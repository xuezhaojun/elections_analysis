1342957849010434048 2020-12-27 06:17:56 +0800 <tdraicer> @viviwizardshark @Diacritic But they chose to feed only on propaganda. Unlike those living in Germany or Italy or Spain under the fascists, alternate sources of info are readily available. They choose to disregard them.

1342561351508623360 2020-12-26 04:02:24 +0800 <tdraicer> @santiagomayer_ Of course if Trump really wanted the $2000 he would have come out for it many months ago. He's just screwing with Mitch. But I'm fine with that.

In any case, I hoped you enjoyed playing as much as I did reading, and feel that you've learned lessens for your next play (assuming you like it well enough to return to).

1341646747261669378 2020-12-23 15:28:05 +0800 <tdraicer> @RepDonBeyer @mlauriat I think you should let Nancy handle this one.
1341646280435576833 2020-12-23 15:26:14 +0800 <tdraicer> @stuartpstevens I don't worry because you need the military, and for some strange reason he doesn't have those suckers and losers.
1341644649769922560 2020-12-23 15:19:45 +0800 <tdraicer> @genej101 There is a good chance now Dems will hold the WH for a generation, which is not the point at which I want to start limiting executive power, especially since the GOP is likely to hold the Senate or House for much of that time.
1341643578142027777 2020-12-23 15:15:30 +0800 <tdraicer> @marcushjohnson Of course they CAN win. I didn't say this gives us those seats, I said it helps us. I stand by that. YMMV.
1341642793219993602 2020-12-23 15:12:23 +0800 <tdraicer> @marcushjohnson GOP civil war is underway-I don't see any way that playing out that doesn't help us.

1341637597802733568 2020-12-23 14:51:44 +0800 <tdraicer> @KylaInTheBurgh Also this has nothing to do with helping anyone. This is just Trump making problems for the GOP for not saving him.
1341637275839545344 2020-12-23 14:50:27 +0800 <tdraicer> @Manny_Funes I think he is really pissed at Mitch.
1341636522689310722 2020-12-23 14:47:28 +0800 <tdraicer> @Kevswatching He wants to make things difficult for Mitch. It's revenge for Mitch recognizing Biden.
1341632397352312833 2020-12-23 14:31:04 +0800 <tdraicer> @liberalgoddess This is just Trump's revenge on Mitch and the GOP for not keeping him in power, but it won't actually happen. It might give us the GA races though and then a lot becomes possible.

1341477831667314689 2020-12-23 04:16:53 +0800 <tdraicer> @Kevswatching That's not in the Covid relief bill. That's in the general purposes bill Covid relief was attached to.

1341274882760466433 2020-12-22 14:50:26 +0800 <tdraicer> Despite GOP obstruction the Dems got $600 PLUS $300 weekly unemployment, tax credits for the poor, money for things like the NYC MTA and more. It's not enough but it is also not nothing. You want more, help us win GA.

1341207188426113032 2020-12-22 10:21:26 +0800 <tdraicer> @AreMond2 My thought it is there is no Congress. There is a Dem House, which passed over 3 trillion in aid in May and a GOP Senate that would have approved literally nothing if not for the GA Senate races.

1341168168895729665 2020-12-22 07:46:23 +0800 <tdraicer> @MollyJongFast I never think that.

Individual terrorists have existed at both extremes, but they never were never allied to one of our two parties before (well-since 1860).

That's how AOC, a first-term member of Congress of no particular importance became a MSM star; she can be counted on to feed Dems in Disarray.

1341152250811576324 2020-12-22 06:43:08 +0800 <tdraicer> There are things in this Covid bill we don't want and many things we want that aren't there, but there is far more than just the $600 everyone is focused on, including 4 billion for the NYC MTA which is badly needed to prevent a transit collapse that would kill the city.

1340934707060600832 2020-12-21 16:18:42 +0800 <tdraicer> @AreMond2 @waltshaub Yes. That we can only disarm by voting for Dems in every election for every office from now on.
1340934419482329088 2020-12-21 16:17:33 +0800 <tdraicer> @campbellitstrue Depends what "this" is. Another few hundred thousand of us will die from Covid, so they won't. The rest of us will live to see a new Biden administration, but how much they can accomplish will depend on GA Senate. GOP will continue to be fascist either way. So a qualified Yes.
1340933649471037440 2020-12-21 16:14:30 +0800 <tdraicer> @ColoradoDavidSu It's the GOP.
1340932382044598278 2020-12-21 16:09:27 +0800 <tdraicer> @lanechanged Nope. Dems passed over 3 trillion in aid back in May. This is all on the GOP.

1340826037983338497 2020-12-21 09:06:53 +0800 <tdraicer> @donnalove0 And? The choice facing Dems wasn't between this and something better, it was between this and nothing at all. If you want to change that, send money to the GA campaigns.
1340825130600173569 2020-12-21 09:03:17 +0800 <tdraicer> @mathers_georgia And there was NEVER going to be. The GOP controls the Senate. Unless we change that, we are constantly going to have to choose been nothing and very little.
1340824306436194307 2020-12-21 09:00:00 +0800 <tdraicer> @mathers_georgia They also got $300 a week for unemployment. It was this or nothing. We weren't outmaneuvered, we simply had a terrible hand. And that will remain true until we control the Senate.

People who encourage them to take that route aren't interested in helping Palestinians, they just want to hurt Israelis.

1340229883910377473 2020-12-19 17:37:59 +0800 <tdraicer> It is true Biden won convincingly.  It is true we held onto the House.  It is true we may yet retake the Senate.  It is also true over 74 million people voted for the absolute worst president in American history, so much so it isn't a contest.   We can never be complacent again.

1339701676018724865 2020-12-18 06:39:04 +0800 <tdraicer> @MollyJongFast The entire GOP is. Some of them are willing to allow the bare minimum for political reasons, but if they thought they could get away with it not a single one would vote for a single door for anyone who actually needs it.
1339700497293467649 2020-12-18 06:34:23 +0800 <tdraicer> So John Roberts is now the target of the magats. Gotta love a Right-wing civil war. May they continue to splinter, and may splinters have splinters.
1339699972627959811 2020-12-18 06:32:18 +0800 <tdraicer> @PalmerReport Trump?

1339661749285478406 2020-12-18 04:00:25 +0800 <tdraicer> Mitch has veto power over any relief deals and twitter turns its ire on...Nancy and Chuck.

1339646974111432706 2020-12-18 03:01:42 +0800 <tdraicer> The differences between the GOP and its voters now and Nazis and their voters then are many, but they are the result of different historical circumstances. Psychologically they are identical.

1339637915199127552 2020-12-18 02:25:42 +0800 <tdraicer> Quite clear the political MSM has (intentionally) learned nothing from the last four years, and apart from not giving it our money, the only thing we can do is use our voices to reject and denounce its bs. ALWAYS push back, and don't feel the need to be polite about it.
1339461515695562752 2020-12-17 14:44:45 +0800 <tdraicer> Magats are terrified of what they think Biden and the Dems will do to them and it is funny because none of those fears are valid.   I mean there are pretty much no limits to the torments I would inflict on them, but I'm not an elected official.

1339420794838020096 2020-12-17 12:02:57 +0800 <tdraicer> @jstmeinmo And the GOP Senators, who put Mitch in that position and keep him there.
1339420230951596038 2020-12-17 12:00:42 +0800 <tdraicer> @LabyrinthWeaver @EldeeMickel GOP Senators. Dems and Magats are not the same.

1339411740363272193 2020-12-17 11:26:58 +0800 <tdraicer> @freedlander @barbarakevans And the MSM sees these as the same.
1339411431465377793 2020-12-17 11:25:44 +0800 <tdraicer> @MollyJongFast The concept is utterly alien to him.
1339410528691769347 2020-12-17 11:22:09 +0800 <tdraicer> @TravisAllen02 No, but it has a long long way down to go before we can even think about resting easy.
1339409684609064961 2020-12-17 11:18:48 +0800 <tdraicer> @McFaul That's why Block is your friend.
1339409257683410957 2020-12-17 11:17:06 +0800 <tdraicer> @zette68 Dems don't think anything of the sort, but as long as Mitch controls the Senate we either accept getting a little or getting nothing. If we win in GA this can all change.
1339408707860520960 2020-12-17 11:14:55 +0800 <tdraicer> @wigwam That's up to you: the Dems are a center-left party and will remain so. We are also in favor of democracy over fascism, which should be a plus, but ultimately you'll have to decide what matters most to you.

1339337650877194240 2020-12-17 06:32:34 +0800 <tdraicer> @Ardwulf Quite a few still hold up imo: La Grande Armee, Arnhem, Seelowe, the Bulge quadrigame, Panzerarmee Afrika (except for the victory conditions, which give Rommel no reason to ever go into Egypt), Sinai among others.

1339333710450208768 2020-12-17 06:16:54 +0800 <tdraicer> @BillPascrell Let's be clear: prosecuting Trump won't stop some future GOP dictator-wannabee from trying, it will just show him some mistakes not to make. Only our remaining on alert can keep the fascists out of power. Trump should be prosecuted because he is a criminal; that's reason enough.

No AG of either party has been nominated in that time (or I think ever).

1338956014331310084 2020-12-16 05:16:05 +0800 <tdraicer> @DemocratsCare @JamesrossrJames They wouldn't care about how it was reported by the MSM because they could count on the MSM covering for them.

The world is becoming more urban at a rate never before seen in history and for various reasons, including environmental this a good thing. I suggest a reading of the book Metropolis by Ben Wilson

1336564548581683200 2020-12-09 14:53:15 +0800 <tdraicer> If you are in GA, please vote for BOTH Dem Senate candidates. It's okay to like one more than another, but we need BOTH to take the Senate away from Moscow Mitch.
1336563883813859328 2020-12-09 14:50:36 +0800 <tdraicer> @david_darmofal Always true for the Democrats.

There will always be a conservative party because there will always be people uncomfortable with change (and they aren't always wrong, just mostly).  We just need it not to be a fascist one.
1336562283506503680 2020-12-09 14:44:15 +0800 <tdraicer> Not that anyone cares but I approve:

1336561262193471492 2020-12-09 14:40:11 +0800 <tdraicer> @LepapillonBlu Those of us who know anything about Nazi Germany do. And the threat will remain as long as the GOP is fascist. So for a generation or so at least.

That our flawed federal system favors the rural minority over the urban majority and they used their power to rig the system even more in their favor are facts we have to deal with without being responsible for.

No-politics is how democracy works.  The problem is that GOP fascism isn't democratic politics.  Looking at you Andrew Yang.

As for the rest, I predicted in 2008 that Obama would cost us control of Congress and would lead the GOP into fascism within 8 years.

1330225875460251652 2020-11-22 03:05:37 +0800 <tdraicer> So anyone else out there who a. supported HRC in 2008 and 2016 b. supported Kamala in 2019 c. when Kamala dropped out switched to Biden? It seems fairly uncommon, but I can't imagine I'm unique.

1330204072549474305 2020-11-22 01:38:59 +0800 <tdraicer> @theDilfy @davematt88 The problem with the economic argument in the US is a. Trump's voters were better off on average than Biden's and HRC's, and b. those that weren't have voted for decades FOR their economic inequality. Economic inequality is a bad thing. Imo it doesn't explain Trump/GOP.

It requires the people support democracy. Over 70 million American voters didn't. There is no legal reform for that. We just have to keep them out of power.

1329578511737217025 2020-11-20 08:13:14 +0800 <tdraicer> Assume the GOP went all in and got GOP state legislatures or the Supreme Court to hand the election to Trump. Does anyone think that Biden, the Dems, or 80 million voters would just go, Oh well? It would mean civil war or the breakup of the Union. And we won the last one.
1329576916421136384 2020-11-20 08:06:53 +0800 <tdraicer> @people4kam It might, once you recognize the DemSocs are NOT part of the Democratic Party.

1329574940857802754 2020-11-20 07:59:02 +0800 <tdraicer> @Claire_Voltaire And obviously attacks on Israel or Israelis do not constitute persuasion.

It would require recognizing that Israel as a Jewish state exists and isn't going away, and trying to change that by persuading enough Israelis to decide otherwise themselves.

1329511780893257729 2020-11-20 03:48:04 +0800 <tdraicer> The biggest threat to our democracy is not that the GOP is now a fascist party. It is that the MSM will continue to pretend that it isn't.
1329502816902258692 2020-11-20 03:12:27 +0800 <tdraicer> @NormOrnstein @Nedfoley The GOP is a fascist party. That's obvious. But democracy is only dead if they win.

1329489184487321602 2020-11-20 02:18:16 +0800 <tdraicer> @HelenFeathers23 There is a simple answer: refuse to be demoralized. We won, and on Jan. 20 Biden/Harris are sworn in. And we might even have control of the Senate by then. (If not, we have a good shot in 2022.)

1329484732112007168 2020-11-20 02:00:35 +0800 <tdraicer> @just_tracytracy Because Trump used it to keep us divided, and for the magats the Fuhrer is always right.

1329283252964749312 2020-11-19 12:39:59 +0800 <tdraicer> @JGreenblattADL @cindyfsolomon I understand your point. But if the Holocaust can never be used as a reference or analogy it becomes irrelevant. While it was a historically uniquely awful event (so far) that doesn't mean it is outside of history-and history is part of politics. Use with care is not "never use."
1329280567540641796 2020-11-19 12:29:18 +0800 <tdraicer> @KimOlsonTx We can't. Ever.
1329280243417411584 2020-11-19 12:28:01 +0800 <tdraicer> @jakki2004 Imo the MSM has been covering for the GOP since Watergate as an apology for unintentionally taking Nixon down. ("Honest, we didn't know he was that guilty.") 150 papers demanded Clinton resign over oral sex; not one has demanded Trump resign over treason.

1329116693310959617 2020-11-19 01:38:08 +0800 <tdraicer> @JewelsJourneys It's probably also irrelevant. After Trump is done pardoning it will be up to the state AGs.

1328568911751680002 2020-11-17 13:21:26 +0800 <tdraicer> @MfromPa Partly. I think mostly we lost because Trump brought out every possible GOP voter. But he wasn't on the ballot in 2018 and he won't be on the ballot in 2022.

But worse than that, I don't even believe your fanatical Trumpism is sincere. You're just another GOP grifter.

1327764336157347840 2020-11-15 08:04:21 +0800 <tdraicer> @marvswife Probably not. Those exit polls are quite unreliable because so many Dems voted early or by mail. A better estimate I've seen is 49% for Biden, 45% for Trump, and 6% third party or no vote for president. Still way too high of course, but not 55%.
1327758772559900672 2020-11-15 07:42:14 +0800 <tdraicer> @annehelen @joshtpm Remind me what % of vote Trump got? This should surprise no one.

The 19th Century was a tough time to be a native power. Only Siam, Ethiopia, Liberia and Japan managed (in Japan's case by becoming a colonial power itself).

You could fit all the actual work he has done into a weekend. And yet his base keeps applauding "all his accomplishments."   Magats-just admit you love the racism.

But I took, and still take, the choice of Kamala as a pledge that for all his talk of coming together Biden won't do that.

1325162605137158144 2020-11-08 03:46:00 +0800 <tdraicer> @GabbieKDrice I don't hold it against Joe or anyone else. But that's just not me.
1325161805455392769 2020-11-08 03:42:49 +0800 <tdraicer> Imo (for whatever that is worth) Joe and Kamala need to spend a lot of time in GA the next two months.
1325161471395782656 2020-11-08 03:41:29 +0800 <tdraicer> @DMiketon No they don't. In their minds the only thing keeping them from their rightful rule are Democratic conspiracies. They are the Left version of magats.
1325161141685743616 2020-11-08 03:40:11 +0800 <tdraicer> @VextiumStray @DMiketon @coldlawgic @kvlter @pleizar @NeutralGreyHue @evannn_n @TheOnion You are why we lost, you morons.
1325160415639302144 2020-11-08 03:37:18 +0800 <tdraicer> To win the Senate we need everyone who voted for Joe in GA to turn out and this time vote Blue for the Senate. It can be done. Let's all help them do it!
1325148115599568897 2020-11-08 02:48:25 +0800 <tdraicer> @tomwatson In four years.
1325146222181617670 2020-11-08 02:40:54 +0800 <tdraicer> @DDCooper6 Nice of you to say. Thanks!
1325143707444793344 2020-11-08 02:30:54 +0800 <tdraicer> @SaraColpitts For the record, that 55% figure is a crock. Exit poll numbers are more or less worthless in an election where GOP voted overwhelmingly on election day, and Dems did not.
1325142289916682241 2020-11-08 02:25:16 +0800 <tdraicer> @TheRickWilson @Steadyruncho123 You helped create this. You owed us. You still do. But with those caveats, thanks.
1325140759838797825 2020-11-08 02:19:11 +0800 <tdraicer> @thekjohnston @Steadyruncho123 Same back.
1325140579697586178 2020-11-08 02:18:28 +0800 <tdraicer> @JebBush @KareemRifai When you could have spoken out you kept silent. Too little, too late.
1325137802871398402 2020-11-08 02:07:26 +0800 <tdraicer> @KareemRifai Well they are stuck in the 1790s so...
1325136867130552320 2020-11-08 02:03:43 +0800 <tdraicer> @Cajsa Same.
1325136185115635713 2020-11-08 02:01:01 +0800 <tdraicer> Before I forget, and in case anyone missed it:  WE WON!  TRUMP LOST!  WE CAN STILL GET THE SENATE!   GA EVERYONE!
1325135482351726592 2020-11-08 01:58:13 +0800 <tdraicer> @m1db @Mystic_Sailor It was only close because of the Electoral College.
1325135205032603648 2020-11-08 01:57:07 +0800 <tdraicer> @Mystic_Sailor Like Trump they thought they could bluff a virus.
1325133422302523392 2020-11-08 01:50:02 +0800 <tdraicer> @DMiketon Because they WANT to identify Dems with the far Left because hurting Dems is their job.
1324938434696404993 2020-11-07 12:55:13 +0800 <tdraicer> @BoobPunchTina2 I only saw the first one. I'm about to watch this weekend the Japanese Blood Trilogy, 3 70's vampire movies with unrelated plots but all directed and written by the same team. I've heard good things about them.
1324937621957718018 2020-11-07 12:51:59 +0800 <tdraicer> @MattMurchison Yes! Too bad that space bypass is going to be built through our planet though.

1324935767790137344 2020-11-07 12:44:37 +0800 <tdraicer> @siskarma Plus Hillary.
1324935605894205441 2020-11-07 12:43:59 +0800 <tdraicer> No way Trump can win this. I mean I suppose the Supreme Court could just give it to him, but that would mean civil war, and I really don't think even the GOP 6 are up for that. So there is also no excuse for news refusing to call this. Well, apart from our MSM being just awful.
1324932969845448704 2020-11-07 12:33:30 +0800 <tdraicer> @JimmyA_Shook1s And that's an under-count.
1324932372232630273 2020-11-07 12:31:08 +0800 <tdraicer> @josepheschmitz @newsmax Actually it shows he got 3 votes total. We can just make shit up too.

1324906476226416640 2020-11-07 10:48:14 +0800 <tdraicer> @JayEdResists @realDonaldTrump All of them. Every last fascist one.
1324906263797436416 2020-11-07 10:47:23 +0800 <tdraicer> @CynthiaFua The MSM never waits until then. Except now. Because they always lean over backwards for the GOP.
1324905958758297602 2020-11-07 10:46:10 +0800 <tdraicer> @GaleTStrong Not MY money.
1324905657812869120 2020-11-07 10:44:59 +0800 <tdraicer> @selfstyledsiren That must include me then, because I certainly remember.   "Oh you bloody bloody man. Let me take your bloody picture for the bloody newspapers."
1324905087332913152 2020-11-07 10:42:43 +0800 <tdraicer> @TerrySmith6973 @CitizenScreen It's complicity.
1324904892176216065 2020-11-07 10:41:56 +0800 <tdraicer> @CynthiaFua @CharlesPPierce @EricBoehlert This isn't about the counting-the states do that, not the MSM. But if the numbers were reversed the MSM would have called it for Trump this morning.
1324904512163885058 2020-11-07 10:40:25 +0800 <tdraicer> @CurtisGoodnight @CharlesPPierce @EricBoehlert It is.
1324902439204642816 2020-11-07 10:32:11 +0800 <tdraicer> @Redistrict @miggiepdx But we can't call the election.
1324902120743727105 2020-11-07 10:30:55 +0800 <tdraicer> @CitizenScreen We get angry, but we continue to watch them, read them, give them our money and defend them from attacks by the GOP. If we want to change the MSM we have to stop acting like they are our allies.
1324901017503330305 2020-11-07 10:26:32 +0800 <tdraicer> @verbalese @Ellis_Crane Well, somewhat over 50% of us do.
1324899245841764352 2020-11-07 10:19:30 +0800 <tdraicer> @JohnLyn83159113 @dontlickchalk @Slapout4 I don't believe that.
1324898999741067264 2020-11-07 10:18:31 +0800 <tdraicer> Republicans on the Supreme Court won't give the election to Trump but have made it clear they are happy to take actions to keep GOP voters nursing their sense the election was stolen. If we take the Senate, even with 50 votes, we really need to break their hold.
1324898164567105536 2020-11-07 10:15:12 +0800 <tdraicer> @mlauriat We do have AZ.
1324874729505890305 2020-11-07 08:42:05 +0800 <tdraicer> @liberalgoddess I'm just angry because the delay can only encourage GOP violence. Biden's victory is baked in, I'm not worried about that.
1324874464975319040 2020-11-07 08:41:02 +0800 <tdraicer> People always say the MSM bows to the GOP out of fear. I don't tend to buy that, but say it is true: then we need to make them fear us too.
1324873797606977539 2020-11-07 08:38:22 +0800 <tdraicer> @Kevswatching Races. We have two to win in GA.
1324873577800359937 2020-11-07 08:37:30 +0800 <tdraicer> @notgonnanomore @realTuckFrumper It was never just Trump. He was merely the point at which the GOP slide toward fascism became undeniable. The GOP is still here. And it is still fascist.
1324873256114020352 2020-11-07 08:36:13 +0800 <tdraicer> As much as we need to keep beating the fascist GOP, we need a whole new MSM. They, after all, played a huge part in giving us this catastrophe. And they've learned nothing.
1324872618009370624 2020-11-07 08:33:41 +0800 <tdraicer> @CharlesBenson4 He's a fascist, a Russian puppet, and a traitor. So why should I care?
1324872278132355072 2020-11-07 08:32:20 +0800 <tdraicer> @dontlickchalk @Slapout4 No-it's because the MSM always bends over backwards for the GOP.
1324871516270497794 2020-11-07 08:29:19 +0800 <tdraicer> @realTuckFrumper Good!
1324871190196985857 2020-11-07 08:28:01 +0800 <tdraicer> @neeratanden @tomwatson It's how the GOP has worked the refs for decades, and at this point it just complicity.
1324870835543404544 2020-11-07 08:26:36 +0800 <tdraicer> @notgonnanomore @realTuckFrumper Well you believe that if you like. I don't. The fight continues.
1324870602193252362 2020-11-07 08:25:41 +0800 <tdraicer> @tomwatson Yes. But we have to keep winning. Next stop: GA Senate.
1324870195865903105 2020-11-07 08:24:04 +0800 <tdraicer> @joshtpm I do! Put me on tv.
1324870059592994816 2020-11-07 08:23:31 +0800 <tdraicer> @notgonnanomore @realTuckFrumper Nope. Trump will be gone. Trumpism remains.
1324869462676426754 2020-11-07 08:21:09 +0800 <tdraicer> @JoeConason @jaketapper @CNN Four years late. We owe them nothing.
1324866915479801857 2020-11-07 08:11:02 +0800 <tdraicer> @GundyGirl @neeratanden And complicity with the GOP. If the numbers were reversed they would've called it for Trump.
1324866539946905608 2020-11-07 08:09:32 +0800 <tdraicer> @jeff_schult A few hours ago.

1324865905113882624 2020-11-07 08:07:01 +0800 <tdraicer> @dennisaoconnor Turns out Trump is a vampire and Buffy stakes him.

1324861553200410624 2020-11-07 07:49:43 +0800 <tdraicer> @HerschelWalker Better idea. Why don't we do the whole 2016 election over and see what happens?
1324861229459005441 2020-11-07 07:48:26 +0800 <tdraicer> @texson6886 You have rules you can e-mail I'd love to read them.

1324860747831185408 2020-11-07 07:46:31 +0800 <tdraicer> @albertksfong1 @RandilynIsIn Still a substantial win. I mean-GA?
1324860480914141189 2020-11-07 07:45:28 +0800 <tdraicer> @feminemi1y He did anyway.
1324859442198941696 2020-11-07 07:41:20 +0800 <tdraicer> @tbonier They are afraid to call it.
1324858805381980160 2020-11-07 07:38:48 +0800 <tdraicer> @texson6886 I had one game done for computers (Battle of Moscow from Shenandoah which was later picked up by Slitherin Games) and most of my games are available on Vassal or TableTop Simulator. Though not coded by me-I'm a Luddite.

1324852504975331340 2020-11-07 07:13:46 +0800 <tdraicer> @JamesrossrJames They ARE Trump.
1324851884679696384 2020-11-07 07:11:18 +0800 <tdraicer> @ChrisCuomo @pjbrand4 As fascists and traitors. But you help put them in power with Her E-mails.
1324851273879924739 2020-11-07 07:08:52 +0800 <tdraicer> @nsedef Maybe. But don't bet on it.
1324851034389422082 2020-11-07 07:07:55 +0800 <tdraicer> @realTuckFrumper Could be.
1324850961794424833 2020-11-07 07:07:38 +0800 <tdraicer> @notgonnanomore @realTuckFrumper Don't get complacent. We won a big battle, but not the war. Who took Trump seriously 5 years ago?
1324850610517217280 2020-11-07 07:06:14 +0800 <tdraicer> @bobclendenin @ElaineToth7 Yes. But they were too lacking in self-control not to tell us the plan, which is how we won. We can't count on that always.
1324850077672886274 2020-11-07 07:04:07 +0800 <tdraicer> @nsedef Oh they well-now that they can focus on a Democratic administration. Is that not what you meant?  :)

1324847902611677188 2020-11-07 06:55:29 +0800 <tdraicer> @BlueSteelDC @LisaTalmadge They would call it for Trump if the numbers were reversed. Always different rules for Dems.

1324843342694416386 2020-11-07 06:37:21 +0800 <tdraicer> @DDCooper6 Yeah, I'd say we won.
1324825942771044358 2020-11-07 05:28:13 +0800 <tdraicer> @TheRickWilson @ps9714 Then why I am laughing?

1324824036254326786 2020-11-07 05:20:38 +0800 <tdraicer> @MattMurph24 @ManMet80 It will end up being a lot higher than that. But Trump didn't do it alone. The GOP is Trump.

1324816243711508486 2020-11-07 04:49:41 +0800 <tdraicer> I mention this merely as a possibility. It is at least possible that electorally significant numbers of Trump voters will be so demoralized by his defeat they essentially drop out of politics. We'll see.
1324797845988401154 2020-11-07 03:36:34 +0800 <tdraicer> For the Senate I suggest we adopt Will Roger's idea:  "Any Senator who says all he knows has got to sit down.  Half of them wouldn't even be able to answer roll-call."

Maybe we live in a deterministic Universe and free will is an illusion, but if not, at some point you have to be held accountable for your adult self. Trump is evil.
1324792612893659136 2020-11-07 03:15:47 +0800 <tdraicer> @kershaw_alex @JohnBrennan Yes. Or Jews. Or Hispanics. Or Asians. (And dubious exit polls aside*, probably not a majority of white women.)  *Dubious because they way over-count people who voted in person on Nov. 3, which tended to be heavily GOP.
1324791803015499776 2020-11-07 03:12:33 +0800 <tdraicer> @joncoopertweets @ManMet80 The GOP had to either change or reject democracy. They have chosen the latter, and must be destroyed. Which will take more than this election-though it's a good start.
1324791333454815232 2020-11-07 03:10:41 +0800 <tdraicer> @MollyJongFast Okay, we can start by doing away with those GOP tax cuts for the rich.

1324789925137580032 2020-11-07 03:05:06 +0800 <tdraicer> Because I don't want to keep giving them the attention they crave but don't deserve, let me sum up about our "progressives" by saying they helped give us Trump in the first place, and now that we've won they want to claim the victory. The hell with that.

1324782657134354433 2020-11-07 02:36:13 +0800 <tdraicer> @RoadsForPaula They won because they ran in very Blue districts, and the seats we lost were in Red districts. But keep holding onto the fantasy that Americans are just dying for you to save them, when the Left has always been a fringe in American politics.

1324773818787864576 2020-11-07 02:01:06 +0800 <tdraicer> @twtrPAD They won't even try.
1324772512635494400 2020-11-07 01:55:54 +0800 <tdraicer> @DDCooper6 Some will. Don't get me wrong, I think we will win GA. But if we very narrowly lose it shouldn't bother us.
1324771277391933441 2020-11-07 01:51:00 +0800 <tdraicer> Still possible I think when the overseas military ballots are counted we lose GA. But even if that happened, to get so close, and have both Senate seats still in play is a victory. (The EVs are nice, but we can do without if it comes to that.)
1324769954953134085 2020-11-07 01:45:44 +0800 <tdraicer> @anneapplebaum Yes, but at some point he is going to be campaigning from prison or exile.

1324769098023215104 2020-11-07 01:42:20 +0800 <tdraicer> If it was up to me (and obviously it isn't) voting for Trump TWICE would be grounds for revoking citizenship.
1324767428908326916 2020-11-07 01:35:42 +0800 <tdraicer> @CitizenScreen @CNN @ABC To show they are "fair." Our MSM will always lean over backwards to the GOP, even as the GOP has revealed itself as fascist. They only turned on Trump (to the extent they have) when it was clear he was losing.

1324765253335453697 2020-11-07 01:27:04 +0800 <tdraicer> @all_the_Mindy Not compared to Trump. For one thing, he actually did read books. He was evil, and towards the end insane, and at some point (probably after France fell in 1940) he actually came to believe his own created myth, but he was not the complete clown Trump is.
1324764245360345088 2020-11-07 01:23:03 +0800 <tdraicer> Always had mixed feelings about Trump. We are lucky he was Stupid Hitler and not Hitler (though if we let down our guard again we might not be so lucky next time). And on the other hand, what does it say about almost half of America that they lack even the standards of Nazis?

1324759116573777921 2020-11-07 01:02:40 +0800 <tdraicer> Woke up to find us leading in PA, GA, AZ, NV.   Good morning!
1324595457121832967 2020-11-06 14:12:21 +0800 <tdraicer> I never thought I'd say this, but Esper should remain SecDef until we are safely past the GOP tries a coup stage.
1324594961271181312 2020-11-06 14:10:23 +0800 <tdraicer> @sqwabb @kcorr54 I think there is a fundamental difference in revenue that comes from actual crime and that which doesn't. Once officials become complicit in criminal activity, even by looking the other way, the criminals may soon be calling the shots.
1324593066544607233 2020-11-06 14:02:51 +0800 <tdraicer> Trump now leading less than 23,000 votes in PA with plenty still out. We win PA and it doesn't matter what happens in GA, NV, or AZ (though we may win all three). Republican coup fantasies aside, we have this.
1324590872558796800 2020-11-06 13:54:08 +0800 <tdraicer> @joshtpm Do they not understand the potential damage delays in settling this are causing or do they understand and not care?
1324589388634951680 2020-11-06 13:48:14 +0800 <tdraicer> I find this a bit too grim (for one thing, it looks like we are winning GA, and there is no sign the Dems will "lurch to the Left") but it is a warning winning the battle is not winning the war.

1324576673132630018 2020-11-06 12:57:42 +0800 <tdraicer> Newt, Lindsey, Ted Cruz and of course Trump himself are calling for the overthrow of democracy.  MSM will undoubtedly forget this as soon as Biden is in the WH (or next week) and go back to treating GOP fascism as normal.

1324428886596354048 2020-11-06 03:10:27 +0800 <tdraicer> @oldhollywood21 It would make a great double feature with Anna and the King.
1324428461465894913 2020-11-06 03:08:46 +0800 <tdraicer> @lanerodrigs1979 Satanic Red.
1324428158255484928 2020-11-06 03:07:34 +0800 <tdraicer> @BlueSteelDC Which was the MSM's intention in promoting her as a major force in the party instead of just one person in Congress. She, like Bernie, is a media creation intended to divide Democrats.
1324427533421580290 2020-11-06 03:05:05 +0800 <tdraicer> @Resist2TheEnd No. But I don't particularly want to unit with Trump's base. Hopefully Biden can peel off the ones who aren't so much evil as deeply stupid.
1324426979240824833 2020-11-06 03:02:53 +0800 <tdraicer> @ColoradoDavidSu Who isn't?
1324426049858535425 2020-11-06 02:59:11 +0800 <tdraicer> @liberalgoddess Not a certainty, but I actually like our odds in GA now better than theirs.
1324412224220192768 2020-11-06 02:04:15 +0800 <tdraicer> @AngrierWHStaff @ChrisKairo Not as disappointing as letting them break in and stop the count which happened in FL in 2000.
1324411709503741952 2020-11-06 02:02:12 +0800 <tdraicer> @Kevswatching To be fair, a lot of them are writing from Russia.
1324411439076003842 2020-11-06 02:01:08 +0800 <tdraicer> @kazweida Actually take that back. GA results mean it isn't a given and we could still win the Senate. All eyes (and efforts) need to turn to GA Senate races as soon as Biden's win is settled.
1324410643420729344 2020-11-06 01:57:58 +0800 <tdraicer> @tify330 Just a note not to take the exit poll percentages too seriously, since they don't really reflect early/mail-in ballots.
1324409730979237888 2020-11-06 01:54:20 +0800 <tdraicer> @GadiNBC Protestors? No, criminals interfering in a federal election. Do TRY and get it right.
1324409232234524673 2020-11-06 01:52:21 +0800 <tdraicer> @littledeekay Heaven IS a lesbian strip club.
1324408725814300672 2020-11-06 01:50:21 +0800 <tdraicer> @koslen_bambi I think Shakespeare understood his voters: "I am stepped in so far in blood that returning were as tedious as going o'er."
1324408374054785026 2020-11-06 01:48:57 +0800 <tdraicer> @MattMurchison Absolutely!
1324408190310797313 2020-11-06 01:48:13 +0800 <tdraicer> @david_darmofal But really bad takes by people who should know better is Twitter's business model.
1324406261308399616 2020-11-06 01:40:33 +0800 <tdraicer> @people4kam We now need a HUGE effort in GA.
1324406007024549889 2020-11-06 01:39:33 +0800 <tdraicer> @Kevswatching And still he failed.
1324405760793726976 2020-11-06 01:38:34 +0800 <tdraicer> @mlauriat You're invited. (You particularly, not everyone reading this tweet. I'm not putting up 1100 people.)
1324405367334461447 2020-11-06 01:37:00 +0800 <tdraicer> @JRubinBlogger The bedwetters phrase is uncalled for-we all have 2016 PTSD.
1324405124870086656 2020-11-06 01:36:02 +0800 <tdraicer> @H_MitchellPhoto He never lost his base. Add in the so-called libertarians and population growth...
1324404185635368961 2020-11-06 01:32:18 +0800 <tdraicer> @ColoradoDavidSu Better.
1324404114239983616 2020-11-06 01:32:01 +0800 <tdraicer> @mlauriat Still thinking of retiring to Porto in Portugal but that's for reasons of cost, and one can vote from abroad.
1324403407428476932 2020-11-06 01:29:13 +0800 <tdraicer> @david_darmofal @JoeBiden The Magats may refuse to cooperate, but the answer to that is to refuse to treat them.
1324403026069753857 2020-11-06 01:27:42 +0800 <tdraicer> @kazweida It's a given. But we can use that against them in 2022.
1324402740324421634 2020-11-06 01:26:34 +0800 <tdraicer> @Hey_joeb Finally, a reason to live in WV.
1324402202992136195 2020-11-06 01:24:26 +0800 <tdraicer> @EricBoehlert Actually they could and should mention each time. They just won't.
1324402034821468161 2020-11-06 01:23:45 +0800 <tdraicer> @people4kam I doubt that. But he doesn't need to win by that much. And he will win it.
1324401219843096576 2020-11-06 01:20:31 +0800 <tdraicer> @EricBoehlert The ghost of Roy Cohen.
1324400827059052545 2020-11-06 01:18:58 +0800 <tdraicer> @holdavision They mostly stood down immediately, but they were in a flattened and occupied country, concerned with bare survival. Our Trumpers aren't going anywhere soon. The one thing that might have an effect is Trump fleeing abroad (and for that reason I hope he does).
1324399645544599562 2020-11-06 01:14:16 +0800 <tdraicer> @HawaiiDelilah @fewhrsafterthis @jomalleydillon Only because it is.
1324398365912797191 2020-11-06 01:09:11 +0800 <tdraicer> So Trump is calling for his voters to rise up and violently halt the counts. And this should surprise no one. He doesn't care about anyone's fate but his own, and he would destroy the world to save himself.
1324397147656245249 2020-11-06 01:04:20 +0800 <tdraicer> @PhoenixWomanMN @OwenJones84 @morgan7991 Yes. But the Left is like the Right in that they can never fail, only be failed.
1324396715189932038 2020-11-06 01:02:37 +0800 <tdraicer> The Left is still claiming Bernie would have won when Bernie would have been slaughtered, but they are as much cultists (to Bernie-or Marx) as the Trump voters.
1324396259940118536 2020-11-06 01:00:49 +0800 <tdraicer> @OwenJones84 Owen Jones can fuck off.

1324393318088925184 2020-11-06 00:49:07 +0800 <tdraicer> @sarahcpr I know, right?
1324393137524060162 2020-11-06 00:48:24 +0800 <tdraicer> @mayatcontreras PA, NC, and WI are our best bets.
1324392490963783680 2020-11-06 00:45:50 +0800 <tdraicer> @doctor_eon It's as close as it is because Trump offered his fans something no other president ever has: permission to be their worst selves. And you can't walk away from that. Add in the libertarians who are really fascists to start with and simple population growth. Bernie did affect FL.
1324390183517802497 2020-11-06 00:36:40 +0800 <tdraicer> Well I slept 10 hours and feel almost alive again. Much as we all suffered through Tuesday night, the thought that Trump believed he was going to win only to now have to face reality and what that most cost him makes it seem in retrospect a small price to pay.
1324223280807661568 2020-11-05 13:33:27 +0800 <tdraicer> @kaitlancollins @DWUhlfelderLaw Okay, well I'm not staying up til then. Good night everyone! And by everyone, I mean those who voted straight Democratic.

1324219171740274689 2020-11-05 13:17:08 +0800 <tdraicer> Cure a ballot is such an odd choice of term. It turns a ballot into either a meat or a disease.

1324217330520514561 2020-11-05 13:09:49 +0800 <tdraicer> @freedomrideblog A Green. So a fantasist who sees politics not as a means of change but as a means of asserting a completely unearned sense of ethical superiority. Also-Bernie couldn't even win Dems, who are very more liberal than the nation as a whole.
1324216775781875713 2020-11-05 13:07:36 +0800 <tdraicer> @magi_jay Let yourself go.
1324216146246205441 2020-11-05 13:05:06 +0800 <tdraicer> @CatSoluna I so want her to be number 47.
1324213536084680705 2020-11-05 12:54:44 +0800 <tdraicer> @vlmorrisk I hate suspense.
1324213417952055296 2020-11-05 12:54:16 +0800 <tdraicer> @MfromPa The Trump era is clearly not one of them.
1324213284774514689 2020-11-05 12:53:44 +0800 <tdraicer> @MfromPa Depends what you mean. America was born in a world of kings/ emperors where simply the idea of voting was revolutionary. We were founded on Enlightenment ideals as no other nation was. We've never lived up to them, but they inspired people around the world. We've had our moments.
1324212098549895168 2020-11-05 12:49:01 +0800 <tdraicer> So anyone have the latest numbers on GA?
1324210749057699843 2020-11-05 12:43:39 +0800 <tdraicer> @NWPinPDX We have this.
1324210414910099458 2020-11-05 12:42:20 +0800 <tdraicer> @ImchllinKim @crzyfkinworld Same. I had just turned 18 in August. I didn't vote for another winning candidate for 16 years.
1324209991549681664 2020-11-05 12:40:39 +0800 <tdraicer> @people4kam A win is a win.
1324206604200386561 2020-11-05 12:27:11 +0800 <tdraicer> @Hey_joeb He's planning for 2024. No, really.
1324206178080116737 2020-11-05 12:25:30 +0800 <tdraicer> @ngholiG @anneapplebaum Racism, sexism, religious bigotry, unrestrained greed and Christian Fascism. I've solved the puzzle for you. My only solution is to keep them out of power. Or divorce. If you have an alternative, let me know.
1324204527378173952 2020-11-05 12:18:56 +0800 <tdraicer> @HillckHill @RevDrBarber @ReneeLomas Another reason to make it happen.
1324204027261976576 2020-11-05 12:16:57 +0800 <tdraicer> @MfromPa @ProjectLincoln I would assume so, but it's impossible to know.
1324196789893898244 2020-11-05 11:48:11 +0800 <tdraicer> @clwhite58 So same as last 4 years.
1324192849995456514 2020-11-05 11:32:32 +0800 <tdraicer> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Better stop the vote count then. (How do you live with yourself? Oh right-I don't care.)
1324192448529211392 2020-11-05 11:30:56 +0800 <tdraicer> @neeratanden It's hard without taking the Senate. Plus, it's not my nature. But I'll try.
1324192089844916227 2020-11-05 11:29:31 +0800 <tdraicer> @RepBenninghoff Another GOP liar. Well, that's a requirement for your party. We won. Suck on that.
1324190312886132737 2020-11-05 11:22:27 +0800 <tdraicer> @EricBoehlert And there are people who look at that and don't burst out laughing.
1324189811004133378 2020-11-05 11:20:27 +0800 <tdraicer> @RevDrBarber @ReneeLomas That's why the GOP won't let it go.
1324188140937031681 2020-11-05 11:13:49 +0800 <tdraicer> @Resist2TheEnd PA yes, GA no.
1324188022322171905 2020-11-05 11:13:21 +0800 <tdraicer> I've been emotionally all over the map for the last 36 hours and I frankly don't know where I've ended up other than tired. I suspect I'm not alone.
1324167539014991874 2020-11-05 09:51:57 +0800 <tdraicer> If Biden does lose GA it will be because of 60,000 "progressive" morons.
1324163267149910017 2020-11-05 09:34:59 +0800 <tdraicer> @KoboldCurryChef @skars I'm 62. I think things have been pretty stable for about 30 years, the only big change being the GOP going from far Right to outright fascist. Dems keep getting the most votes but our Constitutional system keeps allowing GOP to punch way above its weight. YMMV
1324162449692598273 2020-11-05 09:31:44 +0800 <tdraicer> @richsignorelli @liberalgoddess @JamesCarville Really? That would be nice.
1324162026952904711 2020-11-05 09:30:03 +0800 <tdraicer> @kaitlancollins @ps9714 LOL!
1324161777282748428 2020-11-05 09:29:04 +0800 <tdraicer> @retraCtheJD She is a life-long Republican, hardly a liberal. But don't let that stop you attacking your favorite target.
1324161495672987651 2020-11-05 09:27:56 +0800 <tdraicer> @danielsgoldman @holdavision And it failed.

1324160474431279104 2020-11-05 09:23:53 +0800 <tdraicer> @TIME Horseshit. But not unexpected. This what the MSM does, and why none of us should accept your narratives ever again.
1324159872133455875 2020-11-05 09:21:29 +0800 <tdraicer> @AkeemCrain @IrisDallen @HillaryClinton Exactly!
1324159052113477632 2020-11-05 09:18:14 +0800 <tdraicer> @puertoricojoe @KoboldCurryChef As long as they vote blue while they act surprised.
1324155733789822982 2020-11-05 09:05:03 +0800 <tdraicer> @sparky7u @Yahoo Yeah, that's what everyone calls it.
1324155430944342018 2020-11-05 09:03:51 +0800 <tdraicer> @KoboldCurryChef But I want it sped up and aimed directly at TX's EVs. :)
1324155208633622529 2020-11-05 09:02:58 +0800 <tdraicer> @Sooriclover Possible. If we turn out.
1324154530817343489 2020-11-05 09:00:16 +0800 <tdraicer> @Socaldiced @Angel2daMax @BetoORourke @staceyabrams @semperdiced Works for me.
1324154153187397635 2020-11-05 08:58:46 +0800 <tdraicer> We could fix everything if a million CA liberals would move to Texas.
1324153377610149888 2020-11-05 08:55:41 +0800 <tdraicer> @BadJewishBoy Some will. Anyway, Biden will make that decision, and then if she is asked, she will make hers. I agree it would be great if we could pull it off.
1324153061393260544 2020-11-05 08:54:26 +0800 <tdraicer> To be honest, I'd rather we win the Senate in GA, which we need, then the EVs, which we don't. But of course anything we can get is good.
1324152679241797634 2020-11-05 08:52:54 +0800 <tdraicer> @BlueElection @independant1492 Bullock (for example) not a progressive. Red States are mostly (surprise!) Red.
1324152467421089793 2020-11-05 08:52:04 +0800 <tdraicer> @independant1492 Well that isn't quite settled yet, though the odds are against us.

1324151846039146499 2020-11-05 08:49:36 +0800 <tdraicer> @genej101 I hope so, though at 62 I expect to be dead before things get catastrophic and I console myself with that.
1324151547358490624 2020-11-05 08:48:25 +0800 <tdraicer> @BadJewishBoy Depends on the job, and I can't see Biden giving her a major one. Also her fellow Republicans would never forgive her. But we'll see.
1324150835169943552 2020-11-05 08:45:35 +0800 <tdraicer> @notgonnanomore Could be.
1324150479362904065 2020-11-05 08:44:10 +0800 <tdraicer> @StevenBeschloss @mathers_georgia Trump never lost his base, and the libertarians decided to show their fascist selves (plus there are more voters than four years ago). I admit I was stunned for a bit because I fell for the optimistic polling, but really, this shouldn't be a surprise. Still more of us.
1324149598840066049 2020-11-05 08:40:40 +0800 <tdraicer> @ChristaylJ Not going anywhere.
1324148974899634178 2020-11-05 08:38:11 +0800 <tdraicer> @kazweida Better chance in GA, where there are still over 150,000 ballots that should be overwhelmingly Democratic to count.
1324148391903928320 2020-11-05 08:35:52 +0800 <tdraicer> @MattMurph24 Possible but not likely. But there is still 2022.
1324148005520449536 2020-11-05 08:34:20 +0800 <tdraicer> @jvharris_1965 Not much, but some. Still almost 200,000 votes outstanding GA. But there is always 2022.
1324147514539474947 2020-11-05 08:32:23 +0800 <tdraicer> @BadJewishBoy Why would she accept?
1324147348163956736 2020-11-05 08:31:43 +0800 <tdraicer> @MattMurchison They already believe that.

1324145618126839811 2020-11-05 08:24:51 +0800 <tdraicer> @EricBoehlert That's better than a majority.
1324144930982449154 2020-11-05 08:22:07 +0800 <tdraicer> @ReneeLomas Thanks!
1324141043600773122 2020-11-05 08:06:40 +0800 <tdraicer> @brianrayguitar Not as much Prisoner Trump.
1324140733037744129 2020-11-05 08:05:26 +0800 <tdraicer> @liberalgoddess We have it.
1324139534095962113 2020-11-05 08:00:40 +0800 <tdraicer> @Baligubadle1 Any of those will do.
1324139186006462471 2020-11-05 07:59:17 +0800 <tdraicer> Just read there are 163,000 ballots still to be counted in GA, mostly from Dem sources. We actually could still win there.
1324137968584527873 2020-11-05 07:54:27 +0800 <tdraicer> @glen_55 Oh a lot more than 3.6. The Bronx has more people than WY.
1324136894704345088 2020-11-05 07:50:11 +0800 <tdraicer> @LynzforCongress Unless they're a Republican. Then discourage them.
1324136177818050562 2020-11-05 07:47:20 +0800 <tdraicer> @MattMurchison Well that goes with the VP job.
1324128188331687949 2020-11-05 07:15:35 +0800 <tdraicer> @realDonaldTrump I hereby claim you're a loser.
1324126859173515265 2020-11-05 07:10:18 +0800 <tdraicer> @CatSoluna Our Supreme Court stepped in to prevent that.
1324126368397991936 2020-11-05 07:08:21 +0800 <tdraicer> @brownandbella @Rich705 Or in my case, I just allowed my hopes-based on the polls-to run away with me. I did it in 2016 too, so clearly I'm a slow learner.
1324126015501799425 2020-11-05 07:06:57 +0800 <tdraicer> Tbh, if we didn't have Climate Change I'd be fairly optimistic in the long run. But we do. So I'm not.
1324125613674897408 2020-11-05 07:05:22 +0800 <tdraicer> @dynamicsymmetry @ShadWonderguy True. The problem is with Climate Change the clock is not only ticking, but every delay makes it harder to address. Lucky for me, I'm 62, so I should be dead before things get completely out of control. For those younger, not so much.
1324124789460619264 2020-11-05 07:02:05 +0800 <tdraicer> @MollyJongFast @funkygy123 Nixon. 1960 and 1962. Different jobs though.
1324124399197396992 2020-11-05 07:00:32 +0800 <tdraicer> Kanye West has conceded. Wow, we really dodged a bullet there!
1324124069420273664 2020-11-05 06:59:13 +0800 <tdraicer> A news outlet wrote this sentence: "If Biden wins either of those four, he will have reached the critical 270 threshold."  So no one teaches English now?
1324121330019667968 2020-11-05 06:48:20 +0800 <tdraicer> @jamese1045 @Britpoptarts He almost is.
1324119409779187719 2020-11-05 06:40:42 +0800 <tdraicer> @anneapplebaum Why? Lots of nations have broken up, including the USSR. I think we need to seriously think about a divorce. But Blue America has to get custody of all the nukes.
1324118797041704963 2020-11-05 06:38:16 +0800 <tdraicer> @liberalgoddess I don't know that that is true. But I also certainly know it could be.
1324118532431499266 2020-11-05 06:37:13 +0800 <tdraicer> @Kevswatching They can't. The base still loves him. Unless that changes, they won't either.
1324118288125857793 2020-11-05 06:36:15 +0800 <tdraicer> @Out5p0ken too
1324116250914660354 2020-11-05 06:28:09 +0800 <tdraicer> @Out5p0ken Gore conceded to W. Then took it back. She can to.
1324116032764760068 2020-11-05 06:27:17 +0800 <tdraicer> The thing about Trump voters is they always look exactly like you'd expect them to.
1324115532010979337 2020-11-05 06:25:18 +0800 <tdraicer> @Brown1971Jo @nowthisnews Then I'm 2/3rds thrilled.
1324114474647900161 2020-11-05 06:21:06 +0800 <tdraicer> @koslen_bambi Same.
1324114318045171712 2020-11-05 06:20:28 +0800 <tdraicer> @JoeBiden But they are, unfortunately.
1324113196895133700 2020-11-05 06:16:01 +0800 <tdraicer> @nowthisnews @Brown1971Jo That's good but are they all Democrats?
1324112349305937925 2020-11-05 06:12:39 +0800 <tdraicer> @KevinMcNamee9 @AriBerman @kurteichenwald No-it really isn't.
1324112112462037000 2020-11-05 06:11:43 +0800 <tdraicer> @AriBerman @EldeeMickel Yes. And we can't fix it without going outside the system. Tis a puzzlement.
1324111673284845569 2020-11-05 06:09:58 +0800 <tdraicer> @davidplouffe @MakemydayLisa Well sure. How else is gonna win?
1324111059280633858 2020-11-05 06:07:31 +0800 <tdraicer> @EricBoehlert @BadJewishBoy I call them both. And when you dig into the numbers in NV that seems pretty safe. Which would be enough even without PA.
1324110793219231744 2020-11-05 06:06:28 +0800 <tdraicer> One of the things I don't like about twitter is when someone wrongly interprets what you wrote, and you post a clarification, and people keep liking the original tweet that misunderstood you. Oh well, I'll survive.
1324109661788901377 2020-11-05 06:01:58 +0800 <tdraicer> @KildayMorgan @jkarsh And looking at the data that seems almost certain.
1324109346658242566 2020-11-05 06:00:43 +0800 <tdraicer> @Honeybeeontime They don't need those operatives. The MSM bows to the GOP on its own. How we got here.
1324108427958882306 2020-11-05 05:57:04 +0800 <tdraicer> @LunaLuvgood2020 Everyone but the GOP is against it. But unfortunately we have a system where that's enough to keep it in place.
1324107666923409408 2020-11-05 05:54:03 +0800 <tdraicer> @dfsparks Ah, I thought we were talking about as presidents not as campaigners. My mistake.
1324106925987057664 2020-11-05 05:51:06 +0800 <tdraicer> @ThomboyD @KurtNiceHHL Not that the GOP Senate will care.
1324106765802373123 2020-11-05 05:50:28 +0800 <tdraicer> @AngrierWHStaff @CathyJoeGPT Too late. MI is Biden's.
1324106446682886145 2020-11-05 05:49:12 +0800 <tdraicer> @dfsparks I didn't say she was the greatest. (My GOAT is FDR.) Of presidents in my adult lifetime (Carter on) I rate Bill Clinton ahead of Obama. YMMV (and clearly does).
1324105558144782337 2020-11-05 05:45:40 +0800 <tdraicer> @marsha_vivinate NV looks safe (once you dig into the data) so that should be the ballgame. But I still want PA.
1324105312606015491 2020-11-05 05:44:41 +0800 <tdraicer> @JoyfullySunTzu @Sooriclover I'm not betting on that. I mean if it happens, great.
1324105080753315842 2020-11-05 05:43:46 +0800 <tdraicer> @dfsparks I supported HRC in 2008 and never changed my mind on that, so we'll agree to disagree.
1324104371341242371 2020-11-05 05:40:57 +0800 <tdraicer> @AntisemitismCow Also, WTF?
1324102378963034114 2020-11-05 05:33:02 +0800 <tdraicer> David Frum is worse than useless when it comes to talking about Democrats, race, or immigration, but he often has intelligent things to see about the GOP. But he is wrong that even a blowout Dem win would have ended Trumpism. It is too deeply embedded now in the GOP for that.
1324100464040910848 2020-11-05 05:25:25 +0800 <tdraicer> Looking at the details of where there are outstanding votes, Nevada looks pretty safe for Biden despite the current narrow lead. In which case PA simply becomes a bonus.
1324080212041256962 2020-11-05 04:04:57 +0800 <tdraicer> @koslen_bambi Yes-but ultimately unless a substantial part of GOP voters come to their senses, our system can't function in the long run. Czechoslovakia broke up. Yugoslavia broke up. The USSR broke up. I really think it is time we start considering divorce.
1324078389490233344 2020-11-05 03:57:42 +0800 <tdraicer> I don't know if it is doable, but I really want Trump to fall below Obama's 2008 vote total now that Biden has the highest vote total on record.
1324077941823840256 2020-11-05 03:55:56 +0800 <tdraicer> I was wrong-if we hold Nev. we don't need PA. But I'll feel better with it.
1324075875936149504 2020-11-05 03:47:43 +0800 <tdraicer> It likes look 57,000 nihilist Greens could well end up costing us GA. But note where most 2016 Libertarian votes went to Trump, most 2016 Green voters grew up. But not, alas, all of them.
1324072660138106880 2020-11-05 03:34:56 +0800 <tdraicer> @Claire_Voltaire Still lots a Biden administration can do, but yeah, the big things are out of reach.
1324072269497438209 2020-11-05 03:33:23 +0800 <tdraicer> @EricBoehlert Can't take this seriously given the amount of Dem earl and mail-in voting.
1324069390074171392 2020-11-05 03:21:57 +0800 <tdraicer> @davidfrum @ps9714 @TheAtlantic Until 2023 at least.
1324068919615885312 2020-11-05 03:20:05 +0800 <tdraicer> @rhorseranch_joy @Snapandbud He was probably the best of my adult lifetime, but Hillary would have been much better.
1324067931995734017 2020-11-05 03:16:09 +0800 <tdraicer> @TrinityMustache The exit polls can't be relied on given the size of Biden's early and mail-in voting (and the Times analysis is particularly dubious) so I suspect a majority of white women voted for Biden. But only just.
1324025639121440768 2020-11-05 00:28:06 +0800 <tdraicer> Don't know if this correct, but what the hell:
1324024454616387584 2020-11-05 00:23:23 +0800 <tdraicer> @EmptyPint I'll give you a lunch break.
1324023802641211394 2020-11-05 00:20:48 +0800 <tdraicer> @joshtpm Sorry-"you don't know" and "appears to be" are not sufficient reason to post this.
1324021625088544771 2020-11-05 00:12:09 +0800 <tdraicer> @politicoalex @assinthevalley Did you tell hem to go fuck themselves?
1324020337806315521 2020-11-05 00:07:02 +0800 <tdraicer> Start thinking about this NOW:   WE NEED TO WIN THE SENATE IN 2022!
1324019918107533312 2020-11-05 00:05:22 +0800 <tdraicer> @MattWalshBlog Still a complete nut I see, projecting your own fascism onto others. Oh well, back to blocking you.
1324018626714849283 2020-11-05 00:00:14 +0800 <tdraicer> @DumondVince @Slapout4 For now. There is still a GOP dagger poised at our heart, but better that then it having it plunged in.
1324018092872241152 2020-11-04 23:58:07 +0800 <tdraicer> @realDonaldTrump Give it up-you've lost. Nothing can save you now.
1324017843541807104 2020-11-04 23:57:07 +0800 <tdraicer> @BGBrainKatie Only most of the planet.
1324013834114338816 2020-11-04 23:41:11 +0800 <tdraicer> @TheUSASingers @IMMABOS52901152 Hardly.
1324013411215310849 2020-11-04 23:39:30 +0800 <tdraicer> @ChadHGriffin @hburg4kamala @JoeBiden But no Senate. Well, at least until the next election.
1324013050261884934 2020-11-04 23:38:04 +0800 <tdraicer> @coldlawgic @BadJewishBoy No-the MSM has done that, constantly putting a completely unrepresentative group forward as the face of the party.  With intention-because the MSM is pro-GOP, despite all the rubbish about "liberal media."
1324012018307911681 2020-11-04 23:33:58 +0800 <tdraicer> @NightlyPolitics @mathers_georgia It was this close because it turns out there are more garbage Americans than we realized. We have to go forward with that in mind. (Personally, I favor a divorce-as long as we get custody of the nukes.)
1324011388042444800 2020-11-04 23:31:28 +0800 <tdraicer> @ida_skibenes @upstate_dog Trump is likely to come in as second highest. Still, it seems clear he is leaving Jan. 20.
1324010944175972353 2020-11-04 23:29:42 +0800 <tdraicer> @Hobie_SHRED @JesusNarrowWay It isn't. Neither is the Electoral College. They are the result of compromises made to get 13 colonies to agree to a Constitution (and not all did even so). But we are stuck with them because the GOP knows it can't win without them.
1324010376636338177 2020-11-04 23:27:27 +0800 <tdraicer> @hexagon_guy @eliistender10 Yes.
1324010258390487041 2020-11-04 23:26:59 +0800 <tdraicer> @eliistender10 LOL!
1324010028462952448 2020-11-04 23:26:04 +0800 <tdraicer> @emigre80 @all_the_Mindy Yup.
1324009882530521089 2020-11-04 23:25:29 +0800 <tdraicer> @djrothkopf Bullshit. It just proves the depths of racism and sexism and religious bigotry in this country.
1324009086166409218 2020-11-04 23:22:19 +0800 <tdraicer> @BastaGal @DeborahGiacole2 What a not surprise.
1324008553460441088 2020-11-04 23:20:12 +0800 <tdraicer> @Bonnevilleshop They are bigger margins than he won by. He's out.
1324007808828870656 2020-11-04 23:17:15 +0800 <tdraicer> @StompTheGOP @all_the_Mindy It is. Otoh, they are not quite a majority. And there is no reason to think they will ever be.
1324007410089021441 2020-11-04 23:15:40 +0800 <tdraicer> @Bonnevilleshop I understand. It's bad. Still, Trump is out on Jan 20, and while that's not enough, it's not nothing.
1324006540416847872 2020-11-04 23:12:12 +0800 <tdraicer> @chicagostyle @all_the_Mindy It's not enough for me to feel joy, or even hope, but I do feel a sense of revenge, so that's something.
1324006074647760898 2020-11-04 23:10:21 +0800 <tdraicer> @TrinityMustache I've always thought we had no business letting FDR go.
1324005790420766724 2020-11-04 23:09:13 +0800 <tdraicer> If (as seems likely) PA is no longer relevant to the outcome, will SC stay out of it, or will they act to put a marker down for the GOP in 2022 and 2024?
1324004089424977920 2020-11-04 23:02:28 +0800 <tdraicer> @JRubinBlogger We tried to tell you for a very long time that your base was not voting for the things you said you wanted but for racism and Christian fascism, but until Trump you wouldn't listen.
1324001961591668736 2020-11-04 22:54:01 +0800 <tdraicer> @GabbieKDrice @albyselkie Happy Birthday!
1324000499985764353 2020-11-04 22:48:12 +0800 <tdraicer> @ShelKel2 @Bonnevilleshop In my case ex-family. Blood is not stronger than fascism.
1324000192404824067 2020-11-04 22:46:59 +0800 <tdraicer> AOC is smart and has talent, but ultimately she is just another left-wing grifter, who the MSM has built up because they can count on her for Dems in Disarray.
1323999640677736448 2020-11-04 22:44:47 +0800 <tdraicer> @Bonnevilleshop Not quite 50%.   But it feels like time for a divorce (but we have to get custody of all the nukes).
1323998738310942720 2020-11-04 22:41:12 +0800 <tdraicer> @mathers_georgia No chance now. But still a chance in 2022.
1323997310062338049 2020-11-04 22:35:32 +0800 <tdraicer> The only positive thing I can say about this election (apart from Trump leaving) is that the GOP has won the popular vote only once since 1988, and that 1 time with an incumbent.
1323996538910216194 2020-11-04 22:32:28 +0800 <tdraicer> @anneapplebaum Maybe. But the GOP wins in the Senate are harder to explain away. (And yes, Dems picked up 2 seats, but lost 1.)
1323994997063065600 2020-11-04 22:26:20 +0800 <tdraicer> @SteveSchmidtSES @WillsonSherrie @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden True. But with a GOP Senate and Trump actually increasing his votes. The Right-wing you helped build remains a dagger pointed at the heart of our democracy.
1323994468874395649 2020-11-04 22:24:14 +0800 <tdraicer> @bobbywesson @bbtucker That almost half of America is deplorable.

1323983290555129857 2020-11-04 21:39:49 +0800 <tdraicer> end the fascists, but as the joke goes, Hitler ruined genocide for everyone.)
1323983288227291138 2020-11-04 21:39:48 +0800 <tdraicer> There is no United States. There is a democratic America and a fascist America, and they are almost evenly divided (with democratic America having a small edge that the Constitution renders tenuous at best). Biden should win, but I still support ending this Union. (I'd prefer to
1323980888435249153 2020-11-04 21:30:16 +0800 <tdraicer> @Manny_Funes @JoeBiden We probably will. But we lot the Senate, and seats in the House, and Trump got MORE votes than four years ago.
1323980023066447874 2020-11-04 21:26:50 +0800 <tdraicer> @DKC711 @cindyfsolomon @JYSexton Funny line-and utterly false.
1323979790177755141 2020-11-04 21:25:54 +0800 <tdraicer> @BellaRisttaa @DennisCardiff I suspect almost half of Americans are garbage.
1323979518785265665 2020-11-04 21:24:50 +0800 <tdraicer> Looks like almost all the libertarians revealed their true fascist colors by going for Trump.
1323974192082071553 2020-11-04 21:03:40 +0800 <tdraicer> At lest we can bury that myth that Hillary was a uniquely bad candidate. It is simply that almost half this country is fucked up.
1323973372779368448 2020-11-04 21:00:24 +0800 <tdraicer> @bpmehlman @joshtpm @ElectProject Highest fascist turnout since 1945.
1323971208094822403 2020-11-04 20:51:48 +0800 <tdraicer> Seems Biden will win by the narrowest margin and without the Senate. It is something, though frankly not enough. My bet is still on the end of civilization but at 62 maybe I'll be able to die a natural death before that happens. For those of you who are younger-my condolences.
1323916263681384448 2020-11-04 17:13:29 +0800 <tdraicer> may be well be ended by Donald Trump is is quite a punchline for our species.
1323916262121050118 2020-11-04 17:13:28 +0800 <tdraicer> Biden, Dems, all of us must not accept a Supreme Court decision that gives the election to Trump. Accept it and all elections will be decided that way and our democracy is over. If it means civil war or the breakup of the US that is preferable. Also-that 10,000 of civilization

1323851869861675010 2020-11-04 12:57:36 +0800 <tdraicer> NC-looks like we have the (badly needed) Senate seat.  Yet Biden could lose the state. Who the hell votes for a Dem Senator AND Trump? Talk about schizophrenia.
1323849918432317443 2020-11-04 12:49:51 +0800 <tdraicer> At least Biden is finally ahead in the national vote totals, so I don't have to accept more American support Stupid Hitler.

1323842298107568128 2020-11-04 12:19:34 +0800 <tdraicer> @trom771 I didn't expect it. Maybe I should have but I didn't. And right now I'm broken. I hope that changes.

I'm 62-if Trump wins, my choices are find somewhere abroad to wait out my end or the world's end, whichever is first. Or fight. And I don't mean protest.

1323829190492327936 2020-11-04 11:27:29 +0800 <tdraicer> I know it has been called for Biden, but looking at the numbers, could we lose VA? If we do, that's the ballgame.

1323292151237746688 2020-11-02 23:53:29 +0800 <tdraicer> The most likely scenario is a reverse of the EV numbers of 2016. The second most likely is a Biden blowout with EVs in the high 300s or even above 400. Next most likely is Biden just winning marginally with less than 300 EVs. There is no scenario where Trump wins except by theft.

1322655454883909633 2020-11-01 05:43:28 +0800 <tdraicer> Let me repeat this: We need to fire A LOT of cops.
1322655157881085953 2020-11-01 05:42:18 +0800 <tdraicer> @PragmaticObot But secretly wants to be Himmler.
1322654791303077893 2020-11-01 05:40:50 +0800 <tdraicer> @narceducator @mathers_georgia This is great. Every time he does this he decreases the chances the SC will act (or Dems will accept it if they do).
1322653677727948800 2020-11-01 05:36:25 +0800 <tdraicer> @soledadobrien MSM trying to figure out how they can Both Sides this.
1322653356372959233 2020-11-01 05:35:08 +0800 <tdraicer> @4AnimalLife And civilization. The world barely survived a fascist Germany. It won't survive a fascist USA.
1322652896484347906 2020-11-01 05:33:18 +0800 <tdraicer> @JamesrossrJames I'm supposed to feel sorry for them because they are ignorant. But I can't because they are WILLFULLY ignorant. Also, non-college degree doesn't equal working class. A lot of these people are doing okay economically.
1322651414376652801 2020-11-01 05:27:25 +0800 <tdraicer> @JamesBazan Difference is this time they know the WH is on their side.
1322651056829026312 2020-11-01 05:26:00 +0800 <tdraicer> @PragmaticObot Better not be. It's them or civilization.

1322649405321859073 2020-11-01 05:19:26 +0800 <tdraicer> @Cajsa I assume the windows are closed: as I found out to my misfortune once, screens don't keep out fleas.
1322648062028926976 2020-11-01 05:14:06 +0800 <tdraicer> @BillKristol Most people have never supported GOP policies. When they won  they won on prejudices and attitudes not because voters bought supply side economics or trickle down.
1322646332239237127 2020-11-01 05:07:13 +0800 <tdraicer> @BlueSteelDC I assume Dems will fight his expected ruling, though if it goes up eventually to this Supreme Court...
1322645815081533441 2020-11-01 05:05:10 +0800 <tdraicer> @JimboThulu Otoh, if FL goes early for Biden (which it might) they can call it.  For Biden.

1322644916862898177 2020-11-01 05:01:36 +0800 <tdraicer> Justice Taney infamously wrote that a Black man has no rights a White man is bound to respect. But substitute "Trump voter" for "Black man" and "anyone else" for "a White man" and I think it works just fine.
1322617275845922821 2020-11-01 03:11:46 +0800 <tdraicer> @johnlk_80 @elks_man @joshtpm He didn't drop out because he thought he would lose. He dropped out because he was worn out by the tragedy of a war he neither wanted or had the courage to avoid.
1322608921018802177 2020-11-01 02:38:34 +0800 <tdraicer> I'm not afraid Trump's voters will start a civil war if he loses, I'm afraid we won't start one if he steals the election.

1322599556333379585 2020-11-01 02:01:21 +0800 <tdraicer> The real problem in GA and FL (and maybe Texas) is that we won't have the votes but that the votes won't be counted. Supposedly the Biden campaign is on top of this. I certainly hope so.
1322599055332151296 2020-11-01 01:59:22 +0800 <tdraicer> @JRubinBlogger @SenWarren @SenSanders Maybe you should leave this one to actual Democrats.

1322431873080053771 2020-10-31 14:55:02 +0800 <tdraicer> @SafiMaasai @GeorgeTakei The press assures me there is no fake Melania, which might convince me if the MSM wasn't so often Fake News (just not in the way Trump means).
1322431418308448257 2020-10-31 14:53:14 +0800 <tdraicer> @Angelamartin916 It isn't clear he will lose in FL. This is a good thing.

1322424698655940608 2020-10-31 14:26:32 +0800 <tdraicer> @digby56 Since polls show a majority of the military don't support Trump, maybe not.

1322387744006524930 2020-10-31 11:59:41 +0800 <tdraicer> @MaryAReed It was obvious at the time. There was a book, On Bended Knee, on how the press was taken in. David Brinkley attacked it even though he never read it. (But I did.)

The real worry about the opposition is not that we will respond with a civil war if the GOP steals the election, but that we will knuckle under instead.
1322240953948712960 2020-10-31 02:16:24 +0800 <tdraicer> @MattMurchison Yes.   Also, if Biden takes ANY of OH, FL, TX or GA he wins. But he doesn't need any of them, while Trump needs all of them.
1322240316490108928 2020-10-31 02:13:52 +0800 <tdraicer> @BorisTrump6 Frankly, if they would concede my right to hit them in the head with a bat (one of the heavy wooden ones) I'd be willing to risk their going mask-less. How about it Magats-is it a deal?

What is unique is it was founded on a set of principles that undermine all those things, often to the discomfort of the Founders themselves.

1320907154514214912 2020-10-27 09:56:21 +0800 <tdraicer> @liberalgoddess As with Trump, even if we take the Senate, we won't have the votes to remove them. But if any can be indicted, say for perjury, that's another story.
1320905958332239872 2020-10-27 09:51:36 +0800 <tdraicer> @mlauriat That's because they control the levers of power that could restrain or stop them. It's ridiculous to keep demanding that  SOMETHING happen 8 days before the ONLY thing that can stop them-taking that power away by voting. The only alternative is civil war.

1319723321697751044 2020-10-24 03:32:13 +0800 <tdraicer> @KeysToTheCourt1 Actually we are talking apples and oranges. That was the most that Hitler got running against Hindenburg for President. I was talking about the last semi-free election after Hindenburg made Hitler Chancellor.

1319716487574282241 2020-10-24 03:05:04 +0800 <tdraicer> @KeysToTheCourt1 In the last election in March 1933 (which was neither free nor fair but also not completely Nazi-controlled) the Nazis got 43% of the vote. But Hitler personally was far more popular than the party, and when France fell his popularity was almost-though not quite-universal.

1319711531010052099 2020-10-24 02:45:22 +0800 <tdraicer> @mlauriat But at the height of his popularity-after the fall of France-even a lot of Hitler's former opponents were won over for a time. And certainly by the mid-30s most Germans believed in him. Trump has never had majority support, but Trump is a complete joke and he still has 40%.
1319710053834829826 2020-10-24 02:39:30 +0800 <tdraicer> @KeysToTheCourt1 By 1935 Hitler personally, if not the Nazis as a party, had won over the overwhelming majority of Germans. Trump hasn't managed that, but then Trump is an idiot and the US is manifestly worse off 4 years in, while in material terms (only) 4 years in most Germans were better off.

1319705755327565825 2020-10-24 02:22:25 +0800 <tdraicer> Unexpected side effect of the Trump era is that I have a little (just a little) empathy for the Germans of the Nazi era. They had to go through a lot to be ready for Hitler, and Hitler had to do a lot to win them over. Here all it took was a black president and a complete clown.

1319650466893123584 2020-10-23 22:42:43 +0800 <tdraicer> @perdee22 @vlmorrisk Trump has ideas? Since when?
1319649588630966272 2020-10-23 22:39:14 +0800 <tdraicer> @Sigmundine2 The only thing that qualifies these people as analysts is for some reason someone publishes them.

1319642297286479872 2020-10-23 22:10:16 +0800 <tdraicer> @MattShaheen Are you a liar or moron? With you Republicans it is so hard to tell. And essentially irrelevant.
1319641089767362560 2020-10-23 22:05:28 +0800 <tdraicer> The GOP base is a reminder that the Enlightenment thinkers who basically invented modern democracy feared populism-the rule of the unenlightened mob-most of all.

1319476210032926725 2020-10-23 11:10:17 +0800 <tdraicer> @EricBoehlert Not astonishing. It is what the political MSM does: cover for the GOP.
1319474619070468103 2020-10-23 11:03:58 +0800 <tdraicer> It's  quite clear the political press always intended to declare Trump "much improved" as long as he didn't give an exact repeat of the first debate. That would concern me if I thought people still took them seriously, but I think most of us have finally learned our lesson.
1319468670071017475 2020-10-23 10:40:20 +0800 <tdraicer> @people4kam @amyewalter Tonight he became president.

1319463677616074753 2020-10-23 10:20:29 +0800 <tdraicer> @ramcdk @joshtpm You were mistaken.

1319461569210798080 2020-10-23 10:12:07 +0800 <tdraicer> @TimAlberta Idiots. We need an entirely new MSM.
1319460427215101954 2020-10-23 10:07:34 +0800 <tdraicer> @JohnJHarwood It was nonsense, but now it is obviously nonsense, as Trump has gone feral again. But anything to convince the GOP (who will never be convinced) that you're being fair.
1319459094844026880 2020-10-23 10:02:17 +0800 <tdraicer> David Frum has a never-ending obsession with limiting immigrants to the US. He could solve that by moving back to Canada.
1319457585280520192 2020-10-23 09:56:17 +0800 <tdraicer> @davidfrum If we need an argument against immigrants I'd start with you.
1319457185764605952 2020-10-23 09:54:42 +0800 <tdraicer> @MarkSKrikorian @davidfrum Good. Now if we can just get rid of these white long-term residents who keep voting for fascism. I suggest deporting them to Russia to make way for more immigrants.

They'll be no more prepared for the next would-be fuhrer the GOP throws up. So we better be.

1318415019604955140 2020-10-20 12:53:30 +0800 <tdraicer> they were still Nazis and soon did away with legality. I would prefer a civil war or break up of the United States to accepting a fascist GOP win against the expressed wishes of a majority simply because the compromises of the Founders make it legal.
1318415018220806144 2020-10-20 12:53:29 +0800 <tdraicer> I think we are going to win both the popular vote and the EV in November. But if we win the popular vote and lose the EV, I personally think Biden, the Democratic Party, and the voters should refuse to accept that result. The Nazis came to power by technically legal means but
1318252857846542336 2020-10-20 02:09:07 +0800 <tdraicer> @davidfrum And not at all among Democrats.

1317198409577660416 2020-10-17 04:19:07 +0800 <tdraicer> For my entire life politics has been dominated by a false debate between support for a strong military and a strong welfare state. False because the US needs and can afford both Guns and Butter. What it can't afford is Guns, Butter, and Corruption.

1316914758017232896 2020-10-16 09:32:00 +0800 <tdraicer> If the MSM was doing its job it would report that the GOP is a white supremacist Christian fascist party and Trump evil and deranged. But though those are easily verifiable objective facts they aren't neutral and the MSM hides behind neutrality by conflating it with objectivity.
1316913852827734017 2020-10-16 09:28:24 +0800 <tdraicer> @IChotiner @MarkHarrisNYC Perfect example of MSM's refusal to accept the objective reality that the GOP is a white supremacist Christian fascist party and Trump both evil and deranged. Your "normal rules" as an excuse just highlights the MSM's failure to treat them as abnormal. Thanks for the self-own.
1316912741760860160 2020-10-16 09:23:59 +0800 <tdraicer> @IChotiner No. That Trump is hurting himself is not the point of the objection. This wasn't a clever journalistic trap by NBC, it was cowardice and the eternal MSM Both Sides. That Trump fucked up the opportunity provided doesn't change that.
1316910858723856385 2020-10-16 09:16:30 +0800 <tdraicer> @Geechee4Kamala The MSM failures in 2016 have cost, among other things, hundreds of thousands of lives, but by and large the MSM feels they did just fine.
1316910378597703682 2020-10-16 09:14:35 +0800 <tdraicer> My fantasy is that Biden wins TX, FL, GA and OH in each case by the exact number of GOP voters prevented from voting by catching Covid.

1316905223986827264 2020-10-16 08:54:06 +0800 <tdraicer> @EricBoehlert It took a perfect storm to put Trump in office: social media, the MSM (especially the NY Times), Bernie, Comey, the Russians etc. Remove ANY one of them and this could have been avoided. But I blame the MSM most of all.

1316843747364265995 2020-10-16 04:49:49 +0800 <tdraicer> So Mitch rejects Trump's request for bigger stimulus politically hurting...both of them.
1316837085337223174 2020-10-16 04:23:21 +0800 <tdraicer> Can we all agree to make Nate Silver no longer a thing? Thanks!
1316835725061623808 2020-10-16 04:17:57 +0800 <tdraicer> @SenateDems @SenFeinstein Before jumping the shark. She must be replaced as head of Judiciary in Dem Senate.
1316833811364302853 2020-10-16 04:10:20 +0800 <tdraicer> @TPM @joshtpm What happened to arresting lawbreakers? I mean I know the Justice Department won't, but CA has its own law enforcement as I recall.
1316833267354603522 2020-10-16 04:08:11 +0800 <tdraicer> @joshtpm That's true but only if the election is not visibly stolen. Then the choice is knuckling under to fascism or civil war. I hope if that happened we would all choose the latter. We won the last one.

1316803833385766919 2020-10-16 02:11:13 +0800 <tdraicer> @pablorodas Yeah, Biden was holding his breath for that one.

I'm saying there is nothing WE can do if they are determined to steal the election except fight. and by fight I don't mean demonstrate or bring lawsuits, I mean civil war. I'm up for that if needed, but there isn't much I can do to prepare for it.
1316798641659674624 2020-10-16 01:50:35 +0800 <tdraicer> Good thread.
1316796094471434246 2020-10-16 01:40:28 +0800 <tdraicer> @JamesLindholm1 @ecp408 @MSNBC Our choice if they steal the election is knuckle under or civil war. If they manage to steal power they aren't going to give up to demonstrations or legal appeals. In that case, I hope we will choose civil war-we won the last one. But I'll try voting first.
1316794225367937025 2020-10-16 01:33:02 +0800 <tdraicer> @KeysToTheCourt1 Yes. The GOP embraced the Dixiecrats starting in 1964 with Goldwater. By the time Newt became Speaker the Dixuecrats had swallowed the GOP. Trump just made it obvious.
1316793687704252419 2020-10-16 01:30:54 +0800 <tdraicer> @EdBrickell @NewYorker I hope that is something we would refuse to accept. I for one would support civil war before accepting such a dictatorship. We won the last one.
1316792090077138950 2020-10-16 01:24:33 +0800 <tdraicer> @KeysToTheCourt1 The GOP is a white supremacist Christian fascist party. We can't afford to give them any power until that changes. Which won't be for a very long time.

Covering for the GOP is what MSM political "journalism" has been about since Watergate; a constant record of appeasement in apology for taking down Nixon. (We didn't mean to! We had no idea he was THAT guilty!)

Many leading members of the SS had doctorates. Tribalism, authoritarianism, greed and just plain malice are all part of the human condition. The best you can do is keep them in check.

But hard to see how a Justice could remain on the court if indicted for a crime. Lying before Congress is a crime. We just need an AG who is willing.

1315520741908115457 2020-10-12 13:12:40 +0800 <tdraicer> @davidfrum I'd also point out it was FDR's listening to the Now Balance the Budget folks that caused the recession.
1315518284150833152 2020-10-12 13:02:54 +0800 <tdraicer> @koslen_bambi We won't get a real policy until Biden is in office. The only positive thing to hold on to is that increasingly it is his own supporters who are going to be the victims.
1315516166656360448 2020-10-12 12:54:29 +0800 <tdraicer> @brianstelter @smartdissent @jaketapper Or the MSM that allowed it to happen in the first place. Both you and Tapper included.

1315514479971631104 2020-10-12 12:47:47 +0800 <tdraicer> @koslen_bambi It's the Washington Times, and I'd bet 90% of the people who signed that have no qualifications at all to do so. (Also, 15,000 signatures worldwide is pathetic.)

1315121156404510720 2020-10-11 10:44:52 +0800 <tdraicer> The whole MSM is in search of the white district that will "decide" the election in Nov., though they are all picking different ones. Meanwhile Biden is currently expected to earn 375 EVs.

Strong government regulation, true progressive taxation and strong social safety nets are not socialism.

Which shouldn't be a surprise-a lot of people have died without their covid being confirmed.

1313911209150865410 2020-10-08 02:36:58 +0800 <tdraicer> @LiberalNavySeal @cbmcave Given the actual number of dead is probably around 300,000 now, that's a conservative estimate.

And Communist bigwigs had access to goods the common people couldn't get near. But to the Leninist Left it is an example of an ideal society.

1312552972455469057 2020-10-04 08:39:49 +0800 <tdraicer> @AudreyStJames1 @mlauriat Yeah-because they are talking about over 200,000 dead and GOP attempts to take away health care in a pandemic. Or is Chris Christie in the hospital as part of a hoax too? I mean, I get distrusting the WH, but this is a cover-up of the seriousness of Trump's illness, not a hoax.
1312552001067200512 2020-10-04 08:35:57 +0800 <tdraicer> @GundyGirl Someone will. This WH has more holes than a cheese grater.

1312122666422210561 2020-10-03 04:09:56 +0800 <tdraicer> If Larry Kudlow says Trump has a "very moderate case" he must already be dead.
1312122185058721792 2020-10-03 04:08:01 +0800 <tdraicer> @oldhollywood21 "I can picture you bending over the stove. But I can't see the stove."
1312121605267484672 2020-10-03 04:05:43 +0800 <tdraicer> @tomwatson Irony isn't dead after all.
1312121409951338496 2020-10-03 04:04:56 +0800 <tdraicer> @Stonekettle You know what we are talking about? Trump's disastrous response to Covid and his desire to take away health care while getting the best for himself.
1312120994241236993 2020-10-03 04:03:17 +0800 <tdraicer> @Ky_Gill28 @WillsonSherrie No-I'm fine with talking about Trump killing over 200,000 Americans and crashing the economy, while getting the best health care he wants to deny the rest of us. This isn't a distraction, this is a Biden campaign dream come true.
1312120506305323008 2020-10-03 04:01:21 +0800 <tdraicer> @TaylorDeella Not in THIS WH.
1312119755499732992 2020-10-03 03:58:22 +0800 <tdraicer> @cgogam @MeidasTouch @rlindalucia Exactly.

1312115055220023297 2020-10-03 03:39:41 +0800 <tdraicer> @SMHeath1 A lot of people are, and I understand that. But it's true. And shouldn't be a surprise. The only surprise is it took this long for him to catch it.
1312112614776868865 2020-10-03 03:29:59 +0800 <tdraicer> Putting aside everything else, this WH leaks more than the Titanic. There is no way they could pull this off as a hoax. Trump is sick, and might even die. Regardless, it points up his total failure on the virus, and thus is not a distraction. It's a Biden campaign commercial.
1312111741292048384 2020-10-03 03:26:31 +0800 <tdraicer> @BrianKarem @lunas3rdgirl @realDonaldTrump fine
1312111650514763776 2020-10-03 03:26:09 +0800 <tdraicer> @BrianKarem @lunas3rdgirl @realDonaldTrump We don't need too. This works just find as a reminder of over 200,000 dead and a crashed economy. This isn't a distraction, it's a bonus.
1312110927215357954 2020-10-03 03:23:17 +0800 <tdraicer> @MollyJongFast Not like. it IS a death cult.

1312104539898535937 2020-10-03 02:57:54 +0800 <tdraicer> @mmpadellan No-but it's a cover-up.
1312103674643050498 2020-10-03 02:54:28 +0800 <tdraicer> @carla_margolis This is not a good replacement for him.
1312103474251796480 2020-10-03 02:53:40 +0800 <tdraicer> @JacobHeilbrunn @realDonaldTrump I'm sorry, when exactly did your brain fall out?
1312103261319520256 2020-10-03 02:52:49 +0800 <tdraicer> @kneerecon It just might.
1312102091645579265 2020-10-03 02:48:10 +0800 <tdraicer> I say this btw as someone who owes his existence to Hitler. There is no way the daughter of a Baptist coal miner from KY would have met the son of Russian Jewish immigrants from NJ without WWII. But I'm not egotistical enough to think I'm a fair exchange for 75 million lives.
1312089412151455744 2020-10-03 01:57:47 +0800 <tdraicer> @Sethrogen @jasonrantz Yeah-you clearly aren't the one to make that judgment.
1312089098878889984 2020-10-03 01:56:33 +0800 <tdraicer> @ColoradoDavidSu But they need to keep testing for another 7 to 10 days to be sure.
1312088485218713601 2020-10-03 01:54:06 +0800 <tdraicer> @ColoradoDavidSu Wait a week until we are sure he didn't infect Biden.
1312087829170851844 2020-10-03 01:51:30 +0800 <tdraicer> @davidfrum @TheAtlantic No, we don't reduce ourselves to their level by wishing them ill. Some people are truly horrible and deserve it when they are paid in kind.
1312086818402304000 2020-10-03 01:47:29 +0800 <tdraicer> It is nonsense that every life has value. Some people are horrible, do great harm, and the world is better off without them. So no, I'm not going to pretend to wish Trump well.
1312085758426198016 2020-10-03 01:43:16 +0800 <tdraicer> @carolecadwalla @joshtpm Yeah, that's not going to happen here.
1312085377797238785 2020-10-03 01:41:46 +0800 <tdraicer> @joshtpm Why?
1312082103572541441 2020-10-03 01:28:45 +0800 <tdraicer> @mattmurphmd None.
1312079760433065986 2020-10-03 01:19:26 +0800 <tdraicer> @kingmanmarie39 Understandable, but remember in the end there was a wolf.
1312077698336948232 2020-10-03 01:11:15 +0800 <tdraicer> @Mar_a_Hell_No No. Because I don't believe in god or prayer.
1312071009462296576 2020-10-03 00:44:40 +0800 <tdraicer> @KLoeffler @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS You all thought you could bluff a virus, but the virus didn't care.
1312068241364267010 2020-10-03 00:33:40 +0800 <tdraicer> @juliaioffe There was no need for the "seem to." He doesn't care.
1312067715432165381 2020-10-03 00:31:35 +0800 <tdraicer> @prairielive @CNN No.
1312067294219075587 2020-10-03 00:29:54 +0800 <tdraicer> @goaloa @WeHave2BeBetter Plus drug addiction.
1312066781482233862 2020-10-03 00:27:52 +0800 <tdraicer> @RoxRuminates Well for one thing the SS had a sense of style: Hugo Boss vs. K-Mart.
1312065233989632006 2020-10-03 00:21:43 +0800 <tdraicer> @goyne_david @kazweida Otoh, Pence doesn't have Trump's cultish devotion. Anyway, hopefully Joe is fine.
1311940639509172226 2020-10-02 16:06:37 +0800 <tdraicer> Final thought for tonight: pundits on tv asking if Trump will be able to do his job? What job? Tweeting? Watching Fox News? Golf? Hold his hate rallies? When has he ever done his job?
1311926657633189888 2020-10-02 15:11:04 +0800 <tdraicer> @BadJewishBoy @AusOpinion I agree-but what he can do he will.
1311926412367073283 2020-10-02 15:10:05 +0800 <tdraicer> @TeaPainUSA Once when living in NJ i ran into an aunt from VA at the airport in New Orleans when neither of us knew the other was there. Coincidences happen constantly.
1311925546557865984 2020-10-02 15:06:39 +0800 <tdraicer> @BadJewishBoy @AusOpinion Trump can't win. The only question is can he steal it? Of course now, the question is will he be alive in Nov.?
1311924058532065280 2020-10-02 15:00:44 +0800 <tdraicer> @kazweida Then my concern moves to Biden. did Trump just infect him too?
1311923614850191360 2020-10-02 14:58:58 +0800 <tdraicer> @mrFawkes51 No-just a virus.
1311923414567989249 2020-10-02 14:58:11 +0800 <tdraicer> @dfsparks Absolutely-most things aren't. Otoh, this WH lies so often there is reason to be cautious.
1311922886580592640 2020-10-02 14:56:05 +0800 <tdraicer> @Resist2TheEnd It remains unlikely but it is certainly possible.
1311918628497915907 2020-10-02 14:39:09 +0800 <tdraicer> @admiralmpj @riiickgrimes He already says its no big deal.
1311918466065215491 2020-10-02 14:38:31 +0800 <tdraicer> @admiralmpj @riiickgrimes Mine is he just gave it to Biden.
1311917896927510528 2020-10-02 14:36:15 +0800 <tdraicer> @Turnip2020 @Alt_ReddTruq I get the feeling but hold on:  a. it could be a lie b. If true, he'll get the best care in the world c. I'm waiting to make sure he didn't give it to Biden
1311917305085997056 2020-10-02 14:33:54 +0800 <tdraicer> @jemelehill @JulieAnderson01 No, I wish him ill.
1311917054476398592 2020-10-02 14:32:54 +0800 <tdraicer> @NightlyPolitics @Alt_ReddTruq I care about them only as vectors.
1311916344632324098 2020-10-02 14:30:05 +0800 <tdraicer> @lizzzzz_c Worse-it might be real, and Trump just gave it to Biden.
1311916171365699584 2020-10-02 14:29:24 +0800 <tdraicer> @usambovu @PalmerReport Odd reaction.
1311914588808634368 2020-10-02 14:23:06 +0800 <tdraicer> @AndyOstroy @vegasbanks Worry about Biden.
1311913305330659330 2020-10-02 14:18:00 +0800 <tdraicer> @RICHARDLNEWBY No-but there is a virus. Now let's hope Trump didn't just give it to Joe.
1311912558207565824 2020-10-02 14:15:02 +0800 <tdraicer> @TeaPainUSA I'm not running for office, so if he really has it (who knows?) AND he didn't give it to Biden (knock wood) I'm going to sip my schadenfreude in front of my non-existent fire and laugh quietly.
1311911002687131649 2020-10-02 14:08:51 +0800 <tdraicer> @osullivanauthor @riiickgrimes But that won't save him from state charges.
1311910603737509888 2020-10-02 14:07:16 +0800 <tdraicer> @goyne_david The only thing keeping me from indulging is the thought it might be a lie.
1311910176212033536 2020-10-02 14:05:34 +0800 <tdraicer> Assuming Trump has it and it isn't just a play for sympathy and a way out of the debates, he will literally get the best care in the world so don't get your hopes up too high.
1311908104561397761 2020-10-02 13:57:20 +0800 <tdraicer> @maddow LOL!
1311907822981058565 2020-10-02 13:56:13 +0800 <tdraicer> @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS But it was a hoax.
1311841927986393088 2020-10-02 09:34:23 +0800 <tdraicer> @BradMossEsq I hope so.
1311839903014096898 2020-10-02 09:26:20 +0800 <tdraicer> @RudyCerda Really have no idea. The first I remember (not the same thing) is Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines. Which I still love.

1311839135804596225 2020-10-02 09:23:17 +0800 <tdraicer> @ChristineRomans @retiredtrnman Well if it doesn't, civilization was fun while it lasted.
1311838912202059783 2020-10-02 09:22:24 +0800 <tdraicer> @BUMO33157 The magazine Stormy spanked him with. And that's it.
1311836039489740801 2020-10-02 09:10:59 +0800 <tdraicer> @bradpomerance In the future perhaps. Given the GOP treatment under Trump, right now it probably is.
1311835302063939584 2020-10-02 09:08:03 +0800 <tdraicer> @accidntlmystic @AP Being a virus himself, I'm pretty sure Trump is immune.
1311834221682528257 2020-10-02 09:03:45 +0800 <tdraicer> @fwtoney He's not as bad as Hitler. So far.
1311833884322074626 2020-10-02 09:02:25 +0800 <tdraicer> @realDonaldTrump Enjoy the fantasy-it will make your defeat even more painful, and at this point you can't suffer enough.
1311833406553182208 2020-10-02 09:00:31 +0800 <tdraicer> @lanerodrigs1979 won't
1311833278039683077 2020-10-02 09:00:00 +0800 <tdraicer> @Yair_Rosenberg Why we have to keep the GOP out of power for a long long time.
1311832785498378241 2020-10-02 08:58:03 +0800 <tdraicer> @BY1959 Absolutely. And not just Trump. Every GOP criminal. Which at this point is dozens.
1311832034164314112 2020-10-02 08:55:04 +0800 <tdraicer> @vicky_dollysmom Anyone undecided at this point is a moron.
1311830957784211456 2020-10-02 08:50:47 +0800 <tdraicer> @lanerodrigs1979 I want get my hopes up on those two getting the virus. Professional courtesy.
1311827878024302594 2020-10-02 08:38:33 +0800 <tdraicer> I'll settle for Biden with 270 electoral votes and 50 Dems in the Senate, but what I want is Biden over 350 EC and 53 Dem Senate seats. And right now the latter seems about as likely as the former.
1311749952918491136 2020-10-02 03:28:54 +0800 <tdraicer> @JoeConason He doesn't legally hold the job, so I'm not sure you can impeach him.
1311748733646839808 2020-10-02 03:24:03 +0800 <tdraicer> @joshtpm @TPM You can't bluff a virus.
1311746319745253376 2020-10-02 03:14:28 +0800 <tdraicer> @tomiahonen @larry5hands Actually it wasn't founded by Lincoln, and he was its peak (it peaked early). But I agree with the RIP.

1311719300915486720 2020-10-02 01:27:06 +0800 <tdraicer> @Kevswatching Dobbs would say that if Trump axed the audience to death.

1311458098658369536 2020-10-01 08:09:11 +0800 <tdraicer> @DWUhlfelderLaw The MSM is always "surprised." The alternative would be to tell the truth about Trump and the GOP.

1311452912032284673 2020-10-01 07:48:34 +0800 <tdraicer> @Claire_Voltaire Since civilization won't survive such a United States (it barely survived such a Germany in a pre-nuclear and pre-climate change era) I won't be going anywhere. I'll fight it out here. I support Israel's existence. I've never seen it seen as my refuge.

Then they controlled MOST of the federal government. This was always going to come down to this Nov. Or civil war.

1310292954339254272 2020-09-28 02:59:19 +0800 <tdraicer> There are only three ways this ends: we win by voting, we knuckle under, or civil war. Those calling for the Dems to "do something" and demanding a "Plan B" have no realistic "something" or plan in mind. Ignore them and vote. And then if GOP forces civil war on us that's on them.
1310290465179283457 2020-09-28 02:49:25 +0800 <tdraicer> @marclar Plan B is civil war. That's the only other option. I'll try voting first.
1310287144578056199 2020-09-28 02:36:13 +0800 <tdraicer> those helping spread that propaganda, whatever their motivations. If we vote, we win. and if we win, Trump will leave. The GOP hasn't got the guts to provoke civil war, but if I'm wrong, we'll still win. The "suckers and losers" of the military are more on our side than theirs.
1310287142300659712 2020-09-28 02:36:13 +0800 <tdraicer> I started to debate someone convinced the GOP will steal the election through the SC and Dems have to block Trump's nominee to stop it (they can't) or we are doomed and decided just to Block instead.

The picture of them as criminal masterminds instead of a street mob in a panic because they know are going to lose can only discourage voting and play into their hands.

1309192189755490304 2020-09-25 02:05:16 +0800 <tdraicer> @KareemRifai @BadJewishBoy Obviously no one asked Trump.
1309191810791673857 2020-09-25 02:03:45 +0800 <tdraicer> @TheRickWilson True, but also not the right tone coming from someone who spent years helping to bring us to this point.

1309163722724835328 2020-09-25 00:12:09 +0800 <tdraicer> @neeratanden And GOP is a fascist party. But they are also not that bright, and odds they can steal the election (and force a civil war on us, because no way we should accept that) are much less than the odds we beat them in Nov. They are trying to depress the vote by convincing otherwise.

Killing Soviets is important, but a means to an end-taking VP cities. Taking the Dnepr bend cities has priority over Kiev, and keep the max # of units in range of HQs.
1309021615192244225 2020-09-24 14:47:28 +0800 <tdraicer> It's true GOP knows it can't win with fair elections, but the fact is that they'd oppose fair elections regardless because fascists oppose democracy on principle.

To get away with stealing the election they would have to do it behind the scenes, not out in the open, but Trump can't keep his mouth shut.

1308862479322304515 2020-09-24 04:15:07 +0800 <tdraicer> @piyushmittal In this case, probably pretty much the same. Getting shot at-understandably or not-is pretty much a get-out-of-jail-free card for cops everywhere and at all times. If she was white there probably would have been more secondary charges though.

1308859134427754496 2020-09-24 04:01:49 +0800 <tdraicer> @dad_darius The unfortunate truth is I doubt in all US history you can find a case where police were fired on (even for understandable and valid reasons) and then charged for murder, so this case was always going to be a long-shot, even in a more liberal place than KY.
1308854561659138050 2020-09-24 03:43:39 +0800 <tdraicer> @joshtpm @TPM Yeah, that'll work. Not.

1308833876081553408 2020-09-24 02:21:27 +0800 <tdraicer> @atrupar @pjbrand4 Trump will do whatever he does. Civil war is always possible if they force it on us.  Right now their worst case scenario (Trump/GOP lose resoundingly) is more probable than ours.

1308497767006973953 2020-09-23 04:05:53 +0800 <tdraicer> A reminder. FDR didn't fail to pack the SC because of Constitutional principles, but because southern Dems feared a liberal court would act on civil rights. Those Dixiecrats are now the heart of the GOP and thus not a reason not to expand the courts. #13Justices

1307365619168415744 2020-09-20 01:07:07 +0800 <tdraicer> @magi_jay If Mitch forces through a Trump nominee, Dems increase the number of justices to 13. Problem solved. If he doesn't, Dem AG indicts Kavanaugh and Biden gets two justices, problem solved. If they are willing to go to any lengths, Dems must respond in kind.

1307152969373290497 2020-09-19 11:02:08 +0800 <tdraicer> @MfromPa Still is. If Mitch pushes through another Trump judge we can use that as justification to reform (pack) the courts.
1307152680679337987 2020-09-19 11:00:59 +0800 <tdraicer> @lasteve423 I really think we could turn this to our advantage, but it requires Biden stating that if Mitch does this we will "reform"  (pack) the courts.

1307138586173677569 2020-09-19 10:04:59 +0800 <tdraicer> @notdred @thegarance Well we can fix that by voting out more GOP Senators to make that part true. As for the SC, this is the perfect excuse to reform (pack) the courts in 2021.
1307137847804260352 2020-09-19 10:02:03 +0800 <tdraicer> @Shlarg2 Or we elect a Dem President and WH in Nov. and reform (pack) the courts in 2021. How does 13 Supreme Court justices sound? I mean, we could go higher if people have a problem with the number 13.
1307137393200427008 2020-09-19 10:00:14 +0800 <tdraicer> @joelockhart @ohohyeah 13 sounds like a lucky number for the SC.
1307137195996860422 2020-09-19 09:59:27 +0800 <tdraicer> @liberalgoddess @petro21805 Actually what we need is to expand and reform the Court in 2021. Another Trump nominee pushed through now would be just the motivation-and political cover-for Dems to do that. Of course I'm assuming we win in Nov., but then if we don't, the courts are irrelevant.
1307136525747007488 2020-09-19 09:56:47 +0800 <tdraicer> @DrGJackBrown @ACJJustice Part of me hopes they break their word. Forcing through a new Trump judge would be just the cover Dems need to reform (pack) the courts in 2021.
1307136092123156480 2020-09-19 09:55:04 +0800 <tdraicer> @JewelsJourneys And it is the perfect grounds for Dems to reform (pack) the courts in 2021.

1307134759634599942 2020-09-19 09:49:46 +0800 <tdraicer> @SethAbramson 11th thought-this is the perfect political motivation for Dems to expand the Courts in 2021.

1307130395452993540 2020-09-19 09:32:26 +0800 <tdraicer> @piyushmittal They will. It should provide just the push needed for the Dems to expand the Court in 2021. 13 justices seems like a lucky number.
1307129716344795141 2020-09-19 09:29:44 +0800 <tdraicer> @Eiggam5955 No-we get the Dems to pledge to expand the court in 2021.  Mitch ramming through a nominee now is the perfect political cover for a new 13 member court.
1307129088348499975 2020-09-19 09:27:14 +0800 <tdraicer> @nhannahjones Nothing is over. Personally I look forward to the new 13 member Supreme Court.

1304590348069597185 2020-09-12 09:19:11 +0800 <tdraicer> @master_deli The idea that greed motivates all crimes comes from Marx, but there are 6 other deadly sins, and the Nazi vision of a world purified of inferior races, above all the Jews, went far beyond self-enrichment or even enriching Germany. It was a sincere evil core belief.
1304589529534398466 2020-09-12 09:15:56 +0800 <tdraicer> @master_deli Sorry, no. They confiscated the wealth, and then spent vast amount of resources to create the infrastructure of industrial killing and the organization and transport to carry it out, which cost much more than gold teeth and hair. And at a time the Reich was desperate for labor.
1304587779565858816 2020-09-12 09:08:59 +0800 <tdraicer> @master_deli I don't really agree when it comes to the Nazis. They certainly enjoyed self-enrichment but the ideology was not a surface coating but went very deep. The Holocaust was a huge waste of resources both for Germany and the Nazi leadership that makes sense only to a true believer.

The GOP really doesn't care what happens to the US as long as they stay in charge.

1303760796477018113 2020-09-10 02:22:51 +0800 <tdraicer> @neeratanden It was always obvious he knew all along. Nice to have it on tape, but Woodward is not a journalistic hero here, but in sitting on this to sell his book  an example of everything wrong with the MSM.
1303760309363126279 2020-09-10 02:20:55 +0800 <tdraicer> @american2084 He was nominated by a nazi so...
1303759945876287490 2020-09-10 02:19:28 +0800 <tdraicer> @AblueUs But then so would I.
1303759712471658499 2020-09-10 02:18:32 +0800 <tdraicer> @MollyJongFast Yes. So is the fact he sat on those tapes all these months to sell his book.
1303759264310349828 2020-09-10 02:16:45 +0800 <tdraicer> @MattMurchison Yes. And Woodward knew and kept silent to sell his book.
1303758712239255552 2020-09-10 02:14:34 +0800 <tdraicer> @kazweida Yes. But that he sat on them all these months to sell his book is also unforgivable.
1303757810870747138 2020-09-10 02:10:59 +0800 <tdraicer> @EricBoehlert They understood it, but now it is going to be hard to pretend. But BW is no hero-he sat on this to sell his book.
1303757110283579393 2020-09-10 02:08:12 +0800 <tdraicer> @lasteve423 We'll know in November. What is certain is after 4 more years it won't be.
1303756795505147904 2020-09-10 02:06:57 +0800 <tdraicer> @JRubinBlogger @JewelsJourneys That's been true of the GOP for decades. Trump just made it so obvious even you could see it.
1303755541097975809 2020-09-10 02:01:58 +0800 <tdraicer> @Yair_Rosenberg The other thing is that Woodward knew all this in Feb. And sat on it to sell his book. Let's not make him a hero here.
1303755261455335424 2020-09-10 02:00:51 +0800 <tdraicer> @mlauriat No, you are correct.
1303755144832704516 2020-09-10 02:00:23 +0800 <tdraicer> @glennkirschner2 That Woodward sat on this also demonstrates everything wrong with our poisonous MSM.
1303754150195363843 2020-09-10 01:56:26 +0800 <tdraicer> @CBSNews Quisling wasn't available to nominate.
1303753577291280385 2020-09-10 01:54:10 +0800 <tdraicer> @PreetBharara @littledeekay Glad there are tapes. But let's be clear: Woodward is no hero here. He sat on this while the nation collapsed in order to sell his book.
1303752759498416129 2020-09-10 01:50:55 +0800 <tdraicer> @gregolear Woodward also knew. And sat on it. Blood on his hands too.
1303752342781792256 2020-09-10 01:49:15 +0800 <tdraicer> @Mystic_Sailor Woodward is nearly as guilty here as Trump, sitting on this to sell his book.
1303751947716046848 2020-09-10 01:47:41 +0800 <tdraicer> @Teesa_Michele Odd how the populist Left consists almost entirely of people doing well enough that they aren't affected by the disasters their politics inflict on the rest of us.
1303751201801072643 2020-09-10 01:44:43 +0800 <tdraicer> @Yair_Rosenberg And it was always true. I'm glad for every Trump voter in 2016 who votes for Biden now, but they'll still owe the nation an apology forever.
1303750577277603842 2020-09-10 01:42:14 +0800 <tdraicer> @DanRather @BelaBenanua Yes. We also know Bob Woodward knew-and kept it quiet to sell his book.
1303749832507625472 2020-09-10 01:39:17 +0800 <tdraicer> @JRubinBlogger And Bob Woodward covered it up to sell his book.
1303749495256223744 2020-09-10 01:37:56 +0800 <tdraicer> @NotActuallyZach @master_deli Yes, I'm aware of that. And you are still an asshole.
1303748613512867840 2020-09-10 01:34:26 +0800 <tdraicer> @master_deli I disagree: they both matter. Our awful MSM is ultimately why we are where we are.
1303747699926355968 2020-09-10 01:30:48 +0800 <tdraicer> @magi_jay And Woodward sat on this to sell his book. Our MSM is as poisonous as the GOP. Maybe more: the latter wouldn't hold power without the former.
1303746990724001792 2020-09-10 01:27:59 +0800 <tdraicer> @NotActuallyZach @master_deli True, no one can stop you from being a self-satisfied nihilist, more interested in feeling superior than actually making the world better. But we can hold you in well-earned contempt.

If Dems behaved that way the MSM would focus all its attention on how partisan and unseemly they were being. The truth is our MSM is rigged for the GOP, and that explains most Dem failures for last 30 years.

1301763859204759554 2020-09-04 14:07:44 +0800 <tdraicer> @rcn400 Yes. And after W. I hardly thought that was possible.
1301718282484015104 2020-09-04 11:06:37 +0800 <tdraicer> @DiscoTempoJazz @JoeBiden You don't get it. The problem is that the media sees its job as covering for the GOP, which is why Republicans can get away with things Dems can't, and focus attention in a way they can't. The Biden/Harris campaign has shown itself extremely competent, but the MSM is rigged.
1301713816233934848 2020-09-04 10:48:53 +0800 <tdraicer> @realDonaldTrump You're the eleventh plague.
1301709984066080768 2020-09-04 10:33:39 +0800 <tdraicer> @davidfrum They get it. But to say it would be to admit what the GOP has become, and that they won't do.

1301589505703583746 2020-09-04 02:34:55 +0800 <tdraicer> @OlgaNYC1211 Because a majority of whites still support Trump and our largely white MSM isn't going to tell them they are wrong.

1301578424784498690 2020-09-04 01:50:53 +0800 <tdraicer> "It is illegal to vote twice in an election, officials stress following unsubstantiated claims from Trump and Barr"  "Unsubstantiated claims?" Implying they just didn't provide the evidence. Because god forbid we say they lied.

It's true they have stronger welfare states, but those were put in place decades ago (and not always by the Left).  Bernie Bros aren't DemSocs either. They are Leninists and nihilists.

The Dem platform under both HRC and Biden would be mainstream DemSoc in most European countries (including Labour minus the Corbynites). Part of that of course is that the European Left has moving towards the center for decades now.

1300870032356974595 2020-09-02 02:55:59 +0800 <tdraicer> the entire 20th Century is less than 100,000. That's quite criminal enough so there is no need to invent numbers.

Just saw a tweet which stated that 100,000 to 150,000 poor mostly black people were involuntarily sterilized in the US every year in the 20s and 30s. Which is utter nonsense. The best estimated total for

1300626992979750913 2020-09-01 10:50:14 +0800 <tdraicer> At the end of Turn 1 (second half of March 1918) the Germans have lost 16 steps, which is almost 1/3rd of all their replacements for the entire game. Allied losses have also been heavy (particularly for the British) but the Germans will have to be much more careful from now on.
1300598274156568577 2020-09-01 08:56:07 +0800 <tdraicer> Rest of the front, which I expect to remain pretty quiet, apart from French units railed to the Paris front. I may rail a couple of German Stoss corps down there, as the threat of infiltration may limit how many units the French can peel away.  https://t.co/lU7zBhrcuY

The Allies have lost 9 steps (including three eliminated corps) to the German 12, but another 7 Allied corps are for the moment trapped (though still supplied). But attempt to take Mt.
