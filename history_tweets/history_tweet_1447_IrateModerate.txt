Did you check it out?
1341353235223855104 2020-12-22 20:01:47 +0800 <IrateModerate> @Moonbattery1 You may have noticed  *A Woke Communist Cultural Revolution* Rampaging US cities complete with Maoist type struggle sessions inspired by paranoid delusional thinking that Marxist Critical Race Theory instills into young minds  The ghosts of past injustice are what Oppress you now
1341137265754423296 2020-12-22 05:43:35 +0800 <IrateModerate> @Mamamia1151 @ossoff Funny that it appears few here see objective truth &amp; reality as important  Or they should fact check their beliefs against reality  Workers, incl self employed, got  $600 PER WEEK for months Added to state UI benefits Total $1400/week in some states $60,000+/yr/person  Go figure
1341035992556339203 2020-12-21 23:01:10 +0800 <IrateModerate> @Public_Citizen What'd you mean exactly? USA 267 days?  Days since May's CARES Covid relief bill, 3 Trillion $ to help workers &amp; small business   Then Trump's exec order extended relief to Oct, a way around Dem Congress that held back $ to hurt Trump re-election as Ms Pelosi explained recently
1340943670514647040 2020-12-21 16:54:19 +0800 <IrateModerate> @Rhianno40418828 @DannyBeNice @lyne_ian You have a reference on  "vaccines don't prevent you from getting Covid-19 disease or spreading it"  Contagion is dependent on viral load Vaccinated patients have lower viral loads because of the immune response elicited by vaccines  Therefore they should be less contagious
1340936007630221314 2020-12-21 16:23:52 +0800 <IrateModerate> @AlanDav96481933 @Timcast Given the ability of the infected/ contagious person to infect others is dependent on their viral load  And given that the immune response elicited by vaccines kills the virus b4 it hijacks cellular machinery to replicate &amp; increase viral load  Vaccinated = far less infectious

1337909777804840960 2020-12-13 07:58:42 +0800 <IrateModerate> @TomFitton Because they'd have to explain why the hell they didn't stop it from happening in the 1st place?  Every person in USA except those gaslighted by media (Pravda DNC) knew voting by mail was a DNC dream  Condemned by every bipartisan election commission for decades as open to fraud
1334164671641776128 2020-12-02 23:56:59 +0800 <IrateModerate> @ConceptualJames If this doesn't show the world that the architects of this Critical Sophistry are quite mad, and that CRT is just an effective method used to instill a delusional ideation into the minds of otherwise normal people,  then what possibly could?
1321627755612573696 2020-10-29 09:39:46 +0800 <IrateModerate> @RadicalxEdward @Timcast Intersectionality &amp; identity politics &amp; CRT, the antithesis to Dr MLK Jr's dream of a color blind society inspired the civil rights movement to make possible election of a black man POTUS in Dr King's natural lifetime CRT's used to divide &amp; foment conflict needed before reset
1321449915961102337 2020-10-28 21:53:05 +0800 <IrateModerate> @UnpaidComintern @MaajidNawaz &lt;"But yes, please tell me how workers' self-management will kill everyone"&gt; It certainly would not. But, the belief that communism offers workers' self- management has &amp; will   Communism's duplicitous promise of a workers' paradise only delivers workers into state slavery
1315476798759526402 2020-10-12 10:18:03 +0800 <IrateModerate> @AdamBaldwin @trailbla_zing That's the way I see it *Woke Communism* The new Orwellian Doublethink version
1315463397916336128 2020-10-12 09:24:48 +0800 <IrateModerate> @AshleyGregory00 @Timcast Will they have to? I suspect not. This narrative is more diabolical. Maybe you're a nice person who believes that they, like you, want what's best for the US, Western Liberal Democracy, Freedom &amp; Liberty Maybe they believe it's best to tear it all down? They do say that
