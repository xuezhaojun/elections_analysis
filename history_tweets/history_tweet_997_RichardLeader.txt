Its uniquely top-down, Gosplan-esque method of allocating resources/investing in capacity perhaps isn't suited to the healthcare challenges of the 21st century; where a more agile/market-based approach may serve users better

1340381560592326656 2020-12-20 03:40:41 +0800 <RichardLeader> Tier 4 feels very unnecessary.

1340360567194869763 2020-12-20 02:17:16 +0800 <RichardLeader> @julianHjessop It doesn't matter that your domestically-produced substitutes are likely to be of inferior quality; or that the opportunity cost of producing 5 lbs of potatoes is, say, not writing a piece for the Telegraph.

1340358550791610368 2020-12-20 02:09:15 +0800 <RichardLeader> @julianHjessop Recommend an import substitution trade policy, ie. a mix of tariffs &amp; quotas.

1324078098225238016 2020-11-05 03:56:33 +0800 <RichardLeader> Of course, the motive in challenging is _always_ to overturn a result - that's natural competitive behavior / desire to win.

1324071737663885315 2020-11-05 03:31:16 +0800 <RichardLeader> Of course you've got to count every vote - and, more generally, follow all the rules of the myriad individual ballots (organized at state level) comprising a GE.  It's right that close results can (and should) be challenged/scrutinized. This is healthy. We play by the rules here.

Some factors, eg. COVID-related silliness, will pass. Others, eg. not having a sufficient stake in society to _not_ riot, require fixing.

1321239678436167691 2020-10-28 07:57:41 +0800 <RichardLeader> @bridgetcfisher Municipalities shouldn't have to bid against each other to host projects of this scale.

1321238728229167106 2020-10-28 07:53:54 +0800 <RichardLeader> @bridgetcfisher In the case of HY, granting tax breaks to developers doesn't incur an opportunity cost provided that the investment would otherwise not have been made.  Yet it does create an unwelcome market distortion, in terms of capital allocation &amp; returns. Personally, I dislike these deals.

1321141634239811586 2020-10-28 01:28:05 +0800 <RichardLeader> @burner7711 @NYCMayor The Mayor is effectively CEO of an organization employing 350,000 people that's responsible for a city at the core of a metro area of ~19M people.

Why not simply say: go the pub if you want, just be sensible?  These infantilizing rules cause individuals to abdicate  responsibility vs. taking it seriously.

As you say, younger members - who perhaps don't want to isolate - can be split off, eg. into halls. Others, who choose to stay &amp; care/provide company, can be financially sustained.

A booming, innovative Scots economy firing on all cylinders whilst generating mountains of tax revenue to fund well-run public services would surely present an irresistible argument for ‚ÄúYes‚Äù - however if that‚Äôs the SNP‚Äôs plan then their delivery appears sadly lacking.

Your pals in the teaching unions are still dragging their feet over reopening. Violent crime in the outer boroughs + Harlem has soared, the service economy is dying on its feet, and many of the city's highest-contributing taxpayers have left.

Abatement is only one part of it. Zoning and (to a more manageable extent), rent control/stabilization also inhibit the market's ability to function/respond to price signals.

1304802758986522624 2020-09-12 23:23:14 +0800 <RichardLeader> @DouglasRob0 There's also a tendency to view trade as a competitive, zero-sum game vs. collaborative/win-win, as though exports are goals 'scored'. If I buy a tumble dryer made in S. Korea because it's cheaper/better than domestically-produced alternatives, then as a consumer I gain.

It'd be a safe bet to say they'd gain weight, but very difficult to say by how much - as that would depend on myriad factors that are tricky, if not impossible, to model. Thus, the folly of macroeconomic forecasting.
