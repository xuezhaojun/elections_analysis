1343292264576122884 2020-12-28 04:26:47 +0800 <aka_koon> @devinslawyer2 @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump A civil war is between two factions trying to control the same government. The South seceded, had every right to, had their own President, constitution, and congress.
1343291876514947073 2020-12-28 04:25:15 +0800 <aka_koon> @devinslawyer2 @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump You should study. If a man chases you with a butcher knife and you shoot him, who was the aggressor? Lincoln provoked the war by reinforcing his invading force at Fort Sumpter.
1342930558830206977 2020-12-27 04:29:30 +0800 <aka_koon> @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump I am at a loss that you would compare Trump in any way to most brutal and godless president in our history. You need to get the truth on Lincoln. God forbid that Trump should be like him in any way.
1342509486985121792 2020-12-26 00:36:18 +0800 <aka_koon> Mr. PRESIDENT: Don't concede. What we need is a brand new declaration of independence for those of us who cherish freedom. Don't concede.  SECEDE!!!!
1341798324039499776 2020-12-24 01:30:24 +0800 <aka_koon> @gregkellyusa Seriously?
1341361418436825088 2020-12-22 20:34:18 +0800 <aka_koon> @RealMattCouch And you are assuming we will ever have fair elections again?

1340410990165417992 2020-12-20 05:37:38 +0800 <aka_koon> @disclosetv History cannot be rightly understood without conspiracies for the wicked always work in the dark. The most significant event in history--the crucifixion--was the result of a conspiracy (Psalm 2).

1338914214136713220 2020-12-16 02:29:59 +0800 <aka_koon> @newsmax @senatemajldr Trump people helped him. He got his seat. To hell with Trump now. Swamp creature!!!!
1338904179482497025 2020-12-16 01:50:06 +0800 <aka_koon> Yes
1338892797349392385 2020-12-16 01:04:52 +0800 <aka_koon> Dear Mr. President (the real one not the fraud). Why would you want to continue to serve those who hate you and conspire against You? Alexander Hamilton Stephens proved secession was a legal act. Forget the swamp. Come to the heartland, declare a new nation and a new capitol.
1337139945950031874 2020-12-11 04:59:40 +0800 <aka_koon> @GeorgePapa19 But Southerners were not traitors. They had a legitimate right to secede, had their own President, Congress, and Constitution. If the South was wrong to secede, then the colonies were wrong against King George III.

1330871386345181184 2020-11-23 21:50:39 +0800 <aka_koon> @greta @realDonaldTrump Yup. Daddy Bush is still alive. They don't want that SOB disturbed or convicted.
1330220976596979714 2020-11-22 02:46:09 +0800 <aka_koon> @DavidJHarrisJr We don't need all the evidence and proof. The courts need that. We know the election was stolen. Any one with one eye and half of a functioning brain knows it. Biden never left his basement, was caught with his hands in Chinese fortune cookie jar cheated. Proof coming. Wait
