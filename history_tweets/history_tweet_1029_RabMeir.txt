I do have some proud blocks though just for asking a few questions, from these guys:  Dave Rubin Nick Fuentes Joel Pollack  How dare they limit my free speech!  Snowflakes.

Q-Anon has poisoned a significant segment of their base with nonsense.  If you want to actually learn facts about the issue, it's horrific:   https://t.co/BOLCSWjmT2

1343390607448924161 2020-12-28 10:57:34 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheFeralFanatic @TheQuartering People who can't understand when to use your/you're should avoid calling anyone or anything stupid.  I could care less about Only Fans.  I was just helping Jeremy understand why people were sending Melania pictures to conservatives.  Try to keep up there lad.

But that's not relevant here.  Can you name the most "communist" policy that Joe Biden wants to implement that concerns you?
1343087495223922689 2020-12-27 14:53:06 +0800 <RabMeir> @will_OC_Ca Coward.
1343087114318188545 2020-12-27 14:51:36 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheStrangerTru1 @TheQuartering Lol.  Or maybe some kid playing Sim Universe on a supercomputer in 3020.  Both of these are more likely than any religion being true.  Hey Jeremy, thanks for the thread!
1343086283460063233 2020-12-27 14:48:17 +0800 <RabMeir> @will_OC_Ca Exactly.  None of you can defend an idea.  You spend all day retweeting Twitter handles of "Patriots" with the occasional ad hom.  You're a beta low-T soy cuck snowflake.  An Alpha would man up and deal with me properly.
1343085190336434176 2020-12-27 14:43:57 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheStrangerTru1 @TheQuartering I prefer it only in the way they use it in Ancient Aliens, LOL!  This motherfucker has said more likely things about the realty of God than any pastor I've ever heard give a sermon.  And he's full of shit.  https://t.co/yN9erF9WPw
1343084341371543553 2020-12-27 14:40:34 +0800 <RabMeir> @will_OC_Ca I assume you are smart and impressive, why are you afraid to shop at the marketplace of ideas and prove what a great big brain you have?
1343083910817787905 2020-12-27 14:38:52 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheStrangerTru1 @TheQuartering @neiltyson That's sad and true.  I've used the internet to prove myself and parts of my worldview wrong on several issues.  To do anything else is to remain ignorant.
1343083292904579073 2020-12-27 14:36:24 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheStrangerTru1 @TheQuartering @neiltyson How many years before they officially re-interpret the creation story to be about the entire universe, all of the planets and all life on all other planets?  Will they wait until we have proof of life elsewhere or set the table beforehand?
1343082807057403905 2020-12-27 14:34:29 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheStrangerTru1 @TheQuartering @neiltyson It is sort of fun to see them accommodate every new discovery into their stories.  I was at dinner with a couple before and the wife told me that dinosaur bones were planted by Satan to test our faith.  She was dead serious.
1343082357759348737 2020-12-27 14:32:42 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheStrangerTru1 @TheQuartering It's very difficult for me to imagine otherwise.  The Abrahamic religions can't even agree on foundational beliefs.  The arrogance of any one of them to say they are correct and the others are wrong (and will go to hell).  No one knows.
1343081319400660993 2020-12-27 14:28:34 +0800 <RabMeir> @will_OC_Ca How does someone working on fusion energy support Donald J. Trump in any capacity?
1343080588891328513 2020-12-27 14:25:40 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheStrangerTru1 @TheQuartering Sure, likely not "created for", poor phrasing.  But certainly at some point was hijacked for that purpose in the early days of civilization.  @neiltyson always says "God" is an ever retreating list of things we can't explain with science.  i.e. creation and death today.
1343079006611140610 2020-12-27 14:19:23 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheStrangerTru1 @TheQuartering Totally.  I think they pick and choose when it's convenient for them personally or tactically smart as a whole, and then they hold up the Bible.
1343078525134401541 2020-12-27 14:17:28 +0800 <RabMeir> @will_OC_Ca Aw shit, we got a real live Christian Patriot on the line!
1343078293004824576 2020-12-27 14:16:32 +0800 <RabMeir> @sidman2591 read the rest of the exchange.  I love that you use Twitter just to retweet Jeremy.  Amazin'
1343077360590053377 2020-12-27 14:12:50 +0800 <RabMeir> @MikeyRevival @TheQuartering All good man.  Have a great night!
1343077182294384642 2020-12-27 14:12:08 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheStrangerTru1 @TheQuartering It seems clear to me that religion was created as an early form of subjugating the people.  At one point the church were the only ones who could tell you what day it was and then tell you what you were not allowed to do on that day.  Maybe that's necessary for humanity at scale?
1343076489588305920 2020-12-27 14:09:22 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheStrangerTru1 @TheQuartering I agree with you.  I was subjected to church every Sunday until I was 18.  It's pretty clear the actual values of Christianity are not important to those people if you can "hold your nose" and vote for a man like Donald J. Trump.  There is really no way around that.
1343075209671299072 2020-12-27 14:04:17 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheStrangerTru1 @TheQuartering Yes, I do think that is why it endures.  However I personally believe it does far more harm than good, and we should find a better substitute.  I don't think medication is the answer either.  That's a deep conversation to get into, actually.
1343074551886983168 2020-12-27 14:01:40 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheStrangerTru1 @TheQuartering I do agree with that.  Libertarians are definitely not the same as the traditional Christian conservatives are.  I'm glad there are still people out there who do recognize and point this out.  Good on you.
1343074079562211328 2020-12-27 13:59:48 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheStrangerTru1 @TheQuartering You will get no disagreement from me about religion.  I think it's poison.  I think libertarians have a lot of functional problems in their ideologies, but I do respect them for not trying to dictate how others can live their lives.
1343073557585293314 2020-12-27 13:57:43 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheStrangerTru1 @TheQuartering I do find it interesting that the right seems to love personal responsibility and individual liberty so much in theory, but in reality they work to limit what other people can do if they disagree morally.
1343071743557177344 2020-12-27 13:50:31 +0800 <RabMeir> @will_OC_Ca You already lost the game.  It's over.  You'll be remembered for Trump.  Good riddance.
1343070710638501889 2020-12-27 13:46:25 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheStrangerTru1 @TheQuartering And just to be clear, I didn't send any pics of Melania nor do I think that's the right point of attack.  In fact, it's a literal logical fallacy.  TÅ« quoque (Latin for "you also"), or the appeal to hypocrisy.
1343070276670676992 2020-12-27 13:44:41 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheStrangerTru1 @TheQuartering No one is body shaming Melania.  She has an incredible body.  Try to follow along pal.  Have you seen the right-wing pearl clutching the last couple of weeks over Only Fans and porn?  People are sending Melania nude to point out the hypocrisy of that take.  The end.
1343069532383031296 2020-12-27 13:41:44 +0800 <RabMeir> @MikeyRevival @TheQuartering I guess you didn't see my reply, so assuming you're correct....that would make 2 of us?
1343067902405181440 2020-12-27 13:35:15 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheQuartering Great take, I commend you for that.  I exempt you from my comments about conservatives in general, because that's not a popular opinion with them.  You must admit, Trump and Melania don't exactly fit in with the values of the Christian right.
1343066543438094337 2020-12-27 13:29:51 +0800 <RabMeir> @donwinslow @JhonnoWayne Based only on direct quotes from Trump himself, would any level of involvement with Epstein be hard to believe?
1343065891467046912 2020-12-27 13:27:16 +0800 <RabMeir> @atrupar And somehow, all his very stupid fans instantly turn on every single one.  Is there a limit?
1343065620557017090 2020-12-27 13:26:11 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheQuartering No idiots.  You snowflakes lose your minds over Only Fans, porn, etc.  People showing you how blatant your hypocrisy is should not be this confusing.  Lay off the booze, Jeremy.
1343065216620310528 2020-12-27 13:24:35 +0800 <RabMeir> @jimhig061 @JVER1 @lebronsonroids @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn @SidneyPowell1 Define communism for me.  Joe Biden would be a conservative in most developed countries.  You are lost.
1343064699122962432 2020-12-27 13:22:31 +0800 <RabMeir> @TrumpRulzz @notkristinj It's actually tragic the effect that Trump and his morons have had on institutions and public trust.  Imagine the conservative party turning on the FBI, or any law enforcement agency, even as recently as the W years.  The internet and social media have to be the root cause.
1343064156400922625 2020-12-27 13:20:22 +0800 <RabMeir> @gatewaypundit @e_iaco Have you read any of the PDF?  What a joke this stuff is.  You guys are actually pathetic.  Remember when Trump investigated all this stuff in 2016 because he lost the popular vote by 3 million?  What did he find?  Losers.

1343028131184181249 2020-12-27 10:57:13 +0800 <RabMeir> @ScottAdamsSays Trump did not specifically recommend ingesting disinfectants, but he did express interest in exploring whether disinfectants could be applied to the site of a coronavirus infection inside the body, such as the lungs.  Can we agree that his suggestion was very stupid?
1343027037116772352 2020-12-27 10:52:52 +0800 <RabMeir> @BuzzPatterson Hey Buzz, what's that mean?

Is it possible you refuse to accept even the idea that you COULD be wrong, about anything?  Is that likely?  Do you think you're one of the smartest people alive?  That ever lived?
1343024574942896128 2020-12-27 10:43:05 +0800 <RabMeir> @ii1111 @ScottAdamsSays Before the internet, Scott would be helping people in an auditorium contact their dead relatives.  "I'm hearing from John....does anyone here know anyone named John who died?  Oh you do!  That must be him!"  Give your head a shake, David.
1343024079620739073 2020-12-27 10:41:07 +0800 <RabMeir> @ScottAdamsSays Scott, does the consensus of people who spend their lives studying and working in a particular field mean anything to you?  I think you realize you're going against the grain of medical professionals on this.  Do you offer anything other than your opinion as a counterpoint?
1343023348805214209 2020-12-27 10:38:13 +0800 <RabMeir> @ScottAdamsSays @Im_not_a_Horse1 This is not an argument.  By your logic, do we need a name for any mental disorder?  Where would you draw the line?
1343022849930514433 2020-12-27 10:36:14 +0800 <RabMeir> @ScottAdamsSays "And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning."  Scott -- I know you make money being dishonest -- but come on dude.

Truthful historical record, and a general social consensus of such, is the basis for future decisions.  Do you think it's good if a large segment does not believe in historical fact?
1343018483873886209 2020-12-27 10:18:53 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Does even 1 conservative understand what free speech means?  Are Twitter or Facebook owned and operated by the government?

He is going against the conservative grain and asking people to take the virus seriously.  It's a low bar, but he did jump over it which is more can be said for chuds like @MattWalshBlog

What is the reason?  Why is Trump afraid to criticize Putin?  Why does he always come to his defense?  Even to the extent he calls the USA murderers.  Why?

1341243585862184961 2020-12-22 12:46:04 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Care to elaborate on this, Matt?
1341243373953413120 2020-12-22 12:45:14 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Matt has never heard of Gerrymandering.  He doesn't know about red lining.  Hasn't read that black families have 10% the average net worth of white ones.  Would never learn that it took until the late 90s for black families to start passing down paid off housing to their children

They pushed mass amounts of disinformation over social media that influenced the minds of some of the people who voted for Trump.  That isn't a debatable point.  Although I do use the term "minds" loosely in this case.

1339982101349855233 2020-12-19 01:13:23 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog I think Matt raises a fair point here, for once.
1339981901864587266 2020-12-19 01:12:35 +0800 <RabMeir> @ScottAdamsSays So Scott now believes that every US election has been fraudulent.  For all your Scott Simps out there, do you not see that this man is telling you what you to hear for money?
1339804309941334017 2020-12-18 13:26:54 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Matt is correct here, @TimJDillon.  He has always been obsessed with controlling what all women are allowed to do with their bodies based on how it makes him feel.  Because he's a good Christian.  We all know Jesus famously wanted nothing to do with prostitutes.
1339675895112609804 2020-12-18 04:56:38 +0800 <RabMeir> @AprilWild28 @StacelovesTexas @MattWalshBlog @ScottAdamsSays That's the same thing :)  But really the history of treatment towards gay vs straight people over the past say, 100 years, is not comparable.  Who was the straight Alan Turning?  A handful of trans activists calling straight people transphobic isn't really of any consequence.

It is NOT transphobic for a straight man to want to have sex with biological women only.  To say otherwise is a ridiculous far-left fringe point of view that Matt holds up as something all left leaning people believe.
1339646403237335040 2020-12-18 02:59:26 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Pete is literally a Rhodes Scholar who studied at Harvard and Oxford.  Matt is an easily offended chud on the internet.  Only 1 of these people is a serious person.
1339645434449567744 2020-12-18 02:55:35 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Was (or is) Trump qualified to be President?
1339645227880112132 2020-12-18 02:54:46 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Why do you think they call it "the world's oldest profession"?  You think a couple of chuds online can destroy the demand for sex work?  Why do you think you can control what consenting adults do in private?  I thought "the right" was all about personal freedom.
1339644819170340867 2020-12-18 02:53:08 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog "Many people are saying" that "the left" believes X, Y and Z.  This is all Matt does.  "The left" is not a single-minded entity any more than "the right" is.  How can a reactionary this dishonest make any comment about what is and is not noble?
1339644295624749058 2020-12-18 02:51:04 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Where is the lie?  Do you work for The Daily Wire?  Did Dan and Farris Wilks fund The Daily Wire?  Are Dan and Farris billionaires due to their fracking business?  Do you think that provides any conflict on interest when reporting on climate change?  Your defense is whataboutism?

He's an extremely fragile little snowflake who flips out online for money about things he does not -- and makes no attempt to -- understand.

This is exactly my point about him picking 1 extreme left person and acting like it's a mainstream left viewpoint.  It is not transphobic for a straight man not to have sex with a transwoman.  That's ridiculous.

Such as your opinions.  Generally people do not seek out dissenting opinions on purpose, creating an echo chamber.  Internet exacerbates this.  I think Matt is a very dangerous person.

As if they are monsters, invalid or do not exist.  It's cruel.  I don't understand why Matt has to attack them every 3 or 4 weeks on Twitter or write articles.  What did they do to him?

And what if the therapist concurs that the child is transsexual?  It sort of sounds to me like you think transsexual is just a thing you can cure and make go away.  Is that the case?
1339368955354427393 2020-12-17 08:36:57 +0800 <RabMeir> @AprilWild28 @StacelovesTexas @MattWalshBlog Honest question, if your child at 18 came out as trans and moved out on their own.  Would you disown them as your child?  Refuse to address them as their preferred name and gender?  It's not an easy question if it happens to you.
1339368707454332929 2020-12-17 08:35:58 +0800 <RabMeir> @AprilWild28 @StacelovesTexas @MattWalshBlog Yes teens are.  That's why psychological and medical doctors attend to these situations, which are less than 2% of the population.  Does their very existence bother you?  At some point as parents we have to recognize we don't control our teens as they age and become adults.
1339368141676273667 2020-12-17 08:33:43 +0800 <RabMeir> @AprilWild28 @StacelovesTexas @MattWalshBlog Important to recognize that if we are talking about transgender, or depression, or a variety of issues - other people have different lived experiences than we do.  We will never truly understand.  That's what empathy is.  Telling a depressed person to "just be happy" is cruel.
1339367511566016517 2020-12-17 08:31:13 +0800 <RabMeir> @AprilWild28 @StacelovesTexas @MattWalshBlog Just for reference here, I have 2 kids, and I agree with what you're saying here.  About the tattoo and the puberty blockers.  But if my kid was depressed every day and/or attempted suicide, I think I would do everything in my power to help them find peace and happiness.
1339366864389070848 2020-12-17 08:28:39 +0800 <RabMeir> @AprilWild28 @StacelovesTexas @MattWalshBlog I think that's a perfectly reasonable thing to believe and say.  I think if your child was genuinely transgender, you would probably do EVEREYTHING in your power to help them arrive at their happiest destination because you love them.  And until you've been there, who knows.
1339365259291873281 2020-12-17 08:22:16 +0800 <RabMeir> Are any conservatives willing to read and process anything at all that does not confirm their priors?  Are any willing to honestly and actually debate any of this?  Open to all challengers.  @ScottAdamsSays @MattWalshBlog @michaelmalice @michaeljknowles @benshapiro @scrowder

Why do we never see Matt challenge his opinions or beliefs or engage in honest debate with anyone?  #Grifter
1339362016079822848 2020-12-17 08:09:23 +0800 <RabMeir> @AprilWild28 @StacelovesTexas @MattWalshBlog Matt purports to be a Christian and a clear example of moral virtue.  How well does this apply to his approach to transsexual people?  Is this what the Bible teaches him?  He's making profit by attacking society's vulnerable people.  It's pretty gross when you think about it.
1339361594095099904 2020-12-17 08:07:42 +0800 <RabMeir> @AprilWild28 @StacelovesTexas @MattWalshBlog This is the consensus approach of medical and psychological professionals, again with the intent to reduce the rates of suicide among this population of vulnerable people.  Looks at the rates of violence against them and the way society treats these people.
1339361038354030593 2020-12-17 08:05:30 +0800 <RabMeir> @AprilWild28 @StacelovesTexas @MattWalshBlog And regarding the puberty blockers, this is another area where Matt needs to do more honest reading on the subject.  They delay the hormones, under the guidance of medical and psychological professionals.  If the child stops taking them -- puberty takes its course.  Not permanent
1339360553668665345 2020-12-17 08:03:34 +0800 <RabMeir> @AprilWild28 @StacelovesTexas @MattWalshBlog So (trans) men can have periods.  What is FAR more confusing to me, is why Matt and people like him refuse to make any attempt to understand this, and become outraged by it publicly over the internet on a recurring basis.  How does Buck Angel being called "him" affect Matt?
1339360026541092867 2020-12-17 08:01:29 +0800 <RabMeir> @AprilWild28 @StacelovesTexas @MattWalshBlog Just to give a practical example, you would call the person pictured below "a man" in any setting -- else the words have no social utility as I said.  He is a "trans man", and not a "cis man".  Obviously an important distinction.  He could have a period.  https://t.co/TwGbslrccn

Using #PrincipleOfCharity and trying to figure out why one might say this, it really just means Trans Men have periods.  Cisgender (biological) men do not.
1339299467980398601 2020-12-17 04:00:50 +0800 <RabMeir> @willchamberlain Ben Shapiro is often the most viewed on Facebook.  Crowder is the largest political youtuber.  Yes, very censored.  Do you realize how stupid this argument is, Will?

Fact is though, "she" has a dick.  So if you follow Matt's ideology -- how do you reconcile this?
1339295311370579968 2020-12-17 03:44:19 +0800 <RabMeir> @AprilWild28 @StacelovesTexas @MattWalshBlog Matt likes to find the most fringe extreme example and act as if it represents the views of everyone to the left of him.  To be fair, "the left" does the same thing with Nazis and conservatives.  In both cases, the most extreme fringe positions are not even close to mainstream.
1339294889905885186 2020-12-17 03:42:39 +0800 <RabMeir> @AprilWild28 @StacelovesTexas @MattWalshBlog I agree with that.  Unfortunately we have people like Matt, constantly promoting ideas that actively harm other people.  It's important that people push back against that.  Perhaps if these people would try to educate themselves honestly before being a bigot, it would get better.
1339294472946012162 2020-12-17 03:40:59 +0800 <RabMeir> @humantorch @MattWalshBlog Him and Ben having meltdowns over Harry Styles and such, trying to tell the world about what a "real man" is, I must admit, is sort of funny.  How much collective time did those 2 spend inside a locker as kids?

That's really all trans people are asking for.  There are far left lunatics who want to go way too far, but that's not representative of most people.
1339271905241669647 2020-12-17 02:11:19 +0800 <RabMeir> @AprilWild28 @StacelovesTexas @MattWalshBlog Perhaps in some rare cases.  Looking into biological sex and intersex people it becomes clear that some individuals don't even fit into the biological binary of male and female.  Hormones, chromosomes, genitals and gonads do not always line up.  Gender is totally separate.
1339270637274148867 2020-12-17 02:06:17 +0800 <RabMeir> @AprilWild28 @StacelovesTexas @MattWalshBlog LOL!  I can tell by your bio.  Matt bothers me, as you can probably tell.  A year ago I would have agreed with everything he said on trans people.  But then I actually tried to educate myself, and it didn't take long to find some holes.  It's a worthwhile journey.
1339270374782021632 2020-12-17 02:05:14 +0800 <RabMeir> @AprilWild28 @StacelovesTexas @MattWalshBlog Matt's ideology can't understand the difference between biological sex and gender.  Something understood in academia for decades.  As you go about your daily routine in public, how often do you check people's genitals before you determine their gender?

Do you have any empathy for trans people who have the highest rate of suicide of any group on earth?  Do you think it helps them for people to tell them they are "pretending"?  Is suicide pretend in your opinion?

He says stuff about trans people as if he has conclusive irrefutable knowledge on the subject.  He is perpetuating very bad opinions that actively harm trans people in real life.

He just tells them what is true and what is not.  It's very clear he has taken no steps to try to learn or educate himself about trans people.  He is being an ignorant bully.

Is Matt helping or hurting these people?  Do you think they deserve some level of empathy?  When I first heard about trans people, I had a lot of questions too.  Questions are not bad.

I could point you to specific tweets I think are harmful to people if you're actually interested.

For profit.  It's pathetic, he is a spineless coward afraid of debate.  His fans should spend time reading counterarguments with the #PrincipleOfCharity
1332378972345208832 2020-11-28 01:41:16 +0800 <RabMeir> @ReaganNo1 @scrowder Conservatives pick and choose which parts of the Bible they want to listen to.  The venn diagram of the parts they listen to and the parts that allow control over other people is a circle.  They only listen to the teachings of the Church when it's convenient for them.  SAD!

It is not bullying when you attack them on a regularly scheduled basis?  What did they do to make you so upset?

1329093924816891904 2020-11-19 00:07:39 +0800 <RabMeir> @gypster2004 @HCoorinna @thevivafrei @JustinTrudeau There are double standards everywhere.  It's not something you're going to fix.  Scheer did the same thing.  Why not put your focus and energy towards stuff that actually matters?
1329092701862588418 2020-11-19 00:02:48 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog For example, the President of the United States and his team.
1328915134052519937 2020-11-18 12:17:12 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @UncivilLaw @BroadyNate Team Trump is 1-25 in court so far...
1328909753297276928 2020-11-18 11:55:49 +0800 <RabMeir> @ddwiese @CrazyCatRescuer You sure?
1328909173359251456 2020-11-18 11:53:31 +0800 <RabMeir> @LoveGraceWon @SM4USA Sounds like you might get to see him soon!!!!
1328906980266795009 2020-11-18 11:44:48 +0800 <RabMeir> @Lazarian13 @ezralevant This sounds extremely credible.
1328906422428504064 2020-11-18 11:42:35 +0800 <RabMeir> @CortesSteve Sorry dude, you break it you buy it.
1328905962342789127 2020-11-18 11:40:45 +0800 <RabMeir> @JLPtalk How are they, Jessie?
1328905824815734786 2020-11-18 11:40:13 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich Sounds like he is honest and able to criticize his own mistakes.
1328905043890892800 2020-11-18 11:37:06 +0800 <RabMeir> @liquidlaugh What is real?  What is true?  Where do you go for the truth?
1328904856929771520 2020-11-18 11:36:22 +0800 <RabMeir> @jmen600779 Santa can still find you pal, relax.
1328903716754350083 2020-11-18 11:31:50 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich Also....shouldn't a democracy actually give equal weight to every citizen's vote?  I agree with getting rid of the EC.
1328903544607547393 2020-11-18 11:31:09 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich Scott Piro appears to have written 2 opinion articles for CNN, and this was one.  I don't remember any type of serious push for this.  Certainly nothing on the scale of what is going on here in 2020.
1328899616939630600 2020-11-18 11:15:33 +0800 <RabMeir> @MichaelCoudrey This is getting sad guys.
1328899114004848642 2020-11-18 11:13:33 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray As if the members of that board were anonymous.  A bad take, even for Ian.
1328898471814983684 2020-11-18 11:11:00 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Can you think of any examples where the right did that?
1328894855725060101 2020-11-18 10:56:37 +0800 <RabMeir> @Lauren_Southern So where does one turn for the truth?
1328893364125782018 2020-11-18 10:50:42 +0800 <RabMeir> @Lauren_Southern This was literally a joke on Veep about Selina Meyer's book!!!  Amazin'
1328892939179855874 2020-11-18 10:49:00 +0800 <RabMeir> @Lauren_Southern I feel like you might one day do this exact sequence of events.
1328891778649427977 2020-11-18 10:44:24 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @UncivilLaw @BroadyNate I'm gunna fact check this.

1328888560989122560 2020-11-18 10:31:37 +0800 <RabMeir> @HCoorinna @thevivafrei @JustinTrudeau Thank you.  Does any of this surprise you?  Do you think Elon Musk (or any CEO) follows all of the rules that employees must follow to ensure the survival and success of Tesla?  I tell my kids not to swear.  Would you?  This is immutable human nature that occurs at every level.
1328884740481544197 2020-11-18 10:16:26 +0800 <RabMeir> @TomiLahren Always trust the person or group that tells you they are the only ones you can trust.
1328882550249492481 2020-11-18 10:07:44 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @JustinTrudeau It's literally a logical fallacy to attack a position in this manner.  You can criticize his behavior and the optics all day -- and that's valid.  But it doesn't change the fact that the population should socially distance and wear masks until we are vaccinated.  You disagree?
1328881680401244162 2020-11-18 10:04:16 +0800 <RabMeir> @AudreyMaesmama @MattWalshBlog Who is more manly....Matt Walsh, or the men of Rome?  https://t.co/9TlK6a5T3x
1328880390925414400 2020-11-18 09:59:09 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei How did only 1 person make a small penis joke here?!  This is genuinely shocking.
1328879906948788227 2020-11-18 09:57:13 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @JustinTrudeau TÅ« quoque (Latin for "you also"), or the appeal to hypocrisy, is an informal fallacy that intends to discredit the opponent's argument by attacking the opponent's own personal behavior as being inconsistent with the argument's conclusion(s).
1328879147926646784 2020-11-18 09:54:12 +0800 <RabMeir> @intheMatrixxx @kingArt44577632 Isn't that always the goal after a natural disaster of any kind?  Would you aim to build things back to be worse?  What do you think you've uncovered here?
1328873154870202369 2020-11-18 09:30:24 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @JennaEllisEsq Fair enough.  It appears to me like you consistently criticize the left and praise the right -- regardless of merit.  I hope this doesn't happen here.  Given the mental state of the world right now I think we need more honesty and #PrincipleOfCharity in our public discourse.
1328870044936224768 2020-11-18 09:18:02 +0800 <RabMeir> @RealCandaceO @MattWalshBlog Were the roman men manly?  https://t.co/wAztjqfO93
1328866405203271682 2020-11-18 09:03:34 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @JennaEllisEsq Not bad.  Allow me to re-phrase.  Do you believe these anomalies are part of a coordinated multi-state effort by the Democrats to cheat?  None of us can truly "know" what happened.  I am asking what you think, your opinion.
1328863619254251521 2020-11-18 08:52:30 +0800 <RabMeir> @tumptyone @maggmountains Do you guys think the story on OAN is true?  This question can forever be universally answered quickly and easily: no.
1328863341528424449 2020-11-18 08:51:24 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray What's the 2nd most insane conspiracy theory you believe?
1328862798575775744 2020-11-18 08:49:14 +0800 <RabMeir> @morganisawizard Why does it make them spiteful?
1328860323621834756 2020-11-18 08:39:24 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray What did Trump do?
1328856331755925505 2020-11-18 08:23:33 +0800 <RabMeir> @stephanie_co239 @comgeek25 There's a high percentage of conservatives that will block you if you write something that disagrees with their worldview.  To me, it explains why some of them have the same opinions from 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Despite how much has changed and been learned since then.
1328854713761214465 2020-11-18 08:17:07 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @JennaEllisEsq Viva, what are the odds in your estimation, that the Democrats successfully "rigged" the election to win the Presidency?

1328569991147433984 2020-11-17 13:25:44 +0800 <RabMeir> @JackPosobiec Would you be OK with the federal government providing these IDs to all citizens free of charge?

1328561834333523969 2020-11-17 12:53:19 +0800 <RabMeir> @AllThySons01 @liberal_party What does that have to do with Canadian policy for poor Canadians or the environment?  Canada borrowed the money, which it never has to actually pay back, because every country rolls over their debt forever and always will.
1328561191573217280 2020-11-17 12:50:46 +0800 <RabMeir> @ElishaKrauss @AlissaWalsh21 Almost 250,000 dead Americans, and this is your rhetoric?
1328559421505622016 2020-11-17 12:43:44 +0800 <RabMeir> @AllThySons01 @liberal_party Because their proposed policies and longstanding history of voting proves how they would have handled it.  They have a different worldview.  Look at the disaster to the south of us.  How can you say our federal government did not do a good job?
1328557306108317699 2020-11-17 12:35:19 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich This is gross.  Stop giving money to large corporations.
1328557085328633856 2020-11-17 12:34:27 +0800 <RabMeir> @AllThySons01 @liberal_party You sound red pilled.  Get out of the bubble and listen to some well researched opposing opinions with the #PrincipleOfCharity  If you do, you'll pull back to the middle a bit and see what I am saying.  The Conservative party is not the party to the help the poor or the Earth.
1328556407751385091 2020-11-17 12:31:45 +0800 <RabMeir> @iamjumpingin @JEBJOAN Conservatives used to support the police and law enforcement.  Now they treat the FBI and other federal agencies with less credibility than 1 dude in a car or Russia Today.
1328555657117782017 2020-11-17 12:28:46 +0800 <RabMeir> @AllThySons01 @liberal_party Also CEWS?  They gave a LOT of money to businesses.  I run one.  CERB prevented financial ruin for our citizens while keeping us alive.  Are you willing to consider information that goes against your priors?  Can you any example of Conservative policy that helps the poor?
1328554379671171074 2020-11-17 12:23:42 +0800 <RabMeir> @AllThySons01 @liberal_party No comment on CEBA?
1328554294438719489 2020-11-17 12:23:21 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich Can you tell your audience the 2 ways that the public money supply is increased?

1328548555775238144 2020-11-17 12:00:33 +0800 <RabMeir> @cranky_vet @AOC Do you understand how new debt is created in the first place?
1328548434098466817 2020-11-17 12:00:04 +0800 <RabMeir> @ScottAdamsSays They did, you know they did, Mitch won't do it unless it's no strings attached for big business.  And you know that too.  Stop lying to The Scott Adams Simp Army #SASA
1328546169056858114 2020-11-17 11:51:04 +0800 <RabMeir> @AllThySons01 @liberal_party What do you think of the federal response to Covid?  CERB and CEBA specifically, and the success The Atlantic Bubble?
1328545343261335552 2020-11-17 11:47:47 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheQuartering Tell us more about She-Ra's boobs?
1328545151258648581 2020-11-17 11:47:01 +0800 <RabMeir> @marshall2beach @thevivafrei @JustinTrudeau Yes.  The Liberals rigged the election so they ended up with a minority government, with Mayonnaise Face's party gaining +26 seats and the BQ gaining +22.  You did the dumbest Tweet in the history of the multiverse.  @thevivafrei, you are directly responsible.  Cut this crap out.
1328543019495268352 2020-11-17 11:38:33 +0800 <RabMeir> @michaelmalice Oh sorry man, I didn't mean to make you feel sad.  You're doing good.
1328541438951514114 2020-11-17 11:32:16 +0800 <RabMeir> @michaelmalice You're a self-admitted troll.  Not necessarily blessed with wit or a good sense of humor, just a mean spirit willing to say taboo things for shock value.  SAD!
1328540395953905665 2020-11-17 11:28:08 +0800 <RabMeir> @michaelmalice He says it every minute of every day.
1328539927995445256 2020-11-17 11:26:16 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich LOL  Frig man.  You're challenging guys online to fight at 43 years old.

1328537921364889601 2020-11-17 11:18:18 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich Well, maybe he's an Alpha's Beta....
1328537584000233474 2020-11-17 11:16:57 +0800 <RabMeir> @KurtSchlichter You're a huge idiot.
1328537502127443974 2020-11-17 11:16:38 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich Mike is an Alpha's Alpha.
1328536861866942464 2020-11-17 11:14:05 +0800 <RabMeir> @michaelmalice Especially not safe for a guy with the body of a malnourished twink.
1328536594169651203 2020-11-17 11:13:01 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheQuartering Sounds like the Catholic Church.
1328536280083427330 2020-11-17 11:11:46 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @Barnes_Law @SidneyPowell1 @RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump A lawyer's job is to construe all evidence toward 1 side and only argue on behalf of that side.  Do you ever see yourself breaking free of that paradigm?  I would love to see you have some guests on that are there to do more than confirm the priors of you and your audience. U in?
1328534796998496256 2020-11-17 11:05:53 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @JustinTrudeau The Canadian government has taken care of small business and it's citizens financially, while overseeing some of the best responses to the pandemic in the world.  The Atlantic Bubble is the best outcome in North America.  Get your head on straight, bud.
1328534266393882630 2020-11-17 11:03:46 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich Of course you would.  And you'd set up a GoFundMe so the Simp Army would pay you 6 figures to do it.
1328533683259789312 2020-11-17 11:01:27 +0800 <RabMeir> @dbongino @DAdrian_96 No one cares, Dan.  It would be sweet if you morons all left Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and any other normal space.  Go talk about lizard people and flat earth and whatnot on "Parler".  No one cares.  Also, did you spell the app you're an owner of wrong?  SAD!

1328528390224228355 2020-11-17 10:40:25 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Where Matt Walsh springs to the defense of Ben Shapiro's penis.

1328059970001268736 2020-11-16 03:39:05 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @brianstelter When the Supreme Count stopped the recount, Bush won Florida by 537 votes, a margin of 0.009% in 2000.  Ultimately, Bush won 271 electoral votes.  The country moved on united.  Honest question I am hoping to answer:  What has changed so drastically in the last 20 years?
1328059046260318211 2020-11-16 03:35:25 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @brianstelter Sure.  Whatever the courts determine is fine by me.  I am glad to know that you will stop with the conspiracy mongering related to elections if and when the courts rule in Biden's favor.
1328058522374955009 2020-11-16 03:33:20 +0800 <RabMeir> @Texasgalz Counting votes after election day has happened in every election.  Including many states in 2020 that Trump won.  Why is it a problem to count legally submitted votes?

1328052925260849152 2020-11-16 03:11:06 +0800 <RabMeir> @Texasgalz What about it?  Sorry, I am not seeing the connection here.
1328052604832800769 2020-11-16 03:09:49 +0800 <RabMeir> @Texasgalz - Trump tells his base not to mail in their votes, causing them to skew heavily Democrat. - Republican legislatures prevent counting mail-in ballots until election day.  It was well documented before the election that because of these 2 things, Republicans would have a lead early
1328051981471125504 2020-11-16 03:07:21 +0800 <RabMeir> @mpukita Given that half of the country is skeptical and refuses to trust any vaccine, I would assume everyone would welcome a 2nd set of eyes on the testing procedures.  You can't have it both ways.
1328051736754479104 2020-11-16 03:06:22 +0800 <RabMeir> @mpukita I'm sorry, but that is not true.  Cuomo himself said NY (and 6 other states) have independent panels that will review the procedures and processes used to approve the vaccine.  They are NOT doing any "testing" on the vaccine.  This will happen concurrent with distribution.
1328051193046818816 2020-11-16 03:04:13 +0800 <RabMeir> @Texasgalz His lawyers do not appear to be making the same claims that Trump is.  It looks like his lawsuits are getting thrown out.  I will accept the findings of the courts...will you?   https://t.co/FfNU59JGe9
1328049235443539970 2020-11-16 02:56:26 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @brianstelter Thanks for the information, Viva!  If the judge(s) in these cases rule that Biden won the election -- would you concur with their findings?  Or what conclusions would you draw from that?
1328048849160708099 2020-11-16 02:54:54 +0800 <RabMeir> @mpukita Which one?  The guy trying to withhold a vaccine from an entire state because of a personal vendetta?  Agreed.
1328048615240110087 2020-11-16 02:53:58 +0800 <RabMeir> @Texasgalz What gives you that hope?  Why aren't his lawyers making any arguments of actual fraud in court?
1328048473141358593 2020-11-16 02:53:24 +0800 <RabMeir> @WELSH_BOI_69 He just says or does whatever he thinks will trigger the libtards.  Don't give him what he wants, and maybe he will stop.

1328047791147536384 2020-11-16 02:50:42 +0800 <RabMeir> @charliekirk11 Charlie appears to be a conspiracy theorist.  Antifa does not like Joe Biden, because he's an establishment corporate crony.
1328047211763130369 2020-11-16 02:48:23 +0800 <RabMeir> @KelemenCari @w_tanner9 That is intentional.  What do you trust?

1328045212078403585 2020-11-16 02:40:27 +0800 <RabMeir> @DarrenJBeattie What do you advocate as a replacement for democracy?
1328044943399596032 2020-11-16 02:39:23 +0800 <RabMeir> When the Supreme Count stopped the recount, Bush won Florida by 537 votes, a margin of 0.009% in 2000.  Ultimately, Bush won 271 electoral votes.  The country moved on united.  Honest question I am hoping to answer:  What has changed so drastically in the last 20 years?
1328043469995184129 2020-11-16 02:33:31 +0800 <RabMeir> @xotrulyem This is a dangerous ideology that enables awful behavior.

1328041847881666564 2020-11-16 02:27:05 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @brianstelter Viva, can you tell us why Trump's own lawyers are not making these arguments in court?
1328036486109859848 2020-11-16 02:05:46 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog I disagree.  I think they are arrogant and ignorant.  He is proud that he makes no attempt to educate himself on literally every topic he has a strong opinion about.  It's amazing to watch.

1327839470528425986 2020-11-15 13:02:54 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich Trumpy people only want to be sellers in the marketplace of ideas.  They get mad with Fox News for questioning Dear Leader.  Now they are mad at Mikey C for questioning Dear Leader.  SAD.
1327836712194740226 2020-11-15 12:51:56 +0800 <RabMeir> @JennPellegrino @JoeBiden The extreme left hates Joe Biden just as much as George Bush, Clintons, Obama, etc.  You are worked up about a false narrative.  Is that on purpose?
1327836215547228160 2020-11-15 12:49:58 +0800 <RabMeir> @Lauren_Southern Lauren is a great example of things you can read and should not believe.  So in this case, she's being pretty upfront and honest.

1327825182376026112 2020-11-15 12:06:07 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich Of course he won.  Why would that piss off your audience?

1327821648599375872 2020-11-15 11:52:05 +0800 <RabMeir> @lonelyone_000 @TheLaurenChen With the margin of victory in the number of states, this would need to go far beyond some people throwing some ballets in the trash.  The checks and balances around the election make this scenario extremely unlikely at best.
1327665549128687616 2020-11-15 01:31:48 +0800 <RabMeir> @ScottMGreer What's that mean, Scott?
1327663656440573952 2020-11-15 01:24:17 +0800 <RabMeir> @lonelyone_000 @TheLaurenChen If a lawyer lies to a judge on purpose in court, they can lose their license.  So I think a good way to separate all the bluster and rhetoric from the actual things worth investigating is to pay attention to what the lawyers say in court.  They don't want to lose their jobs.

Trump, in fact, could not accept his win in 2016 because he lost the popular vote by about 3 million votes.  So he made all the same claims he is now, formed a committee to investigate it, and what happened from there?  Do you even know?

1327067580721475587 2020-11-13 09:55:41 +0800 <RabMeir> @TruthSkrilla That is showing the abbreviated identifier for each area.  China:Chinatown.  Look at all the rest of it.  Haight Ash:Haight Ashbury.  These are key/value pairs.  Each period is a new record.

1327056465258049538 2020-11-13 09:11:31 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @nytimes @jack @parler @rumblevideo @realDonaldTrump When are you leaving?
1327056236156768256 2020-11-13 09:10:36 +0800 <RabMeir> @the_rocked @joelpollak I agree with you, they made a mistake in framing the investigation as if the only success was provable collusion.  Lots of wrongdoing was found.  Trump has done a good job of surrounding himself with corruption while staying clean himself.  Why is Michael Cohen in jail?
1327055604385521665 2020-11-13 09:08:06 +0800 <RabMeir> @nittimom @jimkeit70598641 @joelpollak Oh really?  Tell me about the investigations into Hilary's e-mail, and the indictments that came out of that.
1327055157641830400 2020-11-13 09:06:19 +0800 <RabMeir> @droberts8944 @joelpollak What other conspiracy theories do you believe in?
1327054788010401793 2020-11-13 09:04:51 +0800 <RabMeir> @Mark49514699 @joelpollak I guess that depends on if you want people like Paul Manafort in positions of power or not.
1326983724467171329 2020-11-13 04:22:28 +0800 <RabMeir> @Lauren_Southern @TheLaurenChen Sounds like @NickJFuentes fans.
1326983537673834497 2020-11-13 04:21:44 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich @Lauren_Southern @TheLaurenChen Is MGTOW just another label for the incel crowd?
1326982478565871616 2020-11-13 04:17:31 +0800 <RabMeir> @EricRWeinstein Hey Eric,  Are you buying into the narrative that the election was rigged by the Democrats?
1326981979133374465 2020-11-13 04:15:32 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei What other conspiracy theories do you currently believe in, Viva?
1326972117536153602 2020-11-13 03:36:21 +0800 <RabMeir> @ScottAdamsSays Imagine fighting Polio and coming out OK, the hard way, under the old treatment plan and prior to the advent of a vaccine.  Your reward is watching everyone else around you not even get Polio, and not even having to think about it.  Not cool.
1326742045831139329 2020-11-12 12:22:08 +0800 <RabMeir> @Liz_Wheeler @2014_judi No.  It was not fine for people to gather and celebrate the Lakers title, Biden's win, or to simp for Trump at his rallies.  No one is making that claim except for the strawmen arguments constantly constructed by conservatives.
1326740779449061377 2020-11-12 12:17:06 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray What race are you, Ian?
1326740576948146183 2020-11-12 12:16:17 +0800 <RabMeir> @oblivious_guy So you guys are pro-slavery?  Anti-black?  Pro-White?  How would you phrase it?
1326740366343680000 2020-11-12 12:15:27 +0800 <RabMeir> @dissidentum Are you an incel?

1326739577781055488 2020-11-12 12:12:19 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich It's November 12th 2020, the date you finally understood what a false equivalency is and pledged to never again partake in whataboutism.
1326739030055202822 2020-11-12 12:10:09 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @YouTube Is that one of your vlogs?  Sounds like an accurate description...
1326738261272899584 2020-11-12 12:07:05 +0800 <RabMeir> @scrowder And when it confirms the result?  Will you cover that?
1326737740034174976 2020-11-12 12:05:01 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei You pretty clearly picked a side a long time ago, for profit.
1326737175069810688 2020-11-12 12:02:46 +0800 <RabMeir> @oblivious_guy So the people producing 2/3rd's of the GDP, which conservatives hold above all else....shouldn't have a proportional say?  What would you propose alternatively, maybe we can just go by the popular vote nation wide?
1326736329875595264 2020-11-12 11:59:25 +0800 <RabMeir> @BrianOC67735616 @RemyMouskewitz @oblivious_guy They got bored?
1326553446384762880 2020-11-11 23:52:42 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich Are you against the cops now?
1326552917504008194 2020-11-11 23:50:36 +0800 <RabMeir> @MrJustinBarclay @Cernovich Election officials in dozens of states from both parties told The New York Times that there was no evidence of voting fraud, amounting to a forceful rebuke of President Trumpâs false narrative.  Are they all in on it guys?
1326551593387393028 2020-11-11 23:45:20 +0800 <RabMeir> @scrowder @tedcruz Steven, you're a big tough Alpha right?  Ted is too?  Why does he simp for a guy who said all that stuff about him and his wife?  Would you do that?
1326550307300503554 2020-11-11 23:40:14 +0800 <RabMeir> @RealWayneRoot According to @MattWalshBlog, depression is just feeling sad -- and all you have to do is not feel sad.  So no big deal right?
1326548486368632836 2020-11-11 23:32:59 +0800 <RabMeir> @KEEMSTAR @TaylorLorenz @dujopp @BrandonTalks @hasanthehun I think it's bad to say anyone "deserves" something horrific to happen to them.  Do you think America created the environment and animus in the middle east that made 9/11 possible?
1326384742955151360 2020-11-11 12:42:20 +0800 <RabMeir> @Weebster89 @stillgray Oh.  I didn't know that.  All good then.
1326384065281466374 2020-11-11 12:39:38 +0800 <RabMeir> @Weebster89 @stillgray So will that be proven in court, or will they get away with it?
1326382832806191104 2020-11-11 12:34:44 +0800 <RabMeir> @Weebster89 @stillgray Why didn't they steal the Senate and House votes too?
1326382227832397824 2020-11-11 12:32:20 +0800 <RabMeir> @Weebster89 @stillgray So we can throw away everything all the reporters say, in favor of your guy in a van.  What if I go film myself in a van calling his claim false, do I win?
1326381640868909057 2020-11-11 12:30:00 +0800 <RabMeir> @Weebster89 @stillgray How many sources do you need vs your 1 guy in a van?   https://t.co/IgnjufYUfT
1326380663965179910 2020-11-11 12:26:07 +0800 <RabMeir> @rhapsaadic @JamesTodaroMD It was rigged.  They stole 3 rings!
1326379838152863750 2020-11-11 12:22:51 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray  https://t.co/aOkEEOs1qV
1326378775827927041 2020-11-11 12:18:37 +0800 <RabMeir> @Djinn_N_Juice Or a guy willing to say some stuff for a 6-figure payday on GoFundMe.  It's definitely one or the other.
1326378602397655042 2020-11-11 12:17:56 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray It's absolutely nothing Ian, like everything else you get triggered about.

Are you guys concerned about the election results?
1326375976150970368 2020-11-11 12:07:30 +0800 <RabMeir> @AudreyMaesmama @MattWalshBlog You are spot on.  Matt not able to understand that other people have a different experience than he does.  If he had any desire to inform himself, he would hold exactly none of the opinions he does now.
1326374453803147270 2020-11-11 12:01:27 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 I believe it's the truth.  He was replacing it with a note that there are no free hand outs, and she needs to pull herself up by her bootstraps.

1326372341543219201 2020-11-11 11:53:03 +0800 <RabMeir> @forevertiffanys Imagine giving this guy money.
1326363730465185797 2020-11-11 11:18:50 +0800 <RabMeir> @JackPosobiec I'm not sure why you guys are just believing all whistleblowers like this.  Obviously he's just lying for fame or jealously.  Plus, look at what Trump was wearing.  He was asking for it.
1326362971568803841 2020-11-11 11:15:49 +0800 <RabMeir> @michaeljknowles Omg, no way!
1326362659210584064 2020-11-11 11:14:35 +0800 <RabMeir> @BicknellAlf @RexHuppke But who is "we"?  Half of your country is immune to facts.
1326362323372679168 2020-11-11 11:13:15 +0800 <RabMeir> @DarrenJBeattie I agree, America is a joke.
1326362165163532288 2020-11-11 11:12:37 +0800 <RabMeir> @byamberphillips @BicknellAlf This was intentional, so they could sow doubt about the results.  Seems to have worked.
1326361846870405120 2020-11-11 11:11:21 +0800 <RabMeir> @wray_cassandra @TopDog8762 Wait what?  How is he still gaining votes?  This is a clear sign of fraud.
1326361578489470978 2020-11-11 11:10:17 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @thebradfordfile @ScottAdamsSays What's going on?
1326357936273289216 2020-11-11 10:55:49 +0800 <RabMeir> @TomiLahren Would you be OK if the government provided all of these IDs to it's citizens free of charge?
1326312248827121664 2020-11-11 07:54:16 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Hey Ian, can we take your newfound empathy for biological females, and apply it in any other areas?
1326003508546514944 2020-11-10 11:27:27 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei do you ever do any debates?  I would think a lawyer would have this skill in spades.
1326002512957206528 2020-11-10 11:23:29 +0800 <RabMeir> @JackPosobiec What is the reason, Jack?
1326002431050866688 2020-11-10 11:23:10 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray The party that wants to help the Dreamers and let the kids out of the cages is the party of hate.  Great take.
1325999843022671872 2020-11-10 11:12:53 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray You could run in that category and absolutely DESTROY her!
1325998421103300610 2020-11-10 11:07:14 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @FoxNews @AP Move on bud.
1325998268506050560 2020-11-10 11:06:37 +0800 <RabMeir> @RoryGoebbels @Nature_and_Race I don't think that is true at all, and if you wanted to press reset -- do some research into both arguments and form your opinion -- you would agree with me.  I think you have problems with other races, or a sense of superiority about your own race that you should explore openly.
1325997536990154752 2020-11-10 11:03:43 +0800 <RabMeir> @BicknellAlf @thevivafrei @PeteButtigieg The checks and balances in place to double check, recount, audit, challenge, etc. ensure it won't happen.  Republican officials in Philly have said they were able to observe.  All evidence will be ignored by these people.  Viva does it for money.  He knows it's dumb.
1325996740101726208 2020-11-10 11:00:33 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheAethernaut @MattWalshBlog Matt is a professional contrarian.  I think his tweet here signals that deep down he knows there is intrinsic value and objective truth to be found in the pro mac &amp; cheese ideology.
1325996300005937154 2020-11-10 10:58:48 +0800 <RabMeir> @Nature_and_Race Is @scrowder's little red wagon one of them?  That is the one that convinced me.
1325996015338610690 2020-11-10 10:57:40 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray The hero we need.  Finally.
1325995738720055297 2020-11-10 10:56:34 +0800 <RabMeir> @BicknellAlf @thevivafrei @PeteButtigieg Trump lost the popular vote in 2016, claimed fraud, formed a committee to investigate, found nothing.  This is Q Anon level of conspiracy.
1325995426013700098 2020-11-10 10:55:20 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheLaurenChen What did his 2016 committee that looked into vote fraud find?  The conspirators didn't bother to rig the House and Senate votes?  Seems lazy.  If you're going to pull off a world class Ocean's 11 style heist, go all the way.
1325994921728372737 2020-11-10 10:53:19 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @PeteButtigieg What do you think they will find, Viva?
1325658841774776321 2020-11-09 12:37:52 +0800 <RabMeir> @RoryGoebbels @Nature_and_Race Just did.  Men and women of all colors on there.  You're making the 13/50 point as most of you do.  So do you think that some races are more likely to be criminals due to their genetics?
1325657864288038914 2020-11-09 12:33:59 +0800 <RabMeir> @inthepeopleskey @TechTheLegend @MattWalshBlog Sure.  Scroll down on his Twitter feed.
1325654721131139072 2020-11-09 12:21:29 +0800 <RabMeir> @RoryGoebbels @Nature_and_Race Wait what?  It sounds like you are saying that only immigrants commit crimes.
1325654180057505792 2020-11-09 12:19:20 +0800 <RabMeir> @Washington76v2 @thevivafrei @Cernovich Well Occam's Razor would lead me to conclude it is what people call a "mistake".  What did you come up with?
1325653180458393600 2020-11-09 12:15:22 +0800 <RabMeir> @RichHiggins_DC Are you a serious person?
1325652666727477253 2020-11-09 12:13:19 +0800 <RabMeir> @JLPtalk Good one.
1325651964970065920 2020-11-09 12:10:32 +0800 <RabMeir> @RoryGoebbels @Nature_and_Race Can you explain the loss of social capital and quality of life loss to me?  I missed that part.
1325651671410675713 2020-11-09 12:09:22 +0800 <RabMeir> @RealWayneRoot @realDonaldTrump This is hilarious.  Surely you don't think that is real.
1325650080930680835 2020-11-09 12:03:03 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @Cernovich Guys, help me on this one.  What does this prove, in your minds?
1325649011802562562 2020-11-09 11:58:48 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Giving people healthcare like other developed nations is extremist to Ian.
1325643977354317825 2020-11-09 11:38:48 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich Help us normies out.  What does this show us?
1325643821695295489 2020-11-09 11:38:11 +0800 <RabMeir> @RoryGoebbels @Nature_and_Race Yes, I have noticed this.  Canada actually has a pretty strict, merit-based immigration policy.  Immigration is also critical for the growth and sustainability of our economy.  In short, it's a positive thing for a country like Canada.
1325642002336243712 2020-11-09 11:30:57 +0800 <RabMeir> @ScottMGreer Trump gutted the entire government at every level.
1325641447681499142 2020-11-09 11:28:45 +0800 <RabMeir> @JustinARed @AlissaWalsh21 You give me hope!  I think the USA needs at least 4 political parties.  One for groypers and Q Anons.  One for the Mitt Romneys.  One for the Joe Bidens.  One for the Bernie/AOC crowd.
1325640896554143745 2020-11-09 11:26:33 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Take a look at the "Atlantic Bubble" in Canada, and tell me this can't be done properly.
1325640194578649089 2020-11-09 11:23:46 +0800 <RabMeir> @JustinARed @AlissaWalsh21 That sounds reasonable.  Hopefully if no evidence is presented, the MAGA crowd will all feel the way you do and let it go.
1325639815216439296 2020-11-09 11:22:15 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei So is a mirage.
1325639668877176832 2020-11-09 11:21:40 +0800 <RabMeir> @JustinARed @AlissaWalsh21 Let us suppose that all of that occurred.  Seems like something easy to catch, right?  Like there is no way for that to have happened on such a scale without getting caught.  Right?  Elections have a LOT of checks and balances to prevent this.
1325639120362856448 2020-11-09 11:19:30 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Can some of you Q-Anon types help me out here, what does this mean for you guys?  Is it proof of something?  Redpill me.
1325638866037043201 2020-11-09 11:18:29 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich Of course.  Trump does everything like a dickhead though.  Because he is a dickhead.
1325638298644123648 2020-11-09 11:16:14 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 Antifa is still protesting and making it very clear they do not like Biden.  Perhaps the entire left of center side of politics is not controlled by a single hive mind after all?
1325637857260818433 2020-11-09 11:14:28 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 If you had to guess, what do you think they will find?  Remember he did this in 2016 because he lost the pop vote, formed a committee, and found nothing.
1325637429546639361 2020-11-09 11:12:47 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Hey Matt,  What is your suggestion on how to handle Covid?
1325636501271666688 2020-11-09 11:09:05 +0800 <RabMeir> @TechTheLegend @MattWalshBlog You don't think Matt is consistently a bully to trans people?
1325636263899181056 2020-11-09 11:08:09 +0800 <RabMeir> @scrubsfan10 @joelpollak Did Joel block you?  He blocked me.  These guys all seem to have very thin skin.
1325636129677307904 2020-11-09 11:07:37 +0800 <RabMeir> @ThunderStorm209 @MattWalshBlog I can think of a much worse sin that was committed by the Catholic Church over the span of decades...  I think they have officially forfeited their moral authority.
1325635774688194560 2020-11-09 11:06:12 +0800 <RabMeir> @HamSandwich27 @GHOSTKICKZ @thevivafrei @benshapiro I am certain you can find a few examples of mistakes.  I am equally certain you can not find any cases of corradiated conspiracy to steal the election.
1325635349553541120 2020-11-09 11:04:31 +0800 <RabMeir> @BinkoStinko @TendiesB @TheQuartering Wow.  I appreciate that.  Not often you see that happen on here.

1325598145825345536 2020-11-09 08:36:41 +0800 <RabMeir> @BinkoStinko @TendiesB @TheQuartering Just watch more than 18 seconds of the exact conversation you're upset about.  He was comparing to child sweat shops to CP and saying we should be equally upset by all forms of child exploitation.  Quite a bit different than saying he's OK with it, wouldn't you say?
1325597457833730048 2020-11-09 08:33:57 +0800 <RabMeir> @bbusa617 @TopDog8762 @FoxNews @JoeBiden What a twist!
1325597120372617217 2020-11-09 08:32:36 +0800 <RabMeir> @BinkoStinko @TendiesB @TheQuartering Vaush does not support child porn.  Saying it over and over doesn't make it true.  Sorry about that.
1325596791409094662 2020-11-09 08:31:18 +0800 <RabMeir> @HamSandwich27 @GHOSTKICKZ @thevivafrei @benshapiro They asked them to set the votes aside, to ensure they can be validated.  Validating something does not mean they suspect fraud.  Was there any fraud in 2000?  What about 2016?  What about in 2020 in the House and Senate voting?
1325596049843564547 2020-11-09 08:28:21 +0800 <RabMeir> @HamSandwich27 @GHOSTKICKZ @thevivafrei @benshapiro With all the checks and balances around a federal election, it is a major conspiracy theory to imply large-scale cheating.  Trump made all the same complaints in 2016, formed a committee to investigate...and found nothing.  They will find nothing again.  Then what will you say?
1325595615447949313 2020-11-09 08:26:37 +0800 <RabMeir> @TendiesB @TheQuartering Well if you listen to what he actually said in the full clip, you would know he was making a point about all forms of child exploitation.  Which he is against.  This reminds me of the fine people "hoax" that gets your side so upset...
1325594744160972802 2020-11-09 08:23:10 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray @DonaldJTrumpJr Right, we need to get the truth from people with the last name Trump.  That makes a lot of sense.
1325594448244469761 2020-11-09 08:21:59 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheQuartering You are making false accusations.
1325593938099630080 2020-11-09 08:19:57 +0800 <RabMeir> @ScottMGreer A search of public records revealed a man named William Bradley was born in March 1902 and died in I984 in Michigan's Wayne County. But public records also show that his son, also named William Bradley and living at the same address, is very much alive -- and a voter.
1325593557621731330 2020-11-09 08:18:27 +0800 <RabMeir> @RoryGoebbels @Nature_and_Race How so?
1325592862130581505 2020-11-09 08:15:41 +0800 <RabMeir> @oblivious_guy You need at least 4 political parties, and a system more like Canada's.  You'll continue to be a polarized and paralyzed nation until you fix the root cause.
1325592311112347649 2020-11-09 08:13:29 +0800 <RabMeir> @ThunderStorm209 @MattWalshBlog It is kind of crazy.  He is obsessed with trans people, but refuses to spend even 10 minutes trying to learn or understand anything about them.
1325591346938343426 2020-11-09 08:09:40 +0800 <RabMeir> @GHOSTKICKZ @thevivafrei @benshapiro In what sense?
1325589637084090370 2020-11-09 08:02:52 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @benshapiro You're a conspiracy theorist.
1325589541688897536 2020-11-09 08:02:29 +0800 <RabMeir> @ThunderStorm209 @MattWalshBlog He is paid to whine and cry, so I doubt it.
1325587736594698241 2020-11-09 07:55:19 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei Have you seen all the posts about "I hate riggers" with the memes?  Wonder what that is about?
1325574888317390848 2020-11-09 07:04:16 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Because he isn't.  You have a large following, and you seem completely incapable of holding consistent positions or telling the truth.
1325574558997426183 2020-11-09 07:02:57 +0800 <RabMeir> @joelpollak This tweet is a wet fart.  Try again.
1325574373252665344 2020-11-09 07:02:13 +0800 <RabMeir> @DonaldJTrumpJr It's accepted fact by all intelligence agencies that Russia ran a campaign to influence the American election in 2016.  No serious claims were made that they "rigged" it.  Your dad tried to prove fraud in 2016, and found nothing.  You'll find nothing again this time.  Sore loser.
1325573096691085312 2020-11-09 06:57:08 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Are you denying that you're a troll, or that you do it professionally?
1325572998976434176 2020-11-09 06:56:45 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Matt, what Parker says here is 100% provable and true.  You bully trans people on Twitter on a regular and consistent basis.  For profit.
1325540916069883909 2020-11-09 04:49:16 +0800 <RabMeir> @RebsBrannon @stillgray Are you familiar with logic and reason?  1 bad person wrote something bad.  That is all this picture shows.
1325540656786382848 2020-11-09 04:48:14 +0800 <RabMeir> @joelpollak What do you think the USA should do about Covid, Joel?
1325540531565457408 2020-11-09 04:47:44 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray We can all unify around the objective truth that Trump is an awful human being and the world is better now with him no longer in the control of the USA.  Right Ian?
1325538318810042370 2020-11-09 04:38:57 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Do you think you, and people like you, are helping or hurting this cause?
1325332134425407489 2020-11-08 14:59:38 +0800 <RabMeir> @RemyMouskewitz @oblivious_guy The countries that replaced their population's wages did well, such as Canada.  The ones that did not, such as America, have not done as well.
1325296709837205507 2020-11-08 12:38:53 +0800 <RabMeir> @oblivious_guy Definitely implied it.  Why would you not take a vaccine for a once in a century virus that has caused worldwide destruction if it passes all regulation safety precautions?
1325294568854736901 2020-11-08 12:30:22 +0800 <RabMeir> @oblivious_guy You are smarter than Bill Gates?
1325292207469899779 2020-11-08 12:20:59 +0800 <RabMeir> @Chronolxgical @stillgray Your follow list is pretty clean, Ian stands out as a total moron when looking at the rest.  You don't take him seriously, do you?
1325291873863409667 2020-11-08 12:19:40 +0800 <RabMeir> @RodentStill What is Tucker Carlson?
1325291746180390922 2020-11-08 12:19:09 +0800 <RabMeir> @Chronolxgical @stillgray That doesn't make sense.
1325291456366567426 2020-11-08 12:18:00 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Got to bed Ian.
1325291196881768454 2020-11-08 12:16:58 +0800 <RabMeir> @RodentStill What is he?
1325290609041608705 2020-11-08 12:14:38 +0800 <RabMeir> @oblivious_guy @realDonaldTrump Lol.  Sorry man, grab a cookie, dip it in some milk, and have a sleep.
1325290396478529536 2020-11-08 12:13:47 +0800 <RabMeir> @BrockBizzell Can you name 1 city that has been burned to the ground in the USA?
1325289841886715905 2020-11-08 12:11:35 +0800 <RabMeir> @NickJFuentes No one cares.  You pick your nose and eat the boogies.
1325289145036648448 2020-11-08 12:08:49 +0800 <RabMeir> @MichaelCoudrey Which one?  Zeus or Poseidon?
1325288991210541058 2020-11-08 12:08:12 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray They shouldn't.
1325288906821144577 2020-11-08 12:07:52 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @JoeBiden Because his son got a foot job?  Grab a blankie and a stuffie and try to get some rest little guy.
1325286741016776704 2020-11-08 11:59:16 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @Timcast Sweet, delete your account then.

So what is different here is that all of the other ones have been white, so there isn't much need to celebrate another white one.  Can you see the difference?  If not, get some rest, and try again tomorrow.  Repeat.
1325124008191414273 2020-11-08 01:12:37 +0800 <RabMeir> @realDonaldTrump YOU'RE FIRED!  https://t.co/C2Lnf8gyuM

1324914833721073666 2020-11-07 11:21:26 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 @benshapiro @MattWalshBlog He's a p-word.
1324820409133486092 2020-11-07 05:06:14 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei So Trump is behaving right now as you would expect any other President to act?
1324816715386146817 2020-11-07 04:51:33 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @realDonaldTrump (mis)information.  That's the key part you missed there Viva.
1324812181968400385 2020-11-07 04:33:32 +0800 <RabMeir> @SophiaAeon @Nature_and_Race hahahahahahaha  It sounds like the real QUESTION you have is the Jewish one....
1324811793156448258 2020-11-07 04:31:59 +0800 <RabMeir> @SophiaAeon @Nature_and_Race I don't think they have a hive mind and all behave the same any more than any other group.  Your original point seems reversed.  You're just blaming Jews for the fact that you dislike Jews.
1324779693699145735 2020-11-07 02:24:26 +0800 <RabMeir> @oblivious_guy One filled with Groypers?

1324777797282336769 2020-11-07 02:16:54 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox I lived just outside Detroit for 11 years.  Good areas and bad areas, like every single city in America, and likely the world.

1324777058564775938 2020-11-07 02:13:58 +0800 <RabMeir> @MrHappyBalls1 @RubinReport That's a good point.  My problem is that Dave is in the top 3 of the most dishonest people I've seen across all content creators.  Probably top 1 most stupid.

1324774045662040066 2020-11-07 02:02:00 +0800 <RabMeir> @MrHappyBalls1 @RubinReport He blocked me like the pussy that he is.  Hopefully Trump grabs him.
1324773845920849920 2020-11-07 02:01:12 +0800 <RabMeir> @drefanzor @TrumpJew No, they are banning everyone who is posting nonsense that masquerades as evidence of a grand and impossible conspiracy.  Make an honest attempt to understand what it would take to rig a federal election, and then get some rest.
1324773367656886272 2020-11-07 01:59:18 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray You are sleep deprived.  Log off.
1324773168507199494 2020-11-07 01:58:31 +0800 <RabMeir> @RubinReport Be proactive and delete your account now Dave.  Please.
1324772987527139328 2020-11-07 01:57:47 +0800 <RabMeir> @drefanzor @TrumpJew Do you think a screenshot of JSON data proves anything?  It proves someone knows how to type and use the printscreen and paste features.  Try to be a serious person.
1324772133294215168 2020-11-07 01:54:24 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox Detroit's corporation counsel (principal attorney), Lawrence Garcia, said there were approximately 225 Republican poll challengers in the facility on Wednesday, along with 256 Democrats and 76 independents, Grayer reported.

1324736996363874306 2020-11-06 23:34:47 +0800 <RabMeir> @joelpollak Because he was voted out?

The conflict resulted in the displacement of over 300,000 people and has caused the death of more than 70 civilians in Syria and 20 civilians in Turkey. Human rights violations have also been reported.

1324206028779622400 2020-11-05 12:24:54 +0800 <RabMeir> @CaptOmaru @Nature_and_Race Harvard's endowment is 41.9 billion USD.  Blacks have 10% the net worth of whites on average in America.  You aren't being honest.
1324205549920071681 2020-11-05 12:23:00 +0800 <RabMeir> @SophiaAeon @Nature_and_Race Well I would have to point out that this is published on Russia Insider, and says things like "establishment historians".  So I think I would need to take it with some grains of salt without reading more about it.  Bolsheviks were far-left radicals.  That guy was executed.

1324201252792733697 2020-11-05 12:05:55 +0800 <RabMeir> @CaptOmaru @Nature_and_Race Who gives black people money just for being black?  How does that work?
1324200231085506560 2020-11-05 12:01:52 +0800 <RabMeir> @jimkeit70598641 @joelpollak Starts here and gets much worse:  https://t.co/IranYqKqyZ  So why wouldn't Trump ever admit that Russian meddled in 2016?  Or show any concern at all that they did?  Despite his own intelligence agencies all concluding they did.  You tell us.
1324199396200861697 2020-11-05 11:58:33 +0800 <RabMeir> @CaptOmaru @Nature_and_Race I appreciate that we are having honest conversation now.  Let's continue that.  Do you think that in 2020 -- whites are still suffering from the effects of the Ottomans and Mongols in a comparable way to how blacks are suffering the effects of slavery and Jim Crow?
1324198522497937410 2020-11-05 11:55:04 +0800 <RabMeir> @jimkeit70598641 @joelpollak If you can look at all of the connections between Russia and the Trump campaign/administration and see nothing, then you're blind.  Or perhaps have your back turned.  I can't fix that for you.

1324197828600729600 2020-11-05 11:52:19 +0800 <RabMeir> @CaptOmaru @Nature_and_Race I guess it's more accurate, but again completely ignores reality.  The historical treatment of blacks and gays can not be compared to whites and straights, in any capacity.  It's quite clear what you are.
1324197327695990784 2020-11-05 11:50:19 +0800 <RabMeir> @jimkeit70598641 @joelpollak If you can look at all of the connections between Russia and the Trump campaign/administration and see nothing, then you're blind.  Imagine if Mike Flynn worked for Obama and did the same thing?  Come on man.
1324196175612968961 2020-11-05 11:45:45 +0800 <RabMeir> @CaptOmaru @Nature_and_Race No, I am responding directly to your argument while you commit logical fallacies.  In your latest tweet, you are making a false equivalency of epic proportion.
1324195908171554816 2020-11-05 11:44:41 +0800 <RabMeir> @SophiaAeon @Nature_and_Race I'd like to read more about this man.  Aside from that poster made in MS Paint, any sources on him?
1324194358803968001 2020-11-05 11:38:32 +0800 <RabMeir> @CaptOmaru @Nature_and_Race You're looking at this issue in a vacuum, trying to pretend the past 2 centuries did not happen.  It is not honest.  You're saying that straight people have suffered the same persecution as gay people.  That is an absurd claim.  So why would you make it?
1324193263327260672 2020-11-05 11:34:10 +0800 <RabMeir> @DonaldJTrumpJr Preparing for your Dad's trial big guy.
1324193036046393345 2020-11-05 11:33:16 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich A real alpha male.
1324192823999107073 2020-11-05 11:32:26 +0800 <RabMeir> @CaptOmaru @Nature_and_Race But that is nonsense, because being straight was never illegal.  It did not exclude you from society.  You're not being honest.  So that makes me ask why that is.  I think I know the answer, the real question is -- do you?
1324191894700699654 2020-11-05 11:28:44 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Maybe ask what a woman is again.  That's always a good one.
1324191198110797824 2020-11-05 11:25:58 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 @MattWalshBlog It's just another tweet asking what a woman is, don't get too excited.
1324190990438195200 2020-11-05 11:25:09 +0800 <RabMeir> @CaptOmaru @Nature_and_Race Ya, it happens in prison too.  Gay and straight people alike.   That is not any sort of argument.  LGBT people are much more likely to be victims of sexual abuse than perpetrators of it.  Trying to deny that gay people have been historically mistreated is very dishonest.
1324189835763089408 2020-11-05 11:20:33 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Time for bed little fella.  Get some rest.  It will be OK.
1324188206649249792 2020-11-05 11:14:05 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich This is incredible.  Yes, Fox News has not done enough for Donald Trump.  Spot on.

1324187651055013888 2020-11-05 11:11:52 +0800 <RabMeir> @CaptOmaru @Nature_and_Race This is logically invalid.  Was being straight ever illegal?  I suggest you read up on Alan Turing.  Great story.  Good movie too.   https://t.co/aF4uM6ngQh
1324183336303153153 2020-11-05 10:54:44 +0800 <RabMeir> @RoryGoebbels @Nature_and_Race Just that it would make your list next to the other items.

1324182662148509696 2020-11-05 10:52:03 +0800 <RabMeir> @CaptOmaru @Nature_and_Race See I think you're just confused.  BLM does not mean white lives don't matter.  Not a 0-sum game.  Straight pride is different from Gay pride because straight people have not suffered as a minority for generations.  Do you think what happened to people like Alan Turing was OK?
1324180778083848192 2020-11-05 10:44:34 +0800 <RabMeir> @RoryGoebbels @Nature_and_Race And #4 was so awful, you couldn't even mention it!  Circumcision being on the list is pretty funny.  I like it.  Just degeneracy in general?  Or anything specific?
1324180490769829889 2020-11-05 10:43:25 +0800 <RabMeir> @CaptOmaru @Nature_and_Race Then I suspect I can't make you see the difference.  Do you see any issue with "Straight Pride"?
1324179926799519744 2020-11-05 10:41:11 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 Come on!  What are you then?
1324179695055835141 2020-11-05 10:40:16 +0800 <RabMeir> @SkullsAndBones0 @RoryGoebbels @Nature_and_Race Well, I'm not sure it's true.  If it is, I'm not sure what you think it proves.
1324179286614511616 2020-11-05 10:38:38 +0800 <RabMeir> @CaptOmaru @Nature_and_Race You don't see any difference there, huh?
1324179177910767616 2020-11-05 10:38:12 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV Why do they want to blackmail scientists?
1324178431509209089 2020-11-05 10:35:14 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV Ok, well that's good at least.  He is definitely crazy.
1324178260180295680 2020-11-05 10:34:33 +0800 <RabMeir> @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump Hopefully he can fight off the guys in jail...
1324177836039675906 2020-11-05 10:32:52 +0800 <RabMeir> @SkullsAndBones0 @RoryGoebbels @Nature_and_Race Holy crap.  Well at the very least, you can say they got a lot of stuff done!
1324177597467627522 2020-11-05 10:31:55 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 @michaeljknowles This guy DEFINITELY did not win!  https://t.co/ZCg4WmYLei
1324177104372715521 2020-11-05 10:29:58 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV That's some Q-Anon level stuff.  You are very far down the rabbit hole.  You like Alex Jones?
1324176247300173824 2020-11-05 10:26:34 +0800 <RabMeir> @liquidlaugh @TopDog8762 Let's see 1.
1324175689730371585 2020-11-05 10:24:21 +0800 <RabMeir> @michaeljknowles It'll be OK Michael.  Have a bowl of cereal or something.
1324175554300551176 2020-11-05 10:23:48 +0800 <RabMeir> @RoryGoebbels @Nature_and_Race Awww come on.  Give me a few bullet points.  Or try a thread.  I'm here all night.
1324175438764220417 2020-11-05 10:23:21 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV I mean, maybe?  Still reeling from the fact a Catholic is trying to claim that because some pedophiles were Jews...all Jews are pedophiles.  That defies the basic rules of logic.  Meanwhile the institution of your church systemically covered up abuse by priests.  For decades.
1324174674981490690 2020-11-05 10:20:19 +0800 <RabMeir> @RoryGoebbels @Nature_and_Race Oh.  What is it?
1324174559340355587 2020-11-05 10:19:51 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV LOL!  Come on man.  Your actual church, at EVERY level, concealed this stuff for DECADES.  Fuck outta here.
1324174369682345985 2020-11-05 10:19:06 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV Holy cow!  Can we do Catholics next?  Have you ever heard of the "Catholic Church"?
1324174170465460224 2020-11-05 10:18:18 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Looks like 69 was the 2nd most popular.  Master trolling by the conspirators.
1324173881700208640 2020-11-05 10:17:10 +0800 <RabMeir> @Nature_and_Race Do you have something against Jewish people?
1324173783683551233 2020-11-05 10:16:46 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 Isn't it awesome!  You getting ready to party it looks like!!!
1324173672215650304 2020-11-05 10:16:20 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @brianstelter What is CNN covering up Viva?  Tell us.
1324172650751631362 2020-11-05 10:12:16 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV I did not do that.  And don't you think it's impossible to say that 1 group of any faith all act precisely the same way?  Are you a Christian?
1324172174513573888 2020-11-05 10:10:22 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV I am.  Is that OK?
1324171927276212224 2020-11-05 10:09:24 +0800 <RabMeir> @ElijahSchaffer @stillgray Like Chris Rock said, Tupac and Biggie were assassinated.
1324171572094140416 2020-11-05 10:07:59 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV Are you?
1324171384570978306 2020-11-05 10:07:14 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV Is it a problem for you if I am?
1324171297560158210 2020-11-05 10:06:53 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV Yikes.  Well dude, I hope you find your way out of that garbage some day.
1324171123064557570 2020-11-05 10:06:12 +0800 <RabMeir> @RealJamesWoods That's one fat ass, lazy, motherfuckin' lion.
1324171013492531202 2020-11-05 10:05:46 +0800 <RabMeir> @JamesOKeefeIII @JackPosobiec @Project_Veritas @USPS BOMBSHELL:  Alex Jones to release whistleblower allegations from within the Lizard Person HQ.  Any second now!
1324170776220782592 2020-11-05 10:04:49 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich Because votes are being counted?
1324170701356572672 2020-11-05 10:04:31 +0800 <RabMeir> @TomiLahren If....votes were being counted?  Are you OK Tomi?
1324170183389401089 2020-11-05 10:02:28 +0800 <RabMeir> @TomiLahren Conservatives never want everyone to vote.  Why is that I wonder?
1324169979273617408 2020-11-05 10:01:39 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV Is it really?  See, I've watched Nick's stuff.  Are you a "groyper"?  You really sound like one.
1324169017897213958 2020-11-05 09:57:50 +0800 <RabMeir> @jimkeit70598641 @joelpollak So because their was no absolute proof of collusion, in your mind that invalidates all of the charges, indictments and impropriety that was found?  And that logic holds up to scrutiny for you guys?  I think perhaps you're believing only what you want to.
1324168098027610113 2020-11-05 09:54:11 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV So you don't like gays, or Jewish people?  That's so unique for fans of Nick.  How do you feel about black people.  Don't hold back.  Let it out.
1324167145350139906 2020-11-05 09:50:23 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV I don't do that.  You seem deranged.  Do you have Biden Derangement Syndrome?  #BDS
1324166929561591808 2020-11-05 09:49:32 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Are you aware of how many protections are in place to protect against actual fraud?  And how little has ever actually been found, despite several attempts by conservatives.  Trump ordered investigation into 2016 because of the popular vote.  What did they find?
1324166586652102661 2020-11-05 09:48:10 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV Wow, that's a lot of murder.  Lol @ liking your own tweet also.
1324166291196944386 2020-11-05 09:47:00 +0800 <RabMeir> @joelpollak And your retort is the usual one from you guys when faced with the facts.  I am aware of the "deep state lawyer".  I agree that they made an error in setting the bar at "collusion".  But that does not invalidate everything they found. Do you have any concern about what was found?
1324165541611905024 2020-11-05 09:44:01 +0800 <RabMeir> @Nature_and_Race It benefits all people, every single person who lives on, or will live on the earth.  How does putting all your energy into White Supremacy benefit you?  I'm failing to understand that concept.
1324157975196479488 2020-11-05 09:13:57 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV I don't and have not defended pedophiles.  What else do you think should be resolved with capital punishment?
1324156698588831744 2020-11-05 09:08:53 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV Disturbing.  I find a lot of Nick's fans are very disturbed, and say awful stuff like this.  If you won't listen to the man's own words, let's play your game instead!  What do you think society should do with people attracted to kids?  It's a real and hideous problem.
1324155684787757057 2020-11-05 09:04:51 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV That's really gross.  It's such a weird go-to smear you guys love to throw around to deflect.  Why is that?
1324155456038776833 2020-11-05 09:03:56 +0800 <RabMeir> @joelpollak A total of thirty-four individuals and three companies were indicted by Mueller's investigators. Eight have pleaded guilty to or been convicted of felonies, including five Trump associates and campaign officials.
1324155044653076480 2020-11-05 09:02:18 +0800 <RabMeir> @BruhFvckJack @NickJFuentes @VaushV He doesn't, and has addressed that one several times at length.  I know you guys are triggered by the way he keeps slaughtering you over and over and over, but let's keep it 100.
1324139621366812673 2020-11-05 08:01:01 +0800 <RabMeir> @Nature_and_Race Examples of what?  Is the Lochness Monster there?  What are you showing us?
1324139137990070272 2020-11-05 07:59:06 +0800 <RabMeir> @NickJFuentes @VaushV check out this guy!
1324138727384453123 2020-11-05 07:57:28 +0800 <RabMeir> @realDonaldTrump @NickJFuentes Trump repeats his lies over and over with the belief that the more he tells them the more people will believe them. We all wish heâd just shut up, but the problem is he wonât.â
1324138681515581440 2020-11-05 07:57:17 +0800 <RabMeir> @realDonaldTrump @NickJFuentes and they cheated with votes from dead people and people who werenât born yet. Heâll tell all sorts of lies and activate his militias. Itâs going to be a pathetic show. But, by stacking the Supreme Court, heâll think he can get an injunction.
1324138575303200768 2020-11-05 07:56:52 +0800 <RabMeir> @realDonaldTrump @NickJFuentes Cohen is so certain that Trump will lose that he recently placed a ten-thousand-dollar bet on it. âHeâll blame everyone except for himself,â Cohen said. âEvery day, heâll rant and rave and yell and scream about how they stole the Presidency from him. Heâll say he won by millions.

1324135425154469888 2020-11-05 07:44:21 +0800 <RabMeir> @realDonaldTrump @NickJFuentes Log off, go upstairs and hug your mommy Nick.  It will be OK.

1324130365846528002 2020-11-05 07:24:15 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Oh, Conservative Twitter is collectively losing what's left of their minds.  Turning into Q-Anon all at the same time.  Tweeting pictures of random objects and typos as proof that Lizard People faked the moon landing.  That kind of thing.  How did you miss it?
1324129665024405508 2020-11-05 07:21:27 +0800 <RabMeir> He finally built the wall.

1324086435285262337 2020-11-05 04:29:41 +0800 <RabMeir> @scrowder That's probably just because you're wearing pajamas bro.

1324085811395125254 2020-11-05 04:27:12 +0800 <RabMeir> @Nature_and_Race With all of the recounts, audits, etc. that will go on here -- just begin to imagine the level of conspiracy to do what you're saying here.  It's beyond 9/11.  You're into Q-Anon level nonsense.  Read more things.  Escape your fringe lunatic bubble.
1324084599526404101 2020-11-05 04:22:23 +0800 <RabMeir> @scrowder Holy shit.  Places.  With stuff in them.

1324082732830515200 2020-11-05 04:14:58 +0800 <RabMeir> @NickJFuentes Aw poor melting low-T snowflake has run out of soy and feels a sad.
1324082585547558918 2020-11-05 04:14:23 +0800 <RabMeir> @scrowder If there is anyone we can trust to report honestly on this, it's @scrowder.  Maybe you can bring Alex Jones along!
1324082080955932673 2020-11-05 04:12:23 +0800 <RabMeir> @TomFitton @TopDog8762 @Twitter @realDonaldTrump I feel like something is interfering with your ability to think critically.
1324080689399189517 2020-11-05 04:06:51 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheLaurenChen Is this why you call it "pseudo" intellectual?  So far, 5 people like your strawman.
1324080061499297792 2020-11-05 04:04:21 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Are you guys remembering to breathe?  Is oxygen reaching your brains?  What is 1.4 + 1.6?
1324079330058752001 2020-11-05 04:01:27 +0800 <RabMeir> @RealCandaceO Maybe you and @charliekirk11 can explain why this doesn't make you cry fraud and conspiracy but when the reverse happens, it does?
1324066002448113677 2020-11-05 03:08:29 +0800 <RabMeir> @themostafasaad @TheLaurenChen I did not say or imply that the only thing good about Canada was the healthcare system.  Canada is objectively one of the best places to live on earth, for a lot of reasons.
1324062886755524608 2020-11-05 02:56:06 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheLaurenChen No, but I think it's a point of pride.  It is not perfect and I feel empathy for your situation, when taken on the whole for every citizen we are far ahead of the United States.  I think that matters.  You can find individual situations that confirm/deny when viewed in a vacuum.
1324061786702778371 2020-11-05 02:51:44 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Why is that, Matt?  Be honest.
1324060839482134528 2020-11-05 02:47:58 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheLaurenChen Didn't you just go on a campaign to undermine our healthcare system?
1324059784677629959 2020-11-05 02:43:47 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray That's because you're an idiot.
1324059482746441729 2020-11-05 02:42:35 +0800 <RabMeir> @joelpollak @BreitbartNews Yes, he pandered to Zionists.  What's your point?
1324059092957175815 2020-11-05 02:41:02 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 LOL indeed!  "This guy peddles reactionary falsehoods without ever challenging his opinions, and some people dislike that!  Come hear more nonsense and fear-mongering for 25% off!!!"
1324057870921551873 2020-11-05 02:36:10 +0800 <RabMeir> @GDFilms12 @luizandre9x2 @TheLiamDonovan @TheLaurenChen @MattWalshBlog I was referring mostly to the fact there is a federal standard, and it is not left up to each state or county to decide the timing and process.  I appreciate you adding the additional context.  State rights are used as a blanket defense for all sorts of malevolent purposes.
1324057073743732736 2020-11-05 02:33:00 +0800 <RabMeir> @RubinReport Yes Dave, because you're an absolute grifter who seeks to exacerbate the current polarization for cash.  Change my mind.
1324056685447663616 2020-11-05 02:31:28 +0800 <RabMeir> @PhoeniX_TTG LOL!
1324045213875245056 2020-11-05 01:45:53 +0800 <RabMeir> @PhoeniX_TTG @luizandre9x2 @TheLiamDonovan @TheLaurenChen @MattWalshBlog Serious question, do you consider Alex Jones to be a reliable source?

If that is the standard of proof, then I can "prove" basically anything to you as well.
1324044445055176706 2020-11-05 01:42:49 +0800 <RabMeir> @PhoeniX_TTG @luizandre9x2 @TheLiamDonovan @TheLaurenChen @MattWalshBlog Project Veritas has an agenda, that's obvious.  If you can only cite them as a source, then I'm afraid that is not proof of anything.  I can find lots of YouTube videos about Big Foot.  Giving the benefit of the doubt, assuming it's true, where is the corroborating evidence?
1324043897505566720 2020-11-05 01:40:39 +0800 <RabMeir> @PhoeniX_TTG @luizandre9x2 @TheLiamDonovan @TheLaurenChen @MattWalshBlog Um, that title says that James O'Keefe alleges fraud with scant evidence.  James O'Keefe isn't exactly a reliable source.  But let's assume he is correct, then there would have to be several other sources that can corroborate his claims?
1324043369161654273 2020-11-05 01:38:33 +0800 <RabMeir> @luizandre9x2 @PhoeniX_TTG @TheLiamDonovan @TheLaurenChen @MattWalshBlog I wonder what it was about him that caused that level of division?  Anything unique about him vs the previous 43 Presidents?  I wonder if there was anyone who took advantage of that difference to pedal conspiracy about his birth? I wonder if anyone platformed that conspiracy.
1324042675931226113 2020-11-05 01:35:48 +0800 <RabMeir> @PhoeniX_TTG @luizandre9x2 @TheLiamDonovan @TheLaurenChen @MattWalshBlog Can you provide me some evidence of C?  If it is that common, there should be plenty of documented occurrences?
1324042485757333505 2020-11-05 01:35:02 +0800 <RabMeir> @BowdnBoi @RubinReport Oh dude, there's LOTS of evidence.  Ask @joerogan about Dave.
1324038011831701504 2020-11-05 01:17:16 +0800 <RabMeir> @luizandre9x2 @PhoeniX_TTG @TheLiamDonovan @TheLaurenChen @MattWalshBlog I think we both know that's not a strong defense of his behavior.  Literally "he started it" is a clichÃ© that children use, and while Trump IS a child, it still doesn't work.  If someone puts a "kick me" sign on you, you're not justified to beat them into a coma.
1324037628887474176 2020-11-05 01:15:44 +0800 <RabMeir> @luizandre9x2 @PhoeniX_TTG @TheLiamDonovan @TheLaurenChen @MattWalshBlog It's a bit of a dichotomy, I agree with you.  I would get rid of the Electoral College to start, because it suppresses Democracy.  Imagine how delightfully boring the past 4 years would have been with Hilary.  Who had nearly 3 million more votes than Trump.
1324036881231814656 2020-11-05 01:12:46 +0800 <RabMeir> @PhoeniX_TTG @luizandre9x2 @TheLiamDonovan @TheLaurenChen @MattWalshBlog The polarization and tribalism is the biggest obstacle in fixing the country.  I wonder if the last 4 years made that problem worse, or better?
1324036624238465026 2020-11-05 01:11:45 +0800 <RabMeir> @forevertiffanys @realDonaldTrump The votes are only showing up because they are doing WAY more testing.  More testing than anyone else is doing.
1324036326669373440 2020-11-05 01:10:34 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray No one has ever made a typo.  Fraud and crime proven beyond all reasonable doubt.  Great work detective!
1324036057021718533 2020-11-05 01:09:30 +0800 <RabMeir> @BowdnBoi @RubinReport Oh ok.  Well I try to get into honest discussions and find where I truly disagree with people.  It seems like we mostly agree, which is cool.  I also think Dave Rubin is a very very very stupid man, and a grifter.
1324035657912754182 2020-11-05 01:07:54 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray So....state run propaganda?  Nice!

There is right-wing and left-wing populism.  Populism becomes popular when you see massive level of inequality.  Which America has in spades.
1324034509621395456 2020-11-05 01:03:21 +0800 <RabMeir> @BowdnBoi @RubinReport Yes I would consider it an anomaly.  Which when you're dealing with massive datasets, you will always have.  I'm not going to jump to any immediate conclusions on it, especially ones that would require mass-conspiracy.  This would be 9/11 truther levels of conspiracy. QAnon.

I don't think that alone saves a country.  But it's the best current available option for governance, no?
1324032960677498881 2020-11-05 00:57:11 +0800 <RabMeir> @luizandre9x2 @TheLiamDonovan @TheLaurenChen @MattWalshBlog Totally agree.  Whoever wins this US election, will also be a legal and transparent victor.  Once all the recounts and audits and investigations from Mitch are done.
1324032754007289856 2020-11-05 00:56:22 +0800 <RabMeir> @DaddyWarpig It's a full blown meltdown.  A Chudpocalypse.
1324032569302798338 2020-11-05 00:55:38 +0800 <RabMeir> @ScottAdamsSays Because of Hilary's e-mails Scott.  Clearly.
1324032426432208896 2020-11-05 00:55:04 +0800 <RabMeir> @BowdnBoi @RubinReport If they did come in that way, there is likely a reasonable explanation that doesn't involve lizard people.  There will be recounts, audits and much more to get you your answers.  But you won't get them today.
1324032096214650886 2020-11-05 00:53:45 +0800 <RabMeir> @luizandre9x2 @TheLiamDonovan @TheLaurenChen @MattWalshBlog States Rights is a shield used to defend ideas that are stupid at best.  Malevolent at worst.  Also Brazil elected someone worse than Trump last time.  But I guess they did do it efficiently, using technology.
1324031662339072001 2020-11-05 00:52:02 +0800 <RabMeir> @PhoeniX_TTG @luizandre9x2 @TheLiamDonovan @TheLaurenChen @MattWalshBlog The United States has actively interfered in the democratic elections of several countries and installed pro-US dictators.  It's nice to see you guys getting a micro dose of your own medicine here.

Because of "states rights" allowing each one to have their own equipment, process, timelines, etc.  Federal control of the election would ensure more consistency and transparency, with faster results.  Look at Canada.
1324030497815695361 2020-11-05 00:47:24 +0800 <RabMeir> @BowdnBoi @RubinReport Ok.  You're hinting at the idea that there's a conspiracy to steal a federal Presidential election.  Is that more accurate?

What ever came of those "scandals" anyway?  Just consider what it would take to do what you're proposing.

1324027644833386498 2020-11-05 00:36:04 +0800 <RabMeir> @BowdnBoi @RubinReport It's unlikely to see an explanation for something unproved mere minutes after it is purported to have happened.  It's even more unlikely that anyone could get away with fraud and conspiracy on the scale this would suggest.  Use Occam's Razor, I'm sure there will be much analysis.

Do you really think there is a mass conspiracy to fraudulently steal a federal election, and if so, it will stay secret forever?  What else are you willing to believe?
1324024538141806593 2020-11-05 00:23:43 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog It seems to me like when you guys win, everything is trustworthy.  When you don't, not a single institution can be trusted.

1324022428650119174 2020-11-05 00:15:20 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Sorry pal, maybe next time.

1324021964135108609 2020-11-05 00:13:30 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei Yes, because of "states rights" to each use their own rules and methodologies.  The technical term for this is "stupidity".
1324021086791618561 2020-11-05 00:10:00 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Poor fella.  Maybe you should flee to Gab or Parlour with all the other chuds.
1324020454051450880 2020-11-05 00:07:30 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog All you need to know about the intentions of conservatives, is that at every opportunity they want to restrict and limit voting.  That says everything.
1324020267178467329 2020-11-05 00:06:45 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Matt you're making baseless claims about an election in progress.  I wonder if the votes came in 100% Trump for those 128k, would you also want to go to court?  Or are you a grifting troll?
1323997748149059584 2020-11-04 22:37:16 +0800 <RabMeir> @MinkaOh @VaushV @stillgray Oh totally!  He is awful.  I wanted Vaush to respond on stream to some of the stuff he was posting.
1323824034958684161 2020-11-04 11:07:00 +0800 <RabMeir> @VaushV Check out @stillgray's twitter feed on stream...

1323809355460915200 2020-11-04 10:08:40 +0800 <RabMeir> @RubinReport Dave, I would claim that most of your content is bashing "the left" non stop and further dividing people.  How would you respond to that claim?
1323806331430670337 2020-11-04 09:56:39 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Did you see @VaushV vs @Timcast?  How come you don't do stuff like that?

1323801025837473792 2020-11-04 09:35:34 +0800 <RabMeir> @AprilWild28 @AlissaWalsh21 @RealCandaceO @realDailyWire No Ma'am.  Honest conversation.   #PrincipleOfCharity always.  I think Candace is toxic.  Likely grifter.  Read her content from 2015 and imagine @MattWalshBlog hosting a show on @TheYoungTurks in 2025.  Why did @joerogan break up with @RubinReport and @RealCandaceO?  Check it.
1323798346771955713 2020-11-04 09:24:55 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 This is a good tweet!
1323797913642872835 2020-11-04 09:23:12 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 @AbbyJohnson For my 2nd example I would point to the "dreamers".  As of 2017 most are in their 20s, and about 80% arrived in the United States when they were 10 or younger.  They only know the USA as their home.  How come the conservatives don't care about these children?  Are they criminals?
1323795389070397448 2020-11-04 09:13:10 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 @AbbyJohnson I have not and don't mean any disrespect to her individually.  I was speaking more broadly about conservatives.  I haven't seen a lot of conservatives up in arms about the 550+ children still looking for their parents at the border.  As just 1 of many examples we could get into.
1323795018088407040 2020-11-04 09:11:41 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 @RealCandaceO @realDailyWire It's hard to tell if she really believes what she says or if she is saying it for profit.  If you want 1 example I would point to her reaction to several of the police shootings.  She focuses only on the wrongdoing of the deceased, no empathy.  No desire to fix root causes.
1323793531945816064 2020-11-04 09:05:47 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 @AbbyJohnson Do the future conservatives care about children after they are born, or only while they are in the womb like the current iteration?
1323791862524772354 2020-11-04 08:59:09 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 @RealCandaceO @realDailyWire Candace is a black white supremacist.  Change my mind.

1321646999771512833 2020-10-29 10:56:14 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog So, you're saying that in Musical Chairs, anyone can get a chair.  And I am saying that I agree, but everyone can't.  THAT IS THE POINT OF THE GAME. ð³
1321646687040000005 2020-10-29 10:54:59 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog So all the homeless people just didn't try?

In fact, I believe that one of the stupidest, most vein and insecure people who have EVER lived could even become President of the United State of America.  Any 1 person can do anything.
1321646066702471168 2020-10-29 10:52:31 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog Totally agree.  So the most physical "alpha" wins the game while the rest get less and less to fight over.  You said that you believe in no safety net for people without a chair, and that's where we disagree.
1321645407135502336 2020-10-29 10:49:54 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog Such feats.  You are just jerking yourself off here, you love your worldview because it means you out-worked so many others and you are special.  Your ego drives a large part of your religious level of dedication to this concept.  You sound like a robot programmed to be a zealot.
1321645052251262976 2020-10-29 10:48:30 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog I have acknowledged the 1 point you keep spamming me several times.  Then I distilled it to 4 words and you are still unable to comprehend it.

1321642379988914177 2020-10-29 10:37:52 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog So if we all agree that you are amazing, can we move on to discuss the other 330,999,999 million people in the country?
1321642099771691009 2020-10-29 10:36:46 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog I agree in the sense that you are capable of saying this over and over again.  Any ONE person can become Bezos.  I am not talking about that.  I am trying to talk about what is good for society AT LARGE, which seems to be a concept outside of your grasp or consideration.
1321641457716023296 2020-10-29 10:34:13 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog @NickJFuentes That just means I am capable of invisibility, and does not change my arguments.  You are binary in every way.  I am not a communist and we live in a capitalist/socialist hybrid system today and have for a long time.  Who built the roads?  Who pays the cops?  Everything is grey.
1321640940273020928 2020-10-29 10:32:09 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog "There should be no safety net."  You are FOR SURE young.  That is some cold shit, and I hope you never truly have to live through a situation that shows you why.  You need to research some counter opinions and come back to the middle.
1321640071926288384 2020-10-29 10:28:42 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog Your thinking is extremely binary.  You need to stop watching only reactionaries and watch both sides, or you will soon be following @NickJFuentes, and worse.
1321639863410675714 2020-10-29 10:27:52 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog That's a pretty huge leap.  I did not make any such statements.  Not even close.
1321639003771281410 2020-10-29 10:24:28 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog I could not disagree more, and hopefully you learn more about the world some day.
1321637986849726464 2020-10-29 10:20:25 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog So everyone that is below poverty, the people working 2 or 3 part-time jobs just to survive.....are only below poverty because they didn't work hard enough?  It's a ridiculous world view, and if you really did come from poverty and you believe that, that is tragic.
1321637606833213440 2020-10-29 10:18:54 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog Try watching some @VaushV @dpakman @SamSeder and actually make an attempt to listen and make a charitable attempt to understand their points.  Your follow list tells me everything I need to know.
1321637220940472321 2020-10-29 10:17:22 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog 1 last try.  If everyone succeeds, who is left to take the bulk of the jobs that need to be done that pay low wages?
1321636888013344769 2020-10-29 10:16:03 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog All 100 people can't take everything, the opportunity to be that 1 person doesn't mean fuck all if you don't end up being that person.  The other 99 all have nothing in that example and that's the problem.  You can't even understand what I am saying.
1321636494218592256 2020-10-29 10:14:29 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog I mean it's not an excuse and we just said the same thing.  You can call them the "hardest working" because they are the highest ranked and/or wealthiest Nigerians.  That doesn't change my point.  You're either young or very dumb.  It was worth a shot.  Get out of your bubble.
1321636007272423425 2020-10-29 10:12:33 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog That's an incredible fairy tale that is easily disproved with data, but you choose not to challenge yourself.  And that is your choice.
1321635787092430848 2020-10-29 10:11:41 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog So if a society has 100 people in it, as long as 1 person can win and take everything, that's all good then?
1321635539150319617 2020-10-29 10:10:41 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog Because only the highest ranked and wealthiest Nigerians migrate to the United States.  That is extremely obvious.
1321635332945825792 2020-10-29 10:09:52 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog No, that is someone saying that I agree to disagree with you and debating that point any further is pointless.
1321634737174228992 2020-10-29 10:07:30 +0800 <RabMeir> Good work today @VaushV, keep it up!
1321634597092937738 2020-10-29 10:06:57 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog Yes, any 1 person can do that.  What about society at large?  Do you care about that?
1321634467002331136 2020-10-29 10:06:26 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog Well, you see what you want to see.
1321634303864905729 2020-10-29 10:05:47 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog Read up bud.  He got between 1 and 4 game suspension....THEN the tape came out and they changed it.  It's one of Roger's more famous fuck ups.
1321634064743452672 2020-10-29 10:04:50 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog You sound like a libertarian.
1321633799319490560 2020-10-29 10:03:47 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog That's true for a very small % of ppl.  The rest of them, by necessity, have to work for relative peanuts and barely survive.  The "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" is a fallacy.  No offence meant but you sound young.  Read up on some opposing opinions. Think critically.
1321633225073188866 2020-10-29 10:01:30 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog Yes.  But if you really look at how the NFL handled that, it wasn't so good.  I think he got like 1 or 2 games until the tape came out.  Why?  Because it made them look bad.  Hurt their mission to make money.
1321632876690104321 2020-10-29 10:00:07 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog And if BLM had the level of organization and management that the NHL does, they would expel anyone who does violence or destroys property.  Why?  Because it would make them look bad, and distract from their purpose.  No one would listen to them.  But they are not the NHL.
1321632365446418432 2020-10-29 09:58:05 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog @VaushV @Timcast I have not used whataboutism 1 time, in any way.  Check out @VaushV vs @Timcast.  You'll learn some stuff, 100% guarantee.
1321632142015811587 2020-10-29 09:57:12 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog I don't see it as an accountability issue.  If you grow up in a bad house that really hurts the probability of you having great outcomes.  Like I said, blacks have 10% the net work of whites on average in the US of A.  So they have worse outcomes.  That's the issue.  Needs a fix.
1321631815132684288 2020-10-29 09:55:54 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog Well I think it's unfair, and like I said the left does the same thing to "your side".  I think that leads to extreme polarization, no discourse or attempt to understand the nuance and dynamics of a group.  If a hockey player rapes a girl, is the NHL involved in rape?
1321631192110796800 2020-10-29 09:53:25 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog @JadenPMcNeil @NickJFuentes I am happy to hear that.
1321631075324624897 2020-10-29 09:52:57 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog I'd say they weren't raised properly and don't have proper values if they rob a store.  Regardless of their skin color.  Is that fair?
1321630917870444545 2020-10-29 09:52:20 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog I agree.
1321630880864047106 2020-10-29 09:52:11 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog @VaushV @Timcast Please trust me I am trying to have 100% honest and fair conversation with you and just debate our disagreements fairly.  I don't have a side.
1321630516706185217 2020-10-29 09:50:44 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog I really appreciate your response, and I do not believe I am full of shit.  It's fine that we disagree, people often do.  What makes you think they can't work hard enough to fit in?
1321630255937998849 2020-10-29 09:49:42 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog I can and do criticize "the left" and BLM and "woke" people all day long.  They have all gone too far to one side.  It sounds to me like you have to.  Go check out @VaushV vs @Timcast from today.  Come back to the middle.
1321629957811044353 2020-10-29 09:48:31 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog Who is "they"?  BLM?  Is all of BLM rioting in the streets?  No.  Walter Wallace is just the most recent straw that broke the camels back, and is not relevant to the reasons behind the movement beyond that.  Nor is his character or morality while he was alive.
1321629598304604161 2020-10-29 09:47:05 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog You should follow @JLPtalk too.  He LOVES to ask loaded questions and demand a yes or no answer.  Try to understand that it's perfectly valid to dispute the premise of a question.  "When did you stop beating your wife?  Give me a date." is the classic example of this.  Be honest.
1321629270331035650 2020-10-29 09:45:47 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog @JadenPMcNeil If you have got to the Jaden level of the rabbit hole, why aren't you also following @NickJFuentes?
1321628864301408256 2020-10-29 09:44:10 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog @JadenPMcNeil I have answered that.  You are taking a small % of extreme people and painting the entire movement with that brush.  To be fair, "the left" does the same thing and calls all of you guys Nazis, and I think that's wrong too.  Everything is shades of grey.
1321628318807085059 2020-10-29 09:42:00 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog @JadenPMcNeil Ask it again please.  I would be more than happy to.
1321628272984268807 2020-10-29 09:41:49 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog I am making every attempt.  The looting and rioting is a small % of extreme individuals.
1321628145871687682 2020-10-29 09:41:19 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog I think any time you have civil unrest for progress, you will see a small % of more extreme individuals take advantage of the situation and loot.  It seems to happen every time.  But that doesn't invalidate the movement.
1321628010156621830 2020-10-29 09:40:46 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog Again I am asking you to try and make a charitable attempt to understand their position.  I see that people like @JadenPMcNeil have poisoned your mind but let's try.  In your relationships, do you go from 0 to 100 based on 1 grievance?  Or do things build up to a boiling point?
1321627404188659713 2020-10-29 09:38:22 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog My answer is clear in my first message that you did not read.  BLM is not protesting for 1 or 2 individual criminals.  They are protesting that they have 10% of the net worth of white people on average and therefore disproportionally end up with bad outcomes including criminality
1321626312742719493 2020-10-29 09:34:02 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog Did you even read what I wrote?  What do you think BLM is about?  Do you believe that it's a movement about martyrdom for criminals?  Maybe we can help Matt learn that a martyr is someone killed for their beliefs.  Which of these black dudes was killed for beliefs?
1321624467538366465 2020-10-29 09:26:42 +0800 <RabMeir> @4moreyearsMAGA1 @MattWalshBlog Matt is being inflammatory and dishonest here, which seems to be his life's work.  BLM is not a movement about making martyrs out of criminals.  Try to use the #PrincipleOfCharity here and understand that they are protesting the outcomes of black people in America at large.
1321623737612075008 2020-10-29 09:23:48 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 @MattWalshBlog I agree with you.  The root cause is what truly matters.  I think any time you have civil unrest for progress, you will see a small % of more extreme individuals take advantage of the situation and loot.  It seems to happen every time.  But that doesn't invalidate the movement.
1321276739969032194 2020-10-28 10:24:57 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 @MattWalshBlog Thank you for the reply :)
1321276695794647040 2020-10-28 10:24:47 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 @MattWalshBlog It seems reminiscent of the Civ. Rights protests of the 50s and 60s.  Which I think everyone agrees was a good thing.  No one outside the fringe supports looting and destruction.  But we have to be honest about what they are truly angry about and what can actually be done to fix.
1321276025628708866 2020-10-28 10:22:07 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Is empathy reserved for zygotes and embryos? Do you count your age from conception or birth? Do you agree with Christians who say God makes life; God doesn't make mistakes so rape and incest babies must be born without regard for the mother's opinion?  You agree @AlissaWalsh21?
1321273731386400770 2020-10-28 10:13:00 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 @MattWalshBlog Do you guys actually spend your evening sitting around tweeting each other confused about why black Americans might be upset about their situation in the US of A?  They have 10% of the net worth vs white families on average.  Is that worth discussion and analysis, or no?
1321272245424185344 2020-10-28 10:07:06 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Hey Matt, are you able to make a charitable attempt at understanding why black Americans might be upset?  Or is that beyond your abilities?  I can help you out if you aren't too big of a coward.
1321270767573716993 2020-10-28 10:01:13 +0800 <RabMeir> @CortesSteve @ScottAdamsSays Do you see a fundamental dichotomy when you purport to be the smartest man alive while simultaneously refusing to challenge any of your own opinions?  What happens if you examine Trump's corruption with the same enthusiasm as Biden's?
1321264971431424002 2020-10-28 09:38:11 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog @AlissaWalsh21, Matt likes to bully trans people invokes the opinion of your daughter to do so.  Curious how you feel about this, wondering if you could help him out.  Show your daughter a picture of @MsBlaireWhite and @BuckAngel and ask her to pick the man and the woman.
1321263280858554369 2020-10-28 09:31:28 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Hey Matt, I see you're having your tri-weekly meltdown about Transpeople getting a marginal level of respect.  You make no attempt at empathy or understanding on this subject.  Is this how a Christian behaves?  What is @MsBlaireWhite?  What is @BuckAngel?  You tell me cool guy.
1321262228050497537 2020-10-28 09:27:17 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog 1 example of this is _____?
1321261689979998209 2020-10-28 09:25:09 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog This stands out as stupid even compared to all of your other takes.  Do you get the sense that a lot of people are on the fence here, just waiting to see what Trump or Biden say and do on the day before the election?  What could Biden do or say to get your vote, @MattWalshBlog?
1321261280343281664 2020-10-28 09:23:31 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog It's nice to see Matt admit that he has the same worldview as a small child.
1319135941269819392 2020-10-22 12:38:11 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray So you're always hungry?
1316838042569768961 2020-10-16 04:27:09 +0800 <RabMeir> @KrystalDobsons I think environment is a big factor.  I believe poverty creates crime, and black people are much more likely to be poor in the USA.  Having about 10% of the net worth on average vs white people.
1316837636342984706 2020-10-16 04:25:32 +0800 <RabMeir> @cruzmissile1945 @Harry1T6 @KurtSchlichter They got Al Capone on tax evasion. I suspect he did more than that.  They made a big mistake framing the investigation as looking for "collusion". Set themselves up to fail with expectations that were too high.  The Stormy payment is an obvious crime. Should have kept it simple.
1316836640451686401 2020-10-16 04:21:35 +0800 <RabMeir> @RubinReport Is he though?  Or did a guy just take a picture?
1316809420391809025 2020-10-16 02:33:25 +0800 <RabMeir> @KrystalDobsons LOL!  Maybe use some euphemisms and hyperbolic satire to illustrate the point?  Or speak clinically, they don't ban that.  I take it from your reply that you think it's genetics.  In their DNA.  Does that sort of sum it up?
1316809026718531586 2020-10-16 02:31:51 +0800 <RabMeir> @cruzmissile1945 @Harry1T6 @KurtSchlichter One of the FIVE campaign officials was the, ahem, campaign manager.  So I'm not sure they came back with squirrels.  Perhaps a zebra, 3 donkeys and a horse.  My problem is that according to conservative talking points, no animals were even spotted. Everything is so binary &amp; dumb.
1316808268522622977 2020-10-16 02:28:50 +0800 <RabMeir> @GlenBradley @MZHemingway @mob_ocracy Strawman.  I did not equate saying the phrase with any level of guilt.  It sounds like you don't believe in being courteous or having empathy for others.  If anyone is offended by anything, they are wrong and need to be "helped".  Is that your position or do I misunderstand you?
1316807404315697154 2020-10-16 02:25:24 +0800 <RabMeir> @KrystalDobsons That's true, they are.  Why do you think that is?
1316586515229704195 2020-10-15 11:47:40 +0800 <RabMeir> @AlissaWalsh21 Looks like a guy trying to decide between being gay or being straight.

1316584277459570689 2020-10-15 11:38:47 +0800 <RabMeir> @Harry1T6 @KurtSchlichter A total of thirty-four individuals and three companies were indicted by Mueller's investigators. Eight have pleaded guilty to or been convicted of felonies, including five Trump associates and campaign officials.
1316584067127742464 2020-10-15 11:37:57 +0800 <RabMeir> @Harry1T6 @KurtSchlichter The Special Counsel indicted 34 peopleâseven U.S. nationals, 26 Russian nationals, and one Dutch nationalâand three Russian organizations. Two additional individuals were charged as a result of referrals to other FBI offices.

If they actually wanted to find a middle ground, they totally could.

I found that a bit strange.

It sounds like we could come to agreement on some level of "common sense" gun regulation.  Why do you think it's so hard for the politicians to get ANYTHING done in that regard?  Is it just the NRA and lobbies like that?
1316568376337223680 2020-10-15 10:35:36 +0800 <RabMeir> @MGK_2417 @cantshakeme1776 @BabyBoomstick @CraigRSawyer @AMPFEST_USA @DineshDSouza @RepMattGaetz @govkristinoem @vets4childres While I agree it's the gangs...I disagree on that solution.  That sounds like stomping on whichever ants you can find, rather than taking out the ant hill.  What do you think causes the existence and popularity of gangs in cities like Chicago?  Why wouldn't we fix the root cause?
1316567802300575746 2020-10-15 10:33:19 +0800 <RabMeir> @cantshakeme1776 @BabyBoomstick @MGK_2417 @CraigRSawyer @AMPFEST_USA @DineshDSouza @RepMattGaetz @govkristinoem @vets4childres I didn't know that.  I have no problem with people like you having guns, no one knows better what they are capable of doing.  I appreciate the conversation.  I meant no disrespect to your friend @CraigRSawyer by the way.  People are too divided and only honest discourse can heal.
1316566384566992896 2020-10-15 10:27:41 +0800 <RabMeir> @cantshakeme1776 @MGK_2417 @BabyBoomstick @CraigRSawyer @AMPFEST_USA @DineshDSouza @RepMattGaetz @govkristinoem @vets4childres Absolutely.  If you need a license and some training to drive a car, it's reasonable to apply the same standard (or more) to guns.  Both can cause great harm to other people if you don't follow proper safety.  There are too many stories of young kids shooting kids by accident.
1316565845611622401 2020-10-15 10:25:32 +0800 <RabMeir> @RubinReport Hahahahahahahaha  This is like the guy from Fyre Festival telling us what a great businessman Bernie Madoff is.

Also, how would you defend the Merrick Garland position while simultaneously defending the ACB position?  Or have you ever defended any of your positions?
1316564251755122688 2020-10-15 10:19:12 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog I'm glad to see you advocating for regulation Matt!  How would you feel about some gun regulation?  What about restoring the environmental regulations that Trump removed to protect clean water?

As you rightfully point out, criminals don't follow laws.  Are you against any type of gun regulation for future purchases?  Perhaps requiring training and/or a license?
1316562829479215104 2020-10-15 10:13:33 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Or 29 years?  "The word preference suggests a degree of voluntary choice that is not necessarily reported by lesbians and gay men and that has not been demonstrated in psychological research," the American Psychological Association (APA) noted in a journal article published in 91
1316562517993365509 2020-10-15 10:12:19 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog 1) Why are you so obsessed with gay and trans people? 2) Why can you make no honest attempt to understand their existence? 3) Why do you have no empathy for them? 4) When did you choose to be straight? 5) How close were you to choosing dicks?

This doesn't make logical sense, implies that criminals would have more guns if only the good people got rid of theirs.  Are there major supply issues I am not aware of?  Do you have something to back this up?

1316559616122261504 2020-10-15 10:00:47 +0800 <RabMeir> @GlenBradley @MZHemingway @mob_ocracy I completely and totally agree with you.  Being gay is not a choice.  "Sexual preference" is the language that was used by people who said it was a choice, and tried to electrocute them into being straight.  So it offends them.  That's pretty simple to understand isn't it?
1316559112159797248 2020-10-15 09:58:47 +0800 <RabMeir> @FactSmacker @ZaidJilani @Cernovich Also, as I mentioned, this can not be argued in a vacuum.  There is a history of this language being used to justify electro-shocking gay people to turn them straight.  Can I safely assume you do not support electro-shocking gay people to turn them straight?

You made some good points that are worth discussing.  But let me ask you this, what do you think is the best way to fix the problem in Chicago?

You just refuse to acknowledge my answer because it disagrees with your priors.  You brought up Australia, and what happened was their homicide rate is 18% what the USA has.  So you made my point for me.  Thank you for that.

USA: 4.96 Canada: 1.76 Iran: 2.47 UK: 1.20  So I am not sure your argument holds up there.  It sounds like you believe you need guns to potentially use against your fellow citizens.

Sadly, a lot of people in 2020 would post that image on Twitter in a completely serious way.  The VP definitely believes that all gays go to hell.  I like to debate those kind of people.  Sorry to bother you :)
1315868460484898821 2020-10-13 12:14:23 +0800 <RabMeir> @HamptureI @amaan_ver @KYolke Ok, cool enough.  I guess when I see that being gay means you go to hell, I assume Christian.  Since Christians generally are the ones who believe in hell.

Toddlers killing other toddlers due to a lack of these things is tragic.  Does it make sense to need a driver's license to operate a car?  If so, maybe some gun training and licenses should be required for someone to own a gun for self defense?

Do you think that applies today?  I don't.  I agree the military needs guns to fight wars.

1315862356296183808 2020-10-13 11:50:07 +0800 <RabMeir> @amaan_ver @KrystalDobsons So what do you guys think happened?
1315861543305850880 2020-10-13 11:46:54 +0800 <RabMeir> @KYolke @HamptureI @amaan_ver I sometimes wonder if tweets like this are how good Christians should treat other people.  What do you think?

Don't want to change that.  Trying to understand the level of fetishization with them.  I'm curious what you mean by the lesson you learned.  I don't like soy and I'm not scared of you owning guns.  I agree with the sacrifice as well.

Some people like to collect and play with pinball machines.  No one says patriots who love America need to all get pinballs.  That is the kind of rhetoric I was curious about originally.
1315854794746195989 2020-10-13 11:20:05 +0800 <RabMeir> @cruzmissile1945 @AMPFEST_USA @DineshDSouza @RepMattGaetz @govkristinoem @vets4childres Machismo sounds right.  The statistics when using guns for self-defense are not great.  Much more downside than upside there.  Appreciate the answer.

The US has 121 civilian firearms per 100 inhabitants. Canada has about 35 per 100.  It's not for sport.  Why do these "patriots" need so many guns for?  You should be able to give a better answer than sport.

I am just curious what the practical use is for every day citizens in 2020.  Should be an easy thing to have a discussion about, right?
1315848079283757058 2020-10-13 10:53:24 +0800 <RabMeir> @BabyBoomstick @CraigRSawyer @AMPFEST_USA @DineshDSouza @RepMattGaetz @govkristinoem @vets4childres Did he?  So what are they for?  He made some baseless claim and then talked about "evildoers" who are enslaving people.  I understand why the military needs to have guns.  Why do regular everyday "patriots" need so many guns?  What are they for?

1315847042703536129 2020-10-13 10:49:16 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei @realDonaldTrump @ScottAdamsSays Are you willing or able to defend this position in an honest discussion?  Or do you just troll lefties online for profit like your mentor Scottie?
1315846535486332928 2020-10-13 10:47:15 +0800 <RabMeir> @michaeljknowles What triggers you so much about wearing a mask?
1315845385211064320 2020-10-13 10:42:41 +0800 <RabMeir> @CraigRSawyer Also, the "far left" is just an insane as the "far right".  Both are bad and their ideas shouldn't be taken seriously.  That's actually what the "far" part means.  They are fringe lunatics.
1315844912907194369 2020-10-13 10:40:49 +0800 <RabMeir> @CraigRSawyer Craig, be honest.  "SB 145 would only apply in cases involving minors between ages 14 and 17 and with an offender within a 10-year age range."  A judge will decide about offender registry.  So if a 19 year old has sex with a 17 year old, a judge can decide not to ruin their life.
1315843390848851968 2020-10-13 10:34:46 +0800 <RabMeir> @theserfstv What conservatives are willing to debate anyone on the left today other than @JLPtalk?  I haven't seen any.  @TheQuartering quit being such a Low T Beta Soy Cuck.
1315842628257304581 2020-10-13 10:31:44 +0800 <RabMeir> @RubinReport This is also not permitted behavior Dave, so your comparison is very weak.  Honest question, what would you have the government do about this celebration?
1315842255241052172 2020-10-13 10:30:15 +0800 <RabMeir> @CraigRSawyer @AMPFEST_USA @DineshDSouza @RepMattGaetz @govkristinoem @vets4childres Interesting reply Craig.  2 follow-ups for you.  1) Which evildoers are you referencing? 2) What have I said to disprove that I love peace?
1315841567979118592 2020-10-13 10:27:31 +0800 <RabMeir> @menditony @CraigRSawyer @AMPFEST_USA @DineshDSouza @RepMattGaetz @govkristinoem @vets4childres I understand why you're allowed to have all the guns.  I asked what they are for, can you answer that?  You worried the Red Coats might come back?
1315793061415395328 2020-10-13 07:14:46 +0800 <RabMeir> @MooCowExpress @RealJamesWoods Exactly.  You have no reply.

1315522065286471680 2020-10-12 13:17:56 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Ian, none of this can be happening.  @Cernovich told me that the riots stopped because Biden saw it was hurting him politically.  So he ordered them to stop.  Not sure where this fake footage is coming from.
1315520144341336064 2020-10-12 13:10:18 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Or......OR.....and try to follow this Ian.  It's a superspreader event *if* a bunch of people spread Covid to other people!  Imagine that!

1315516920364503040 2020-10-12 12:57:29 +0800 <RabMeir> @MooCowExpress @RealJamesWoods Right, have you ever seen Donald Trump speak?
1315516218749714432 2020-10-12 12:54:42 +0800 <RabMeir> @Innoculo @Cernovich @JesseKellyDC When they refuse to fill the vacancy for a year under Obama, and then put conservative in....NOW they reverse their position and confirm a judge 2 weeks before an election to get ANOTHER conservative in....that is packing the courts with conservatives.  I watch neither of those.
1315515824388665344 2020-10-12 12:53:08 +0800 <RabMeir> @Innoculo @Cernovich @JesseKellyDC On March 22, 2019, the Special Counsel submitted their report to Attorney General William Barr. The investigation garnered 199 criminal charges, 37 indictments or guilty pleas, and 5 prison sentences.
1315513926562570240 2020-10-12 12:45:35 +0800 <RabMeir> @RealJamesWoods Hi James, that seems harsh.  And did you really just say "your mom"?

1315512251630133249 2020-10-12 12:38:56 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Weird take.  Really dumb.  But even more weird.
1315511552032862209 2020-10-12 12:36:09 +0800 <RabMeir> @Innoculo @Cernovich @JesseKellyDC No one talked about legality.  If this is the Republican strategy, why wouldn't the Democrats "pack the court"?  How is ignoring Merrick Garland and then doing this not packing the count?  The rest of what you said is crazy.  Stop believing people who brand hoaxes for profit.
1315510600999620609 2020-10-12 12:32:22 +0800 <RabMeir> @scottmo11903643 @RealJamesWoods Very vocal parts of the left go too far.  Calling it China flu is not inherently racist.  However unless we are doing science experiments, things don't happen in a vacuum.  Trump has a long history of language and actions that when taken in totality are hard to ignore.
1315509584535134214 2020-10-12 12:28:20 +0800 <RabMeir> @scottmo11903643 @RealJamesWoods I don't think anyone has said no one was supposed to die.  But plenty of people think that less people should have died.  Would you concede that a country like Canada has handled it better -- with consistent messaging from their leaders and more compliance from the population?

1315505277408600066 2020-10-12 12:11:13 +0800 <RabMeir> @SheilaGunnReid Oh nice.  What's her name?  If it is ACTUALLY even, the entire world must already know it.
1315505058784710657 2020-10-12 12:10:21 +0800 <RabMeir> @RealJamesWoods Hey James, are you a Trump Simp who is upset by old men who are attracted to young women?  Do you see any inherent problems with that position?  Give it a minute.
1315504652444741632 2020-10-12 12:08:44 +0800 <RabMeir> @RealJamesWoods Hey James, how do you think Trump has done handling the pandemic?

1315498478496350208 2020-10-12 11:44:12 +0800 <RabMeir> Big shoutout to @realBobbyFox for having an honest discussion with me about a very polarizing and inflammatory subject.  Neither side does NEARLY enough of this.  #PrincipleOfCharity
1315497813489389569 2020-10-12 11:41:34 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist You as well.  Pleasure conversing with you.
1315497688180445184 2020-10-12 11:41:04 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist Lol.  Is that a Scottism?  I think of the term "march in protest" and was using the words synonymously.  I wouldn't consider that it changed my point and certainly I didn't hallucinate that he said "march".  Innocent use of synonym on my part, no mal intent.  #PrincipleOfCharity
1315496717232607234 2020-10-12 11:37:12 +0800 <RabMeir> @BrRorshach @neolib_fanfic What do you think they overreached on?
1315496427204866051 2020-10-12 11:36:03 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist I agree with most of your statement here.  Left media fans the flames of this narrative -- and I find that gross and very divisive.  People everywhere are dividing us for profit.  I can't see that ending in a good place.  Can you?
1315495979756511234 2020-10-12 11:34:16 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist You're 100% correct.  He said "protest".  I apologize for the mistake.
1315495739221573633 2020-10-12 11:33:19 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist That's a tough one for me to think about.  I am not sure if you're familiar with @JLPtalk, but I have heard him say objectively racist things.  A lot of them actually.  And I don't understand that either.
1315495257623199745 2020-10-12 11:31:24 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist I knew we would find some things we could agree on!  If more people tried to find some common ground and build on that, wouldn't things be a lot better?  I think the way things are going is horrific.  It's way too polarized.  Sincere thanks for this discussion tonight.
1315494919713239045 2020-10-12 11:30:04 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist I am not talking about the crowd.  Trump specifically referenced the people who were marching for the Robert E. Lee statue, and so that is who I am talking about.  He said they were not WS.  The makeup of the spectators is irrelevant to me.
1315494624551673857 2020-10-12 11:28:53 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist The left has gone too far.  They have some people who seem to be actually insane.  Same on the right.  Both extremes are awful.  I think Scott brands hoaxes for money.  And I think it exacerbates division instead of taking steps to unite people.  So I think that's bad.
1315494204521488385 2020-10-12 11:27:13 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist Sure, if we are talking about everyone on the sidelines watching.  But if we specifically discuss the people there to protest the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue -- lefties think it's totally fair to call them racist.  You probably don't.  So that's a disagreement.
1315493688391458816 2020-10-12 11:25:10 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist The crowd that was just watching, and the 20-40% who were at home do not appear to be referenced in his quote and I think we can leave them out of this discussion.  I mean, do you think it's a "hoax" when Fox News frames Democrat behavior in ways lefties consider dishonest?
1315493341136646144 2020-10-12 11:23:47 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist I'm sorry but I don't know what a hoax funnel is.  I think that if you read his statements with the mindset of the left, that statue marchers are racist -- then his condemnation doesn't really hold up.  So to me, it's a disagreement about what makes someone a racist.
1315492853230063616 2020-10-12 11:21:51 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist I read his statement to mean that the people marching for the statue are not WS.  And that they were the fine people there.  Do we agree on that part?  I also will say that I agree with his point that there WERE some bad people on the left side that day as well.  100%
1315491988502966272 2020-10-12 11:18:25 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist Try to extend me some courtesy here as I am trying to do to you.  He clearly said there that not every was a WS, some where there to protest the statue.  A lot of people on the left would argue that marching for the statue MAKES you a WS.  Disagreement, not a hoax.
1315491631659921408 2020-10-12 11:17:00 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist Trump: "...Iâve condemned neo-Nazis. ... But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch. Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue of Robert E. Lee."
1315490587815141376 2020-10-12 11:12:51 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist He said the WS and Neo Nazis were bad.  He said the people there to march about the statue being taken down had some fine people there.  Do we agree about that at least?  For some people, marching for the statue makes you racist.  It's a disagreement, not a hoax.
1315489636173729794 2020-10-12 11:09:04 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist That's why people say he called racists "fine people"  it's not a hoax.  Some people genuinely believe that marching for the Confederate statue makes you a racist.  So why can't @ScottAdamsSays have an honest conversation about this and invoke the Principle of Charity?
1315489164788465664 2020-10-12 11:07:12 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist Thank you for engaging with me in an honest fashion, I do appreciate it.  This shows the nuance here.  People who showed up to watch aren't the group referenced.  They weren't participating.  For a lot of people, marching for the statue IS racist.  That is the real disagreement.
1315483827658199040 2020-10-12 10:45:59 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist But that's not what I said.  We can discuss them too, but I am curious about your thoughts on the people who showed up to march to protest the statue being removed.  On the same night as the UTR rally.  Can you seriously not see why someone would question their motives?
1315483530357608451 2020-10-12 10:44:48 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist I'll ignore that.  It's obvious that anyone saying DJT never condemned the WS and Neo Nazis is lying or uninformed.  Since this "hoax" is about the "fine people" who were there that night marching about statue, that's who I am talking about.  Not everyone who supports the statue.
1315481765637754880 2020-10-12 10:37:48 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist Holy cow, that's literally the exact same image, with the exact same orange circle around the text.  Where did you pull this from?
1315481477342208006 2020-10-12 10:36:39 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist That's very interesting, I got that same screenshot back from another one of you guys.  Appealing to popularity isn't an argument.  Try to focus.  If you're marching to support a Confederate statue, what are you supporting?
1315479138787000320 2020-10-12 10:27:21 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist What does that prove?  If you're marching to support the Confederates, what are you supporting?
1315478404951617537 2020-10-12 10:24:26 +0800 <RabMeir> @realBobbyFox @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist To be clear, I am legitimately curious what would motivate someone to march to protest the removal of a Confederate statue.  On the same night as the Unite The Right rally organized by Neo Nazis.  It seems obvious.  Are those really fine people?  @ScottAdamsSays is dishonest.
1315475459363278849 2020-10-12 10:12:44 +0800 <RabMeir> @RealJamesWoods Ya guys, they purge bot accounts all the time.  Happens to the left and the right.  Only one side is serially addicted to being a victim and complains about it incessantly.  Poor fellas.

1315473879008260098 2020-10-12 10:06:27 +0800 <RabMeir> @VaushV @VaushV How do you prefer to hear feedback from your fans?  Stream chat is a fast flowing river of nonsense.  You don't accept DMs here.  Do you read e-mails?  I have some ideas I want to bounce off of you.
1315473218099122178 2020-10-12 10:03:50 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich If Republicans were willing to ignore Merrick Garland for nearly a year, then ram a judge through 2 weeks before the election in order to take healthcare away from the most vulnerable 10% of their own country.....why shouldn't the Democrats play dirty too?  @JesseKellyDC

1315472605483335680 2020-10-12 10:01:24 +0800 <RabMeir> @ScottAdamsSays @YouTube Thanks Scott.  Any chance you're willing to defend any of your positions in an honest debate?
1315472235226959872 2020-10-12 09:59:55 +0800 <RabMeir> @DarrenJBeattie You do see why Q Anon has the potential to cause far more damage than 1 death though, right?
1315471846377127936 2020-10-12 09:58:23 +0800 <RabMeir> @Lauren_Southern Can we try this online too?  Let's try the Principle of Charity Challenge.  Everyone pick 1 topic they disagree with completely, and try to educate yourself and earnestly understand the other side's position.  Might help bridge the widening divide between the 2 sides.  Thoughts?
1315471124076036098 2020-10-12 09:55:30 +0800 <RabMeir> @NickJFuentes how come you don't do any debates anymore?

1315467941492781057 2020-10-12 09:42:52 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei I'll take a stab at it.  It was put there to trigger Chuds into pulling over, taking a picture, and tweeting about it.  Looks like it's working as intended.  How did I do?

1315464577614831616 2020-10-12 09:29:30 +0800 <RabMeir> @ScottAdamsSays @JakeResist This is so tired and sad.  Scott is right -- Trump condemned the White Supremacists and Neo Nazis.  The "fine people" he talked about were the guys who showed up on the same night and marched to protest the removal of Confederate statues.  Wonder what motives someone to do that?
1315463378232578051 2020-10-12 09:24:44 +0800 <RabMeir> Kudos to @MattWalshBlog for having an open mind and seeking to understand new ideas, even if they may lead to conclusions that could challenge parts of his faith.  It proves he can do it if he really puts his mind to it.  Now try the same exercise with Transgender people.

1315461654696652800 2020-10-12 09:17:53 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Can we talk about Merrick Garland?  Or can you only defend your positions in a vacuum?
1314794599240658950 2020-10-10 13:07:14 +0800 <RabMeir> @GrayBattleToad What's a power level?

1314786585519554560 2020-10-10 12:35:24 +0800 <RabMeir> @johndurant @Cernovich Donald Trump and his base have not been good for any single person's wellbeing.
1314786102755164160 2020-10-10 12:33:29 +0800 <RabMeir> @Buckshotgutsho1 @Colson311Olson @TheLaurenChen @KingWilliam_I @ConnorSays3 Some things should be above profit.  Healthcare is probably one of them if you care about human beings.  A country that allows for-profit prisons, especially juvenile prisons, has some very disturbing priorities.
1314785218990047232 2020-10-10 12:29:58 +0800 <RabMeir> @Buckshotgutsho1 @Colson311Olson @TheLaurenChen @KingWilliam_I @ConnorSays3 Absolutely agree with you 100%.  Americans pay highly inflated costs due to their healthcare-for-profit system.  It's absurd.  I do feel very sorry for the entire middle and lower class of the country.
1314784682958032896 2020-10-10 12:27:50 +0800 <RabMeir> @nixonist @johnjac69506971 How did you get to that conclusion based on a group of people deciding to display some art for awhile?  I feel like you brought some priors into this...
1314784251905179648 2020-10-10 12:26:07 +0800 <RabMeir> @michaelmalice You are a self-admitted troll.  What are you writing a book about?
1314784131142823936 2020-10-10 12:25:39 +0800 <RabMeir> @AshaLogos @RichardBSpencer Richard, it's a temporary display of some art.  What's the big deal?
1314783391569588224 2020-10-10 12:22:42 +0800 <RabMeir> @TheLaurenChen Canada doesn't have a mass migration problem.  In fact, it's merit-based and more restrictive than US policy.  It's not easy to become a Canadian citizen.  It's obvious your family could afford extra money for premium care.  I do think that should be allowed in Canada.
1314782535352823808 2020-10-10 12:19:18 +0800 <RabMeir> @GrayBattleToad That's interesting.  Which parts of Confederate ideology do you like?
1314782305882439681 2020-10-10 12:18:23 +0800 <RabMeir> @Buckshotgutsho1 @Colson311Olson @TheLaurenChen @KingWilliam_I @ConnorSays3 You can cherry pick anecdotes all day.  Obamacare gave 20 million people healthcare.  How can you justify leaving any percentage of your population without basic healthcare?
1314781348972892161 2020-10-10 12:14:35 +0800 <RabMeir> @Buckshotgutsho1 @Colson311Olson @TheLaurenChen @KingWilliam_I @ConnorSays3 Everyone in Canada has very good health insurance, provided by the government.  Not tied to employment or payments.  44 million Americans are uninsured, and eight out of ten of these are workers or their dependents. Another 38 million have inadequate health insurance.
1314759460221521920 2020-10-10 10:47:37 +0800 <RabMeir> @_atlashugged @krishanisdead1 Of course they can.  Conservative policies ensure that millions of children are raised in poverty, but when it helps their prejudice they pretend to care.
1314758201754234880 2020-10-10 10:42:36 +0800 <RabMeir> @LRarey @stillgray You can't be seriously asking this question.
1314757502660116480 2020-10-10 10:39:50 +0800 <RabMeir> @Colson311Olson @TheLaurenChen @KingWilliam_I @ConnorSays3 The top earners in the US have better healthcare than Canadians, but they pay top dollar for it.  The rest of the US population has worse healthcare, or no healthcare at all.  There is no perfect system.
1314756317991575552 2020-10-10 10:35:07 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog It seems like you're really upset about masks.
1314756082825408512 2020-10-10 10:34:11 +0800 <RabMeir> @GrayBattleToad You like the flag itself aesthetically, or you like what it stands for?  Or both?
1314729289296875520 2020-10-10 08:47:43 +0800 <RabMeir> @oblivious_guy If it ranks near the bottom of bad takes, wouldn't that make it a good take?
1314729083524263936 2020-10-10 08:46:54 +0800 <RabMeir> @GrayBattleToad What makes you care so much about the Confederate flag?
1314627522596876290 2020-10-10 02:03:20 +0800 <RabMeir> @NickJFuentes @FlyGroyper Do you guys believe this?  Or just trolling libtards?
1314627260427776000 2020-10-10 02:02:18 +0800 <RabMeir> @JadenPMcNeil blocked me for asking him honest questions.  I suspect him to be a coward.  Can anyone confirm or deny?  @NickJFuentes what do you think about that?
1314626040086573056 2020-10-10 01:57:27 +0800 <RabMeir> @cincinnato @ScottAdamsSays Conservatives defend all their positions in a vacuum.  Everything Trump did before and after that moment have no  bearing on their analysis.

1314624435069083648 2020-10-10 01:51:04 +0800 <RabMeir> @dstack4273 @barefootboomer I wonder what motivates people like @oblivious_guy to seek out information and attempt to make the argument that it wasn't about slavery?
1314624038484967436 2020-10-10 01:49:29 +0800 <RabMeir> @barefootboomer It was about state's rights.  State's rights to allow slavery.
1314598780969287682 2020-10-10 00:09:08 +0800 <RabMeir> @oblivious_guy Not to mention, a lot of these protestors throwing bricks through windows and setting fires are white.
1314598568284557313 2020-10-10 00:08:17 +0800 <RabMeir> @oblivious_guy That sounds like identity politics, which I thought only the left did.  Do you think all black people behave the same way?  Like if you lived near LeBron, Mike Tyson and @JLPtalk you would find they all behaved the same way?  What would they do?
1314597464050143235 2020-10-10 00:03:54 +0800 <RabMeir> @RubinReport @ScottAdamsSays Hey Guys,  People who care enough to protest the removal of a Confederate statue are motivated by ________
1314596375900893185 2020-10-09 23:59:34 +0800 <RabMeir> @NickJFuentes @realDonaldTrump Is this what they call "simping"?
1314596098477117443 2020-10-09 23:58:28 +0800 <RabMeir> @thevivafrei What is the purpose of your poll?
1314595879240728576 2020-10-09 23:57:36 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog How do we decide who is smart enough to vote?
1314252738386112513 2020-10-09 01:14:05 +0800 <RabMeir> @GrayBattleToad There's an argument to be made there.  What about a city like Toronto?  Lots of different races all living together, and you don't see big problems caused by tribalism.  How would you explain that?  Do you think segregation is the ONLY answer to the problem?
1314252147295490049 2020-10-09 01:11:44 +0800 <RabMeir> @RubinReport @ScottAdamsSays Did I say the smart thing right Scottie?!  Can I get a biscuit???
1314251273592598528 2020-10-09 01:08:15 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray What about Trump?
1314250746523783170 2020-10-09 01:06:10 +0800 <RabMeir> @GrayBattleToad Not bad.  In your opinion, what are the benefits of segregation?
1314250414095773697 2020-10-09 01:04:50 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Hey @RubinReport isn't this identity politics?  I thought only "the left" did that.  Surely you don't agree that all men act the same way and all women act the same way?
1314249956761403397 2020-10-09 01:03:01 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Why are you obsessed with something so simple and easy to understand if you make even the slightly attempt?  Male/Female is biological sex.  Man/Woman is gender, defined by society.  These definitions have evolved over the years.  As has language.  Is that hard to grasp for you?

1313924569816801282 2020-10-08 03:30:03 +0800 <RabMeir> Do not look at the vessel, but rather at what it contains.

1313909516791144452 2020-10-08 02:30:14 +0800 <RabMeir> @FlyGroyper @NickJFuentes Interesting way to frame his content.  I think his feelings about "femoids" goes a bit beyond advocating for transitional roles.  I think this is easy to prove.  Let's talk crime though, why do you think black people commit more crime than white people?
1313906198480121856 2020-10-08 02:17:03 +0800 <RabMeir> @19thBl What's this mean?

1313895295445598209 2020-10-08 01:33:44 +0800 <RabMeir> @daisysssdukesss That's another ad hominem attack against me.  Please apologize and let's have some civil discourse here.

1313889571751550977 2020-10-08 01:10:59 +0800 <RabMeir> @FlyGroyper What's a "Groyper"?

1313888683825790976 2020-10-08 01:07:27 +0800 <RabMeir> @bigger_tex @winnnat @ScottMGreer Absolutely.  Every individual in every army has their own reasons for being there.  Centralized power and slavery were the primary divisive issues that lead to the war.  When the war was over, slavery was abolished across the country.  If the south won - would that have happened?
1313886886461681666 2020-10-08 01:00:19 +0800 <RabMeir> @winnnat @ScottMGreer You know what, I don't think you really are.  And that is an ad hominem attack.  I thought we were having a good conversation.
1313866155975639044 2020-10-07 23:37:56 +0800 <RabMeir> @HalfBori Thanks.  And what about the frog?
1313865910235602944 2020-10-07 23:36:58 +0800 <RabMeir> @winnnat @ScottMGreer Oh wow!  So you believe white people are superior to other races?
1313865315307134977 2020-10-07 23:34:36 +0800 <RabMeir> @oblivious_guy Woah!  So you don't like Jewish people either?
1313865042878758912 2020-10-07 23:33:31 +0800 <RabMeir> @oblivious_guy @moon45alpha @ScottMGreer They fought for their rights....to continue owning slaves.  They defended against an army that was coming to.....stop them from owning slaves.  It sounds like you wish they could have kept owning slaves.
1313864599343632385 2020-10-07 23:31:45 +0800 <RabMeir> @HalfBori What's a race soldier?
1313864088620077057 2020-10-07 23:29:43 +0800 <RabMeir> @winnnat @ScottMGreer So you wish that slavery had been allowed to continue?
1313863868918136835 2020-10-07 23:28:51 +0800 <RabMeir> @oblivious_guy @moon45alpha @ScottMGreer What was a world-wide institution, slavery?  So you think that is a valid defense for fighting a war to continue enslaving people?  Appealing to popularity isn't an argument.
1313858804287668224 2020-10-07 23:08:43 +0800 <RabMeir> @moon45alpha @ScottMGreer State's rights?  Right to do what? ;)

1313851116451434497 2020-10-07 22:38:10 +0800 <RabMeir> @BenderRodriguiz @NickJFuentes Does being "based" mean he ignores the lessons that were taught by Jesus and written in the Bible?

1313696519053291521 2020-10-07 12:23:52 +0800 <RabMeir> @cruzmissile1945 @Larkfarm2 @subschneider @ScottAdamsSays @JoeBiden Perhaps if you were plotting his political views on a globe!  I suspect he is branding and marketing "Hoaxes" for profit, making no attempt to understand the other side of any argument.  It seems to me that none of these guys will debate anyone on the other side.
1313692568400605184 2020-10-07 12:08:10 +0800 <RabMeir> @ScottAdamsSays please stop pretending to be confused about opinions you disagree with.  Give my principle a try:   https://t.co/JYw972A4BA  You're causing people to argue about nothing.
1313691846602821634 2020-10-07 12:05:18 +0800 <RabMeir> @cruzmissile1945 @Larkfarm2 @subschneider @ScottAdamsSays @JoeBiden If @cruzmissle1945 and I can have a reasonable conversation about this and work out where both the left and the right are coming from on this topic....why can't the guys with the big audiences like @ScottAdamsSays do the same?

1313688140113215489 2020-10-07 11:50:34 +0800 <RabMeir> @cruzmissile1945 @Cernovich Definitely.
1313687822449209344 2020-10-07 11:49:18 +0800 <RabMeir> @cruzmissile1945 @subschneider @ScottAdamsSays @JoeBiden States rights to do what? ;)  I would be OK with moving them to museums.  I can accept that good people can prefer to keep them around.  But I do wonder if you're motivated enough to get up and go march for that statue, why is that?
1313686578447908864 2020-10-07 11:44:22 +0800 <RabMeir> @cruzmissile1945 @Cernovich No, I totally support this.  The sugar content in almost all food today is absurd.
1313685493805129728 2020-10-07 11:40:03 +0800 <RabMeir> @cruzmissile1945 @Cernovich Which part are you on board with?  I would say my political views are: frustrated.
1313684215268024320 2020-10-07 11:34:58 +0800 <RabMeir> @cruzmissile1945 @subschneider @ScottAdamsSays @JoeBiden All fair points.  In this case, the statue is specifically built to honor his fighting in a war to maintain slavery.  In 1918 Charlottesville the intentions of building that statue are clear.  Their history is well preserved, a statue is meant to honor.
1313681317142368256 2020-10-07 11:23:27 +0800 <RabMeir> @cruzmissile1945 @subschneider @ScottAdamsSays @JoeBiden If we also agree that statues are built to honor the accomplishments of great people, then I guess I would have to ask if it is appropriate to have one built for someone that is only renowned for being a general that fought to maintain slavery?
1313679570957197320 2020-10-07 11:16:31 +0800 <RabMeir> @cruzmissile1945 @subschneider @ScottAdamsSays @JoeBiden Definitely not, and to be clear, marching to keep the statue in place doesn't make someone a neo-nazi either.  That term is abused.  But you're making an appeal to popularity here, not an argument.  Do you agree that the confederate army fought the civil war to maintain slavery?
1313677873815982080 2020-10-07 11:09:46 +0800 <RabMeir> @ScottMGreer Hi Scott.  You seem to have some issues with women.  Why's that?
1313676786337804289 2020-10-07 11:05:27 +0800 <RabMeir> @NickJFuentes @JadenPMcNeil Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you. â Ephesians 4:32
1313673571273764865 2020-10-07 10:52:40 +0800 <RabMeir> @cruzmissile1945 @subschneider @ScottAdamsSays @JoeBiden Right.  That's exactly who I thought he was talking about too.  I am glad we can agree on that.  So they were just there to protest the removal of Robert E. Lee's statue.  What did Robert E. Lee fight for?
1313672073726828551 2020-10-07 10:46:43 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Isn't this tweet virtue signaling?
1313671692410146821 2020-10-07 10:45:12 +0800 <RabMeir> @PhillyLeotardo @stillgray Are you sure that no conservatives post online about all of their virtues that make them better than liberals?  You're sure?
1313671272426024960 2020-10-07 10:43:32 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray What about trolling people on the internet for profits?
1313669327846023169 2020-10-07 10:35:49 +0800 <RabMeir> @subschneider @ScottAdamsSays @JoeBiden Hey Mark, just wondering who you think he WAS calling fine people.  The guys who showed up to protest the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue?  During a Unite The Right rally organized by Richard Spencer?  Or who was it?
1313667705212469248 2020-10-07 10:29:22 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWolking @stillgray Do you only see people as their identities?  Impressive strawman.
1313666259117117442 2020-10-07 10:23:37 +0800 <RabMeir> @scrowder And what about healthcare for ALL Americans, Steven?
1313666093051981826 2020-10-07 10:22:57 +0800 <RabMeir> @michaeljknowles Michael, please tell us you know what anecdotal evidence is, and how useful it is when proving a claim is true.
1313665580017356801 2020-10-07 10:20:55 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Check out the CVOID numbers in Atlantic Canada, Matt.  Why are you so triggered by masks?
1313664428550885378 2020-10-07 10:16:21 +0800 <RabMeir> @Cernovich I agree Mike!  We need to regulate food producers and get the sugar out.
1313664222430142464 2020-10-07 10:15:31 +0800 <RabMeir> @SamHarrisOrg How?
1313663969056428032 2020-10-07 10:14:31 +0800 <RabMeir> @ScottAdamsSays What did he actually say @ScottAdamsSays?  That the people there to protest removing the statue of Robert E. Lee were very fine people?  Is it weird they showed up at the same time as the Unite The Right rally, organized by Richard Spencer?  What do you think @RichardBSpencer?
1313663264077869057 2020-10-07 10:11:43 +0800 <RabMeir> @NickJFuentes Nick, I thought you were a Christian?
1313663141671317504 2020-10-07 10:11:14 +0800 <RabMeir> @bigboy11251537 @JadenPMcNeil Do you think his comments were kind?  Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you. â Ephesians 4:32
1313186941144367106 2020-10-06 02:38:59 +0800 <RabMeir> @bigboy11251537 @JadenPMcNeil That would imply that it's in any way consistent with the values of Christianity, which it clearly is not.  I suspect that @JadenPMcNeil just hates females and black people, so he's really triggered by this tragic story.  What do you think Jaden?
1313185553488150529 2020-10-06 02:33:28 +0800 <RabMeir> @ScottAdamsSays Do you think this is a problem with the hundred-thousand people every day, or are you perhaps not stating your thoughts clearly enough?  Let's try one: what do you think are the reasons for the wealth disparity between say, black and white families in the United States?
1313184586256482304 2020-10-06 02:29:37 +0800 <RabMeir> @ScottAdamsSays Are you open to honest discussion about some of your opinions?  Have you directly stated your opinions?  I have never seen you debate anyone who disagrees with you.  Are you willing to?
1312224236782735360 2020-10-03 10:53:32 +0800 <RabMeir> @JadenPMcNeil Honestly Jaden, you come across as if you hate black people.
1312223279365713921 2020-10-03 10:49:44 +0800 <RabMeir> @JadenPMcNeil Jaden, does the Christian religion teach you to call dead women "disgusting fat slobs" on the internet?
1312220230509383681 2020-10-03 10:37:37 +0800 <RabMeir> @HarleyPeyton @MattWalshBlog I am starting to think that Matt (and his wife) are trolling lefties on the internet for profit.
1312218839212589056 2020-10-03 10:32:05 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Matthew, do you think all leftists are "shitty" human beings?  Can you think of any "shitty" human beings produced by the Catholic culture?
1311842426399731712 2020-10-02 09:36:21 +0800 <RabMeir> @DarrenJBeattie Darren, is the winking face meant to imply they are both gay?  @NickJFuentes seems to like your joke. Does that make you happy?  Are you trying to make fun of gay people on the internet?
1311827485261205505 2020-10-02 08:36:59 +0800 <RabMeir> @PrisonPlanet Paul, has anyone ever claimed these statements ended racism?  Why do you keep posting this same thing over and over?  Do you like racism?
1311827145853935617 2020-10-02 08:35:38 +0800 <RabMeir> @DonaldJTrumpJr Junior Donald, you definitely realize the context of these statements is in no way comparable.  Let's begin a journey of truth together.  Take my hand son.  Walk with me.
1311825896337272833 2020-10-02 08:30:40 +0800 <RabMeir> @stillgray Ian, do you think Donald Trump has any history of, or current problems with race?
1311825249634324481 2020-10-02 08:28:06 +0800 <RabMeir> @scrowder Can you explain why?
1311824733734948864 2020-10-02 08:26:03 +0800 <RabMeir> @MattWalshBlog Matthew, will you make an honest attempt to understand the language used to discuss trans people?  Is it consistent with your faith to harass and bully a community of people on the internet?  A community with abnormally high rates of suicide?  Is that Catholic behavior?
1311499953433382913 2020-10-01 10:55:30 +0800 <RabMeir> @RubinReport David I would love to have a confirmation of the point you are making here: all gay people should agree with you?
1311498175530893312 2020-10-01 10:48:26 +0800 <RabMeir> @dbongino @MattWalshBlog Daniel, please help us clarify your point: BLM is a Marxist organization that is racist against white people, with legitimacy comparable to the Proud Boys?
1311478517872369665 2020-10-01 09:30:19 +0800 <RabMeir> Be lowly in spirit to every person.
1311478024118951936 2020-10-01 09:28:21 +0800 <RabMeir> Greetings @MattWalshBlog.  You are clearly a man of principles, so I would like to share mine with you.   https://t.co/JYw972A4BA  Perhaps together we can resolve some of the misunderstandings that have upset you so.
