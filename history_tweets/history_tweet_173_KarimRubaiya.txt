1343986219181436928 2020-12-30 02:24:19 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> 테형이 생일축합니다 너무 사랑함니다 당신을 주셔서 감사합니다 보라해💜💜💜  #HAPPYVDAY  #HappyBirthdayTaehyung  #HappyTaehyungDay
1343429394195365888 2020-12-28 13:31:41 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> the extreme between these two statements really sends
1343397300031221760 2020-12-28 11:24:10 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> things I did since I woke up an hour's ago:  watch Jungkook manspread.
1343310514479194112 2020-12-28 05:39:18 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> that lmao at the end really do be hitting me right now
1342825486276149249 2020-12-26 21:31:59 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> this tweet becomes more and more relevant with each passing day
1342447345401675777 2020-12-25 20:29:23 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> I'm laughing way too hard😂💯
1341672105012707328 2020-12-23 17:08:51 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> I fucking hate living and I'm not even saying that as a joke
1340931652617265152 2020-12-21 16:06:33 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> my biggest glow up is not being able to tell any of the BTS members apart, to listening to their entire discography (including their solo music), learning how to read and write Korean, while learning the words to most of their music as well as choreography in under 6 months.😸
1340777999369609219 2020-12-21 05:56:00 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> you know you are peak depressed when you find yourself binging on k-pop crack videos at 3 in the morning and still can't bring yourself to laugh unless someone accidentally cracks a penis joke, which is practically just that one time Tae mispronounced "Coke"
1340221025934401537 2020-12-19 17:02:47 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> Spotify is getting too comfortable with these triple and sometimes quadruple ads.
1340179415058157575 2020-12-19 14:17:26 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> I'm really enjoying all of these performances and the extra content, but are they even sleeping? or taking breaks?   I'm actually genuinely surprised at how much work they do outside of producing albums.
1339958640350908417 2020-12-18 23:40:09 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> @seokjindesi @yoongikillme reading this hurt me, physically 😩
1339869085635497984 2020-12-18 17:44:18 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> I've been checking my phone every 5 minutes while I'm watching Netflix. like someone's actually gonna text me lol
1339670478298832896 2020-12-18 04:35:06 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> you know what's cheating? playing Spring Day at the end of Break the Silence while the credits roll.   I absolutely did not cry when it ended🚣
1339118134364524545 2020-12-16 16:00:17 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> @_hoefortae_ @yoongikillme Jungkook didn't call him Harry Hyung-nim for nothing 😩
1338872746722279426 2020-12-15 23:45:12 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> Seokjin is me contemplating all my life decisions when I have to wake up at 6 am to revise for my exams after having stayed up till 2 the previous night because I refused to study beforehand.  https://t.co/LcKJC1lp0X
1338814618576199680 2020-12-15 19:54:13 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> The 2016 MAMA BTS stage is basically "cool boys in black skinny jeans and embroidered jackets ruining my life in the best way possible"   I stream it almost everyday for good luck😩  and I totally do not loop that TaeJin moment and the JiHope dance-off, I swear
1338695458126884864 2020-12-15 12:00:43 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> @gukookye @taegipathy this picture of Seokjin. an accurate representation of how I sit in my bed questioning all my life decisions the moment I wake up.
1338205538929102848 2020-12-14 03:33:57 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> I'm turning 21 in a month.  honestly, how the fuck am I still alive?
1337470080104292353 2020-12-12 02:51:30 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> don't do that. don't give me hope.
1337426239397658628 2020-12-11 23:57:18 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> we all know why Jimin is mad at Taehyung's shoes all the time  somebody teach the boy how to wear them right, please???
1337397400021782531 2020-12-11 22:02:42 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> yes, I got your letter yes, I'm doing better it cut deep to know, right to the bone....  .....I know that it's over, I don't need your closure
1337396570535337984 2020-12-11 21:59:24 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> "there'll be happiness after you, there was happiness because of you"                           -taylor swift, 2020
1337396255295586307 2020-12-11 21:58:09 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> taylor swift really wrote two whole songs on evermore just for me. this is the only type of holiday gift that I will accept now onwards.
1337024357223133196 2020-12-10 21:20:22 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> @taylorswift13 I'm gonna cry so much this time because I've lost people who I used to listen to your music with and life is nothing like it was four months ago, let alone a year.  Thank you for being a part of all the important milestones of my life.
1337023590697353217 2020-12-10 21:17:19 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> man, I'm so upset and happy at the same time.
1337021062391840768 2020-12-10 21:07:16 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> oh okay, I'll just ignore my exams then. That's perfectly okay. I don't fucking mind at all😭😭😭😭
1336891825676644352 2020-12-10 12:33:44 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> @yoongikillme manifesting good grades🕯️🙏
1336766418306547712 2020-12-10 04:15:24 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> when I make my mandatory year end post, @btsaeso gets the first mention.   no other person as consistent as this one right here. Congratulations on your website!  Thank you so much for everything that you do for us💜  borahae 💜💜💜

1335955376513028096 2020-12-07 22:32:37 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> with the western/non-Korean fanbase.   Moreover, he always makes it a point to appreciate anyone who tries to speak in Korean because he empathizes and understands how difficult it is to learn a whole language that isn't your mother tongue.  You've got to be more respectful
1335955372536786951 2020-12-07 22:32:36 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> has been a part of BTS' journey. He spoke in metaphors because he's a poet. He wasn't just saying random things.  You have absolutely no right to mock someone whose native language is not English. You don't understand the kind of effort the man puts in to be able to communicate
1335955370028625920 2020-12-07 22:32:35 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> RANT: Y'all really got to be a different breed if you need to mock someone's accent to put them down. Especially when it's someone like Namjoon. He's revolutionary. He's made a world of difference for us  He delivered the speech in English because he wanted to thank everyone who
1335670574387892224 2020-12-07 03:40:55 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> @btshopewrld @BTS_twt hon, this is truly funny but please get some rest. it's been a long day😭😂💜
1335599961338118146 2020-12-06 23:00:19 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> **AR WTF IDK HOW TO TYPE BECAUSE OF THIS

1335273640342900740 2020-12-06 01:23:38 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> yes, because I was so freaking amazed by it all. no, because I had never been at a worse place in life.   BTS helped me start my journey towards healing and while the early days with them were wonderful, I do not ever want to feel that kind of pain ever again.
1335243777309462530 2020-12-05 23:24:58 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> Psycho for SOTY and I'm not even a full-fledged reveluv. That song is just a bop. I mean, @RVsmtown really said vocals, y'all👀
1335209613369638913 2020-12-05 21:09:13 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> honestly, Black Swan deserved better
1335209421308190720 2020-12-05 21:08:27 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> no but J-hope really became Jung Hoseok today and slayed my life.  #MMA2020  @BTS_twt

1331437275142520834 2020-11-25 11:19:17 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> the queen is back to claim her throne
1331308750712410112 2020-11-25 02:48:35 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> It's representation for the kind of people who are often ignored every step of the way for being non-white and non-American.   I couldn't be prouder because this means that in a year of crisis and distance, we all came together to celebrate each other.
1331308748418080768 2020-11-25 02:48:34 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> this has been such wonderful day in terms of acknowledgment of art that I love.  Starting with Delhi Crime winning at the International Emmys and ending with a Korean band of brothers being nominated for the Grammys.   Both wins, poles apart but so, so important to me.

1316251926128852993 2020-10-14 13:38:08 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> @kthgifted why can I not stop watching this gahhhhh
1316229066953904131 2020-10-14 12:07:18 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> absolutely astonishing to me how many people actually know about BTS but most of them would rather hate on the boys than give them credit for all the wonderful work that they do.  your xenophobia and toxic masculine ideas are showing, hun. these boys paved the way.
1316038173902823424 2020-10-13 23:28:46 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> it's a Polynesian producer, a black singer/songwriter and, an Asian singer/songwriter septet at the top of the Billboard hot 100 this week. I don't care what you think of the music. This is much bigger than just that. It's representation and WE FUCKING LOVE TO SEE IT!!!

1315226390174732288 2020-10-11 17:43:01 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> the way BTS has made me so happy in the last two days is beyond comprehension even to my own mind if it wasn't for them, I'd have given up but they helped me find my way and purpose, at least for now I will always be grateful for them  #MapOfTheSoulOne_D2  #WeAreNotSevenWithYou

1305526416222552065 2020-09-14 23:18:47 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> kinda just want a do-over for Lover because it really just hurts to listen to a song that made me so happy that I cried in the middle of a busy canteen during its premiere and now I just cry into a pillow whenever it comes on
1305383365961330688 2020-09-14 13:50:21 +0800 <KarimRubaiya> I love this song. it deserves an MV. Fuck every other opinion.
