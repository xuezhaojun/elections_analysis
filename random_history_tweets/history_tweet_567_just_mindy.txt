1338124789328863232 2020-12-13 22:13:05 +0800 <just_mindy> As I said, she wrote a research paper.  In the midst of a pandemic when she insists on speaking out about matters of healthcare, it‚Äôs inappropriate to use her title as it misleads.  IE: Whoopi Goldberg thinking she was a medical doc

1337579031299055617 2020-12-12 10:04:26 +0800 <just_mindy> It‚Äôs almost as if people in NYC and Silicon Valley forget sitting and typing on laptops all day doesn‚Äôt build homes, grow food, maintain electrical lines, teach kids, deliver mail, put out fires, protect citizens, unclog toilets..you know other useful endeavors. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1337577696214310913 2020-12-12 09:59:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @LadyElinorD I just sent that tweet to mine and he replied ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get beat senseless‚Äù.  ü§£ü§£

1337573861416693761 2020-12-12 09:43:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Rewarding them for keeping that Hunter story hush hush
1337573493869862915 2020-12-12 09:42:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Grady protects the county where my son is a firefighter so I know he is always safe.
1337572382085615616 2020-12-12 09:38:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @Dan_Camm Probably true
1337572307989049346 2020-12-12 09:37:43 +0800 <just_mindy> The left really loves the idea of tattooing people, or branding people, or making them wear some identifier and that‚Äôs creepy.
1337571912650776578 2020-12-12 09:36:09 +0800 <just_mindy> You mean a Christian plans to celebrate their most religious holiday next to Easter?  How could he?
1337571002906238977 2020-12-12 09:32:32 +0800 <just_mindy> You would find life much different without food
1337570871322533889 2020-12-12 09:32:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Yeah, Florida with its ports and offshore oil and fish and seafood and agriculture trade would wither in minutes.  I wonder if this much stupid hurts? üôÑ

1337365100148248576 2020-12-11 19:54:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @noble150 Really stellar parenting happening here
1337363172131475456 2020-12-11 19:46:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Come back daily for tips on healthy non manipulative conversations with your teen.
1337363004653002752 2020-12-11 19:46:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Actual convo with my 14 year old last night (who btw has an awesome voice) Her: mom, do I have to sing at the Christmas party? Me: yes Her: argues for 10 minutes  Me: I housed you in my body for 39 weeks, you gave me stretch marks and I puked everyday.  You will sing &amp; like it
1337360359557095424 2020-12-11 19:35:31 +0800 <just_mindy> A 1600 week old fetus
1337358404239699969 2020-12-11 19:27:45 +0800 <just_mindy> And here‚Äôs my other question... Donna Shalala lost her election.  Why doesn‚Äôt her disclaimer say ‚ÄúMaria Salazar is the winner per....‚Äù.  Just asking for some consistency.  https://t.co/6XjBhSEDFH
1337357565164974080 2020-12-11 19:24:25 +0800 <just_mindy> And if this is their new policy, it best be across the board in 4 years if Biden loses reelection.
1337357229901623298 2020-12-11 19:23:05 +0800 <just_mindy> Has there been a cogent explanation from IG as to why they are now putting this Joe Biden disclaimer on LITRALLY anything @realDonaldTrump posts? This post was simply a Chanukah greeting and they added this disclaimer.  Trump is still POTUS until 1/21 no matter what.  https://t.co/YQ8P5sTyIw
1337356173004115971 2020-12-11 19:18:53 +0800 <just_mindy> They should start with y‚Äôall smothering the Biden story in October tbh

1336094271892500480 2020-12-08 07:44:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @Bro_Pair Do you normally exploit the death of a beloved teacher to advance a false political narrative or just this time? He was no longer teaching in a physical classroom.  Also, you are contributing to the neglect of millions of kids with your attitude. Kids need to be in school.

1336010128865304577 2020-12-08 02:10:11 +0800 <just_mindy> You have no idea how if here were acting and she could have kept driving and never acknowledged their existence
1336009914087563269 2020-12-08 02:09:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Not for nothing, but someone who loses it as this level should not be unsupervised around kids. I‚Äôm not kidding.  She‚Äôs unwell.

1335764931287846914 2020-12-07 09:55:51 +0800 <just_mindy> People are also saying this isn‚Äôt Warnock‚Äôs church.  This certainly isn‚Äôt the pulpit today.  Does anyone know when this pic was taken?  https://t.co/GUmW55nGY9
1335764074987212801 2020-12-07 09:52:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Hating the military and cops isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúreligion‚Äù. Opposition to infanticide, like ACB, is actually a part of Christianity
1335763735298908161 2020-12-07 09:51:06 +0800 <just_mindy> This is the kind of nonsense I hate.  Clearly she isn‚Äôt there as a parishioner, she is on stage, at I‚Äôm sure, some event.  Parishioners don‚Äôt sit on stage and the front row isn‚Äôt on stage Charles.  Have you ever gone to church?

1335630954459783177 2020-12-07 01:03:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @memes_range @BruceExotic The ‚Äúboard‚Äù isn‚Äôt really running the HOA anymore.  Property managers who line the pockets of attorneys are, and they receive additional funds when petty letters are sent out.  I‚Äôve been on all sides of it.
1335630675857248256 2020-12-07 01:02:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @memes_range @BruceExotic There really is zero legitimate purpose that shouldn‚Äôt be taken care of with city taxes.  A neighborhood pool or tennis court can be handled as a co-op with residents who want that amenity.  Most HOA‚Äôs are now run by property managers who advise boards to sue &amp; be heavy handed

1335394294673403911 2020-12-06 09:23:04 +0800 <just_mindy> My friend sent me a little note and it had 10 encouraging points on it.

1335304059151142912 2020-12-06 03:24:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Yet he still had a fraction of the nursing home deaths as Cuomo.

1335302625563172864 2020-12-06 03:18:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @le_blah @MarcACaputo Bro.  Clearly many people are in need of my reading comprehension class. The announcement DeSantis was making is it all teachers must make a minimum of $50,000 per year. The original poster states he makes $50,000 and his wife makes $50,000. That‚Äôs $100,000

My son was pulled from a state final by an ump when he was pitching because he forgot to remove his gold chain.  It stunk but kids don‚Äôt get to behave like that.
1335297242522132480 2020-12-06 02:57:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas Yep.  The trade off for no state income tax
1335295499318996997 2020-12-06 02:50:30 +0800 <just_mindy> I have 6 dogs and have never pulled any of their tails.  I‚Äôm weird, apparently

1335293987201163264 2020-12-06 02:44:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Also I now have 23 years in the system and make 59K so I have zero sympathy for starting teachers making 50K whining about it.
1335293531003510785 2020-12-06 02:42:41 +0800 <just_mindy> And by the way, this is my son‚Äôs choice.  I don‚Äôt think he deserves kudos.  It‚Äôs just the reality of public service starting salaries and why teachers in Fl should be grateful

1335293134318788608 2020-12-06 02:41:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @davidcmeyer It‚Äôs close to that here and we also get personal vacay days.
1335292906387763212 2020-12-06 02:40:12 +0800 <just_mindy> My son is a Firefighter|/EMT who could die any shift and works weekends and holidays and started at 40k in Florida so please cry more teachers making 50K at 21 years old and working 10 months a year.
1335292315057971201 2020-12-06 02:37:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @coUzo4 @MarcACaputo Lake Worth.  I‚Äôm quite aware of rental prices in Miami.  People have apartments that make less than 100k
1335292055258591232 2020-12-06 02:36:49 +0800 <just_mindy> I swear, people can‚Äôt read. Original poster - makes 50K His wife also a teacher - makes 50k That is 100K
1335291724915204112 2020-12-06 02:35:30 +0800 <just_mindy> I swear teachers are the worst &amp; I‚Äôm one.  DeSantis gets starting salaries in the top 5 IN THE NATION, we work 10 months a year, have decent healthcare, no state income tax and they still complain. We don‚Äôt miss holidays with our kids.  We work in AC.  Always aggrieved
1335290926403641353 2020-12-06 02:32:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalpuppy3 No, I‚Äôve actually been a teacher in Fl who started making 23k in 1997 and appreciate a politician FINALLY addressing salaries and then people crap on it
1335290389021028352 2020-12-06 02:30:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @FuckDHSandICE Yeah no.  The new law states teachers have to start at 50K.  That‚Äôs the announcememet Desantis was making.
1335290093863653376 2020-12-06 02:29:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalpuppy3 And frankly he and his wife don‚Äôt work holidays or weekends and have lots of summer off and have great healthcare (just like me, also a public school teacher) so maybe he should realize his lower salary has lots of perks
1335289763918716931 2020-12-06 02:27:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalpuppy3 Because the Governor worked hard to get Fl salaries up in the top 5 in the nation and he replies ‚Äúyeah let‚Äôs celebrate high salaries when my wife and I can‚Äôt afford a house‚Äù. So his personal issue means DeSantjs didn‚Äôt do good work on behalf of teachers?
1335289194139312134 2020-12-06 02:25:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @theamericanrd 100K is the minimum they would make.  New teachers have to make 50K in Fl
1335288991260807174 2020-12-06 02:24:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalpuppy3 They earn a minimum of 100k in Fl under this law. Teacher salary starts at 50K here by law.  If they have student debt, that has nothing to do with the salaries they are earning
1335288674314047493 2020-12-06 02:23:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @ouachita77 Yes, all of that
1335288187837702147 2020-12-06 02:21:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @JayPSU @MarcACaputo The announcement being mocked mandates starting teacher salaries at 50K in Florida.  Thanks
1335288016902959104 2020-12-06 02:20:46 +0800 <just_mindy> 2 people teaching is a minimum of 100K
1335287879963205633 2020-12-06 02:20:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @Smitty9215 @MarcACaputo People have apartments in Miami that make less than 100k a year.  Many of my students and their families for example.
1335287624026779649 2020-12-06 02:19:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @Smitty9215 @MarcACaputo I‚Äôm a public school teacher.  The new law mandates demands 50K starting for new teachers.  He said he and his wife both teach. 50 plus 50 means they make a minimum of 100k
1335287154193338370 2020-12-06 02:17:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @ouachita77 I understand with how they‚Äôve treated their elderly
1335286107622281216 2020-12-06 02:13:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Y‚Äôall make 100k minimum and can‚Äôt afford an apartment in Miami? I mean, yeah not on the beach but.....

1335277740795244544 2020-12-06 01:39:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Pub subs are overrated
1335273627537838083 2020-12-06 01:23:35 +0800 <just_mindy> My son is a first responder in Fl.  My cousin is a nurse and her husband is doctor.  Our hospitals aren‚Äôt overrun.
1335269755243081730 2020-12-06 01:08:12 +0800 <just_mindy> Hi @GovRonDeSantis.  Please address.
1335269527630848001 2020-12-06 01:07:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Because the majority of our state doesn‚Äôt want @RonDeSantisFL to be a petty tyrant.  If you want that, move to NY or Cali.
1335268739365957632 2020-12-06 01:04:10 +0800 <just_mindy> I worked my way through college in 1997, pal. Hershey bars were like $1.80.

1335245111916171273 2020-12-05 23:30:16 +0800 <just_mindy> We have fewer deaths and hospitalizations which actually matter.
1335244553062912002 2020-12-05 23:28:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @2021Labs @BenFischerSBJ She lives in NY.  Pretty sure she can find it on a map
1335244273445429248 2020-12-05 23:26:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @kagamine_taylor @NarwhalNico @NateSilver538 No he‚Äôs not. Infection rates are meaningless.  Hospital beds &amp; deaths matter.
1335244016582012928 2020-12-05 23:25:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Ppl in NYC claim it takes hours to get tested.  I can get tested right now at 6 different places in Fl within 3 miles.
1335243768480587778 2020-12-05 23:24:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Except for like 3 days this week, people in Fl run AC EVERY DAY all day long.  Not sure who told you we don‚Äôt use AC in Fl in November.  Mine is on right now.
1335127655243542528 2020-12-05 15:43:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Bye!!!
1335127567305732101 2020-12-05 15:43:12 +0800 <just_mindy> Or what? Like Matt or any other Floridian cares what the Gov of NJ thinks.  People leave NJ in droves to come to FL, not the other way around

People on Twitter complained before Tgiving of waiting hours for a test in NYC. I live in a rural Fl &amp; can get tested at 6 different places in a 5 mile radius.  Testing is easy here = more cases

1334927000721649664 2020-12-05 02:26:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @j_mt_ams I have no idea what can or will be proven but ‚Äúit‚Äôs only fraud if you can prove it‚Äù isn‚Äôt an acceptable answer.  No matter the outcome of this election, things need to be investigated
1334925151717232640 2020-12-05 02:18:52 +0800 <just_mindy> The reason I know there was fraud is because Dems in my own county attempted ballot harvesting. They were just dumb enough to put their illegal activity on FB.  Other Dems apparently are slightly more capable.

1334630794762080257 2020-12-04 06:49:12 +0800 <just_mindy> They are livid he won‚Äôt be a dictator and force them to comply and send cops after people who don‚Äôt obey.  What have we become as Americans? It‚Äôs nuts.
1334630588553322496 2020-12-04 06:48:23 +0800 <just_mindy> After seeing people denigrate DeSantis for allowing Floridians to live free &amp; have personal choice, I get it.  Ppl go on the #DeathSantis hashtag and demand he force people to wear masks, shut down schools and businesses, &amp; force us all to our homes.  They are angry at him.
1334630036272541698 2020-12-04 06:46:11 +0800 <just_mindy> So if you spent a lot of time in Sunday School as a kid, you learned about the Israelites begging God for a king. It was such a hard idea to grasp.  Why would people want to be ruled over after experiencing freedom?! Why beg?!

The only good part of the cold.  I don‚Äôt have panties on under my leggings either because eff all restricting things

These things are deeply personal &amp; the heart wants what it wants.  Love &amp; intimacy surprises us all, sometimes.

1333265502345551873 2020-11-30 12:24:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @justanurse25 @logiccounselor I did mine at 21 because of the stones.  I‚Äôm super fastidious with oral health because my mom worked for a dentist but I couldn‚Äôt stop the bad breath from the stones. My first husband said we had to do something.  Never another issue since.
1333264901771587584 2020-11-30 12:21:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @justanurse25 Yes.  At 21.  It sucked for a week but so glad I did it.

1333263150226022400 2020-11-30 12:14:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @sandsalamander Ha!!! Same!
1333263101974769664 2020-11-30 12:14:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity What is meant for me will come.
1333261504389533696 2020-11-30 12:08:08 +0800 <just_mindy> But what I‚Äôm not fixing to do is cry because these eyelashes cost too much for me to wash them away and look like one of those skinless cats
1333260929811746818 2020-11-30 12:05:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity Ha!!!  Apparently it‚Äôs not that hard!

1333260444195229696 2020-11-30 12:03:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity Yep.  Let‚Äôs not do that.  Just be honest and not waste each other‚Äôs time.
1333260183246688256 2020-11-30 12:02:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @Tazatator I love that!!

1333258542107734017 2020-11-30 11:56:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, can we normalize just being honest and open and not beating around the bush if a dating relationship is no longer serving you? I would rather just get the truth. Don‚Äôt try &amp; spare my feelings. Don‚Äôt be mean in hopes the other person just gets the hint. Just end it.

1333175468619657220 2020-11-30 06:26:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Remember Psaki was responsible for this campaign that totally changed Russia‚Äôs mind about Ukraine.  https://t.co/6CPTYpewb3
1333174539551969281 2020-11-30 06:22:34 +0800 <just_mindy> She‚Äôs already been in the WH with Obama.  Everyone knows how to say her name, doofus
1333174302947094536 2020-11-30 06:21:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Psaki was embarrassing during Obama.  Yuck to having to see her again.
1333170935331921920 2020-11-30 06:08:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden literally didn‚Äôt answer one question of any substance the whole campaign but ok
1333170715768582148 2020-11-30 06:07:22 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  The media was so fair and their coverage so glowing in regards to Trump üôÑ
1333166753409605633 2020-11-30 05:51:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @KinCali1 @bccover @Ruggable I know!  I‚Äôve been so tempted and I‚Äôm glad to hear all these great reviews

1333166186629099520 2020-11-30 05:49:22 +0800 <just_mindy> Because he‚Äôs old and feeble and not very lucid and for some reason, the press pool chose to ignore this the whole campaign.
1333165135645601793 2020-11-30 05:45:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @bccover @Ruggable Thanks for the tip!!  I think I‚Äôm going to order one!

1333162093047144449 2020-11-30 05:33:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @PatriotBeez You‚Äôre welcome
1333161764561838082 2020-11-30 05:31:48 +0800 <just_mindy> I thought Biden was 76.  He‚Äôs 78.
1333161143980986370 2020-11-30 05:29:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @JeffJoh41591476 I am beginning to wonder
1333161045960110097 2020-11-30 05:28:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @TagSherman You know anytime a very old man has an orthopedic issue, it leads to decline

1333159581984444420 2020-11-30 05:23:07 +0800 <just_mindy> I thought they would at least wait until Biden was sworn in to start laying the groundwork for ‚Äúhis health has declined &amp; he is stepping down‚Äù.
1333159260801347587 2020-11-30 05:21:51 +0800 <just_mindy> This

1333158387270479874 2020-11-30 05:18:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Kamala will be President sooner than we imagined
1333155263113781252 2020-11-30 05:05:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @SallyRoth @Ruggable Awesome!!  I will check it out
1333154339213500420 2020-11-30 05:02:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @SallyRoth @Ruggable Is that a cleaner?
1333154269042765830 2020-11-30 05:02:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @ZacBissonnette @bethanyshondark This hospital chain has 21 hospitals and a total of 49 ICU patients with COVID.  That‚Äôs like 2 per hospital.  This reporting is ridiculous
1333153232651169795 2020-11-30 04:57:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @HoosierInfidel @Ruggable Just got another thumbs up testimonial!
1333153125386121222 2020-11-30 04:57:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @bccover @Ruggable Awesome!! I‚Äôm so excited because I wanted a big rug but the dogs made it impossible until I saw this option!!
1333152764545953794 2020-11-30 04:56:02 +0800 <just_mindy> This is what I mean. This article has been debunked but people still believe it
1333152479211642887 2020-11-30 04:54:54 +0800 <just_mindy> And again, data has shown 30 year old people rarely get in ‚Äúcritical condition‚Äù from COVID. A total of 12 people in their thirties have died from COVID in all of VA for example.
1333151833397858305 2020-11-30 04:52:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Maybe, just maybe, anytime a 30 year old gets sick from anything, they usually ignore it because young.  Duh.
1333150963331379200 2020-11-30 04:48:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @bethanyshondark Her data makes me incredulous as well
1333150705167851520 2020-11-30 04:47:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude But her thread was talking about 30 year olds.
1333150601782419466 2020-11-30 04:47:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @HoosierInfidel @Ruggable So far, one person answered they love theirs!!!
1333150462216982528 2020-11-30 04:46:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @BenignApathy She said she worked with @BalladHealth.  They have 21 hospitals in Va and TN &amp; currently have 49 total COVId patients in ICU.  I‚Äôm confused about how staff is seeing multiple dead people a day
1333150171329421315 2020-11-30 04:45:44 +0800 <just_mindy> This hospital chain has 21 hospitals &amp; just reported they have 49 people TOTAL in iCU for Covid.  That‚Äôs like 2 people a hospital.  How are they seeing multiple dead a day?
1333148659282825217 2020-11-30 04:39:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Would love to know where in Appalachia they are seeing multiple deaths a day in a hospital.  This feels like that other story where it was revealed there had been a total of 8 deaths in the whole town in months.
1333147939536056324 2020-11-30 04:36:52 +0800 <just_mindy> I learned about @Ruggable on Tik Tok, per all other things in my life.  https://t.co/LaX0aDqGAg

1333145706350186497 2020-11-30 04:27:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, I‚Äôm considering this one.  My house is very cottage boho vibe in case you want to comment on that as well.  https://t.co/D0iJ7iSFh1

1333145293832003597 2020-11-30 04:26:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Have any of my Tweeps (particularly pet owners) purchased a rug from @Ruggable? My doxies have occasional accidents so I have no large rugs and it seems like such an awesome option to be able to remove the top layer &amp; wash.  Do they wash up well? Do you like?

1332888611814043650 2020-11-29 11:26:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 You just have to hope you cover your tracks long enough that they tape over themselves after 48 hours or 7 days
1332888450677297153 2020-11-29 11:25:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @caeser_pounce Yes!!! Toll booths mess folks up
1332888375695695872 2020-11-29 11:25:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @chris_b4 It will be a battle.  I‚Äôm friends with Forsythe‚Äôs Dad (OL) and Trask‚Äôs GF is the daughter of my friend who passed away from breast cancer in her 30‚Äôs.  So for personal reasons I want them to excel.
1332887187239694337 2020-11-29 11:20:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @chris_b4 My BF is a Bama fan so I hear this all the time and like I told him, Bama will likely win this year.  It‚Äôs just the game everyone is waiting on.
1332886887162372096 2020-11-29 11:19:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Don‚Äôt take your cell phone with you.  Don‚Äôt go through any toll booths.  Antifreeze tastes like Gatorade is pretty effective. Throw out the bottle and receipts when done.  Also the glass you used.  Have a burner phone for your side piece.  Look nothing up on the home computer.
1332885755417473024 2020-11-29 11:15:02 +0800 <just_mindy> We need to fast forward to the UF vs Alabama game.  That‚Äôs what everyone is waiting for and how the Heisman will be decided.
1332885016955777029 2020-11-29 11:12:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Kind of like when UF beats FSU

1332864382620102658 2020-11-29 09:50:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Women need to communicate what works and doesn‚Äôt and that generally only happens when there is enough relationship to support that vulnerability.

1332360544804810757 2020-11-28 00:28:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Walmart, Target, etc have all thrived during this pandemic.  They don‚Äôt need your money.  Your local store does.  Desperately.
1332360149462360065 2020-11-28 00:26:28 +0800 <just_mindy> For me? Sweet Nothings Marketplace in Mascotte, Fl.  They don‚Äôt Twitter but they do FB so I‚Äôll hype them there.  I will buy ornaments for our work ornament exchange.
1332359874299224068 2020-11-28 00:25:22 +0800 <just_mindy> We all know Small Business has been hit hard by quarantine. To some that is a bug, others of us feel maybe that‚Äôs a bit intentional. To combat that, use your dolla dolla bills baby. Think of 1 small business you can shop with this weekend. Then, hype that store on social media.

1331973701189898240 2020-11-26 22:50:51 +0800 <just_mindy> To all the big mads about the Supreme Court decision, welcome to America where what you think of anyone‚Äôs religion doesn‚Äôt matter and we all get to worship or not how we choose.  Literally, why our nation was founded.  If you don‚Äôt like that, maybe try another country?

1331498978635116545 2020-11-25 15:24:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Some families know how to cook, and enjoy spending time together.

1331294836373262339 2020-11-25 01:53:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @ronni_g Our school sends a recording if there has been a case
1331294736011980800 2020-11-25 01:52:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @VeritasAntequam Since we have seen kids aren‚Äôt great vectors of disease, probably not many. A single mom with a 6 yr old needs her kid in school. It‚Äôs way more risky for her to not have an option for her child
1331294410215133187 2020-11-25 01:51:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 Yep
1331294366326018049 2020-11-25 01:51:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x You do know a radiologist and a psychologist are completely different things? A radiologist is an actual MD
1331294161614614529 2020-11-25 01:50:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x Are we equating a radiologist with a psychologist? Please.
1331293981075005442 2020-11-25 01:49:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @bbanck Always does
1331293929812205576 2020-11-25 01:49:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly!!!
1331293848186839041 2020-11-25 01:49:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude It is a beautiful thing
1331293724626784257 2020-11-25 01:48:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok?! And. A kid caught a virus. They likely will be asymptomatic.
1331293517524643841 2020-11-25 01:48:03 +0800 <just_mindy> You know who else cares about their kids?Police, firefighters, Nurses, Doctors, Grocery workers, truck drivers, sanitation workers, linemen, mailmen, retail workers, people who work at Disney, child care workers..but they are all going to work.  Teachers aren‚Äôt a protected class
1331292321447546886 2020-11-25 01:43:18 +0800 <just_mindy> You‚Äôre a psychologist. You understand zip about virus spread.  And as a psychologist, you should know mental health in children is at a crisis level
1331292003854905346 2020-11-25 01:42:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Are the teachers sick or exposed? If it‚Äôs ‚Äúexposed‚Äù, this is why adults should not be working closely with more adults than necessary.  They should only be quarantined if they are around an infected adult for more than 30 minutes within 6 ft
1331291607233159174 2020-11-25 01:40:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Then they should lose their jobs.  All kinds of other essential workers are going to work.
1331291449455996931 2020-11-25 01:39:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Is it sick staff or ‚Äúexposed‚Äù staff quarantining?
1331291274939420682 2020-11-25 01:39:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Where is the evidence of sick students?
1331291183830749185 2020-11-25 01:38:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Florida is completely open and so are schools and have been for months and are numbers aren‚Äôt bad
1331291020999471104 2020-11-25 01:38:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Yet it‚Äôs not happening, you aren‚Äôt calling out Cuomo and other blue state Governors, you aren‚Äôt criticizing teacher unions, you aren‚Äôt criticizing Biden for stacking his Ed Transition team with Union heads adamantly opposed to choice by families.  Do your job.

1331282811505041408 2020-11-25 01:05:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @UtterDisgust Obviously, good people feel it‚Äôs our responsibility to rear our own children.  Unfortunately, not all parents are good people and school was a safety net for the kids of abusive (or more often, neglectful) parents
1331282143297888265 2020-11-25 01:02:51 +0800 <just_mindy> So you‚Äôre saying the market works? Ok cool yes that‚Äôs true.

1331275722548256775 2020-11-25 00:37:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden doesn‚Äôt care about y‚Äôall or your bloc of voters.  He used you to get elected.
1331274862338433024 2020-11-25 00:33:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Zero Christians should even slightly consider voting for @ReverendWarnock. Any Pastor who openly advocates for abortion is diametrically opposed to the Bible and is a dangerous false prophet.  He should not have the vote of any Christ follower.  Democrat or not.
1331273926954119176 2020-11-25 00:30:12 +0800 <just_mindy> Y‚Äôall.  Oximeters are so important.  Docs have said people don‚Äôt realize how low their Oxygen saturation is with this virus.  I have my parents check twice a day.

1331263294926184456 2020-11-24 23:47:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy @Neoavatara I know it.  It‚Äôs frustrating
1331263212172537858 2020-11-24 23:47:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @OCpatriot123 It really is a good state!!
1331260493051334661 2020-11-24 23:36:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @ronni_g It doesn‚Äôt surprise me
1331260183528558595 2020-11-24 23:35:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity Exactly.
1331260143317770244 2020-11-24 23:35:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @OCpatriot123 Oh my family are all conservative and voted Trump.  They just didn‚Äôt realize we were so open here
1331259954259501057 2020-11-24 23:34:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara That‚Äôs the one thing that makes me nuts.  They move away from NY and vote for the same bad policy here
1331259503086608391 2020-11-24 23:32:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @Scottbiggie @thebradfordfile @EdAsante77 Most do, but to have our kids back in school and playing sports and having clubs make it worth it
1331258998272749571 2020-11-24 23:30:53 +0800 <just_mindy> No we don‚Äôt.  And that‚Äôs clear as we picked up more seats in the House, the state house and went for Trump
1331258575159783425 2020-11-24 23:29:12 +0800 <just_mindy> They really don‚Äôt.  I talked to my cousins in San Clemente and they had no idea we were living normal lives.
1331258284913942530 2020-11-24 23:28:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Mostly NY transplants who are used to government mandating their every move.  Natives love Gov DeSantis. As do other freedom loving folks who‚Äôve moved here
1331257649862676480 2020-11-24 23:25:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Wait, what??
1331257440898310146 2020-11-24 23:24:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @auntieamy90 @manuphatak @thebradfordfile No state income tax in Fl either!
1331243833447866368 2020-11-24 22:30:37 +0800 <just_mindy> The reason we are back in school is this is a right to work state and Unions don‚Äôt run it. We don‚Äôt elect Unions.  We elect legislators. They need to get a backbone.
1331243579382132736 2020-11-24 22:29:37 +0800 <just_mindy> No parent in these United States should accept the premise kids can‚Äôt be back in school.  DeSantis demanded it &amp; it happened in August in Fl.  Kids are great.  We know there is no evidence kids spread it. This is the third largest state in the Union folks. There is no excuse.
1331242934956683270 2020-11-24 22:27:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @MarcusWhaley1 @sarah_wxtx Florida schools have been in person since August with very few having to shut down for 10 days.  We are having sports, etc. There is no need for prioritizing kids. They should all be back
1331227544595685376 2020-11-24 21:25:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude The issue is they aren‚Äôt enforcing a law.  They‚Äôre enforcing an edict from a power hungry Governor
1331131677574311936 2020-11-24 15:04:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh she will be dead in a few days
1331131354193530886 2020-11-24 15:03:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Or a train.  Or go to a concert.

Are you concerned that Biden ruined a man‚Äôs life lying that he killed his wife &amp; daughter while driving drunk when the man wasn‚Äôt drunk and Biden‚Äôs wife was actually at fault?  Do you care Biden doesn‚Äôt acknowledge his grandkid?

1331126893618327552 2020-11-24 14:45:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Melania speaks 7 languages.  Jill Biden is a fake Dr who would cry after one day in a high school classroom.  Calm down. Also, I thought the left decried insulting sex workers and ‚Äúslut shaming‚Äù?
1331124803001069568 2020-11-24 14:37:38 +0800 <just_mindy> The House controls the purse strings.  Dems control the House. Where is Nance?
1331124418068815872 2020-11-24 14:36:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @MustangMommie @foodgod The amount of infections is a useless measure.  All that says is people have it and they may be asymptomatic and we are getting closer to herd immunity.  Our death rate and hospitalizations low.  That‚Äôs the important metrics.

Our hospitals are not overwhelmed and the death rate is low.  We also have more cases because clearly it‚Äôs way easier to test here than in NY.
1330947497288720386 2020-11-24 02:53:05 +0800 <just_mindy> There are LITRALLY 6 places, yes 6 places I can go right now &amp; get a rapid test with no wait.  Within 10 miles. So, how is @GovRonDeSantis ‚Äúfailing‚Äù his citizens yet Cuomo is receiving an award? Please explain.
1330946854826233859 2020-11-24 02:50:32 +0800 <just_mindy> So I just listened to @JessicaTarlov on Fox &amp; she states in NYC she waited for 6 hours for a COVID Test.  That is a blue state with the amazing Governor Cuomo at the head.  I live in a red state led by @RonDeSantisFL in a rural area.

1330169099943632898 2020-11-21 23:20:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes yes yes!!! Again, there are so many similarities to people being HIV + in the 80‚Äôs. We vilified people &amp; they didn‚Äôt test or tested and didn‚Äôt tell people.  This is terrible for public health.

1330003233083887618 2020-11-21 12:20:55 +0800 <just_mindy> He can‚Äôt even get the saying correct: mi casa you casa? Bro, it‚Äôs ‚Äúmi casa es su casa‚Äù.

We don‚Äôt want him to feel unsupported and I assure you the other side is aggressive and hostile.
1330000463425654789 2020-11-21 12:09:55 +0800 <just_mindy> States are closing churches again.  He has refused to.  States are closing schools again.  He has refused to.  States are closing restaurants &amp; entertainment again.  He has refused to.  Our unemployment rate is back in the 6% range &amp; our hospitals aren‚Äôt overwhelmed.
1330000058926948352 2020-11-21 12:08:18 +0800 <just_mindy> I know I fan girl for @GovRonDeSantis &amp; @RonDeSantisFL but when I see and hear what other states are facing, it is so clear we are blessed to have a Gov who respects our freedom.

1329998227706408963 2020-11-21 12:01:02 +0800 <just_mindy> 250k are dead.  Where are we getting half a million?  Also cite those promises! I‚Äôd love to hear.

1329995633630072834 2020-11-21 11:50:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Now we just got the guy who lied about his wife and child‚Äôs death, done nothing but government jobs so he‚Äôs lived off the tax payer, locked millions of black men up and is senile.  Man, what an improvement.

1329962750383153152 2020-11-21 09:40:03 +0800 <just_mindy> In an orange grove around a bonfire drinking beer and reminding everyone to close the gate so the cows don‚Äôt get out.  Ending the night in the Quonset Hut getting it on with what became husband #1 eventually
1329961813262393346 2020-11-21 09:36:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Amen
1329961315167858691 2020-11-21 09:34:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Actually not what the Constitution says.  It doesn‚Äôt make allowances for viruses that kill less than 1% of the time
1329960977476046848 2020-11-21 09:33:01 +0800 <just_mindy> You realize science LITRALLY says lockdowns don‚Äôt work so this has nothing to do with containing a virus?

1329950168804945920 2020-11-21 08:50:04 +0800 <just_mindy> If Trump being President kept you awake for 4 years, seek therapy
1329949838839066627 2020-11-21 08:48:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Can you people retain a tiny shred of dignity?  Biden is a old man. Surely he can‚Äôt stand this much fellating? I don‚Äôt know a 20 year old man who could take this much, really.

1329886353174171653 2020-11-21 04:36:29 +0800 <just_mindy> I told my son to stop introducing me to girls because I get too much anxiety when he breaks up.

1329880075542654977 2020-11-21 04:11:32 +0800 <just_mindy> I showed this to my Dad and his one remark is ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt he just poke him in the eyes?‚Äù.  Typical Florida man ish.

1329768040075026432 2020-11-20 20:46:21 +0800 <just_mindy> It was a press conference about COvID
1329767140942077953 2020-11-20 20:42:46 +0800 <just_mindy> She fell in love with a Hawaiian florist and got lei‚Äôd

1329765282341130240 2020-11-20 20:35:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Yup
1329765154406461446 2020-11-20 20:34:53 +0800 <just_mindy> This should absolutely be eliminated
1329763678376357895 2020-11-20 20:29:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Those mainly happen to women. No biggie.
1329763073691951107 2020-11-20 20:26:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Preach
1329760503544107010 2020-11-20 20:16:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @SWHesq Stuff like this freaking terrifies me
1329760246718476289 2020-11-20 20:15:23 +0800 <just_mindy> The 78 year old version is already terrifying
1329759426824253440 2020-11-20 20:12:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @EIowaGuy The press was way worse with Biden.  They‚Äôve made it clear they will not report on anything that hurts a Dem candidate.

1329755931882688512 2020-11-20 19:58:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Again, people who don‚Äôt have enough self awareness to recognize Trump is a symptom of Obama.
1329755580655931392 2020-11-20 19:56:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Me too &amp; it‚Äôs no longer political.  He‚Äôs just so arrogant &amp; impressed with himself.
1329755059333304321 2020-11-20 19:54:46 +0800 <just_mindy> And this is the spirit in which we all should move
1329754860934336512 2020-11-20 19:53:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @NathanMartin Yes!!!!  Lots of heart attacks!! That‚Äôs how Matthew McConaughey‚Äôs dad died.
1329661501238620161 2020-11-20 13:43:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep!
1329661405570674688 2020-11-20 13:42:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh yes!! That was another thing.
1329661253103591425 2020-11-20 13:42:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @Frank_Gotch I definitely can see his point
1329661061637791744 2020-11-20 13:41:15 +0800 <just_mindy> I don‚Äôt walk around questioning election results. I knew Obama won 2008. 2012 I had hopes for Mitt but knew he had been beat.  The ‚ÄúBiden win‚Äù just doesn‚Äôt feel feel right or real or valid in my bones. Sorry.
1329660572992942083 2020-11-20 13:39:19 +0800 <just_mindy> 15. I can listen to Biden like most logical humans and know he isn‚Äôt fully cognizant.  People hates Kamala. Even Dems.  She was like 12th in NH. I won‚Äôt ever believe people thought those 2 would be fit leaders. Trump is Trump but is the devil you know
1329660017851715585 2020-11-20 13:37:06 +0800 <just_mindy> 12. The left is cray &amp; will stop at nothing to oust Trump 13. A 3% rejection rate in GA for absentee ballots in the past is more like 0.3% this year.  14. Trump winning Florida by 3 points which is unheard of in Florida lately. Florida is a diverse population.
1329659384381779974 2020-11-20 13:34:35 +0800 <just_mindy> 8. The Georgia broken water pipe was a lie  9. Philly making it so difficult for poll &amp; ballot watchers  10. The AG of Penn tweet that Biden couldn‚Äôt lose.  11. All kinds of reports of bad behavior at Philly polls that came in all day long.
1329658741130731528 2020-11-20 13:32:02 +0800 <just_mindy> 5. Biden‚Äôs whole campaign was very strange as if they knew there was no way they‚Äôd lose. In essence, they didn‚Äôt campaign. At all. 6. The left was adamant about mail in voting and that was ripe for fraud 7. Ballot harvesting happened in my county
1329658256504057856 2020-11-20 13:30:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm willing to wait to see what happens w/ Election: 1. Biblical prophecy (fine if that isn‚Äôt your jam) 2. don‚Äôt think Biden got millions more votes than Obama 3. The 6 states where all the problems were all suddenly stopped counting 4. Florida &amp; Ohio are bellweathers
1329657326060662784 2020-11-20 13:26:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes
1329657249330061313 2020-11-20 13:26:06 +0800 <just_mindy> I would like to see some evidence too but I‚Äôm willing to wait a couple more weeks.

1329623458410598402 2020-11-20 11:11:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @prestonbaines I‚Äôm glad you insisted.  Our older relatives have listened to so much Media it can be overwhelming for thrm.  Yes, this has to stop
1329623205062070272 2020-11-20 11:10:49 +0800 <just_mindy> We fly planes, drive cars, climb mountains, ride bicycles, swim in the ocean, bungee jump, ride horses, eat food, have elective surgery, drink alcohol, scuba dive, have sex, give birth.  People have died doing all these things yet we still do them. Safety isn‚Äôt everything.
1329620570225455112 2020-11-20 11:00:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes!! What has come of us?
1329620419662516225 2020-11-20 10:59:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @jannyfayray I wish!

1329613235209768960 2020-11-20 10:31:12 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  She always has a new demon
1329613112127971334 2020-11-20 10:30:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jaihawkk Ha!! Fair!!
1329609912117317634 2020-11-20 10:18:00 +0800 <just_mindy> You are not an asshole
1329609667656486913 2020-11-20 10:17:02 +0800 <just_mindy> And after 10 days they all come back and then they can teach again.  That doesn‚Äôt mean schools stay shut forever.
1329608942469713921 2020-11-20 10:14:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes. Just like adults are forced to be doctors, nurses, police, firemen, grocery store employees, realtors, amusement park workers, waiters, sanitation workers, linemen, etc.  Teachers aren‚Äôt a protected class.
1329608398418169859 2020-11-20 10:11:59 +0800 <just_mindy> There have been 5 in one Arizona county recently
1329608308026728461 2020-11-20 10:11:38 +0800 <just_mindy> You also say you are married af.  Many men &amp; women aren‚Äôt.  Who is caring for their kids so they can work? You understand having a partner makes life more doable in circumstances like this.
1329607966312566784 2020-11-20 10:10:16 +0800 <just_mindy> Schools aren‚Äôt breeding grounds when everyone is masked, additional sanitation measures are taken, kids practice social distance and kids with fevers are excluded.  My child goes to a school with 2400 kids. There have been 9 cases since August.
1329607207823028232 2020-11-20 10:07:15 +0800 <just_mindy> And again, I know for sure there was ballot harvesting in my county because they weren‚Äôt trying to hide it.  A local commissioner told ppl to bring their ballots to her at a park for food and free tutoring for their kids.  ON FACEBOOk! It didn‚Äôt matter in Fl, but it happened.
1329606222060920832 2020-11-20 10:03:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeclay22598848 @AbigailShrier He does
1329606136069300224 2020-11-20 10:03:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Hilary Clinton comes out at least quarterly claiming she is the rightful President &amp; her election was stolen.  If you didn‚Äôt faint over the fragility of the Union every time she did that, have a seat.
1329604215161958405 2020-11-20 09:55:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl Oh yes.  Identical
1329604128675401730 2020-11-20 09:55:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @ilikedags17 Sure, but don‚Äôt expect me to get vapors over Guiliani
1329604027659788288 2020-11-20 09:54:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @DestructiveChem The last 4 years the Democrats who also allegedly represent the US have talked about pee tapes and Russian interference and stolen elections.  For 4 years.  Trump was Putin‚Äôs bitch.  You remember all of that, I assume .
1329603661824208898 2020-11-20 09:53:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @TXVet4Trump Ha!! Same
1329603579095773185 2020-11-20 09:52:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl Very much on the pulse of the people
1329603510334332928 2020-11-20 09:52:34 +0800 <just_mindy> I wonder if Dem lawmakers or members of Biden‚Äôs cabinet will be allowed to eat in peace? Being part of the ‚Äúresistance‚Äù seemed so fun until your guy is in power.  I wonder if Kevin McCarthy will get the chance to dramatically tear up a speech.
1329602995764547585 2020-11-20 09:50:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Maybe have Jill‚Äôs first husband &amp; Hunter‚Äôs stripper baby mama on Fox News.  Hell, we know very little about Ashley and why she is always hidden.  That might be fascinating TV.  They might even find enough to impeach old Joe.
1329602457756905473 2020-11-20 09:48:23 +0800 <just_mindy> So yep, our side might decide Biden isn‚Äôt entitled to one ounce of respect.  Maybe they‚Äôll investigate him and Hunty if we win the House in 2022 for the next 2 years and lay out all the salacious details of his family life.  Perhaps find old friends to write books about it.
1329601934614007808 2020-11-20 09:46:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Don‚Äôt even get me started on the press acting like cheap escorts anytime Adam Schiff ‚Äúleaked‚Äù some new salacious story or Obama‚Äôs govt spying on the Trump transition with no consequence. They gave Trump not one ounce of respect his entire Presidency.  Not a modicum
1329601418823659521 2020-11-20 09:44:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Person who doesn‚Äôt get ramming through Ocare in the middle of the night, Obama‚Äôs pen &amp; phone, Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúwin elections‚Äù snark, Pelosi‚Äôs refusal to do anything worthwhile, the press acting as an arm of the DNC is what led us here.  73 million ppl don‚Äôt care how he‚Äôs acting.
1329600457929617408 2020-11-20 09:40:26 +0800 <just_mindy> But y‚Äôall think Guiliani looks crazy on TV.   K.
1329600126462140422 2020-11-20 09:39:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl Oh it is, but they are way more intellectual than you or I, you see.
1329599595454803968 2020-11-20 09:37:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Some of these same people think Stacy Abrams had legitimate gripes in her race against Kemp as well.
1329599028930240512 2020-11-20 09:34:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl Some of them still believe that
1329597838402215938 2020-11-20 09:30:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicsofamy They still made him quarantine 10 days. He never had any symptoms
1329596048931696641 2020-11-20 09:22:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicsofamy Same thing happened to one of my son‚Äôs friends.  He is a college athlete and took 2 one day that were positive and 2 the next thing that were negative.  It‚Äôs nuts

1329564906824331270 2020-11-20 07:19:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @reeb1011 They really don‚Äôt get that Twitter isn‚Äôt real life
1329564778751287296 2020-11-20 07:18:40 +0800 <just_mindy> I say this because my Dad is a popular bloke and about 10 of his friends have called excited about the press conference. These are all men who had pretty brilliant careers or owned businesses.
1329563930897813509 2020-11-20 07:15:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh You always bring me joy
1329562825786789890 2020-11-20 07:10:54 +0800 <just_mindy> I know we are all very intellectual and above it all here on the Twittah, and think Giuliani is a silly goose, but please be aware the general public does not see things the way the pundit wonk mind trust here sees it.

1329490538538655744 2020-11-20 02:23:39 +0800 <just_mindy> We want liberty and freedom.  What our country was founded upon.

1329162102804721664 2020-11-19 04:38:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly
1329162063462195200 2020-11-19 04:38:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Probably mostly the latter
1329161549877972992 2020-11-19 04:36:22 +0800 <just_mindy> These people are insane
1329161421909860353 2020-11-19 04:35:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, why does every public official from NY look like they come out of Hunger Games central casting

1329126674328412161 2020-11-19 02:17:47 +0800 <just_mindy> It‚Äôs a weird jump because people can be in the military and not make it an idol

1328690705448005632 2020-11-17 21:25:24 +0800 <just_mindy> Yeah, the Army is a such a breeze. I wonder why everyone isn‚Äôt doing it.  Ohhhhh....
1328690300978688001 2020-11-17 21:23:48 +0800 <just_mindy> And if you‚Äôre in Florida, Bright Futures.  Make sure your kids are meeting all the requirements once they start 9th grade
1328689989257994240 2020-11-17 21:22:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Amen.  Kids can start with community college, live at home, do AP and Dual Enrollment in high school, do some online classes, get scholarships (apply, apply, apply), and go to in state uni.
1328689500348944386 2020-11-17 21:20:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @office_chick I hope you‚Äôre right
1328687802549219329 2020-11-17 21:13:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Like Biden and the persona the media created for him, it‚Äôs all a con.
1328687556091932673 2020-11-17 21:12:53 +0800 <just_mindy> People simply no longer don‚Äôt want to not see their parents, not visit their grandparents in nursing homes, they want to allow their kids a childhood and to play with other children, they want to earn a living?!  These monsters!!
1328687191825002496 2020-11-17 21:11:27 +0800 <just_mindy> There are tele-health mental services you guys.üôÑ

1328685926801936385 2020-11-17 21:06:25 +0800 <just_mindy> And Lindsay Graham can call whomever he wants
1328682067610263552 2020-11-17 20:51:05 +0800 <just_mindy> They truly believe it‚Äôs fine because ‚Äúit‚Äôs punching nazis‚Äù
1328680815883071489 2020-11-17 20:46:06 +0800 <just_mindy> So if your school district is closed or you‚Äôre new to homeschooling and feeling like a dismal failure, just read to your kids a lot and have good conversation. I‚Äôm serious. That‚Äôs how you rear literate people.  It all falls into place!
1328680396054278145 2020-11-17 20:44:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Reading @bethanyshondark and @ElishaKrauss IG stories this morning.  Your local Reading Specialist (they give actual graduate degrees in it!) confirming reading to kids and talking to kids are the single biggest predictors in academic success!!!  That‚Äôs it!! It‚Äôs that easy!
1328679756255072257 2020-11-17 20:41:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @txtiger1 Yes!

1328574590621278208 2020-11-17 13:44:00 +0800 <just_mindy> This is the number of people who have died thus far by age group in Fl.  Our kids have been back in school since August.  Schools should open now.
1328571794987622401 2020-11-17 13:32:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @Philly_Hoosier Absolutely!
1328571069079412738 2020-11-17 13:30:01 +0800 <just_mindy> This also.  Why wasn‚Äôt Kamala ever pressed about this after becoming his running mate? She was ok with partnering with a man she considered a rapist?

1328503130972106753 2020-11-17 09:00:03 +0800 <just_mindy> How about if you want 50k of Loan Forgiveness, we start with those who served in the military, first responders, teachers in high need areas, lawyers willing to do pro Bono, docs willing to donate time to clinics...etc

We will be missing my 92 year old uncle who was killed in a car accident in February and my 51 year old cousin who died in his sleep 2 months ago.  My dad who just finished chemo will thankfully be with us.  I‚Äôm not putting off holidays.
1328476375758540803 2020-11-17 07:13:44 +0800 <just_mindy> One of my friends who is ecstatic about this 50k of loan forgiveness bought a car, a new Apple Air, went on a vacation to NY (they earned it after a hard semester) with her loan money.  Between her and her husband they have 150k in student debt.  He‚Äôs never gotten a job. Lol
1328475629096984577 2020-11-17 07:10:46 +0800 <just_mindy> and took extra money so you could live in a dorm of suites with a lazy river.

1328336234993823744 2020-11-16 21:56:52 +0800 <just_mindy> LITRALLY watch this with the sound off and just look at her expressions and mannerisms.  This is a terrified nurse?
1328336062708641792 2020-11-16 21:56:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, check her timeline back to March 2020.  She has been in full blown panic mode since then insisting even that her hospital would run out of IV‚Äôs &amp; they were practicing manual pumps.  At that time, there were FOUR cases in ALL OF SOUTH DAKOTA.  She‚Äôs insane.
1328334270662848515 2020-11-16 21:49:04 +0800 <just_mindy> BTW the handle for this woman is @jodiDoering.  A quick scan of her TL shows she hates Trump and Tim Allen is a garbage person because he‚Äôs a Republican so consider her motivation for this rant.
1328332883833069569 2020-11-16 21:43:33 +0800 <just_mindy> This woman seems particularly animated and chipper for someone watching people die as she describes.  I would be gutted.
1328329011106361344 2020-11-16 21:28:10 +0800 <just_mindy> We all should and do like my friends who used the money to buy a car.

1328327903000530944 2020-11-16 21:23:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @TFC3Tweets @KatMcKinley Oh I do too.  They are wonderful people.  We continued to pay them while he recovered (he was out 3 weeks) and she said every client they had did as well.  That speaks to the kind of service they provide.
1328327463177490433 2020-11-16 21:22:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep! Fire Rescue can‚Äôt go into volatile scenes until police arrive to secure.
1328327181035048960 2020-11-16 21:20:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x @TheDemocrats Demilitarization is definitely a goal as is reducing uneven community policing which has worked well in my community. For example our chief doesn‚Äôt allow his officers to set speed traps.  But the department is also well funded because when you pay better, you get quality.
1328326508323155969 2020-11-16 21:18:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley He recovered and she insists it‚Äôs because he stayed home.  Apparently they have had many in the Mexican community who have gone to hospital and died
1328326264768393216 2020-11-16 21:17:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley Our lawn guy is got COVId.  He said he was desperately sick and begged his wife to take him to ER but she was terrified to as she said people die once they go to hospital.  She insisted on taking care of him at home.
1328324497116700677 2020-11-16 21:10:13 +0800 <just_mindy> So when you say #DefundThePolice, you are not only losing police officers and their families and friends and people that support them, but also all other first responders who depend on police officers so they can do their job and return home safely.
1328324245194235904 2020-11-16 21:09:13 +0800 <just_mindy> But many times firemen can‚Äôt do their job without the police. Police ensure the scene is safe so my son and his colleagues can do their jobs. Without police they can‚Äôt do their jobs safely and successfully. Therefore, firemen know they need police officers.
1328323986980278272 2020-11-16 21:08:12 +0800 <just_mindy> People love their houses not burning down, their loved one being saved during a heart attack or drug overdose, calling for help when their 16-year-old is having a panic attack at 4 AM, being extricated from a destroyed car after an accident.
1328323602769453056 2020-11-16 21:06:40 +0800 <just_mindy> I don‚Äôt think @TheDemocrats understand how they lose a whole sector of the public with the #DefundThePolice stuff.  My son is a firefighter.  People love firefighters. No one wants to defund them.
1328320488385417220 2020-11-16 20:54:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @e2pilot I see people outside not masking but all private businesses here still require it.
1328318825926897665 2020-11-16 20:47:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Who isn‚Äôt masking?  I live in a state that doesn‚Äôt require it yet everyone masks.

1328107812585697285 2020-11-16 06:49:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x Florida has a larger population than NY and a much lower death rate.  The rate of infection is higher but that‚Äôs really not a metric.  People have it? Ok.  They aren‚Äôt hospitalized or dead and are recovering.  That‚Äôs a good thing
1328107217208401921 2020-11-16 06:46:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest @JV2O2O @sarah_wxtx If public school is so unnecessary, let‚Äôs close them down, sell the buildings to private providers and give the tax money to parents to use at the school of their choice. Easy!
1328106660792049664 2020-11-16 06:44:37 +0800 <just_mindy> If ‚Äúshutdowns‚Äù meant these morons couldn‚Äôt get Shipt to deliver groceries, and door dash for snacks, and they weren‚Äôt allowed to use their laptops so they didn‚Äôt get paid like the little people, they‚Äôd be begging for the country to reopen tomorrow.
1328105799923720194 2020-11-16 06:41:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x Florida is the third largest state in the US.  Of course we are going to be at the top.  The average age of death in Fl is 78.  Kids should be in school
1328105475175550976 2020-11-16 06:39:54 +0800 <just_mindy> and who is watching the kids of the people who have to work?!

1328104360744718336 2020-11-16 06:35:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x Then they need to reconsider their safety protocols.  Covid isn‚Äôt different in FL than in Alabama.  The only difference would be safety protocols.  Are they taking temps, making kids wear masks, cleaning appropriately? It‚Äôs up to state govt to ensure that happens
1328102551888289793 2020-11-16 06:28:17 +0800 <just_mindy> They are crazy. Biden literally has no plan outside of what Trump did.  They are psycho.
1328102427095158784 2020-11-16 06:27:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x Schools have been fully reopened in Florida since August with no issues.  There are virtual options for families who choose but most kids are back in school
1328102085137747968 2020-11-16 06:26:26 +0800 <just_mindy> As a person who lives in a fully reopened state, where we eat out, go to high school football games, go the gym &amp; church, shop, kids all go to school, &amp; life is relatively normal except face diapers, I sometimes forget others are still living like prisoners. I can‚Äôt imagine.
1328101431967100934 2020-11-16 06:23:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, who isn‚Äôt wearing masks?!

1328100783536082946 2020-11-16 06:21:16 +0800 <just_mindy> Maybe go leave a comment supporting kids being back in school on this post because the crazy ‚Äúwe should lock our kids in the basement for another year‚Äù people are weighing in.

1327486841113743361 2020-11-14 13:41:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Maybe learn about the actual US and not what leftists who are perpetually aggrieved our shilling.  Also? They can be mad and unemployed because their parents support them off their American dream money

1327392938729598976 2020-11-14 07:28:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear Me too
1327391437978284034 2020-11-14 07:22:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Too late.  It has bred resentment.  That ship has sailed.  We need to go back to life.
1327391032238018560 2020-11-14 07:20:58 +0800 <just_mindy> I don‚Äôt do what I‚Äôm told.

1327388887178752001 2020-11-14 07:12:27 +0800 <just_mindy> But people needed to go celebrate Biden winning.  I continue to hold the non controversial view you are a hypocrite. Call those folks out &amp; then people will care what you say.  Also, what do you suggest?  We know lock downs don‚Äôt work.
1327388060783403008 2020-11-14 07:09:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Yikes
1327386934470119427 2020-11-14 07:04:41 +0800 <just_mindy> One final note @RonDeSantisFL kids shouldn‚Äôt influence the plans adults make for their family holidays and the Health Dept putting kids in the position of bad cop with their parents is completely disrespectful of constituents.
1327386495435632647 2020-11-14 07:02:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @viperstrike74 He gets much better PR when he stands up for liberty and says he encourages families to make decisions based on individual circumstances
1327386244096077824 2020-11-14 07:01:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Finally @RonDeSantisFL you need to instruct the health department they don‚Äôt define what is ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù to families.  That isn‚Äôt their role.
1327385929754038273 2020-11-14 07:00:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas @RonDeSantisFL Exactly and that makes me furious
1327385843032608771 2020-11-14 07:00:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Stop instilling fear into kids.  Kids are now going to be scared of Thanksgiving and being around family because of this nonsense. I thought Florida had dodged a bullet with the over the top rhetoric but I guess not.
1327385011335667713 2020-11-14 06:57:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @lhcamp @RonDeSantisFL I am super angry.  Like you said, they want the kids to insist to their parents that having Thanksgiving is bad.
1327384804875231233 2020-11-14 06:56:13 +0800 <just_mindy> I understand reminding Floridians to be safe, but discouraging families from gathering is gross to me.  People like me will just live my life, but impressionable people will cancel because of this &amp; that is antithetical to the attitude of your admin thus far.
1327384001707986945 2020-11-14 06:53:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Hi @RonDeSantisFL I‚Äôm super unimpressed with the flyer sent home with school students today from the Florida Dept of Health encouraging Thanksgiving meals with only ppl you live with &amp; indicating they are still ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù.     https://t.co/Nndu0WjVOV

1327119527667245059 2020-11-13 13:22:06 +0800 <just_mindy> One other thing, my daughter &amp; I want for eyelash fills tonight.

1327118774236012549 2020-11-13 13:19:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Human beings are social creatures made for intimacy with others. This is why we talk about the danger of solitary confinement. Some of y‚Äôall have parents or grandparents who have seen no one but their nurse for almost a year.  That‚Äôs equivalent to a prisoner only seeing the guard
1327118232021512192 2020-11-13 13:16:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Not for nothing, but depriving your elderly parents and grandparents of companionship and their grandchildren and holidays and affection is way worse on the immune system than COVID could ever be. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1327034021487009793 2020-11-13 07:42:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Please RT this thread.  This is why we fight so hard for school choice.  Public schools have been holding families hostage via zip code for decades.  Allowed to provide a subpar service with zero accountability.  Now, they are holding us hostage using COVID as a cudgel.
1327033641474674688 2020-11-13 07:40:49 +0800 <just_mindy> This is asinine.  Parents with kids with an IEP should sue as online learning is not least restrictive environment and zoom is not meeting the needs of the IEP. That is literally breaking the law and school systems receive extra money to provide these services.

1326930181823586305 2020-11-13 00:49:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle Oh my word!!!
1326925789867233280 2020-11-13 00:32:16 +0800 <just_mindy> As I was saying
1326925679892570112 2020-11-13 00:31:49 +0800 <just_mindy> We acquiesce with our submission.  Refuse to submit.
1326919760081268737 2020-11-13 00:08:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Have you seen him in the last year or so?
1326919591117922304 2020-11-13 00:07:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Yeah, baby.  Mindy for Ed Sec in a DeSantis or Rick Scott admin
1326917179871256577 2020-11-12 23:58:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep! This is what he needs to address because I ABSOLUTELY can see split ticket voting.  Just not only voting Biden at that level
1326916485902643208 2020-11-12 23:55:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Andrew Cuomo is a narcissist blow hard high on his own supply.

1326914771262861316 2020-11-12 23:48:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley I guess Dan is saying Steve‚Äôs numbers are wrong:   https://t.co/KffTqvGFCO

1326911870142459909 2020-11-12 23:36:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Fantastic!!
1326911656069312513 2020-11-12 23:36:06 +0800 <just_mindy> All reasonable people go, hmm...there are tons of ballots with only President marked? Sounds like someone had a bunch of ballots and went through right quick and marked just POTUS because time was a wastin. Occam‚Äôs Razor, fan.

1326910773050925062 2020-11-12 23:32:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @physicsgeek I‚Äôm telling you, it‚Äôs weird

1326896761978433538 2020-11-12 22:36:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @SapperK Exactly
1326893778045689857 2020-11-12 22:25:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara Exactly
1326893571996327940 2020-11-12 22:24:14 +0800 <just_mindy> It won‚Äôt be ‚Äúsick people‚Äù as it is illegal to kill gators in Fl. Yes, a trapper will kill it.  It has lost its fear of humans.
1326893103156957184 2020-11-12 22:22:22 +0800 <just_mindy> They don‚Äôt relocate alligators.  They kill them. Relocation is a nice thing we say to make people feel better.
1326892799724294150 2020-11-12 22:21:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Alligators are faster than humans.  Zig zag and get up high.
1326892464523923458 2020-11-12 22:19:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes he‚Äôs big.  He‚Äôll now be ‚Äúrelocated‚Äù.‚Äô RIP.
1326889503664050178 2020-11-12 22:08:04 +0800 <just_mindy> I say all this to say, unless you make voters actually request the ballot, it is ripe for fraud, and even then, it is not ideal.  The mail in ballots are what screwed up this election.  Period.
1326889179142377473 2020-11-12 22:06:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Her mission was made more difficult though, because in Florida, you have to actually request your mail in ballot.  They just don‚Äôt send them.  That is an extra step most people don‚Äôt want to do if they really don‚Äôt care.
1326888881460031489 2020-11-12 22:05:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Fl law states you may bring in ballots for up to 2 other people. Period.  Obviously she has hundreds of ballots.  The supervisor of elections allowed the votes to be counted but told her she couldn‚Äôt do that anymore.
1326888618577842178 2020-11-12 22:04:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Ballot Harvesting- a city commissioner in our county was caught doing it. She advertised ‚Äúfree tutoring and homework help‚Äù for kids if parents brought their mail in ballot up to her.  We had the screenshots from FB.  This is against FL law.
1326887584820244482 2020-11-12 22:00:27 +0800 <just_mindy> And Joe Biden is making Union heads the bulk of his transition team so all kids will be back home soon.

1326767936913240066 2020-11-12 14:05:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @PeculiarBaptist That would be amazing
1326767004464910339 2020-11-12 14:01:18 +0800 <just_mindy> He probably doesn‚Äôt get to work for a major newspaper again, no.  Employers are funny about sexually assaulting other employees &amp; the liability of all of that.
1326766560481062912 2020-11-12 13:59:32 +0800 <just_mindy> You say ‚Äúvirtually‚Äù every company.  Is there one who is ok with this because I want to ensure I never send them a resume.
1326766114018353153 2020-11-12 13:57:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Or anywhere if we haven‚Äôt said we would like to see it
1326765305033617412 2020-11-12 13:54:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Seeing someone I don‚Äôt want to see manually stimulate their sex organ is victimizing, yes.
1326764967106924545 2020-11-12 13:53:12 +0800 <just_mindy> It‚Äôs not harsh to fire someone for masturbating in front of colleagues.  This isn‚Äôt difficult.  This is like a base line behavior expectation right next to don‚Äôt take a dump in the middle of the office floor or don‚Äôt lick a coworker.

1326759028006002690 2020-11-12 13:29:36 +0800 <just_mindy> We are the third largest state in the nation so it would make sense we have the third largest amount of cases. What is your point?
1326758047600037888 2020-11-12 13:25:43 +0800 <just_mindy> You should move
1326757975457927174 2020-11-12 13:25:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, like it or not, DeSantis is an example of Trump being a great judge of character and leadership and putting his support behind him. DeSantis won (thank God!) because of that
1326757620758274049 2020-11-12 13:24:01 +0800 <just_mindy> He‚Äôs like Trump but more charming and the media can‚Äôt stand it

My parents have multiple restrooms so they could do that so thankfully we already have that in practice.
1326529046264549379 2020-11-11 22:15:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, if you need a little comedy relief, you have to listen to @RuthlessPodcast this week.  @ComfortablySmug &amp; @HolmesJosh go in on Chris and it is one for the ages.

1326526629607301121 2020-11-11 22:06:08 +0800 <just_mindy> My dad wasn‚Äôt willing to not have Thanksgiving at all because cancer has taught him nothing is guaranteed and he said he isn‚Äôt missing holidays with his grandkids. He will wear his mask, we will spread out on the well ventilated porch and we will wash our hands.
1326526244117164036 2020-11-11 22:04:36 +0800 <just_mindy> As y‚Äôall know, my Dad just finished chemo &amp; his immune system is weak so we are having our Thanksgiving on my back porch because it‚Äôs large and open and I live where Nov weather is amazing. That is my family‚Äôs choice &amp; freedom means  your family can make choices too.
1326525498902650880 2020-11-11 22:01:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Trump doesn‚Äôt have to order you not to have Thanksgiving.  If you are scared of Thanksgiving, don‚Äôt have one.
1326524363865288705 2020-11-11 21:57:08 +0800 <just_mindy> People gathering in their own homes is not equal to people using shared roadways.
1326524043663695872 2020-11-11 21:55:52 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm not having virtual Thanksgiving when your political  party has no problem with mass gatherings to celebrate Biden among strangers whilst drinking out of the same champagne bottle.  Not doing it.
1326523417999396866 2020-11-11 21:53:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  As a conservative woman, that era has been every minute of my adult life.
1326522961285816321 2020-11-11 21:51:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @RBPundit I thought he said if the polls were wrong, his profession was over?  Shouldn‚Äôt he be on the job hunt right now?
1326522533697515521 2020-11-11 21:49:52 +0800 <just_mindy> This argument is dumb when you realize many of the disputed ballots only voted for POTUS and the rest of the ballot was blank.

1326519292377096193 2020-11-11 21:36:59 +0800 <just_mindy> I can‚Äôt remember, did CNN have a list of Senators who didn‚Äôt congratulate Trump or a list of Congresspeople who boycotted Trump‚Äôs inauguration?

1326518338839863297 2020-11-11 21:33:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeamusPotStir I also don‚Äôt get that
1326510904196947969 2020-11-11 21:03:39 +0800 <just_mindy> What I don‚Äôt understand is why people who should know better, would allow their elders to think SS or Medicare was at risk just to win an election.  Her daughter should have told her Mom neither candidate was touching either so her mom wasn‚Äôt inconsolable for months.  Elder abuse
1326395458940448769 2020-11-11 13:24:55 +0800 <just_mindy> That would be the most attractive ticket ever as well as one of the best
1326394473643905026 2020-11-11 13:21:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @SusieD57 Absolutely

1326392848112099328 2020-11-11 13:14:32 +0800 <just_mindy> What have we become that we feel so superior to others because they caught a virus and we didn‚Äôt? Or at least haven‚Äôt yet?
1326392398281396230 2020-11-11 13:12:45 +0800 <just_mindy> I was maybe 11 or 12 and the scenes of people suffering alone in this woman‚Äôs house who would take them in when family had deserted them.  My parents and church would take food and pray and visit. That‚Äôs such an awful way to treat the sick &amp; we are doing so much wrong w/ COVID
1326391961406873600 2020-11-11 13:11:01 +0800 <just_mindy> When so much was unknown  about HIV in the 80‚Äôs, my church in Orlando was one who wanted to continue to minister to those who tested positive.  I remember taking food &amp; going to pray with my parents to comfort sick patients who had been utterly deserted.
1326391400385159168 2020-11-11 13:08:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes!!!  The fact we mock, scorn &amp; deride people who contract a virus is asinine. Masks aren‚Äôt 100%, nor is social distancing or washing hands. We do what we can, but ppl aren‚Äôt bad or naughty if they catch a virus. This feels like the way people treated AIDS patients in the 80‚Äôs
1326389562717966336 2020-11-11 13:01:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Excellent

1326289031064383511 2020-11-11 06:22:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Here‚Äôs a whole ass ad Rick made about Jeremiah Wright.  As a reminder the opponent of @KLoeffler is @ReverendWarnock.  He idolizes Jeremiah Wright &amp; loves Fidel Castro.
1326288417223798790 2020-11-11 06:19:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh this one is gold @ProjectLincoln.  Your founder is criticizing Axelrod for defending Jeremiah back in 2012,  yet y‚Äôall are now funding the campaign of @ReverendWarnock who is a Jeremiah disciple. You can‚Äôt make this mess up.
1326287656121233408 2020-11-11 06:16:33 +0800 <just_mindy> By the way, here is Rick Wilson of @ProjectLincoln referring to Jeremiah Wright as ‚ÄúRev Crazypants‚Äù, yet now Rick wants to help elect his acolyte @ReverendWarnock in Georgia.  Such principles.

1326197439838228480 2020-11-11 00:18:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @DenverLarry7 Yes she is
1326197312100704256 2020-11-11 00:17:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh Yep.  And cry again when she sees she worried about nothing for years but her daughter was too much of a scumbag to tell her Trump wasn‚Äôt taking her Medicare
1326195336839376899 2020-11-11 00:09:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @bayoukellyfish It is
1326194484909125633 2020-11-11 00:06:19 +0800 <just_mindy> TFW Joy puts up an inaccurate tweet to prove Trump should stop pursuing a recount and now all the comments are Democrats relitigating it and saying Gore shouldn‚Äôt have given up.  Thank you, Joy, for proving our point.
1326188792064172033 2020-11-10 23:43:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @Randy_Shannon That looks so good!!
1326185923969691648 2020-11-10 23:32:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity Awesome

1326174959673241603 2020-11-10 22:48:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Ohhhhhh
1326172096297394176 2020-11-10 22:37:21 +0800 <just_mindy> The election is contested.  Read the last point
1326171893045587968 2020-11-10 22:36:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Jill Biden has a Doctorate in Ed.  Melania speaks 7 languages.  I can assure you the latter is way more impressive.
1326170009324941312 2020-11-10 22:29:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @Maggies_Kid Awesome

1326168620687364098 2020-11-10 22:23:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @DavidDaniels71 It hurts my heart
1326168019513577473 2020-11-10 22:21:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @DeebsFLA @FormerlyCBM @kris_kinder Absolutely, but we also know this isn‚Äôt one off typical stuff.  We know a machine ‚Äúglitched‚Äù &amp; changed 4000 votes.  We only know that because that county was reliably red so it raised alarms.  Those machines were in use many places.  We also know PA defied Alito‚Äôs orders

1326162113954459648 2020-11-10 21:57:41 +0800 <just_mindy> I agree.  I used to think the sides could have honest disagreement among decent people.  I no longer feel the majority of Dems, and certainly those with a platform, are good people.

1326006863394181121 2020-11-10 11:40:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Maybe the Senators are waiting to see how the court cases resolve? Seems reasonable

1325996408982425600 2020-11-10 10:59:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @woohooPhilly She played a witch was is appropriate
1325996255516962816 2020-11-10 10:58:37 +0800 <just_mindy> No sweetie. We allowed parties from every side in the room, every day the numbers of VBM  was updated for anyone to see and by party affiliation &amp; voters could check to ensure their ballot was counted.  Don‚Äôt drag Fl, who had a picture perfect election, into your delusions.
1325995529680146432 2020-11-10 10:55:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes

1325990944022409218 2020-11-10 10:37:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley Me too
1325990176770945027 2020-11-10 10:34:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Bill is actually worried because he knows PA overstepped, he knows AZ is too close to call, he knows there was voter machine irregularities &amp; he knows common sense tells us GOP didn‚Äôt have a stellar night and lose POTUS.

1325973982575783937 2020-11-10 09:30:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @whybanflatearth Yup
1325973766883729415 2020-11-10 09:29:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @Grouchy_OG I mean, this is too much

1325971380173762560 2020-11-10 09:19:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @SallyRoth I mean they want to pretend Al Gore didn‚Äôt live
1325969805736865794 2020-11-10 09:13:31 +0800 <just_mindy> And literally no one would object
1325969672504827904 2020-11-10 09:12:59 +0800 <just_mindy> The difference is those 42 other states all counted in a timely and organized manner &amp; had returns in within hours.  Amazingly all these states with ‚Äúissues‚Äù still can‚Äôt seem to finish up.  That‚Äôs a little concerning.
1325969359072866313 2020-11-10 09:11:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Go right ahead.  Forensically audit all the votes.  Sounds great to me.
1325968842791800838 2020-11-10 09:09:42 +0800 <just_mindy> Absolutely

1325963964031918080 2020-11-10 08:50:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @SapperK Right!! Who cares what legal maneuvers happen.
1325963472534982657 2020-11-10 08:48:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity That‚Äôs awesome!!!
1325961784717701127 2020-11-10 08:41:39 +0800 <just_mindy> And then Democrats continued to call the election fraudulent and investigated it for 3 years.
1325961572674625538 2020-11-10 08:40:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Then y‚Äôall have nothing to worry about ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1325961315626659840 2020-11-10 08:39:47 +0800 <just_mindy> I know you were like 7 in 2000 but recounts have gone over 37 days and the republic survived.  You‚Äôll be fine.
1325961064798937090 2020-11-10 08:38:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Right.  The difference between a coup and not a coup
1325960455232303114 2020-11-10 08:36:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheLizMac It feels like they know Biden didn‚Äôt really win
1325960276412395527 2020-11-10 08:35:39 +0800 <just_mindy> The @TheDemocrats investigated the last election for 3 years and still don‚Äôt accept it as valid.
1325959937726566400 2020-11-10 08:34:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Again, my question is, ‚Äúwhat are these people afraid of?‚Äù.  Why does a recount terrify them? Why are they so appalled a judge is going to hear a case? Biden won‚Äôt be inaugurated until January, at best, so why not assure 70 million ppl their votes were counted?
1325958924223254531 2020-11-10 08:30:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Unlikely? Maybe.  We‚Äôll see.
1325958626008326145 2020-11-10 08:29:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Asking for recounts and the Supreme Court to comment on voting irregularities is the exact opposite of a coup.  It is using judicial avenues to ensure all legal votes are counted.

1325955496034111488 2020-11-10 08:16:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley @MarkSalter55 One clear problem were machines ‚Äúglitching‚Äù to change 4000 votes from Republicans to Dem.  Maybe that is isolated but since many counties used those machines, those voters need to be checked.  My boyfriend is a programmer &amp; says glitches like that don‚Äôt happen.  It‚Äôs intentional

1325811574712504320 2020-11-09 22:44:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Me to other Christians: you are voting for Planned Parenthood, dead babies, the demise of Israel, and for us to be disarmed.  Why?

1325802848668495872 2020-11-09 22:10:06 +0800 <just_mindy> No and in fact, the boss of some of the most prolific list makers, @PeteButtigieg, is being considered for a cabinet position.  We can assume he may be bringing his little fascist crew with him to the White House.
1325802391380373506 2020-11-09 22:08:16 +0800 <just_mindy> You first
1325802251278032896 2020-11-09 22:07:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Interesting for @MittRomney to take the lead of Health and Human Services under Biden since we are told he is adamantly opposed to abortion. Much like all things Mitt , his allegiance &amp; principles are fungible based on who is courting him.

1325535046200078341 2020-11-09 04:25:56 +0800 <just_mindy> There‚Äôs like a million typos &amp; grammatical errors in that but I don‚Äôt feel like fixing them.
1325534772869914625 2020-11-09 04:24:51 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, I‚Äôm a Christian who fails ALOT, and I sometimes cuss, and don‚Äôt act charitably, and I‚Äôm working on all that too.
1325534577658646530 2020-11-09 04:24:05 +0800 <just_mindy> So, in unity with other believers who feel this is not over, I‚Äôm doing my best not to speak against what God has said.  I‚Äôm not living in fantasy land.  I‚Äôm doing my best to be obedient to God‚Äôs call to His people.
1325534204751450112 2020-11-09 04:22:36 +0800 <just_mindy> As a Christian, I‚Äôve seen God orchestrated and designed events these last few months that lead me to believe God is still working and He hasn‚Äôt has his final say.  Where God speaks, I will stay silent.  I fear God more than Twitter followers.
1325533798436655112 2020-11-09 04:20:59 +0800 <just_mindy> So, just a PSA so I don‚Äôt have the same argument over and over.  I‚Äôm a Christian and a Republican but I‚Äôm a Christian first.

1325284615070822400 2020-11-08 11:50:49 +0800 <just_mindy> It will be fine.  Biden said he is going to shut down the virus.  It‚Äôs all over.

1325275431176712193 2020-11-08 11:14:19 +0800 <just_mindy> I know I have to be the grown up and tell them how sad I was when George HW lost to Clinton, but eventually Republicans win again, and I did that.  I want them to stay engaged.  Keep the faith, hold the line, own the libs.
1325274975507410945 2020-11-08 11:12:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Apparently our home has become the place for disheartened young Republicans to come to grieve tonight.

1325264785382969344 2020-11-08 10:32:01 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm blocking a lot now.  I don‚Äôt care if friends on here make love to Biden. A friend is a friend &amp; I don‚Äôt respond to your praise Biden tweets w/ my nonsense.  I don‚Äôt need a reply guy on my Trump tweets. I have a man, a son &amp; a Dad so I have plenty of men telling me I‚Äôm wrong.
1325263905409667072 2020-11-08 10:28:31 +0800 <just_mindy> He lied for 20 years.
1325263768239083521 2020-11-08 10:27:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chug_A_Lugg Or you could not be a clown and answer the question I posed.
1325262986802565126 2020-11-08 10:24:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chug_A_Lugg So you would use your national platform for 20 years to say ‚Äúa man killed my wife and daughter because he chose to drink his lunch instead of eat it‚Äù ruining that man‚Äôs life and reputation because your wife ran a stop sign?  That‚Äôs weird behavior.
1325261387447275522 2020-11-08 10:18:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chug_A_Lugg The man didn‚Äôt.  The accident was Biden‚Äôs wife‚Äôs fault.  She ran a stop sign.  He also wasn‚Äôt drunk
1325261162338988032 2020-11-08 10:17:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @zippyelf That‚Äôs true.  I will always give a hot woman credit
1325260852430331910 2020-11-08 10:16:24 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm just going to pin that tweet for anytime anyone asks me why I have rage toward Biden.  I used to think he was harmless until I researched that story, and any man who will use the death of his family for political gain, is a whole trash bag.

1325260203856629761 2020-11-08 10:13:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chad6454 I‚Äôm not sure
1325260007299026946 2020-11-08 10:13:02 +0800 <just_mindy> He caused a family significant grief for many years by lying about their father killing his wife &amp; kids while drunk driving. He ruined the man‚Äôs life &amp; only after the man‚Äôs death did he apologize when the man‚Äôs daughter exposed him so no.
1325259440535298054 2020-11-08 10:10:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh yes.  And cheated on her with a stripper.  And then got the stripper pregnant while still with his brother‚Äôs widow.  Then married another girl and knocked her up to

1325169150398902273 2020-11-08 04:12:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @J_C_Elias Biden literally ran against Romney and couldn‚Äôt remember his name.  It‚Äôs not a badge of honor.  Also? ‚ÄúThat Mormon‚Äù wasn‚Äôt a term of endearment

1325168008919134208 2020-11-08 04:07:28 +0800 <just_mindy> I hope we investigate Hunter every day for the next four years, as well as Joe‚Äôs brother who seems to be the family enforcer, and all their family business is drug out for the world to see.  Cheers.
1325167630920003584 2020-11-08 04:05:58 +0800 <just_mindy> In the South, there are two things you don‚Äôt do to a man.  Mess with his family or his dog.  The Trumps don‚Äôt have dogs but they‚Äôve become our family since they are now official Floridians.  So, I say, give em hell and I hope Joe Biden has zero peace.
1325167080455368704 2020-11-08 04:03:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Official press release from the Just Mindy Organization:  Donald Trump was never given one second‚Äôs peace from the moment he was elected.  They rioted, spat, harassed his family, endlessly sought impeachment, humiliated his court picks, and lied about his every intention.

1325151946932580354 2020-11-08 03:03:38 +0800 <just_mindy> But don‚Äôt celebrate Thanksgiving OR SING IN CHURCH
1325151401299873793 2020-11-08 03:01:28 +0800 <just_mindy> No it‚Äôs over.  Biden said he will shut it down without shutting down the economy.  It‚Äôs fine.
1325151199251755013 2020-11-08 03:00:40 +0800 <just_mindy> He‚Äôs a fake President and she‚Äôs a fake Doctor.  Fitting.

1325143281928429568 2020-11-08 02:29:13 +0800 <just_mindy> I sure hope they root out any Jews in the crowd.  They aren‚Äôt allowed to gather according to @NYGovCuomo

1325126348596187136 2020-11-08 01:21:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Of course
1325125096416047110 2020-11-08 01:16:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Ahhhh.  I‚Äôm so not mystical and vibing.
1325123540429885440 2020-11-08 01:10:46 +0800 <just_mindy> They‚Äôll let him play President for a month or 2
1325123294232629253 2020-11-08 01:09:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @skov1 He is going to shut the virus down but not the economy.  I‚Äôm riveted to see how he does it
1325122356830822403 2020-11-08 01:06:04 +0800 <just_mindy> So, is Biden going to shut down the virus today or do we have to wait until January?

1325089457192755201 2020-11-07 22:55:20 +0800 <just_mindy> As have been 2 million other Americans and probably more than that.  Water is wet.  Dogs bark.  The sky is blue.
1325089012302950400 2020-11-07 22:53:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Hillary doesn‚Äôt bother me.  She was awful.  I can see how people didn‚Äôt come out for her.  When they try to tell me Biden did better than Obama, when I know many of my Republican friends voted Obama in 2008, that‚Äôs a problem for me.

1325083168890818561 2020-11-07 22:30:20 +0800 <just_mindy> It takes time to make up new ballots
1325082882285723650 2020-11-07 22:29:12 +0800 <just_mindy> One of those stats is amazing. The other is ‚Äúglitches‚Äù in voting machines.  I‚Äôll let you decide which is which.

1325080769547603969 2020-11-07 22:20:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly this.  My smart Dem friends can‚Äôt even keep a straight face.  They know it‚Äôs BS but it‚Äôs BS that they like, so just wink and nod.  The problem is, nobody, even them, will trust elections now.  There are conservative programmers (I love one), too.

1325077444928434176 2020-11-07 22:07:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Republicans won state houses, only lost 1 Senate seat, &amp; won eleventy House seats but lost the Presidency. Makes sense.  https://t.co/6exNM7LnGk
1325076796023447553 2020-11-07 22:05:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Not America.  States trying to make up ballots to steal the Presidency. Like 4 of them.
1325074137660977152 2020-11-07 21:54:27 +0800 <just_mindy> ICYMI: all those machines with the ‚Äúglitches‚Äù are being used in most of the swing states.  @jenvanlaar does a deep dive

1325073574282006528 2020-11-07 21:52:13 +0800 <just_mindy> As my man explained to me last night.  There is no ‚Äúglitch‚Äù

1324935042871799809 2020-11-07 12:41:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep.  My Republican friends voted for Obama.  No way Biden got more votes.
1324934829805350912 2020-11-07 12:40:54 +0800 <just_mindy> The Lord is exposing the schemes. Tariq is one of the first messengers.  More will come.
1324934484517670915 2020-11-07 12:39:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Also this.  Biden damn sure isn‚Äôt more popular than Obama

1324933868210716672 2020-11-07 12:37:04 +0800 <just_mindy> My son‚Äôs baseball friend said ‚ÄúMs Mindy.  I was up in those counties for baseball camps this summer.  They don‚Äôt like Biden and they were like us and don‚Äôt wear masks even.  No way those votes are coming from them‚Äù
1324933400164249601 2020-11-07 12:35:13 +0800 <just_mindy> See Georgia right now
1324933139354046469 2020-11-07 12:34:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Props for caring about the country past this election
1324932882511564800 2020-11-07 12:33:09 +0800 <just_mindy> By the way, Hari has now removed his association with @PeteButtigieg from his bio but it was there as well as the fact he was a teacher.

1324922676843081729 2020-11-07 11:52:36 +0800 <just_mindy> And if that means Biden wins when it was such a favorable climate for all other Republicans, so be it.  Perhaps it was a specific repudiation of Trump.  But I think it‚Äôs imperative the cases are heard and recounts are done in full light of day.
1324922112272904199 2020-11-07 11:50:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @FranklinsRule Thank you so much.  I really appreciate that!! ‚ù§Ô∏è

1324865986827325446 2020-11-07 08:07:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep
1324865864840187905 2020-11-07 08:06:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @DHenderson1617 Because they can‚Äôt win in the South and Midwest and they won‚Äôt acknowledge it‚Äôs a policy problem
1324865689279225857 2020-11-07 08:06:09 +0800 <just_mindy> That‚Äôs the messaging challenge for Republicans ahead of regaining the House in 2022. Help the average American understand these people can‚Äôt be in power. Showing my parents things on Twitter made them see.
1324865390141431809 2020-11-07 08:04:58 +0800 <just_mindy> We need the average voter to see the Dem party isn‚Äôt the party of unions anymore. The message has to get thorough to those who are completely or mostly politically disengaged. The average American doesn‚Äôt want abortion to 40 weeks &amp; no cows because they fart.
1324864928730255360 2020-11-07 08:03:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Most people know she is insane but mainstream media cover up a lot of her drivel. Conservatives need to figure out a better way to expose the Democratic agenda.  It‚Äôs not protecting SS &amp; making sure you make a good living.  It‚Äôs all the crazy GND, PP support, off the rails stuff
1324864446653665281 2020-11-07 08:01:13 +0800 <just_mindy> Part of the issue is so many of our voting electorate isn‚Äôt on Twitter to see the inane crap @aoc &amp; others spew every day.

1324822169638064129 2020-11-07 05:13:13 +0800 <just_mindy> There is no way back.  I‚Äôm convinced.  There needs to be an amicable split. They won‚Äôt be happy until conservatives are subordinate to them.

1324766608720564226 2020-11-07 01:32:27 +0800 <just_mindy> For once I agree with Newt: when you don‚Äôt allow watchers in, when you board or paper over windows, when you put large farm machinery in the way of watchers, there is ZERO reason those votes should count.  There is no obligation to trust those ballots.
1324763958885187587 2020-11-07 01:21:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Let me show you how a real Governor deals with county shenanigans.  May I submit Rick Scott 2018   https://t.co/5yNWIPyJa9

1324453894748033027 2020-11-06 04:49:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @KenGardner11 @DanIsett That‚Äôs the whole thing.  It was all going his way and then suddenly folks stopped counting
1324450658020413445 2020-11-06 04:36:58 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep!
1324450585089921024 2020-11-06 04:36:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @DanIsett @KenGardner11 What I said to my boyfriend today too.  Ohio has picked 94% of Presidents correctly since 1896.  The ultimate bellwether.  Trump wins Ohio handily but loses the election. Funny that
1324450203575947266 2020-11-06 04:35:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @FranklinsRule @FormerlyCBM Why? Florida has a larger population
1324449306116587520 2020-11-06 04:31:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Correct &amp; he‚Äôs my hero  https://t.co/XRGHBey0dj
1324448420124368898 2020-11-06 04:28:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @_David_Edward That‚Äôs the only joy I‚Äôve had for 3 days
1324447820066234370 2020-11-06 04:25:42 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep. That fixed a lot
1324447479832653826 2020-11-06 04:24:20 +0800 <just_mindy> This particularly is making me mad
1324447171236765696 2020-11-06 04:23:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @capnbrunchusa Ha!!! No since COVId, no dependents
1324447079696080896 2020-11-06 04:22:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @nevadaracer00v It takes more than just the SOS.  Our Governor had to do lots of fixing things in many counties
1324446906437742596 2020-11-06 04:22:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @FormerlyCBM @jarchie But we know suppression wasn‚Äôt an issue this election by data
1324446520402432001 2020-11-06 04:20:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe What is happening
1324446395177312257 2020-11-06 04:20:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @capnbrunchusa I‚Äôm still not allowed in our commissary.  I‚Äôm over it
1324445838857457664 2020-11-06 04:17:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @gyab_x I should say officers at least. Sigh
1324445554521350144 2020-11-06 04:16:41 +0800 <just_mindy> That‚Äôs why Florida and Texas are done in 3 hours.  Maybe the reason all the states having issues reporting are run by Democrats should be a clue
1324445063246761984 2020-11-06 04:14:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Texas &amp; Florida are run by Republicans. That‚Äôs all anyone needs to know.
1324444914801934341 2020-11-06 04:14:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Good.  At least the military are generally smart and vote Republican
1324444398969593857 2020-11-06 04:12:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Which is why we can report in 3 hours
1324444314592825346 2020-11-06 04:11:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @FranklinsRule @FormerlyCBM It still shouldn‚Äôt take days.  Up until 2018, we were the same in Fl and it didn‚Äôt take days.
1324444015585075204 2020-11-06 04:10:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @AndySwan  https://t.co/y1n4DFoFON
1324443418513342469 2020-11-06 04:08:12 +0800 <just_mindy> As ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù has now ‚Äúanti-choice‚Äù
1324442938047422464 2020-11-06 04:06:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @Ryan1973 We had a ton of mail in ballots in Fl.  Millions and millions.  They were counted in hours
1324442716747538439 2020-11-06 04:05:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @FormerlyCBM And all those places are run by Democrats. So either they are uniquely inept or there‚Äôs a bigger story
1324442473662480384 2020-11-06 04:04:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @angry_blue_dot @FormerlyCBM I‚Äôm sorry, did I intimate somewhere I thought Democrats were smart? If I did, let me relieve you of that notion.  They aren‚Äôt smart.  Also, Kentucky is run by Republicans as is SC so it‚Äôs much more difficult to cheat.
1324441947923251201 2020-11-06 04:02:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @FormerlyCBM I submit if there isn‚Äôt a conspiracy, you don‚Äôt mind folks watching.  It also doesn‚Äôt take days to count ballots when you are on the up and up which is why the other 40 states managed
1324441596591525889 2020-11-06 04:00:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC He really is

1324433776122933255 2020-11-06 03:29:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @slowhoneybee Exactly!!!
1324433617108566016 2020-11-06 03:29:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @slowhoneybee Jeb and then DeSantis really made things accessible and transparent
1324433465694179332 2020-11-06 03:28:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Breaking:  Mindy is in her home office at her job today too.  News at 11.
1324432670730969090 2020-11-06 03:25:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @slowhoneybee All voter data is public
1324432530104324096 2020-11-06 03:24:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @slowhoneybee Were received.  You can track your mail in ballot online to ensure it was counted.
1324432366660669440 2020-11-06 03:24:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @slowhoneybee We have 10 days of early voting in every county.  We can vote by mail but you have to request your ballot.  All ballots have to be in by Election Day at 7 pm.  Our website is real time and shows by party affiliation, how many people voted early each day and how many Mail ballots
1324431878632464386 2020-11-06 03:22:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealSagacity Exactly
1324431538143059969 2020-11-06 03:21:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Yep.  Sometimes you have to be party loyal
1324431421407141888 2020-11-06 03:20:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Follow the lead of Florida
1324431204876197895 2020-11-06 03:19:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Also true.  We should have been boots on ground before Election Day
1324429396560760839 2020-11-06 03:12:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep
1324429292533665792 2020-11-06 03:12:04 +0800 <just_mindy> The Miami Dade supervisor of elections acted like some of these Georgia supervisor of elections are acting right now and Ron DeSantis replaced her. Kemp should be working on that
1324428951217971205 2020-11-06 03:10:43 +0800 <just_mindy> We should absolutely not be having these problems with accountability and transparency in a state where there is a Republican governor. That‚Äôs outrageous!
1324428749115457541 2020-11-06 03:09:55 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm beginning to think governor of Georgia is trying to protect his future political ambitions over ensuring that this election has integrity
1324428603262722058 2020-11-06 03:09:20 +0800 <just_mindy> And I would really like to know what the heck the Republican governor of Georgia is doing right now? I can assure you, these shenanigans would not be happening under a Rick Scott or Ron DeSantis.
1324420683796008966 2020-11-06 02:37:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly. Nope.  https://t.co/K2JK0nEl5t

1324407178535575552 2020-11-06 01:44:12 +0800 <just_mindy> Progressives find voter fraud whimsical.  Conservatives, not so much

1324380673189289985 2020-11-05 23:58:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Because our state is run by Republicans
1324380035759919112 2020-11-05 23:56:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @EricMertz_KC @dminor85 Yep!!! Exactly!!
1324379944730955776 2020-11-05 23:55:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes including distance education which Jeb also created and perfected in Florida

1324379610381955072 2020-11-05 23:54:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @EricMertz_KC @dminor85 That needs to change
1324379470095175687 2020-11-05 23:54:06 +0800 <just_mindy> In Florida, when a mail in ballot comes in, it is marked ‚Äúreceived‚Äù and that number is then reflected on a real time website anyone in the world can see.  This way, there aren‚Äôt ‚Äúfound‚Äù ballots or ‚Äúoops‚Äù ballots.  Everyone knows how many ballots there are in real time. How quaint

1324378514179739648 2020-11-05 23:50:18 +0800 <just_mindy> The weakness across Georgia seems to be their ability to keep track of how many ballots they have
1324377839198785539 2020-11-05 23:47:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @EricMertz_KC @dminor85 I agree

1324369410082197504 2020-11-05 23:14:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Since 1896, Ohio has been the ultimate bell weather state.  It has chosen the President correctly 94% of the time.  In this year with all these other ‚Äúdiscrepancies‚Äù, Trump wins Ohio bigly, yet doesn‚Äôt win the Presidency. Such a kwink a dink.
1324368666163634184 2020-11-05 23:11:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly!!

1323762739785965568 2020-11-04 07:03:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Um.  Woah. To give some guideposts, this is where everybody‚Äôs favorite Sheriff Grady is sheriff and my son is a fireman in this county.  GOP does well here.
1323759483206721536 2020-11-04 06:50:29 +0800 <just_mindy> So @Wizard_Predicts is very bullish on Fl looking good for Trump whilst @umichvoter99 thinks it looks good for Dems. I just wanted to clarify since I‚Äôve been sharing Trump positive news for Fl.  There are def 2 very divergent takes.
1323757552950222849 2020-11-04 06:42:49 +0800 <just_mindy> Let‚Äôs go Florida!! Please remember our panhandle is on Central time, friends.

1323436646340136972 2020-11-03 09:27:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Is anyone else feeling a shift tonight by pundits toward actually giving Trump a chance to win this or is just me?
1323436406157574146 2020-11-03 09:26:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @CheriPrice1966 Yep

1323435449797484544 2020-11-03 09:22:54 +0800 <just_mindy> And again Biden is vetting @rweingarten for his Ed Secretary who is single handedly keeping millions of kids out of school.  Randi is training teachers how to stay out of work and get paid.  It‚Äôs theft from tax payers
1323434180210995203 2020-11-03 09:17:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @SallyRoth Exactly

1323329483722706948 2020-11-03 02:21:49 +0800 <just_mindy> Who has been sacrificed?  Y‚Äôall criticize Trump 24/7 and are praised for it.  You receive social capital for it.  Who is stopping you from criticizing him? Who has been killed for criticizing Trump? If anything, they are given 6 figure checks on CNN.

It‚Äôs important young people see it‚Äôs ok to be a Republican &amp; they see all races &amp; religions embracing conservatism.
1323291379208957955 2020-11-02 23:50:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, when I was polled, I answered truthfully and now they are all mad at me.  Lol  Sorry!! I didn‚Äôt understand the game lol
1323290617653374978 2020-11-02 23:47:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok.  So I was a Skeptical Sally about people ‚Äúlying‚Äù to pollsters.  I will say, however, I am in a private FL FB Trump group with over 10k people and hundreds responded they lied. Several reasons: fear, dislike of polls, depress Dem turnout.  So, it could be a thing.

1323047877325848577 2020-11-02 07:42:49 +0800 <just_mindy> No.  We had no idea Democrats would refuse to accept the results of an election &amp; plunge the country into angry marches, sham impeachment hearings, daily vitriol all because Hilary lost. The boarding up isn‚Äôt for Trump voters &amp; every honest broker will admit this.
1323045743658192897 2020-11-02 07:34:20 +0800 <just_mindy> No.  That‚Äôs when there is merging.  You can‚Äôt just decide to go into another lane and run someone off the road

1322692286350766081 2020-11-01 08:09:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay Oh it‚Äôs all over now.  All over the US
1322692185330982916 2020-11-01 08:09:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Cubans, yes. Not sure about other Latinos.  I haven‚Äôt seen the AA vote switch yet.  We will see
1322691549814267907 2020-11-01 08:06:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 Getting worse, yes
1322691374211354625 2020-11-01 08:06:12 +0800 <just_mindy> All of that said, I‚Äôm a huge pessimist and didn‚Äôt think DeSantis would win in 2018. I just don‚Äôt believe we can win Florida at this moment.  I think too many NPA will go to Biden.  The media perfectly curated him &amp; people buy it.  I desperately want to be wrong.
1322690835046109184 2020-11-01 08:04:04 +0800 <just_mindy> And this age group of Christian women listening to Hatmaker, Bessey, Howerton, etc sell them on leftist Christianity hasn‚Äôt helped. It‚Äôs worked splendidly and is peeling off significant Evangelical vote.
1322690421135462401 2020-11-01 08:02:25 +0800 <just_mindy> College educated 25-40 year olds are going to be a yuge problem for Trump.  They are all about who is nice and kind and warm fuzzy. They don‚Äôt think logically as a whole.  Obviously lots of exceptions but it‚Äôs a very groupthink generation
1322689839947522050 2020-11-01 08:00:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Anecdotal things that make me worried about Trump in Fl: 1. I hear lots of ‚ÄúTrump fatigue‚Äù from moms and professionals my age. They see Biden as a friendly uncle. 2. Some people fear COVID very much &amp; are mad we are so open.  3. Too many Biden signs in my usually very red county
1322689324626837504 2020-11-01 07:58:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Anecdotal things that make me happy about Trump chances in Florida: 1. High turnout in many red counties  2. Republicans slayed early in person voting  3. Boat &amp; road rallies had high enthusiasm 4. We are open in Fl and we appreciate that.

1322614667966074881 2020-11-01 03:01:24 +0800 <just_mindy> I had to stop watching.  It‚Äôs a joke
1322613479329697800 2020-11-01 02:56:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @lyndseyfifield My dad has a friend voting for Biden.  I kid you not, when my Dad questioned him about this very thing, he said ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs rhetoric and racism incites these people to do this.  Once he is gone, they‚Äôll stop rioting and burning‚Äù.  This is a very smart man.

1322578497907445760 2020-11-01 00:37:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Right but he has to speak every once in a while.  He is just always a mess
1322578310900158466 2020-11-01 00:36:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @atomickristin This is going to be my yard work entertainment in a few minutes
1322578168994213889 2020-11-01 00:36:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod @LorenSethC Definitely the liberal millennials and the boomers who think Biden can cure a virus

1322576154486808576 2020-11-01 00:28:22 +0800 <just_mindy> Important! There was a mail back up and that‚Äôs a problem, but only 7 ballots in the back up
1322575742564208640 2020-11-01 00:26:43 +0800 <just_mindy> It‚Äôs easy to be ‚Äúerror free‚Äù when you don‚Äôt allow the candidate out of the house and the media never asks questions

1322535749267456000 2020-10-31 21:47:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh, of course.  Those of us who work on school choice advocacy know every time you find a Dem adamantly opposed to school choice, you‚Äôll find a Dem who sends their own kids to private school.  Every time.

1322275396725936132 2020-10-31 04:33:15 +0800 <just_mindy> A bit of a geography lesson. ‚ÄúThe Villages‚Äù is located in very very very red Lake &amp; Sumter counties in Florida.

1322266475563024389 2020-10-31 03:57:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Favorite line from the new @RuthlessPodcast epi: ‚Äúsir, the Lincoln Project is not a charity‚Äù.  üò©üòÇüòâü§£ Also, important to note that Kissin Cal tapped his side piece in his own house so that makes him extra ew.

1322238770624815104 2020-10-31 02:07:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheMSombrio There are too many R‚Äôs and people in their 30-40‚Äôs who don‚Äôt like Trump as a person and can‚Äôt get beyond that.

1321899179438940160 2020-10-30 03:38:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  There are no like minded conservative thinkers of the female persuasion.  Where could I find such a person?!  It‚Äôs a mystery.

1321884837364584449 2020-10-30 02:41:19 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden continues to say ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt going to close down the economy.  We are going to close down the virus‚Äù yet has no plan for shutting down the virus.  Has anyone in the press ever asked Biden what he means?

1321855445158473730 2020-10-30 00:44:31 +0800 <just_mindy> My coworkers have bad breath and poop everywhere but it‚Äôs cool.  https://t.co/hBrTHd9NZR

1321849557370679296 2020-10-30 00:21:07 +0800 <just_mindy> No one cares if athletes go on their personal social media and express their political feelings.  No one wants it shoved down their throats while we are watching sports for fun.
1321844680145932290 2020-10-30 00:01:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC Yes

1321842275496923137 2020-10-29 23:52:11 +0800 <just_mindy> As an also obviously not true conservative, it bothers me that votes can be counted for 9 days.

1321840523951378432 2020-10-29 23:45:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @Latentem Definitely pray for Biden and his team.  The reason for this series, however, was her impression from the Holy Spirit there were specific schemes &amp; threats against Trump individually.

1321837662198747136 2020-10-29 23:33:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @StaunchCon Exactly.  We cope and look toward the next election.  They‚Äôre still litigating 2016
1321837485668945921 2020-10-29 23:33:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Bingo

1321827703247482881 2020-10-29 22:54:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @SWHesq Exactly.  Which would entail wanting to keep a conservative Senate as a check and balance on the executive which they don‚Äôt want.  So they‚Äôre Dems

1321803519867977728 2020-10-29 21:18:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Guess what? School boards are beholden to citizens. Demand they reopen the schools.  We know this is awful for kids, we know it is increasing suicide rates, abuse rates, poverty as parents can‚Äôt work and it‚Äôs FOR NOTHING.  School is safe for kids.
1321803016924782593 2020-10-29 21:16:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Schools in Florida are going on 3 months in school, kids wear masks, staff cleans, we have sports and normalish lives.  It is STUNNING parents across this country aren‚Äôt demanding schools reopen immediately.

1321541672346505216 2020-10-29 03:57:42 +0800 <just_mindy> Because our media is a succubus of DNC disinformation designed to depress voters up until the election so they vote for Biden in a desperate bid for normalcy.  Our Media doesn‚Äôt exist to provide Americans with facts. It‚Äôs propaganda.

1321524741627383809 2020-10-29 02:50:25 +0800 <just_mindy> There are absolutely easy answers.  Florida (the third largest state in the US) has been back in school for 10 weeks and there have been no major outbreaks.  Kids wear masks.  There is virtual options for families who choose to not do Face to Face.  Open up schools.

1321515158976536579 2020-10-29 02:12:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Speaking of small hoop nose piercings, I really want one. Major changes to my lewk get run by my BF, son and Dad.  BF and son are good with it, my Dad is adamantly opposed so I‚Äôm not doing it while he‚Äôs sick.  I will one day though

1321501737744781314 2020-10-29 01:19:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Finally you can early vote anywhere in your county.  It doesn‚Äôt have to be just your usual precinct. Bring acceptable ID.  You can wear candidate gear as long as you are not soliciting votes.
1321500823466246144 2020-10-29 01:15:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Only mail in ballots received in the SOE office by 7:00 pm on Election Day will be counted in Florida.
1321500562479828993 2020-10-29 01:14:21 +0800 <just_mindy> If you see/ hear people offering to take MORE THAN 2 other mail in ballots to drop off boxes, that could be ballot harvesting and is against the law in Fl.  Take screenshots and call your Supervisor of Elections office.  You can return ballots legally in Fl for up to 2 other ppl
1321499913046425600 2020-10-29 01:11:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Ask your friends and your adult kids, y‚Äôall.  The world is nuts and not everyone is as plugged in to politics as you.  You can turn it up to 2 ballots for other people in drop boxes in Fl.  Ask your friend if you can drop theirs off if you know they are busy.
1321499358085500928 2020-10-29 01:09:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Right now, Republicans have over 600k ballots out.  We can‚Äôt let those votes be lost.  Trump won by mid 100k in 2016.
1321499046683545601 2020-10-29 01:08:19 +0800 <just_mindy> In Florida, if you requested a ballot and now want to vote in person, you can.  BRING THE BALLOT TO YOUR POLLING PLACE and surrender it and you can vote in person.
1321498677010194433 2020-10-29 01:06:51 +0800 <just_mindy> Florida friends:  if you are planning to vote by mail and have not returned it, PLEASE take it to a drop off box and then track it on your Supervisor of Election site.  Make sure it is received and counted.  DO NOT MAIL IT NOW. It might not make it in time.
1321480246403747843 2020-10-28 23:53:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chimp_HQ Yes.  Terribly cruel.  Thank you so much and prayers for your friend as well.
1321478796441169921 2020-10-28 23:47:51 +0800 <just_mindy> Let‚Äôs also be honest that as people cut the cord, sites like Twitter and FB become the place people get news.  It‚Äôs the place government officials communicate with the public.  It‚Äôs not just a social media site any longer.

1321254339860680706 2020-10-28 08:55:56 +0800 <just_mindy> The Media knows Biden is crooked af. They will drag him across the finish line so he can pardon who needs to be, and then insist he step down for Kamala to enact her leftist agenda a/ glee. They just need to hide stuff fr voters for 6 more days.
1321252721731768320 2020-10-28 08:49:31 +0800 <just_mindy> I think Miami Dade and Broward will be closer than people think because school choice is always on the ballot in Florida and people love their schools.  I know Biden lost most cops and FF families in Fl during riots. All in all, go vote!!!
1321252297654046722 2020-10-28 08:47:50 +0800 <just_mindy> I believe we are cannibalizing some E day turnout.  I believe some Repubs will defect.  I believe Dems encouraging early voting by mail is a mistake as even if 1% are discarded, that could be 100k votes. I think Latino vote for Trump is higher than people think.

1320659339833708544 2020-10-26 17:31:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Ahhhh.... the new verbiage leftists will use to destroy an institution of government is: rebalancing.  Fascinating.  Also? Filling open seats isn‚Äôt court packing &amp; Mitch is able to do so because of Harry Reid nuking the filibuster. Direct your angst to him.
1320658551505887233 2020-10-26 17:28:29 +0800 <just_mindy> You‚Äôre right.  You don‚Äôt understand American governance.
1320654642297131009 2020-10-26 17:12:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Clearly Biden is recalling 08 when he and Obama were positioning themselves as the antidote to 8 year of of GWB.  This is really sad and again, I can‚Äôt believe people won‚Äôt acknowledge what is right before their eyes.
1320574803993124864 2020-10-26 11:55:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @SBroadie Terribly sad lives!!!
1320559109884829696 2020-10-26 10:53:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @FabulousVPOE Exactly
1320558304192585728 2020-10-26 10:50:09 +0800 <just_mindy> This is an example of the worst of us actually.  Badgering your dying father is not loving nor humane.

1320521706176454656 2020-10-26 08:24:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes. The refusal of Democrats to confirm a highly qualified woman just because she won‚Äôt agree to suspend her own cognitive ability is extreme misogyny and very telling
1320519118257332225 2020-10-26 08:14:26 +0800 <just_mindy> All the ‚ÄúJoe is getting his message out virtually because he doesn‚Äôt want to have big crowds in a pandemic‚Äù ignore he is sending out Kamala &amp; Obama in person to have in person rallies. So it‚Äôs ok for them to risk their lives but not Joe? Seems racist, tbh.

1320489081059553281 2020-10-26 06:15:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @phillyrich1 Sounds like the friend had a hold put on it because Hunter was on a binge.  As a wife who had to do that many times to my almost ex husband, I recognize it.  Daddy was enabling

1320479436173643778 2020-10-26 05:36:45 +0800 <just_mindy> So who knew @HawleyMO could preach? Listening to him now at the worship service on the National Mall &amp; he‚Äôs incredible.

1320473534511108098 2020-10-26 05:13:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @puzzzld Exactly.  He has gone above and beyond what I expected
1320471882739703808 2020-10-26 05:06:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @RevConwell That‚Äôs not bad!
1320471353829560322 2020-10-26 05:04:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @RevConwell I might have to
1320469198418706432 2020-10-26 04:56:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear Stupid question, I know

1320467936004505602 2020-10-26 04:51:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Why would a search warrant be necessary? The laptop was the property of the shop owner &amp; he brought it to the FBI and reported what he saw.  The FBI  then had reasonable suspicion
1320466625200590849 2020-10-26 04:45:51 +0800 <just_mindy> Why does she look like a Marvel villain?
1320466123930914817 2020-10-26 04:43:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @HoosierInfidel Oh yes!  That drives me nuts too
1320466000022851590 2020-10-26 04:43:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @Queen2Five I just thought supply would be back by now

1320465842191147014 2020-10-26 04:42:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @KristinBoymom Exactly and no one knows who you are other than Cardi B‚Äôs husband
1320465512170725377 2020-10-26 04:41:25 +0800 <just_mindy> He should be focused on getting tested for STD‚Äôs.  Also if he was my husband, he would be real worried about health care after he caught these hands
1320464867887894532 2020-10-26 04:38:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @HoosierInfidel It‚Äôs so annoying

1320462151291686913 2020-10-26 04:28:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @Maggies_Kid Maybe I should check at the Spanish grocery.  Good idea!
1320461682230124546 2020-10-26 04:26:12 +0800 <just_mindy> He and Cardi are getting divorced so he needed attention

1320348926587883520 2020-10-25 20:58:09 +0800 <just_mindy> My son just now:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting annoyed with all the bandwagon Rays fans.  Where were these people when we were the worst team in baseball and people made fun of me for having a Rays license plate‚Äù  ü§£ü§£.   People love a winner, my man.

1320345698651561986 2020-10-25 20:45:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Lol.  My county is one of the ‚Äúapathy‚Äù counties in Florida proving once again, rednecks really don‚Äôt like politics and only vote now in small numbers, because it‚Äôs been forced down their throats.
1320344330901532672 2020-10-25 20:39:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba @BNightengale It all happened so fast my brain couldn‚Äôt catch up
1320342113335320580 2020-10-25 20:31:05 +0800 <just_mindy> Your daily reminder that Joe and Faux Dr. Jill are not good nor fine people as they continue to pretend their youngest grandchild doesn‚Äôt exist even after definitive DNA tests.  üòòüòò
1320341771038167041 2020-10-25 20:29:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba Exactly and I know many families, where the child wasn‚Äôt accepted by the parent, but because the grandparents had more life experience, they embraced the child.  It shouldn‚Äôt matter what Hunter does. If Joe and Jill were ‚Äúfine people‚Äù, they would embrace the child

1320339707151196160 2020-10-25 20:21:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Reminder, if you early voted in Michigan, Wisconsin or Minnesota, and the Biden revelations are making you regret your vote, you can change your early vote.

1320234725357817856 2020-10-25 13:24:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl I can‚Äôt figure that out but the baby is only like 2 and he says his youngest is 16

1320200236749459456 2020-10-25 11:07:19 +0800 <just_mindy> They probably dropped their mail in ballots in the mail the first minute they could voting straight R

1320199891344384000 2020-10-25 11:05:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Lincoln Project is hoping for a Trump win way more than you or I. If Trump loses, Dems aren‚Äôt interested in them.They‚Äôve proven themselves traitors.  They are pariah to GOP so no job there either.  They need a Trump win to finish shoring up their retirement cushion for 4 years.

1320188520028405768 2020-10-25 10:20:45 +0800 <just_mindy> The Villages is a huge retirement village. Probably more than 12 people died yesterday
1320187835689897987 2020-10-25 10:18:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @melifix @irishspy Very sad and I almost wonder if that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt see his daughter or Jill‚Äôs kids campaigning more.  They don‚Äôt agree with this

1320181906458161152 2020-10-25 09:54:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Yep.  They‚Äôre voting for Kamala

1320180701732478978 2020-10-25 09:49:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @GameOnJD @SME_In_Italy Oh I‚Äôve voted, my parents voted, and my son voted
1320180279928029184 2020-10-25 09:48:01 +0800 <just_mindy> As I said, I want to give good ness too
1320179948783620097 2020-10-25 09:46:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @SME_In_Italy @GameOnJD I don‚Äôt feel that in my bones rn.
1320179800959569920 2020-10-25 09:46:06 +0800 <just_mindy> This is still funny
1320179559204065280 2020-10-25 09:45:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Bill Kristol unfollowed me.  Time to bring back #holdmeJohnKasich
1320179216080605184 2020-10-25 09:43:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @nevadaracer00v @GameOnJD I want to be wrong and I‚Äôm a pessimist so we will see
1320179119393562626 2020-10-25 09:43:24 +0800 <just_mindy> I want anyone considering voting for Biden to go listen to him speak in 2016 and then now.  It is a marked difference and it isn‚Äôt a stutter.
1320178781651374080 2020-10-25 09:42:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 It‚Äôs def me in 2020
1320178737745362950 2020-10-25 09:41:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @Maggies_Kid Good!! The popular vote matters to the narrative
1320178620074201088 2020-10-25 09:41:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Love that man
1320177961086181376 2020-10-25 09:38:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy Oh same
1320177788234702848 2020-10-25 09:38:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Absolutely
1320177642545565697 2020-10-25 09:37:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  Def an FU contingent in the Trump vote
1320177218786557952 2020-10-25 09:35:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG @JohnEkdahl Ok I couldn‚Äôt remember if you were a Johnson voter like me in 2016
1320177047310798849 2020-10-25 09:35:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @GameOnJD I‚Äôm skeptical Trump will win.  I don‚Äôt think independents are breaking for Trump.  But we‚Äôll see
1320176899398709249 2020-10-25 09:34:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth That would be a beautiful thing
1320176836173811713 2020-10-25 09:34:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 He‚Äôs a Kentucky man through and through
1320175245811240960 2020-10-25 09:28:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @ADowling34 @MarcACaputo @ryan_tyson I have seen plenty from Marc about Biden being able to win here. There was an article this morning or yesterday that totally depressed me.  He‚Äôs called balls and strikes
1320174808764645382 2020-10-25 09:26:16 +0800 <just_mindy> I am a Floridian who didn‚Äôt vote Trump in 2016 as is @JohnEkdahl and maybe @NiedsG and plan to in 2020.  I think there are many of us.
1320174493885661184 2020-10-25 09:25:01 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm still skeptical but I think his Hispanic numbers are way closer to what we will see than other pollsters are predicting.  I say that because when I go to Trump events, nearly half the crowd is Hispanic. I think his AA is actually low and might be more like 12%
1320172662258270208 2020-10-25 09:17:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Gosh, he‚Äôs so good
1320171071102963716 2020-10-25 09:11:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth I meant specifically people hanging out in Times Square where the ads are
1320168381308375040 2020-10-25 09:00:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Truth.  No one is actually visiting there right now and everyone in New York is already voting for Biden.

1320155274070687747 2020-10-25 08:08:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @AdamR2973 You totally get it then!
1320154127192739842 2020-10-25 08:04:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @AdamR2973 So glad it isn‚Äôt just me
1320153965770756097 2020-10-25 08:03:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, this isn‚Äôt commentary on my financial status.  I‚Äôm blessed by my family‚Äôs hard work to live where I do and it has nothing to do with my own accomplishments. I was dealt a good hand
1320153605060677632 2020-10-25 08:02:01 +0800 <just_mindy> These kinds of posts always make me laugh because I live on what is termed ‚Äúmillionaire‚Äôs row‚Äù in my town, and 3/4 of the houses have Trump signs and exactly zero have Biden signs.  So is there some sociological message there too?
1320122387896143873 2020-10-25 05:57:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @SackJD Exactly!!!
1320122320791474178 2020-10-25 05:57:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @LLSKYGIRL Never know with him
1320119549358997505 2020-10-25 05:46:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @SackJD I just found the right channel as the game ended
1320118130342043648 2020-10-25 05:41:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Annoying
1320114413546971139 2020-10-25 05:26:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Awesome!!
1320114233686872065 2020-10-25 05:25:34 +0800 <just_mindy> And everyone knows Harris will be the actual President.  We all see his failing cognitive abilities
1320109993987801089 2020-10-25 05:08:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @lambert_craig I‚Äôve wondered the same thing
1320109903168573440 2020-10-25 05:08:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest We have had a lot of rain lately but still, there are lots of days to vote
1320104654013857792 2020-10-25 04:47:30 +0800 <just_mindy> I need a fact check
1320102702387503104 2020-10-25 04:39:45 +0800 <just_mindy> My mom was born in Key West and my grandfather was a Pastor there.  One of their favorite parishioners was a Cuban man and he gave all my grandparent‚Äôs kids their middle names.  That‚Äôs how my mom has the middle name Edilia ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
1320100954713280512 2020-10-25 04:32:48 +0800 <just_mindy> And we are fine with that
1320100421843800065 2020-10-25 04:30:41 +0800 <just_mindy> I think you should drag God into court and prosecute Him for making it rain.  Also? There is like 9 more days of early voting if people didn‚Äôt want to wait in line
1320096572185710594 2020-10-25 04:15:23 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm a very secure man, ironically
1320095253865680897 2020-10-25 04:10:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Bingo

1320079693274664960 2020-10-25 03:08:19 +0800 <just_mindy> The womb is a very unsafe place for a Black female tbh.

1320039976499875842 2020-10-25 00:30:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Yessssss
1320039506419081216 2020-10-25 00:28:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Oh but they insist we are and only the Lincoln Project guys will be able to get it back
1320039277959516162 2020-10-25 00:27:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Sweetie, the divisiveness started long before Trump.  Y‚Äôall just aren‚Äôt used to a Republican fighting back.
1320038999986216962 2020-10-25 00:26:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Can not name one thing Trump has done to make him a authoritarian üëáüèº
1320038384627232768 2020-10-25 00:24:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Grifters always find easy marks
1320038043563286532 2020-10-25 00:22:49 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm told they are the best at what they do and the GOP will come crawling to them in 2022 to help win back the Senate because they are so effective.
1320027485141164032 2020-10-24 23:40:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chug_A_Lugg They‚Äôre targeting Senators who did what their constituents sent them to do.  Not many people get to make careers off of what they did 10 years ago with little to no success since then but you do you.  I mean Palin was the last big campaign for Steve. Give me a break
1320020479898488837 2020-10-24 23:13:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chug_A_Lugg If Trump loses, it won‚Äôt be because of them.  It will be because of himself.  To be good at what you do, you need to win campaigns. That‚Äôs the metric. They don‚Äôt.  They‚Äôre good at being grifters. I‚Äôll hand that to them.  They may have more in common with Trump than they think
1320019385017389056 2020-10-24 23:08:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Found the person the email was literally about
1320017743878508551 2020-10-24 23:02:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chug_A_Lugg You haven‚Äôt checked out their win loss records lately apparently
1320016421305393152 2020-10-24 22:56:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes and that is why they should never ever ever have a home in the GOP again
1320014838324658178 2020-10-24 22:50:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @SallyRoth You were smart

1319878987934519299 2020-10-24 13:50:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes yes yes
1319878883555115010 2020-10-24 13:50:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark Thank you!! 11 years of school choice policy and I can spit it out quick now
1319876412401135618 2020-10-24 13:40:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @JustinRWalton ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
1319876368423899136 2020-10-24 13:40:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark Thank you
1319876326619336704 2020-10-24 13:40:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalFF It‚Äôs such a hard thing.  I totally agree
1319876166858268672 2020-10-24 13:39:34 +0800 <just_mindy> And their parents will start demanding tax scholarships for private schools like we have in Florida.
1319875887899226112 2020-10-24 13:38:28 +0800 <just_mindy> I promise you if @realDonaldTrump signed an EO tomorrow diverting these funds to any state not open by 12/1 or whatever arbitrary date, Governors would open schools again stat.  Why? Because they know if kids get in private schools they like, they won‚Äôt go back to public
1319875456724848642 2020-10-24 13:36:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Remember, states like Florida wouldn‚Äôt need to participate since kids are back in school so we are only talking about kids in states where Governors refuse to follow the Science and the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatricians.
1319875052742037505 2020-10-24 13:35:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Currently the federal government provides about 79 billion dollars per year to states for education.  The average private school tuition is 10,000 dollars.  That means about 8 million kids could be served by this program and be out of a failing Zoom system
1319873236134395905 2020-10-24 13:27:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalFF Very true
1319873155041722368 2020-10-24 13:27:36 +0800 <just_mindy> If you have the schools apply in batches on behalf of new students, it should be rather cut and dry. Have a list of approved private schools prepared by the Gov. office in the state, those schools advertise number of open slots, then school completes paper work for funding
1319872587019784193 2020-10-24 13:25:21 +0800 <just_mindy> There would be some abuse of the system obviously but if you only allow reputable private or charters to participate, it would be minimal.  The tiny risk of fraud is worth it for most kids to have options at this point
1319872110840500224 2020-10-24 13:23:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @JustinRWalton They should have to go on record opposing her for no reason
1319871855700938752 2020-10-24 13:22:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalFF That‚Äôs why the option of using tax dollars at private schools is appealing
1319871640231137281 2020-10-24 13:21:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Private schools can tell federal govt ‚Äúwe have 35 new students‚Äù and offer verification signed by parent.  The check can go directly to the school to cover student tuition. This is basically how we handle corporate scholarships in Florida.
1319871092337631232 2020-10-24 13:19:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Any school system not making plans to reopen should lose  federal funding and parents should be able to seek grants for those funds to send their child to private school.  Alternatively, the federal govt can allow private schools to apply on behalf of new enrollees to streamline
1319870368505647107 2020-10-24 13:16:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Children are being left alone, abused, not properly fed, and many aren‚Äôt even signing on for school. Suicide &amp; depression rates are sky rocketing. Drug &amp; alcohol abuse is at insane levels. Divorce rates are through the roof.  This cure is way worse then COVID.
1319869656035983361 2020-10-24 13:13:42 +0800 <just_mindy> I see so many financially and mentally stable parents on Twitter at wits end about school closing. These are ppl with resources &amp; support systems. I cannot imagine what many children are facing with families who cannot offer those safety nets. Reopen schools now.
1319867161318404098 2020-10-24 13:03:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax Thank goodness!!!
1319867049200521216 2020-10-24 13:03:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Senators earn a good salary.  There are only 2 fr each state and I assure you, there are many who would love the job &amp; would show up to work.  We should absolutely expect our elected officials to be at every meeting unless there is some emergency
1319866010623758336 2020-10-24 12:59:13 +0800 <just_mindy> I attend many meetings where I don‚Äôt agree on the agenda or outcomes. If we started docking legislator pay if they did not show up for work, I bet they would show up for work.
1319864208964673536 2020-10-24 12:52:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax That‚Äôs what boggles!!! I‚Äôve been doing this for 11 years.  There are people like me who know what we are doing.  Why did districts try to recreate the wheel rather than bringing in subject matter experts to show them best practices!!
1319863731036295168 2020-10-24 12:50:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax And it‚Äôs so much better for the teacher to be available one on one or for small group in zoom rather than making all kids sit when there 65% know what to do and should be working independently
1319863239115669505 2020-10-24 12:48:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax Yes you do!!! The way it‚Äôs being done now in many states is so detrimental and awful for kids!!
1319862097916940288 2020-10-24 12:43:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep!!
1319862000856551425 2020-10-24 12:43:17 +0800 <just_mindy> We‚Äôve had full day of school in Florida for 9 weeks now and zero collapses

1319805743210635264 2020-10-24 08:59:44 +0800 <just_mindy> We need to let kids go back to school. We just finished our first 9 weeks of school in Florida with minimal issues.  It is criminal to continue to keep schools closed with zero scientific evidence.  The people must stand up &amp; demand their school boards listen
1319800996005093379 2020-10-24 08:40:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas @danielc4liberty So Publix is now making a chicken tender with bacon , cheese, special sauce and pickles on a brioche bun in the deli.  They are on sale for 2/$6.  We got them for dinner.  So good!!!

1319702813727969280 2020-10-24 02:10:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 It is.  The Cuban vote is very R though

1319350801500864515 2020-10-23 02:51:58 +0800 <just_mindy> I never thought there would be a day when all the Media, Social Media, etc would collaborate to control the messaging at the expense of our President.  This is a bizarre timeline.
1319350377775570947 2020-10-23 02:50:17 +0800 <just_mindy> The gaslighting feels so unreal.  We all know the Hunter Biden laptop and implications are at least worth investigating but our media insists it‚Äôs ‚ÄúRussian disinformation‚Äù with actual zero evidence. They insist we must look away and what we see with our own eyes is false.
1319349666681675776 2020-10-23 02:47:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Bingo

1319335976729182208 2020-10-23 01:53:03 +0800 <just_mindy> I agree.  Very bad.  She sounds extremely petty
1319335816607531008 2020-10-23 01:52:25 +0800 <just_mindy> I think Stahl starting the  interview with ‚Äúready for some tough questions‚Äù was pretty adversarial in tone and wasn‚Äôt a great foot to lead on.

1319283003797852162 2020-10-22 22:22:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Trump should have a website domain like ‚ÄúHunterNews‚Äù or ‚ÄúWheresHunter‚Äù or some ish he promotes tonight during his debate closing with all the stuff the media is hiding easily accessible
1319274479617359874 2020-10-22 21:48:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Seriously, do you know any other man who has 4 adult children that are constantly by his side, as well as their spouses/sig others? Like LITRALLY the whole family moves as a unit? Hell, I didn‚Äôt know Ashley Biden existed until yesterday?! Let‚Äôs stop acting like Trump is a bad dad
1319273902099496961 2020-10-22 21:46:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomWhig I mean, the man has 5 children that are CONSTANTLY at his side AND THEIR SPOUSES but they want me to believe he hates his family or something
1319273647945572354 2020-10-22 21:45:23 +0800 <just_mindy> ‚ÄúBiden is an exceptional father and very close to his kids we never see, trust us, but Trump is a wooly legged ninny monster whose children hate him yet they all are by his side 24/7.  What a terrible father who doesn‚Äôt know how to love and is an emotional leper‚Äù - our press
1319272467588808706 2020-10-22 21:40:41 +0800 <just_mindy> And this is the other part that bothers me. Stop pretending Trump exists in a vacuum. The way the press treated men like Romney &amp; McCain gave way to Trump. He fights back.  And clearly he is a good Dad.  We don‚Äôt see Biden‚Äôs kids ever.  Trump‚Äôs kids are at his hip. All of them.
1319271821062144000 2020-10-22 21:38:07 +0800 <just_mindy> A couple of things. Biden is lauded for his ‚Äúcloseness‚Äù w/ his sons, &amp; that‚Äôs fine, but Trump is also very close with his. They are a unit always together and they are devoted to him. As are his daughters.  Clearly, he is beloved by them. But their relationship is mocked
1319267246582222850 2020-10-22 21:19:57 +0800 <just_mindy> We will be too busy impeaching Biden for all this Hunter stuff.  See the slippery slope Nance started when she decided to let AOC boss her around?

1318932019947147265 2020-10-21 23:07:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Mam.  I know you are wack, but he‚Äôs been President for 4 years and hasn‚Äôt rounded up a soul.  He has released a whole lot of folks. Go place your crystals outside in the sun so they can recharge.

Seeker friendly churches are turning out shallow Christians who see the Bible through the social justice lens rather than social justice through a Biblical lens. Not their fault. We‚Äôve abandoned the Word in church

1318764478629117952 2020-10-21 12:02:07 +0800 <just_mindy> In case you are wondering, this is literal fascism.  Attempting to rob people of social and vocational capital because of who they vote for

You are handing  POTUS Kamala Harris the executive &amp; the Senate unfettered.  That‚Äôs not saving anything. That‚Äôs losing our country to the most liberal member of the Senate

1318354347193925638 2020-10-20 08:52:24 +0800 <just_mindy> To be fair, there is a second video call happening at the same time at Toobin‚Äôs place so while technically loving himself, he had an audience. üòâ

These are alleged ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù voting for the most liberal member of the Senate to be POTUS, even more leftist than Bernie.  And they think they will rebuild the ‚ÄúGOP‚Äù.  No thank you.

1318327422429913091 2020-10-20 07:05:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 Right? What is the end game? They won‚Äôt be progressive enough for Dems.  They‚Äôre useful pawns.  The GOP won‚Äôt want them as they decimated even the Senate.  There is no work in politics for them
1318325838606204928 2020-10-20 06:59:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba Terrible boating accident

1318325419809083393 2020-10-20 06:57:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Ben Carson is a brilliant neurosurgeon.  He has saved lives.  Movies were made about him.  You troll people on Twitter.  Calm down.

1318322532391489536 2020-10-20 06:45:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth You got that right
1318322458672455685 2020-10-20 06:45:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy Or not as he was seeking other forms of entertainment
1318320788240539649 2020-10-20 06:39:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Apparently he was also on a second video call which means he was ‚Äúhaving fun‚Äù with a partner which explains apologizing to his wife.

1318018933740503046 2020-10-19 10:39:36 +0800 <just_mindy> What POTUS did was entirely appropriate.  Tithing is for members of a congregation to bring into their local ‚Äústorehouse‚Äù.  You don‚Äôt tithe where you aren‚Äôt a member.  You give in offering when visiting a church where you aren‚Äôt a member. Cash is most appropriate.

1317992786864594947 2020-10-19 08:55:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @kcherrick This woman says there are caged children. I‚Äôm asking why they aren‚Äôt at the border demanding their release
1317992634833620992 2020-10-19 08:55:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @kcherrick Abortion rights activists are committed.  No doubt.  So are pro-life people.  There have been tons of restrictions put on abortion providers in the last 10 years thanks to their work.  The difference is, there isn‚Äôt a room full of caged babies to go free.
1317991574102511616 2020-10-19 08:50:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @kcherrick I do believe abortion is murder but I don‚Äôt hold any Democratic President personally responsible for it the way they do the ‚Äúcaged children‚Äù.  Also, what happened to the marches and protests at the border?  Pro-life folks never stop.
1317991191032496128 2020-10-19 08:49:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman My apologies!!
1317991096472010752 2020-10-19 08:48:59 +0800 <just_mindy> The ‚Äúcaged children‚Äù trope is really their effort to allow anyone to come into the US, be immediately released into our populace and everyone knows they‚Äôll never show back up for their hearing.  Let‚Äôs be honest.
1317990820377710595 2020-10-19 08:47:53 +0800 <just_mindy> It‚Äôs almost as if she knows children aren‚Äôt really ‚Äúcaged‚Äù.  That activists demanded they not be separated from their parents, and their parents broke laws, and until they are processed, the children stay with them.  They used to go to foster homes.
1317990354306650112 2020-10-19 08:46:02 +0800 <just_mindy> We talk often about people who sat idly while the Jewish people were killed in Germany, but here is a woman with w platform and means, who truly believes there are caged children yet she just plays on Twitter and sleeps easy at night?! Really?
1317989993252610048 2020-10-19 08:44:36 +0800 <just_mindy> When people say ‚Äúfocus on the man caging children‚Äù, I wonder how monstrous they must be.  If they truly believe there are ‚Äúcaged children‚Äù, &amp; they just complain on Twitter rather than collect a mob to go demand the freedom of the kids, that‚Äôs the height of inhumanity.

1317875481727950848 2020-10-19 01:09:34 +0800 <just_mindy> I am going to say one thing.  I get lots of DM‚Äôs from married men (don‚Äôt DM me married men) and wife friends who aren‚Äôt having fun and experimenting, should maybe try.  It‚Äôs good for everyone!
1317874808886091776 2020-10-19 01:06:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @DetTitanUp Sometimes they get the Fins or Bucs instead.

1317861484517609473 2020-10-19 00:13:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley Exactly.  So so sad
1317861182829715458 2020-10-19 00:12:45 +0800 <just_mindy> This is why people need to vote and encourage friends to vote. These people are insane.
1317860358988746760 2020-10-19 00:09:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Also this is why kids belong in school.  Kids that are most vulnerable are left in situations like this.

1317851314404102144 2020-10-18 23:33:32 +0800 <just_mindy> This is why the Women‚Äôs March was way more of a ‚Äúsuper spreader‚Äù event than any Trump rally.  People came from all over US to DC &amp; will now go back to every corner.  Trump rallies are people staying in their own geographic areas. You won‚Äôt hear the news talk about that tho.

1317618809944014848 2020-10-18 08:09:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 4 years but the first 2 he had the program Scott Frost built
1317618418540007425 2020-10-18 08:08:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I‚Äôm probably not real cute right now
1317617711162249216 2020-10-18 08:05:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Heupel has zero control or discipline of this team. You can look at him and the lack of pride he takes in his own appearance and that extends to how he coaches.  Period.
1317616544986353666 2020-10-18 08:00:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I‚Äôm so frustrated!

1317614772175732741 2020-10-18 07:53:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Oh I knew we didn‚Äôt.  I know who our coach is
1317613946333954048 2020-10-18 07:50:19 +0800 <just_mindy> Orlando is literally a Soccer Mecca for the US.  Maybe we can find a kicker
1317613632650383360 2020-10-18 07:49:04 +0800 <just_mindy> What a joke.
1317613458796515329 2020-10-18 07:48:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Here we go

1317611368531566592 2020-10-18 07:40:04 +0800 <just_mindy> As bad as Heupel losing every game is, watching him go into the press conference looking like he‚Äôs just came off a 2 day bender and mumbling dumb nonsense makes me even more ragey.

1317609770413625347 2020-10-18 07:33:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Our coach is trash.  He always loses close games

1317609505212014594 2020-10-18 07:32:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 This game is making me crazy and it‚Äôs making me hate our coach even more

1317593937742278658 2020-10-18 06:30:49 +0800 <just_mindy> I beg Texas to take Heupel.  Please.
1317593666668630022 2020-10-18 06:29:44 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm already there.  He did fine for 2 years under what Frost built and it‚Äôs been awful since.  He looks like a frumpy disheveled mess all the time and is embarrassing.  The guy has zero charisma and isn‚Äôt inspiring.

1317584066041073670 2020-10-18 05:51:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC @markknoller Very few
1317583931420643329 2020-10-18 05:51:03 +0800 <just_mindy> It‚Äôs really good that COVID is a registered Democrat and doesn‚Äôt infect people protesting on behalf of leftist causes.
1317583679225516032 2020-10-18 05:50:03 +0800 <just_mindy> These folks don‚Äôt look very social distanced @markknoller

1317583094145294337 2020-10-18 05:47:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @JMR1834 @markknoller Exactly!!  Social media has changed the landscape
1317576303273443328 2020-10-18 05:20:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheWatchdogDBQ Right.  The texts indicate they know he is in a bad place.  Watching Jill allow Joe to run in his cognitive state shows me there is a total lack of self awareness in that family
1317574733425238017 2020-10-18 05:14:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheWatchdogDBQ He definitely was in rehab at one point because he was writing letters from there. I can‚Äôt get over believing it‚Äôs a good idea to send your son to other countries when you know he‚Äôs in full addict mode

1317440180740104192 2020-10-17 20:19:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @MrTate @ATxFellow Again? I can look at Biden and know he won‚Äôt make it one year in the Presidency. It‚Äôs a shadow campaign for Kamala and as far as I‚Äôm concerned, she‚Äôs a better looking Bernie. I‚Äôm praying for scales to fall off eyes and people vote for Trump
1317439308391981057 2020-10-17 20:16:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @Monkey3ddd It sure is
1317439137595727873 2020-10-17 20:15:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @MrTate @ATxFellow Biden isn‚Äôt the candidate.  Kamala is, and she was rated as more ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù than Bernie so no, it‚Äôs not amazing in any way.

1317334938727948288 2020-10-17 13:21:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, many Republicans are also artists.  Those people happen to have well developed creative sides yet also see the need for pragmatic government and liberty because that is where people can best express and create
1317334389186039810 2020-10-17 13:19:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Liberals make Art. Republicans keep the world safe for creatives to make art. Both are required.  If the creatives are tasked with the work of governing &amp; managing and protecting, they cower in fear and then the country is taken over by those who will tell you what you may create

1317326610777935872 2020-10-17 12:48:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @reeb1011 Yep.  The addiction is not Joe‚Äôs fault at all.  Allowing his son who was so vulnerable to trade on his name &amp; position is absolutely Joe‚Äôs fault.

1317325807967211520 2020-10-17 12:45:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl I understand, like you do, that people don‚Äôt get it until they‚Äôve been there
1317325669899141120 2020-10-17 12:44:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gurgun1989 Absolutely
1317325607190122496 2020-10-17 12:44:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chestertweet It‚Äôs frustrating when people don‚Äôt think addicts should be accountable
1317325484548567041 2020-10-17 12:44:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @Timm989 @ltthompso And what does that say about allowing him to work for foreign companies in a vulnerable state?
1317325307653820421 2020-10-17 12:43:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @Astonvillausa Yes and you know and I know, had he gave you access to 50K a month, you might not be alive
1317325149696413696 2020-10-17 12:42:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @reeb1011 Exactly
1317325082348445697 2020-10-17 12:42:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Addicts aren‚Äôt angelic beings who get caught up and if it weren‚Äôt for the drugs, they‚Äôd be sweet loving people all the time.  Just like all other people, addicts are sometimes selfish jerks even when sober.  The innocents are their kids
1317324629841760260 2020-10-17 12:40:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Please please stop behaving like addicts don‚Äôt hold responsibility for their behavior.  I can assure you Hunter had access to every rehab known to man.  He chose to skip meetings.  He chose in a lucid mind to start again.  He put everything else behind his drug of choice.
1317324227184369664 2020-10-17 12:39:05 +0800 <just_mindy> I say this from a personal place.  My husband (almost ex) has devastated me, our kids, his siblings and another marriage.  He isn‚Äôt an innocent in this. Yes, it‚Äôs a disease, but every time he used, he made a choice. He was offered help and love time and time again.
1317323602958712832 2020-10-17 12:36:36 +0800 <just_mindy> One more thing I want to say about addicts &amp; addiction.  We want to infantilize addicts often.  That leads to more sickness. Addicts have a problem &amp; need help, but we also must acknowledge they are selfish &amp; liars while using. These are choices.  Addicts still have free agency.
1317322550783971328 2020-10-17 12:32:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Again, I disagree. It shows a father who knows his son is very sick and very broken, but still allowed him to trade on his name &amp; position, to get lucrative seats on boards against his son‚Äôs best interest &amp; that of our nation.
1317319744370954242 2020-10-17 12:21:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @chim0m Yes.  I think Hunter always believed he didn‚Äôt measure up
1317317824201826310 2020-10-17 12:13:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Same
1317317562238205953 2020-10-17 12:12:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Amen
1317317475911041024 2020-10-17 12:12:15 +0800 <just_mindy> I don‚Äôt hate anyone.  I know what life with an addict is. I was an enabler.  I get.  I just think allowing your addict kid to be a pawn or foreign government and taking a slice of the bribe is gross
1317317086629253121 2020-10-17 12:10:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara I know!! Why don‚Äôt I parent or something!!

1317316324490620928 2020-10-17 12:07:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Where did I say my kids haven‚Äôt made bad choices? I wouldn‚Äôt allow them to use access to me to score huge sums of money that they would them snort up their nose. I can‚Äôt control what my kids do, but I can certainly stop them from using me as an incentive if I was a govt official
1317314284679024641 2020-10-17 11:59:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Um I have four children. The oldest is 30, then 25 and then 20. I also have an addict spouse who I would never ever give unfettered access to money and never allow him to be used in schemes with other governments because he‚Äôs unstable!

1317302606453219328 2020-10-17 11:13:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheWatchdogDBQ The Biden campaign hasn‚Äôt refuted it.  That‚Äôs a huge tell

It also has to do with the children never getting attention because their parents were too enamored with chasing clout and in Biden‚Äôs case, finding a new woman.  Children are often pushed to the back burner.
1317301769786064896 2020-10-17 11:09:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl @DeusVult1911 That he knew for 10 days!!!

1317301447399264262 2020-10-17 11:08:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl @DeusVult1911 Yes!! Very dysfunctional.  And while he is sleeping with his brother‚Äôs wife, he gets another woman pregnant
1317301127109615616 2020-10-17 11:07:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Exactly!
1317300997803417600 2020-10-17 11:06:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheWatchdogDBQ Probably what the ‚Äúbook advance‚Äù on his taxes were
1317300836838576128 2020-10-17 11:06:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy Oh. My. Word.
1317299747858878464 2020-10-17 11:01:48 +0800 <just_mindy> I don‚Äôt think his texts to his son are damning. What is a problem is Biden knew his son was quite sick and was fine with him sitting on boards and earning huge sums of money which we all know were for access.  He allowed his his son to be a pawn.  A son he knew was broken.
1317298947346620417 2020-10-17 10:58:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheWatchdogDBQ I‚Äôm sure it was being laundered
1317298811417579520 2020-10-17 10:58:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 I mean, what a dumb statement
1317297294069432320 2020-10-17 10:52:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl @JohnEkdahl Yes.  And it was an illegal recording
1317297095787876357 2020-10-17 10:51:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl And he was a former Democrat!! Now a happy warrior!!

1317293341541847040 2020-10-17 10:36:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Way into their 60‚Äôs for me.  I don‚Äôt see guys in their 30‚Äôs as attractive mostly

1317292204763774976 2020-10-17 10:31:50 +0800 <just_mindy> What about Biden exudes ‚Äústrong‚Äù to you? I‚Äôm seriously fascinated to hear this.

1317281200785051648 2020-10-17 09:48:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes.  If there are underage girls, he should be immediately
1317281098804695040 2020-10-17 09:47:42 +0800 <just_mindy> At this point, Biden needs to shore up Independents &amp; Republicans who don‚Äôt like Trump.  Allowing tweens to transition is not how you reach them.  Really dumb move.
1317280721275412480 2020-10-17 09:46:12 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm not sure how the ‚Äútrans‚Äù question last night was intended to help Biden.  I believe that demographic of parents was already firmly in his camp.  I‚Äôve had 2 ppl reach out today &amp; say they will now have to vote Trump because they disagree with that answer from Biden.

1317275553188220929 2020-10-17 09:25:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep and so is everything else which is why the Biden camp is mum.  They hope to ride it out like Cunningham and Northam
1317272307937804288 2020-10-17 09:12:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Wow.  Cristiano is going to the mat for the Biden campaign

1316906199200169985 2020-10-16 08:57:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod It should be that way
1316906108771045377 2020-10-16 08:57:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly
1316905270770077696 2020-10-16 08:54:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden is having a buddy chat with some guys son who served under Reagan but was best friends with Tip O Neil if you are wondering about the @GStephanopoulos cuddle puddle.
1316904451400257537 2020-10-16 08:51:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Yet out of the other side of his mouth said millions of people are already voting ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1316902285889441795 2020-10-16 08:42:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @lazyone2222 Exactly
1316901366200176640 2020-10-16 08:38:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden just said cops should shoot people in the leg and not to kill.  Anyone in law enforcement can tell you why that‚Äôs nuts .
1316898636601692160 2020-10-16 08:27:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 Yep!!! And they found out by requiring records from their cell phones

1316835048319004672 2020-10-16 04:15:15 +0800 <just_mindy> I live in Florida.  We have had kids back in school since August.  Our state is back open.  Our hospitals aren‚Äôt overwhelmed.  Our death rate is .02%.
1316834695678767104 2020-10-16 04:13:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC Apparently I have a huge wart on my face

Those people should protect themselves in the way they see fit.  We can‚Äôt expect economies &amp; life to halt when death rate is less than 1%.  I suggest an eye exam if you see a wart on my face.  https://t.co/9GyzHPVDab
1316832660673769485 2020-10-16 04:05:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba She was brilliant!!!
1316826497039114241 2020-10-16 03:41:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba Yes.  They are way too convinced they are clever
1316822750875594752 2020-10-16 03:26:23 +0800 <just_mindy> You appear to be elderly so I suggest you take precautions.  My dad is doing the same.  He, however, doesn‚Äôt believe my teen should be locked up at home with no life. It‚Äôs selfish for you to believe that.
1316820803745468425 2020-10-16 03:18:39 +0800 <just_mindy>  https://t.co/H5HMIubzUt
1316819859917942784 2020-10-16 03:14:54 +0800 <just_mindy> The death rate in Fl is .02% and people want to lock up young healthy people.  Makes zero sense
1316819539334762499 2020-10-16 03:13:38 +0800 <just_mindy> This is where I get my data btw    https://t.co/Jm5PPYJqIn
1316819189534011392 2020-10-16 03:12:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheGHThree Depends on where you live in Fl.  That isn‚Äôt a conversation you hear in central or N. Fl.  Not that there is anything wrong with that convo.
1316818902429696001 2020-10-16 03:11:06 +0800 <just_mindy> The actual death rate in Fl is .02% currently.  So less than 1%.  And we are completely open with no mask mandate
1316818103477710849 2020-10-16 03:07:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @FallerKristin Yes!!!  That‚Äôs awesome he does too!!

1316817966126829568 2020-10-16 03:07:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @jamiedupree Hmmmm.  I live in Florida and we were told that over and over.  Our kids have been back in school, our businesses are open and our hospitals aren‚Äôt overwhelmed &amp; our death rate is around 1%.  Where is the mistake, exactly?
1316817501511188482 2020-10-16 03:05:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @FallerKristin üòÇüòÇ I only do politics on Twitter.  Lol my guy is on Twitter but he doesn‚Äôt speak like that to women
1316817260900741126 2020-10-16 03:04:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @chris_b4 I think maybe so too
1316817204009205765 2020-10-16 03:04:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @BillWicker5 LITRALLY what some of the leftist men on here should be wearing
1316817024207683584 2020-10-16 03:03:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @Shauna74891161 The polls scare me.
1316816848097288195 2020-10-16 03:02:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Again? Number of cases shouldn‚Äôt concern us.  Number of hospitalizations &amp; death rates should.  Tons of college kids have it.  They‚Äôre asymptomatic.
1316816140690165773 2020-10-16 03:00:07 +0800 <just_mindy> If my man got on Twitter and called a woman names or disparaged her appearance rather than operate in good faith and present a cogent thought, I would be super annoyed.  I don‚Äôt know why women are ok with their husbands acting like trash bags.

1316813422101757958 2020-10-16 02:49:19 +0800 <just_mindy> Um, we are fully open in Florida.  Anyone who wants can have a party. Maybe you should take your ire out on your elected officials rather than a girl who isn‚Äôt in politics and is trying to live her life.  Twat.

1316802754237562880 2020-10-16 02:06:56 +0800 <just_mindy> No matter your political affiliation, are you confident in a Trump victory in November?
1316800522762977286 2020-10-16 01:58:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @Bruce84078206 Very likely
1316800473907822598 2020-10-16 01:57:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @LLSKYGIRL Yes. She also fails at humor
1316799086641676291 2020-10-16 01:52:21 +0800 <just_mindy> If you don‚Äôt understand the difference between you, a law student, and ACB, a judge who has to be unbiased, you should definitely drop out of law school.  For sure.
1316797991706128384 2020-10-16 01:48:00 +0800 <just_mindy> And that is why she explained the difference between academia and actually being a judge, as she is now.

1316787094455545858 2020-10-16 01:04:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @FallerKristin Always
1316787032992120837 2020-10-16 01:04:28 +0800 <just_mindy> And why watch Trump if you loathe him so much? Watch Biden, fan girl, wet your pants, get tingles up your leg, and go to bed.  Why do they care what Trump says?
1316786284548034565 2020-10-16 01:01:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @soccerdhg Probably

1316786196354412545 2020-10-16 01:01:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark I mean, at one point the NBA finals and the MLB games were both on at the same time and I had to DVR.  I didn‚Äôt scream that it was a miscarriage of justice
1316785791868309504 2020-10-16 00:59:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Unprecedented!!
1316785177662820355 2020-10-16 00:57:05 +0800 <just_mindy> Apparently people haven‚Äôt heard of the ‚ÄúDVR‚Äù and can‚Äôt record one town hall to watch after watching the other town hall? Even us rednecks in the South know about the DVR.
1316784775164760064 2020-10-16 00:55:29 +0800 <just_mindy> So?
1316784431684825091 2020-10-16 00:54:07 +0800 <just_mindy> These people are loathsome
1316772723377438721 2020-10-16 00:07:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Public schools aren‚Äôt ‚Äúowed‚Äù tax dollars.  The students of the state are ‚Äúowed‚Äù tax dollars.  The education is for their benefit.  Let families choose best &amp; least restrictive placement for their child.
1316771985163157507 2020-10-16 00:04:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Public schools take tax dollars from citizens &amp; give them back a subpar product.  Opportunity scholarships allow parents to make better choices for their child.  Kids can‚Äôt wait for public schools to improve.
1316771494035427329 2020-10-16 00:02:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 @proteinwisdom And that they don‚Äôt check with experts

1316761154581147653 2020-10-15 23:21:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy @HawleyMO I am eagerly awaiting it
1316760578258595840 2020-10-15 23:19:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC @suze109 @jack We shall see
1316760525733326848 2020-10-15 23:19:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow @jack Yes!
1316760049310629889 2020-10-15 23:17:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @suze109 @jack I hope so
1316759981350432769 2020-10-15 23:16:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @goducks321 @HawleyMO Same
1316758781469040646 2020-10-15 23:12:12 +0800 <just_mindy> My note: @HawleyMO is so fine
1316758669850275843 2020-10-15 23:11:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Now @HawleyMO speaking.  Says this is attempt by monopolies to rig an election
1316758497418190849 2020-10-15 23:11:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Now Senator Graham is speaking.  He states even if you are a Democrat, this censorship should scare you because it could be you next.  States nothing about Trump has ever been shut down.
1316758137848901632 2020-10-15 23:09:38 +0800 <just_mindy> The Democrats can try to delay the subpoena until after the election but @SenTedCruz hopes they will not.
1316757910811181057 2020-10-15 23:08:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Ted Cruz and Lindsay Graham will issue a subpoena to @jack to testify next Friday in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee
1316749128009953281 2020-10-15 22:33:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @GregoryZachBell It was prescient

1316619580924624900 2020-10-15 13:59:04 +0800 <just_mindy> This is the actual Twitter standard:      Does it hurt Trump?  No.  It‚Äôs ok, no matter how it was obtained.     Does it hurt Biden? Yes. Banish it to hell.    We all know this is true.  Let‚Äôs stop pretending otherwise.

1316543564848009216 2020-10-15 08:57:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep.  They have one narrative

1316542716482813952 2020-10-15 08:53:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep!! They don‚Äôt want to defend the opinion the media and their friends told them to have
1316542404070121473 2020-10-15 08:52:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Hi! I‚Äôm @justmindy on Parler, btw.  I‚Äôm a conservative woman, and they are getting nervous about us this week because ACB is a dang superstar.  I‚Äôll probably get banned soon, so follow me there pretty please?!  https://t.co/F9BKsd3wvf
1316541409592258560 2020-10-15 08:48:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes there has never been equal conservative representation
1316541194009280518 2020-10-15 08:47:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @jannyfayray @GStephanopoulos You know those folks are Democratic operatives
1316541065244147713 2020-10-15 08:47:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe Also true
1316540816169590784 2020-10-15 08:46:05 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly right
1316539856399593472 2020-10-15 08:42:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 She is pretty up front that she hates conservatives
1316539709422743552 2020-10-15 08:41:41 +0800 <just_mindy> When you leave your laptop behind at a repair shop and don‚Äôt pay the business owner, they own the computer.   He had every right to share info on a computer he now owned
1316538899188117504 2020-10-15 08:38:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @jannyfayray Oh yes.  They are celebrating this article being blocked
1316538795513257989 2020-10-15 08:38:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 Pretty blessed indeed.  Having a partner to share it with would be the cherry on top, but if not, I already have more than I deserve
1316538451840335873 2020-10-15 08:36:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 Yes.  I tried to move away from Fl once and I couldn‚Äôt.  I was miserable
1316538270134738944 2020-10-15 08:35:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @jannyfayray No.  @GStephanopoulos won‚Äôt even ask him about
1316537921487462400 2020-10-15 08:34:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @BethieBeemer Clearly
1316537872938340352 2020-10-15 08:34:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 She just hates conservatives
1316537779719991298 2020-10-15 08:34:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 Lol!! I have both of those things too
1316537353599692800 2020-10-15 08:32:19 +0800 <just_mindy> You understand the difference between a rally &amp; a social media platform censoring a major newspaper in favor of their preferred candidate, no?
1316536529075011584 2020-10-15 08:29:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 I could never leave Florida
1316535956170735616 2020-10-15 08:26:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 Yes.  My soul has to live by the water
1316535665467838464 2020-10-15 08:25:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @geologyguy Yes.  There is no justification
1316535406414958592 2020-10-15 08:24:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Very true
1316534777986658305 2020-10-15 08:22:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 I love living on the lake
1316534188661788673 2020-10-15 08:19:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 That is really my view.  Standing on my porch looking down on my dock. üòçüòç
1316533274035056640 2020-10-15 08:16:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 Yes!! In theory!
1316532685326766082 2020-10-15 08:13:46 +0800 <just_mindy> There is no hacking.  The computer was not picked up and the owner followed the law of his state and took ownership
1316532477280817152 2020-10-15 08:12:57 +0800 <just_mindy> The only right thing is to allow the story to be shared.  Period.
1316525727152574465 2020-10-15 07:46:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @tremlo3 She was great.  I believe angels surrounded her

1316525595703083008 2020-10-15 07:45:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @ugatapie That‚Äôs true
1316523513323364354 2020-10-15 07:37:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @tremlo3 Or that she was flirting with Ben Sasse
1316523401608130571 2020-10-15 07:36:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @PegLegPilot That‚Äôs what all that hate does to you
1316523343567294466 2020-10-15 07:36:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @Bruce84078206 She makes me ill
1316522958849028097 2020-10-15 07:35:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara I know!!! People seem really perplexed
1316522885796724736 2020-10-15 07:34:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear Apparently it‚Äôs a weird concept
1316522817320558592 2020-10-15 07:34:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @BKudron I mean, I always end up banging but whatever
1316522692128931841 2020-10-15 07:34:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @realmanofgenius I know.  It‚Äôs a concept
1316522544913166336 2020-10-15 07:33:29 +0800 <just_mindy> I hope to see something from @marcorubio &amp; @SenRickScott soon!
1316522114262929408 2020-10-15 07:31:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @cardi_mark Thank you!!! Saves me lots of time!!!
1316521916598038529 2020-10-15 07:30:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Men and women can actually be kind and have fun with one another without banging
1316521498358804480 2020-10-15 07:29:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @cardi_mark I‚Äôd love a guide if you have one!

1316519618719166479 2020-10-15 07:21:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC Exactly
1316519553346818050 2020-10-15 07:21:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Probably
1316518200142688258 2020-10-15 07:16:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC They didn‚Äôt mention the Biden story
1316516365046624258 2020-10-15 07:08:55 +0800 <just_mindy> If you live in Orange or Lake County, Florida, you can start early voting at 10:00 am on Monday 10/19.  Just FYI. #Trump2020
1316516069817962497 2020-10-15 07:07:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Ridiculous
1316515303371739137 2020-10-15 07:04:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @SWHesq More important to folks in the South tbh
1316514930632294401 2020-10-15 07:03:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax I mean. There is apparently no bottom to their willingness to be humiliated at the behest of the DNC
1316513876960305153 2020-10-15 06:59:02 +0800 <just_mindy> With everything happening in the world, the NBC national news leads off with....Barron Trump had COVId
1316508448993968138 2020-10-15 06:37:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 She just thinks so much of herself@
1316507878228926475 2020-10-15 06:35:12 +0800 <just_mindy> Totally agree
1316507222302695426 2020-10-15 06:32:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy @SaintRPh Yes.  We also have a lot of Anglo/Hispanic in Fl also obviously. It‚Äôs really seem as no big deal.
1316505574436151296 2020-10-15 06:26:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Absolutely!
1316504680982351878 2020-10-15 06:22:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy @SaintRPh Oh yes.  Very common in the South now
1316503308077543435 2020-10-15 06:17:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Preach
1316502102068416515 2020-10-15 06:12:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh I‚Äôm convinced there is way less racism in the South

1316157250512314371 2020-10-14 07:21:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @07shari22 Exactly
1316157192958074883 2020-10-14 07:21:42 +0800 <just_mindy> Ginsburg was way more forthcoming because she had been a PP employee.  It wasn‚Äôt a mystery.  ACB hasn‚Äôt worked for an abortion provider.
1316156878515318784 2020-10-14 07:20:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Way way way out of her league
1316156553469333505 2020-10-14 07:19:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @07shari22 She‚Äôs much smarter than Kamala.  ACB had to get where she is using her brains.  Kamala took the short cut.
1316156325160783872 2020-10-14 07:18:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 I get it!!!
1316156244420329478 2020-10-14 07:17:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @Queen2Five @SouthernKeeks With a quickness
1316154914700234753 2020-10-14 07:12:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Your husband is exactly right
1316154411647938561 2020-10-14 07:10:39 +0800 <just_mindy> And all day long today
1316153701913026565 2020-10-14 07:07:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @genethelawyer Maybe

1316106550008860672 2020-10-14 04:00:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yikes!!! Sending wishes and prayers for pain relief
1316106417858842624 2020-10-14 03:59:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @MaxNordau Exactly right
1316106264531927048 2020-10-14 03:59:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @jimantle Duh
1316106139885543431 2020-10-14 03:58:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Blumenthal has a lot of nerve to speak about integrity.
1316104407294058500 2020-10-14 03:51:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @jimantle But it wasn‚Äôt in the OrIGinAL.  üòÇüòÇüòÇ
1316102496218238976 2020-10-14 03:44:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, you would never have the balls to ask a conservative woman this to her face
1316102353519509504 2020-10-14 03:43:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @Modern_Templar Fair point
1316101043667832833 2020-10-14 03:38:35 +0800 <just_mindy> I like asking leftist men if they have low T or mommy issues.
1316098980703621122 2020-10-14 03:30:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @henning_love @SuperAndrea @LorenaSGonzalez Absolutely
1316098229797355521 2020-10-14 03:27:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @Sjanderson86 And how
1316098183588708352 2020-10-14 03:27:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @raymond04489465 That would be perfect
1316098100654755840 2020-10-14 03:26:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @Vets4AP Oh absolutely

1316093993650921473 2020-10-14 03:10:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeanBannion Got it!!!
1316093931730411520 2020-10-14 03:10:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax Yes!!!!
1316093630776578048 2020-10-14 03:09:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @RLMO306 Oh dear God
1316093574467985410 2020-10-14 03:08:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Safe travels!!! Leave plenty of bad juju in Memphis
1316092968466513921 2020-10-14 03:06:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Wait. They get to ask her more tomorrow? Someone explain this to me?
1316092584142540803 2020-10-14 03:04:58 +0800 <just_mindy> Tell them to Google me
1316091429282873347 2020-10-14 03:00:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jaihawkk Thank you!!!
1316091236089036803 2020-10-14 02:59:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG That‚Äôs also fair
1316090069317562368 2020-10-14 02:54:58 +0800 <just_mindy> This is driving me nuts and I wish one of the Republicans would correct this.
1316089886026366976 2020-10-14 02:54:15 +0800 <just_mindy> IT IS NOT GINSBURG‚ÄôS SEAT!!!
1316089666706251781 2020-10-14 02:53:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG That‚Äôs pretty terrifying
1316083660395814914 2020-10-14 02:29:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @Texas_Hillbilly It was crazy
1316083590950801409 2020-10-14 02:29:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @jgpetruna Yes!!
1316083478778318850 2020-10-14 02:28:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chad11057585 It is
1316080326721052672 2020-10-14 02:16:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chad11057585 And embarrassing themselves
1316080233821470728 2020-10-14 02:15:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 Exactly
1316080183296831488 2020-10-14 02:15:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @RLMO306 Yes, apparently
1316080001905762315 2020-10-14 02:14:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @jgpetruna üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
1316079923497492480 2020-10-14 02:14:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Thank you!!
1316079872712880128 2020-10-14 02:14:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chad11057585 It‚Äôs wild
1316079714965094401 2020-10-14 02:13:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 It‚Äôs insane
1316079642541916161 2020-10-14 02:13:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomWhig @Neoavatara True
1316079577127628801 2020-10-14 02:13:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Someone should tell Klobuchar that Ginsburg is gone now and it wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄúGinsburg‚Äôs Seat‚Äù and she needs to compose herself and move on.
1316079065976246272 2020-10-14 02:11:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara She is off the rails
1316078996388409344 2020-10-14 02:10:58 +0800 <just_mindy> No, but seriously, Klobuchar needs to take a Xanax
1316078763604676608 2020-10-14 02:10:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Is Klobuchar going to cry?
1316078575695663113 2020-10-14 02:09:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @bearshrugged @amyklobuchar Fair enough
1316078511984201729 2020-10-14 02:09:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @fionathepest Exactly
1316078429473771529 2020-10-14 02:08:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @37smadAmaS I can totally see it
1316078377435095042 2020-10-14 02:08:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG She acts like she is tweaking
1316078002636292096 2020-10-14 02:07:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 She‚Äôs aggressive
1316074062414843904 2020-10-14 01:51:22 +0800 <just_mindy> Klobuchar is even acting erratic today.  Trump has broken them all.
1316070817860661248 2020-10-14 01:38:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Literally impossible
1316068534783488000 2020-10-14 01:29:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @BeltoWNC My dad is only 70 and couldn‚Äôt do it!
1316067466565611522 2020-10-14 01:25:10 +0800 <just_mindy> cc: @secupp whatcha think?
1316066668678967301 2020-10-14 01:21:59 +0800 <just_mindy> One of you meme nerds please make Katie‚Äôs quote something I can share on IG, pretty please?!
1316066400998502400 2020-10-14 01:20:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara Exactly!!
1316066110203191302 2020-10-14 01:19:46 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm 45 and I can assure you, I‚Äôm still able to remember names and what state I‚Äôm in.  Biden isn‚Äôt close to 50.
1316065619347988481 2020-10-14 01:17:49 +0800 <just_mindy> By the way, loved @KatiePavlich breaking this down to ‚Äúa chance for conservative women to finally get a chance at the table‚Äù today.  That‚Äôs exactly right.
1316064787550343169 2020-10-14 01:14:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @EEElverhoy üòÇüòÇüòÇ

1316063261046046721 2020-10-14 01:08:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  Maybe we need a sanity test and an age test
1316062429332332548 2020-10-14 01:05:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 No.  He‚Äôs nuts

1316059724228460544 2020-10-14 00:54:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @PruPaine Which is happening right now with this ahole Whitehouse
1316059598466494466 2020-10-14 00:53:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @bfwebster @bethanyshondark I totally agree
1316059414042992647 2020-10-14 00:53:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Repping Pro-life, eating a banana, and listening to one of the most dishonest men in politics.  #ProLife #SCOTUSHearing #WomensRightsBeginintheWomb  https://t.co/YUxR6V62zk
1316055511209566208 2020-10-14 00:37:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @PruPaine Yes!!! And that she should have expressed more sympathy!! She has her own special needs child. She‚Äôs aware of the struggle
1316055343873634304 2020-10-14 00:36:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @prestonbaines He was particularly awful today
1316055283035189248 2020-10-14 00:36:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 Said ACB was not sympathetic enough to the medical stories of people who may lose health care
1316052413577662472 2020-10-14 00:25:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @OneFineJay @Jadkins151 Very true
1316052368123924482 2020-10-14 00:25:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @charcware That commentary was off the rails
1316052292349689856 2020-10-14 00:24:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @krezae That was bizarre
1316052231263850496 2020-10-14 00:24:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb He‚Äôs making a fool of himself

1316049650458267653 2020-10-14 00:14:22 +0800 <just_mindy> Did someone kidnap Chris Wallace? His opinions lately are horrifically terrible and poorly thought out.  He‚Äôs praising Durbin. Calm down, Chris.
1316049066728583169 2020-10-14 00:12:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jadkins151 It‚Äôs so ridiculous
1316048715023609856 2020-10-14 00:10:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @kc2fargo @TheGray168 So hard to think about
1316048637122752516 2020-10-14 00:10:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @wajhawk Exactly
1316048562464141314 2020-10-14 00:10:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy And infinitely more brilliant
1316047789185527809 2020-10-14 00:06:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy You retired and are enjoying life!

1316046477106589696 2020-10-14 00:01:45 +0800 <just_mindy> People might want to wait a few days
1316046178870611971 2020-10-14 00:00:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @goducks321 Yep.  We like our leaders young tho.  Rubio &amp; DeSantis for example
1316046063380426753 2020-10-14 00:00:07 +0800 <just_mindy> This is crazy to me!

1316045902294011910 2020-10-13 23:59:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @wajhawk Also true.  I do think there are very good arguments about the lucidity of 87 year old people though
1316045646080749569 2020-10-13 23:58:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheGHThree @HoosierInfidel And then let‚Äôs move on to almost 90!!!! That‚Äôs ridiculous
1316045274595422208 2020-10-13 23:56:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @Albany__Rose @Tamzilla_52 Swoon üòç
1316044699317174275 2020-10-13 23:54:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Feinstein was afraid to ask her anything

1316044340670746626 2020-10-13 23:53:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @HoosierInfidel Yes!  As someone else said, these aren‚Äôt boomers even!! They are parents of boomers!

1316043583363874817 2020-10-13 23:50:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @goducks321 Oh yes.  Although in Fl, Rick Scott is our oldest at 67, so not quite so bad
1316042761431404547 2020-10-13 23:46:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes!
1316042656192114690 2020-10-13 23:46:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest Both parties do
1316042535266070533 2020-10-13 23:46:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @S_A_Smoot There‚Äôs exceptions but not enough for octogenarian to be next in line to run the greatest country in the world.  AOC isn‚Äôt a product of youth but rather ignorance and indoctrination.  She‚Äôll be just as lost at age 70.
1316041543795572744 2020-10-13 23:42:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Y‚Äôall.
1316041463466164225 2020-10-13 23:41:50 +0800 <just_mindy> My dad was an executive in a Fortune 500 company.  When he turned 59, his company made it quite clear they expected him to retire by 62, at the latest.  An 87 year old running a major company is unheard of and should not be considered in terms of running a country either.
1316040868759994374 2020-10-13 23:39:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Holy crap!! I didn‚Äôt even think of that!
1316040767882883072 2020-10-13 23:39:04 +0800 <just_mindy> There should be zero elected officials that are 87 years old.  That is pure stupidity
1316040448058830850 2020-10-13 23:37:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Y‚Äôall?  87?! That‚Äôs freaking ridiculous
1316039710230433794 2020-10-13 23:34:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Hi Dr. Choi!  Please discuss originalism and the severability clause.  I‚Äôll hang up &amp; wait for your response.
1316038679496925185 2020-10-13 23:30:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Literally, he‚Äôs the poster boy for term limits
1316038483316805632 2020-10-13 23:29:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Durbin doesn‚Äôt give a crap about Black or minorities.  If he did, he would be appalled and shouting from the rooftops about the deaths in Chicago &amp; insisting  the people he represents be protected.  Yet every weekend is a new bloodbath.  So eff him and the horse he rode in on.

1316036734036185091 2020-10-13 23:23:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay Literally, Biden ran against him in an election and accused him of everything from killing Big Bird to grandma, but to add insult to injury, can‚Äôt even recall his name, calling him the Mormon.  Romney needs to get out of politics. It‚Äôs not a gentleman‚Äôs game

1316016546997661697 2020-10-13 22:02:49 +0800 <just_mindy> Joe Biden is refused communion at times.  This isn‚Äôt a good example.
1316015766693584898 2020-10-13 21:59:43 +0800 <just_mindy> I have a teen and we are slightly affluent.  This lockdown was extremely harmful to my child.  She is a new person back in school with friends and her activities. I haven‚Äôt heard one parent friend share their kids flourished.  Like zero.

1315806364304920576 2020-10-13 08:07:38 +0800 <just_mindy> We live in Florida.  Our Governor is not a tyrant.  He isn‚Äôt a dictator. He allows us to be adults and make big boy and girl decisions.  Thanks.

1315054094227329025 2020-10-11 06:18:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @wharrison51 @RantyAmyCurtis Agreed
1315054054310121479 2020-10-11 06:18:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @SackJD Yep!!  He will get them there!
1315053935556734976 2020-10-11 06:17:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Most people are going to get this and most people will recover.  Dragging it out isn‚Äôt helping anything.
1315053702579879938 2020-10-11 06:16:49 +0800 <just_mindy> If I was queen, I would say go back to work and school, concerts and regular life, stay home if you are elderly or have another comorbidity, &amp; let life go on. Wear a mask or don‚Äôt. Add an extra $150 to any SS check going to someone over 70 for delivery fees.
1315051501463711750 2020-10-11 06:08:05 +0800 <just_mindy> I miss Scott Frost
1315049989354196994 2020-10-11 06:02:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes.  They live behind me so he can come to my house to sleep if he needs to.  I‚Äôm hoping they can resolve it tonight.  We‚Äôll see.  Yes, the fall wasn‚Äôt bad thankfully.   TN is hanging in there.
1315048220456873985 2020-10-11 05:55:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Mine is fashion, snacks, and funny kids. That‚Äôs about right.
1315044473806688256 2020-10-11 05:40:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I wish you could send your AC tech.  Our guy is really sweet and is going to try and come tonight.  I can‚Äôt believe this GA game
1315042841505271809 2020-10-11 05:33:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @bigdaddyofnine Blessed man!
1315041552692117506 2020-10-11 05:28:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes.  UCF is on bye and UF üí© the bed.  Sigh. I need to turn on the GA game.  My dad fell out of bed and their AC stopped working so I‚Äôve been helping him and calling the AC company lol
1315038672744599553 2020-10-11 05:17:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep!
1315013020867796992 2020-10-11 03:35:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Same
1315012983408427008 2020-10-11 03:35:01 +0800 <just_mindy> I know the Gators lost.  Bring on your hate.  My Rays won last night so that sustains me.

1315011006637146117 2020-10-11 03:27:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @Michstfr1 Joe Scarborough is a joke who helped Trump get elected so he deserves everything he gets.

1314996664130834432 2020-10-11 02:30:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @alx730 Probably
1314996620614930435 2020-10-11 02:30:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest @irishspy Exactly
1314991011882586112 2020-10-11 02:07:43 +0800 <just_mindy> You‚Äôre a huge POS if you do this to your kid
1314987281531523072 2020-10-11 01:52:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 Don‚Äôt we all
1314986225309229057 2020-10-11 01:48:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @henning_love Me too
1314984682090647553 2020-10-11 01:42:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Welp
1314983399887691777 2020-10-11 01:37:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chad6454 They are so deranged they don‚Äôt think
1314983266802438148 2020-10-11 01:36:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicsofamy @Autie_Radig Absolutely!
1314983197025996805 2020-10-11 01:36:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy Really makes you think
1314983155078701056 2020-10-11 01:36:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @ButchM737 Exactly
1314982182579040257 2020-10-11 01:32:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @Autie_Radig @politicsofamy That‚Äôs a glow up!!
1314981808149323777 2020-10-11 01:31:08 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm shocked
1314981048271417344 2020-10-11 01:28:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chad6454 The illusion Trump is going to jail always makes me laugh
1314977010305961984 2020-10-11 01:12:05 +0800 <just_mindy> But if he loses and we lose the Senate, I can assure you Lincoln Project, Bulwark, etc. will have exactly nothing to do with rebuilding the party.  Your ilk are pariahs and will never be welcome in the movement again. Either way, this election is your last grasp at relevancy.
1314976515210313728 2020-10-11 01:10:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Someone saying ‚Äúhe outsourced judges to the Federalist Society‚Äù isn‚Äôt the least bit concerned with conservatism.  He may lose badly.  We‚Äôll see. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1314976099638669315 2020-10-11 01:08:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @Michstfr1 The economy by all accounts was anemic in its recovery.  Who else picked the judges if not him? This is fascinating to me.  Biden has also been credibly accused of sexual assault. Furthermore, I‚Äôm voting for the person who will further what I believe.  That‚Äôs not Trump.
1314975611589459970 2020-10-11 01:06:31 +0800 <just_mindy> There is no such thing as ‚Äúmoney meant for public schools‚Äù. That‚Äôs like saying RBG‚Äôs SC seat ‚Äúbelonged‚Äù to her.  The money is for educating children.  The money should follow the child.  An institution isn‚Äôt ‚Äúowed‚Äù public tax dollars when underperforming.
1314975125083742211 2020-10-11 01:04:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Go Gata!

1314972971426029568 2020-10-11 00:56:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle They lay low!!
1314970592043569152 2020-10-11 00:46:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @Michstfr1 Really?  He has selected conservative judges, been full throated in his support of pro-life and 2A, has defended the right of churches to worship, started working on criminal justice reform, fully supports school choice.  What is he missing for you?  He doesn‚Äôt talk nice?

1314940125852454914 2020-10-10 22:45:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman But this is just one chain of lakes with 2 ramps on it.
1314940004150521858 2020-10-10 22:45:02 +0800 <just_mindy> I tweeted the first video 8 minutes ago and they are still coming.  #Trump2020  https://t.co/gs3gZ2Jy1W

1314937874584875009 2020-10-10 22:36:34 +0800 <just_mindy> My dad was too sick after treatment to take the boat out today so we are watching from our porch.  It keeps going and going.  #Trump2020 #trumpboatparade  https://t.co/AxNOau1yuR
1314936281093242881 2020-10-10 22:30:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @Hellnutt @HolmesJosh And it‚Äôs not just the cheating.  It‚Äôs the multiple affairs, it‚Äôs sleeping with your mistress in the bed you share with your wife.  That‚Äôs next level humiliation.
1314934857273933825 2020-10-10 22:24:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @prestonbaines Gosh I hope so

1314932988132691975 2020-10-10 22:17:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 That would have been too much excitement

1314931244761837569 2020-10-10 22:10:13 +0800 <just_mindy> Wow!!! That‚Äôs inspiring.  Don‚Äôt know if I can go back to sleep now.

1314923225680416768 2020-10-10 21:38:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @GodIsMaestro @exjon They only understand power
1314922642940596224 2020-10-10 21:36:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Many of us voted for Johnson in 2016 because the other 2 were unpalatable.  It was more that Johnson was a decent human who cared about liberty than alignment with the Libertarian platform.  Trump has now proven he will protect conservative ideals, mostly.

1314915228463833088 2020-10-10 21:06:35 +0800 <just_mindy> This win was God‚Äôs little kiss to @RonDeSantisFL after Joe Cuomo talked about him.
1314914764192198656 2020-10-10 21:04:44 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying

1314910997195390976 2020-10-10 20:49:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Judd is right
1314908654978596864 2020-10-10 20:40:27 +0800 <just_mindy> This.  Why can‚Äôt people have a good life doing good work and just loving their families? That should be enough.

1314788413946712064 2020-10-10 12:42:40 +0800 <just_mindy> You need new friends
1314788298162929664 2020-10-10 12:42:12 +0800 <just_mindy> I just called Cal Cunningham a smug bitch if it makes you feel better.
1314787936857214976 2020-10-10 12:40:46 +0800 <just_mindy> The US is far from having the highest COVID death rate, so that‚Äôs wrong, and also you‚Äôre Canadian so just be glad we continue to let your country exist. Sleep well knowing we protect you.
1314782941575290880 2020-10-10 12:20:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 It would be better if he stopped being so smug
1314782484073263104 2020-10-10 12:19:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @WellSetBanana Agreed
1314782223455920130 2020-10-10 12:18:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @Bruce84078206 Then you can pretend that would be fun
1314781960397639681 2020-10-10 12:17:01 +0800 <just_mindy> There are absolutely other women and anyone watching this, knows it
1314781454430330880 2020-10-10 12:15:00 +0800 <just_mindy> A man that will bang his mistress in his own house, doesn‚Äôt give a crap about you
1314781163760824321 2020-10-10 12:13:51 +0800 <just_mindy> And he did it in the home he shares with his wife which is incredibly demeaning
1314780778065211394 2020-10-10 12:12:19 +0800 <just_mindy> Cal Cummingham and his pecker apparently are concerned with multiple things.

1314774983667843073 2020-10-10 11:49:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes, they did.  Since we know kids aren‚Äôt as susceptible, they probably either had it and were asymptomatic or they didn‚Äôt get it.

1314774008706064387 2020-10-10 11:45:25 +0800 <just_mindy> BTW, people on this thread acting like ACB is a pariah, there is an excellent chance you and your kids will pick up this virus eventually so maybe cool it.

1314772261455441920 2020-10-10 11:38:29 +0800 <just_mindy> She needs to not be a SC justice because her kids tested negative for a virus?
1314772057503215618 2020-10-10 11:37:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Nice mother and grandmother judging another woman‚Äôs parenting abilities.  Very feminism.

1314604344533282816 2020-10-10 00:31:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Listening now
1314604215717765122 2020-10-10 00:30:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheLoneRedshirt @RagnarsMate Good!! I have been happy!
1314603755191635969 2020-10-10 00:28:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @Papa_P_54 I hope they know that
1314603694831398915 2020-10-10 00:28:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @_BatMN_ Exactly!!!
1314603630520139776 2020-10-10 00:28:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheLoneRedshirt @RagnarsMate Are you happy?
1314603556062859264 2020-10-10 00:28:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @RagnarsMate Oh my!! What a mess.  Thankfully the people who chose virtual here are a separate issue.  Sometimes I think teachers don‚Äôt want to learn.
1314603268211965952 2020-10-10 00:26:57 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôve heard this frequently!
1314599070724509698 2020-10-10 00:10:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @RagnarsMate I‚Äôm so glad mine is back in school. She could not sit in front of the computer for 7 hours.  It was a mess!!!!
1314598862003335170 2020-10-10 00:09:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @awstar11 @CamEdwards üíïüíïüíï
1314598752515129345 2020-10-10 00:09:01 +0800 <just_mindy> What about the stress of kids being home with no supervision, assistance, food, social services?  What about kids not receiving services they need?
1314597771790503939 2020-10-10 00:05:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Open up schools!!
1314597375374229504 2020-10-10 00:03:32 +0800 <just_mindy> And I hope no matter what happens, they never get another job within the GOP.  Even if you dislike Trump, their stated mission to defeat Senate Republicans is inexcusable &amp; they deserve no harbor.
1314596902948745217 2020-10-10 00:01:40 +0800 <just_mindy> We like to call her fake @DrBiden

1314523089758281728 2020-10-09 19:08:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @RLMO306 Totally agree
1314510393503551489 2020-10-09 18:17:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Is the American dream: a country welcomes you and your family as refugees from your war torn homeland, you rise to one of the highest offices in the land &amp; then complain abt that country non stop while funneling campaign cash to your new husband after you divorce the old one?
1314508872183406598 2020-10-09 18:11:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Republicans ‚Äúattack‚Äù because Biden refuses to answer a question seems like weird framing
1314385664620855296 2020-10-09 10:02:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @bod25mike I am a sucker for a good love story
1314384646709407744 2020-10-09 09:58:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @bod25mike I love that
1314380725685231628 2020-10-09 09:42:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @Papa_P_54 Exactly!!!
1314374909016117248 2020-10-09 09:19:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU True that
1314374839067648000 2020-10-09 09:19:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @henning_love She does
1314370065782001664 2020-10-09 09:00:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Representation is important including inside the conservative movement  https://t.co/4xIOPfu1vz
1314369811204444162 2020-10-09 08:59:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Very true
1314369070637166592 2020-10-09 08:56:20 +0800 <just_mindy> People say these same things about Pelosi. By the way, they‚Äôre true about her as well.
1314368701026754561 2020-10-09 08:54:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Hmmm.  Seems like you are the one making judgements on a whole swath of people you don‚Äôt know based on an anecdote.  Maybe you‚Äôre the classist trash, here. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1314368332678733824 2020-10-09 08:53:24 +0800 <just_mindy> Or Kamala‚Äôs facials were rude and annoying.  Just as if I made them, and I do.  And then people tell me my face is rude and annoying.
1314359666332364801 2020-10-09 08:18:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @NickP13 Always is
1314359622631936002 2020-10-09 08:18:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman Gotta get one more in before the election!! High is 90 and low is 75 and rain isn‚Äôt coming until the afternoon!
1314358446062481409 2020-10-09 08:14:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @07shari22 Absolutely!!!!
1314358367285137409 2020-10-09 08:13:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @Levimatron So far, he hasn‚Äôt disappointed me
1314358291028377600 2020-10-09 08:13:30 +0800 <just_mindy> The Senate should vote on ACB tomorrow.  Pelosi wants to be dumb. Show her you‚Äôll fight back
1314357910403723264 2020-10-09 08:12:00 +0800 <just_mindy> If you are in the West Orange/Lake County area of Central Fl, we have the Trump Boat Parade this weekend, October 10 at 10:00 am.  We are beginning on Lake Minnehaha at Cypress Cove Marina. If you don‚Äôt have a boat, you can flag wave from the 561 Bridge or Lake Hiawatha Preserve.  https://t.co/omx8iPRBVI
1314353017047613441 2020-10-09 07:52:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @Barbarish Yes.  It would be interesting to hear more his plan
1314352591405551617 2020-10-09 07:50:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 That‚Äôs so nice!! That made my night!!  We are doing our best to keep our head up and be positive!! One day at a time

1314350020754321412 2020-10-09 07:40:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Hi @jack @TwitterSafety @Twitter! I know y‚Äôall only police the conduct of conservatives, but just for funsies, can you look into a death threat.  Thanks!!!
1314349479949078528 2020-10-09 07:38:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @Barbarish Sounds like a death threat
1314348782377730048 2020-10-09 07:35:43 +0800 <just_mindy> You best come with more than just your SAG card &amp; hairdresser.
1314348378499809280 2020-10-09 07:34:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 He thinks it makes Trump look bad

1314347604713635840 2020-10-09 07:31:03 +0800 <just_mindy> I love Pence but that‚Äôs not his vibe.  Dan Crenshaw, that‚Äôs a vibe.
1314346846429552641 2020-10-09 07:28:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @Monkey3ddd That‚Äôs true.  Just refuse to take a stand on any topic.
1314346382287867904 2020-10-09 07:26:11 +0800 <just_mindy> A favorite tweep can use some help. If you have a bit to spare, I know he would appreciate it!!
1314346070894407680 2020-10-09 07:24:57 +0800 <just_mindy> He was worth waiting for

1314344638912892928 2020-10-09 07:19:15 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm not reading the rest, but that line rings entirely true.
1314344185214926848 2020-10-09 07:17:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @jenniferlee_75 @SeanBannion I bet!!
1314344141837537281 2020-10-09 07:17:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley Ha!   I wish I could take credit.  It was Jesus or karma
1314343627288645633 2020-10-09 07:15:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @jenniferlee_75 @SeanBannion That looks so good
1314343495457529857 2020-10-09 07:14:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @skov1 You‚Äôre alive!!! Good to see!

1314343270542082049 2020-10-09 07:13:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @ajzeigler I know.  I‚Äôm super disappointed
1314342354728476673 2020-10-09 07:10:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Maybe the journalists should chill with the constant snark and just report the news and then they wouldn‚Äôt get the day wrong.  ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Also, he used to be way better than this.
1314341830721523714 2020-10-09 07:08:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @JustEric She is so ridiculous
1314341475933720577 2020-10-09 07:06:41 +0800 <just_mindy> It‚Äôs Thursday night
1314341009057361921 2020-10-09 07:04:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Be careful what you wish for
1314340436023095299 2020-10-09 07:02:33 +0800 <just_mindy> After Pelosi‚Äôs latest stunt, let‚Äôs do it
1314335011156504576 2020-10-09 06:41:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Anything to excuse incompetence
1314334882210951169 2020-10-09 06:40:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @KatMcKinley In my head many times.  No, at a company function she got really drunk and acted a fool and got fired the next day
1314332960401821696 2020-10-09 06:32:51 +0800 <just_mindy> The crazy boss who tried to ruin my career for me.  She actually did for a while but thankfully she‚Äôs gone now.
1314332789500710912 2020-10-09 06:32:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @ronni_g That‚Äôs the truth
1314329574088617984 2020-10-09 06:19:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I know Lucy from Charlie Brown and her fee for counseling lol.  I appreciate you always remembering and asking about him.  It means a lot to me
1314329287978364929 2020-10-09 06:18:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy They could keep negotiating I suppose but Pelosi wasn‚Äôt budging.  That‚Äôs different than literally refusing to tell the American public if you plan to blow up the SC or not
1314320447153070081 2020-10-09 05:43:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes.  He is doing ok today.  They gave him something for nerves so that has been a HUGE help.  He was able to go with me &amp; buy a washing machine.  I was happy about that
1314312191806517248 2020-10-09 05:10:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 @CindyPerry6 @debates The Biden campaign had everything to do with this.  If Biden‚Äôs campaign said they would participate in person, there would be an in person debate.
1314311886796709896 2020-10-09 05:09:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy A stimulus bill demanding no more cash bail, nationwide mail in voting and all the other crazy things Pelosi is demanding isn‚Äôt going anywhere.

1314309917864538113 2020-10-09 05:01:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @Barbarish It definitely would not

1314307625564229632 2020-10-09 04:52:11 +0800 <just_mindy> So this is supposed to be like a fun surprise? That‚Äôs not how this  works.
1314307107882180637 2020-10-09 04:50:07 +0800 <just_mindy> All this move does is make Pelosi look desperate.  Period.
1314262491686371328 2020-10-09 01:52:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @SackJD Ha!!!  Clearly he needs a wake up call
1314262364771016710 2020-10-09 01:52:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @DanLtcR Ha!! I need to discuss that with him
1314260216507179010 2020-10-09 01:43:48 +0800 <just_mindy> I feel like he‚Äôs not taking my new rules very seriously  https://t.co/OcX3NAhGce

1314257158951907329 2020-10-09 01:31:39 +0800 <just_mindy> I wonder if @DanicaPatrick expected the other race car drivers to go slower for her, give her prime pole position every race, draft for her because of toxic patriarchal culture, or talk more quietly when they were around her? Or did she just ask for equal opportunity? Hmmm.

1314254327255621632 2020-10-09 01:20:23 +0800 <just_mindy> It was down one day.  They extended the deadline another whole day.  This is ridiculous
1314253646733901824 2020-10-09 01:17:41 +0800 <just_mindy> With friends like this....
1314251001722023938 2020-10-09 01:07:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 Yes the LGBT has been surprising but great!!

1314249262650269696 2020-10-09 01:00:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 Dems never do well with Cubans but he‚Äôs doing way worse than ever.
1314248854196424707 2020-10-09 00:58:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Why is Pelosi refusing COVID testing?
1314248611753005059 2020-10-09 00:57:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Nancy Pelosi is way more impaired on a regular basis than Trump has ever been.  And, she refuses to test for COVID.
1314247268468482049 2020-10-09 00:52:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @joe_duque2 @KurtSchlichter Right.  And the man should say thank you
1314247149593526272 2020-10-09 00:51:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @darrellpwest @KurtSchlichter Precisely
1314244570226536448 2020-10-09 00:41:37 +0800 <just_mindy> I think the Biden campaign is making a huge mistake not to debate in person.  The debate was in Miami, a city in a state Biden needs, in a Latino area Biden can‚Äôt afford to lose, yet it appears he is bleeding support.  Not a good look to not show up.
1314243390339461121 2020-10-09 00:36:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @ValeriaPugliesi Clearly
1314242666570436609 2020-10-09 00:34:03 +0800 <just_mindy> No. This is McConnell saying he is in charge of the Senate and made decisions there and POTUS controls the executive and he made decisions there.  This actually shows Trump isn‚Äôt a dictator trampling on the other branches of government &amp; their autonomy.  That a good thing.
1314240101698985987 2020-10-09 00:23:52 +0800 <just_mindy> You mean he considered the data and made a decision based on his status as a free man in America?  How could he?
1314222573526319109 2020-10-08 23:14:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest Also, I‚Äôm in trouble

1314220602518110209 2020-10-08 23:06:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @NormanFBirnberg And it was going on during the campaign

1314214700834525184 2020-10-08 22:42:56 +0800 <just_mindy> You can tell he‚Äôs a Personal Injury Attorney watching this.  He‚Äôs been watching John Morgan tape. He sounds just like him.

1314210653305860101 2020-10-08 22:26:51 +0800 <just_mindy> I don‚Äôt rely on any face.  I rely on being more competent.  Try that.
1314209463050539008 2020-10-08 22:22:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes, it makes it hard to have personal relationships with co-workers for sure
1314209317000671234 2020-10-08 22:21:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @justanurse25 üòÇüòÇüòÇ
1314208819824660481 2020-10-08 22:19:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @justanurse25 There have been days when my dog couldn‚Äôt and I celebrated when they finally could so I feel this is journal worthy stuff.
1314207565299900416 2020-10-08 22:14:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @SackJD Yep!!  Would be perfect!
1314206982312660994 2020-10-08 22:12:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @SuperAndrea  https://t.co/5sB4Q3RGKU
1314206633753362432 2020-10-08 22:10:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 Yep.  That‚Äôs the whole plan
1314206280966262791 2020-10-08 22:09:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @SackJD Or a former Governor of SD
1314205783383445505 2020-10-08 22:07:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Me too
1314205690882187265 2020-10-08 22:07:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @ArcherMint Exactly
1314205338833313792 2020-10-08 22:05:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @newstouse @KamalaHarris Amy Klobuchar would tell people to stop the mansplaining defense.  I truly believe that
1314205148944637953 2020-10-08 22:04:58 +0800 <just_mindy> I just need a ruling on when it‚Äôs ok to challenge a woman who is asking to be a heartbeat away from the Presidency, actually.
1314204612837040128 2020-10-08 22:02:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATLSAHM @emzanotti Me too, particularly when a woman is asking to run the free world
1314204494540926981 2020-10-08 22:02:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @newstouse @KamalaHarris Absolutely.  Pence has 4 years experience as VP under his belt and knows the foreign policy goals of this admin
1314204131427520512 2020-10-08 22:00:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I think personal interaction is different than someone going to a job interview to run the world
1314203979941900288 2020-10-08 22:00:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATLSAHM @emzanotti Oh yes. Now we must be very gentle and never interrupt the women
1314203858894155778 2020-10-08 21:59:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @lifebythecreek Exactly right
1314203822940655616 2020-10-08 21:59:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jaihawkk @Neoavatara  https://t.co/ukUyD5kbe8
1314203700554993665 2020-10-08 21:59:13 +0800 <just_mindy> If after watching @KamalaHarris last night whither next to basically Mr. Rogers, you want her standing toe to toe with Putin or Xi, then vote for the Democrats.  No one who cares about their children‚Äôs future and this country can truthfully say they feel confident in her.
1314203131111038985 2020-10-08 21:56:57 +0800 <just_mindy> One more time:  absolutely zero people believe Biden will last 4 years.  So Kamala is actually the candidate.  She couldn‚Äôt handle MIKE PENCE who never raised his voice. This woman is going to negotiate with China and Russia on behalf of me and you?  No thank you.
1314202459791912960 2020-10-08 21:54:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @EdwardsPartick Exactly
1314202288777506821 2020-10-08 21:53:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara Why didn‚Äôt he hide under the table and let Kamala talk?!
1314201810501074945 2020-10-08 21:51:42 +0800 <just_mindy> üëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºa must read!!
1314201689906466816 2020-10-08 21:51:14 +0800 <just_mindy> To summarize, the feminists, the Media and leftists (but I repeat myself) are mad that: Pence called the moderator by her correct name, talked for a shorter amount of time than Kamala, talked at all, and kissed his wife.
1314201147893116928 2020-10-08 21:49:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gurgun1989 Well said
1314197445392424960 2020-10-08 21:34:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @Annie_Bannany She makes me nuts
1314196700005830657 2020-10-08 21:31:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @vbspurs @lazyone2222 Yes!!!
1314195869667938305 2020-10-08 21:28:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @vbspurs @lazyone2222 Exactly
1314195846033014784 2020-10-08 21:28:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @lazyone2222 @vbspurs I agree
1314195813652934656 2020-10-08 21:27:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @Annie_Bannany So very vapid
1314194924355624960 2020-10-08 21:24:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @lazyone2222 @vbspurs It‚Äôs true
1314193471377465344 2020-10-08 21:18:34 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm assuming they do married people things so I‚Äôm pretty sure her unmasked self near her husband is ok.
1314190924113678337 2020-10-08 21:08:27 +0800 <just_mindy> If you keep your body clean, than scream. Peace out.    (This is actually a really vulgar song and and I changed the word to body and y‚Äôall won‚Äôt get the reference because you don‚Äôt listen to what I listen to while I‚Äôm working out).
1314188699110969344 2020-10-08 20:59:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @EEElverhoy ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
1314188652021452804 2020-10-08 20:59:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Your character is not ‚Äúsomething other than the issues‚Äù.  The fact nudes of you could drop any minute, is a spectacle and a problem. That you slept with another woman in the bed you share with your wife speaks to your judgement. Sorry, Cal.
1314188005729603585 2020-10-08 20:56:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @EdwardsPartick ü•∞ü•∞
1314187869397962752 2020-10-08 20:56:19 +0800 <just_mindy> No we aren‚Äôt.  I‚Äôm a woman who doesn‚Äôt need a Hollywood actor or a journalist making excuses for my poor performance with accusations of misogyny.  No mam.  Either I hold my own with a man, or I‚Äôm not the best person for the job.  Period.
1314187000392671235 2020-10-08 20:52:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorraineHirsch @lyndseyfifield @MarkRuffalo @KamalaHarris Harris spoke for 3 1/2 more minutes total than Pence.  Your argument is factually inaccurate
1314186757634691073 2020-10-08 20:51:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Again, I‚Äôm sure Putin and Kim Jong Un will review ‚ÄúRuffalo‚Äôs rules for dealing with precious women‚Äù and abide by them in negotiations.  I don‚Äôt want someone this delicate representing the US.  Sorry.
1314186242519642112 2020-10-08 20:49:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman @office_chick Exactly
1314185624627351552 2020-10-08 20:47:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Kind of like the lavish funerals that took place all summer when no one else was allowed to grieve their relatives? Yep, it sucks when our political class lives by different rules.
1314184630308876290 2020-10-08 20:43:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG Exactly!!
1314184583794102273 2020-10-08 20:43:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @realmanofgenius Oh yes!! Very threatening!! Lol
1314184485605388288 2020-10-08 20:42:52 +0800 <just_mindy> That‚Äôs right.  If you can‚Äôt run with the big dogs, stay on the porch.
1314184348397174784 2020-10-08 20:42:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG Exactly what I just posted!! I‚Äôm sure Putin will be careful not to mansplain
1314184110294937600 2020-10-08 20:41:22 +0800 <just_mindy> What the Press is inadvertently admitting when they cover for Harris this way, is she can‚Äôt handle it.  They are saying she is so fragile, we have to run cover for her to mitigate her poor performance last night.  We‚Äôve nothing substantive so we‚Äôll throw out misogyny.
1314183663375052800 2020-10-08 20:39:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Negotiating and holding power in the room is a huge part of relationship and consensus building with other nations.  If Kamala cracks because a man challenges her, how will she deal with N. Korea? Putin? Is she going to cry ‚Äúmansplaining‚Äù to the press if Putin interrupts her?
1314182918814793728 2020-10-08 20:36:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @realmanofgenius Oh my word!!  It‚Äôs ridiculous
1314182700098564096 2020-10-08 20:35:46 +0800 <just_mindy> I don‚Äôt give a damn about Kamala‚Äôs feelings or Pence‚Äôs feelings. Answer the questions, if someone interrupts you, do it back to them, whatever you need to do to get your message out.  But stop whining and acting like women are so tender and precious we whither around men talking.
1314182193846071297 2020-10-08 20:33:45 +0800 <just_mindy> And journalists like Tapper &amp; @GStephanopoulos and Andrea Mitchell pretending like mansplaining should be a thing we are discussing after 2 people debate, 2 people who could be a heartbeat away from the Presidency, is insulting to the American public.
1314181663182774272 2020-10-08 20:31:39 +0800 <just_mindy> I do my best to be respectful of my partner who has earned some deference, but otherwise, I‚Äôll argue with a man the same way I would a woman.  And if a woman can‚Äôt hold her own with a man, leading the free world probably isn‚Äôt for her.
1314181190245642243 2020-10-08 20:29:46 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm so weary of the mansplaining garbage and maybe it‚Äôs because I grew up the only child of a domineering father &amp; a submissive Mom.  I learned quickly he would bulldoze me if I didn‚Äôt defend myself, and it prepared me for the world.  There isn‚Äôt a man that intimidates me.
1314180665529847808 2020-10-08 20:27:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok. Enough with this mansplaining bologna.  If women want equality, you don‚Äôt get to cry when a man goes toe to toe with you.  If you can‚Äôt deal with someone with the demeanor of Pence, some of these world leaders will really rock your world.  Kamala needs to grow up.
1314163935336189953 2020-10-08 19:21:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman I‚Äôm really really sure

1314039652538626048 2020-10-08 11:07:21 +0800 <just_mindy> In Biden‚Äôs current state, everyone knows he won‚Äôt make it 4 years.  You saw Harris tonight. They are back door pushing in a radical leftist agenda.  Don‚Äôt allow it.  #VicePresidentialDebate #VPDebate2020 #VPdebate

1314036837682479104 2020-10-08 10:56:10 +0800 <just_mindy> As a Christian, don‚Äôt believe Trump is a Christian if you choose.  No one at all can question the sincerity of Pence‚Äôs faith and that‚Äôs who I want a heartbeat away from the Presidency.  He will ensure the church is protected.  #VPDebate2020 #VPdebate

1314029860340236288 2020-10-08 10:28:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @CoachMarcWilson That was the most dishonest tweet I‚Äôve seen tonight
1314029723660570624 2020-10-08 10:27:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @JtheHut There is no evidence at all for S.E.‚Äôs claim
1314029609185415170 2020-10-08 10:27:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Pence was far and away the winner in this debate.  His calm demeanor is reassuring and I feel comfortable knowing he would step in and be President if Trump could not. Harris as President is terrifying.  #VPDebate2020 #VPDebate  #Trump2020
1314029063942672395 2020-10-08 10:25:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @loudnuff4u Amen
1314028829111975936 2020-10-08 10:24:20 +0800 <just_mindy> This is absolutely ridiculous S.E and you should be embarrassed.  The man couldn‚Äôt have been more polite.
1314027719567511555 2020-10-08 10:19:56 +0800 <just_mindy> I choose to believe God send the fly to give Pence super powers #VOTE #VPDebate

1314027125725429760 2020-10-08 10:17:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Pence has a fly on his head

1314022589401051138 2020-10-08 09:59:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @KristinBoymom It‚Äôs getting ridiculous
1314022512079122434 2020-10-08 09:59:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Harris has spoken for more time than Harris
1314022196335898626 2020-10-08 09:57:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @LorenSethC At least she actually says what they really believe

1314021672782098434 2020-10-08 09:55:54 +0800 <just_mindy> AOC tells the truth, at least
1314021459031994369 2020-10-08 09:55:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Kamala has spoken for 4 minutes straight now

1314019417869742080 2020-10-08 09:46:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Can someone do a time comparison between Pence and Kamala.

1314006522427564032 2020-10-08 08:55:42 +0800 <just_mindy> While we are discussing abortion, Black Mothers are 14% of the population yet 44% of babies murdered in abortion clinics are Black.  That‚Äôs a literal genocide happening under our noses but Trump hurts my feelings and stuff.

1314002309416968192 2020-10-08 08:38:58 +0800 <just_mindy> If you read the Bible, men like king Nebuchadnezzar were hardly righteous.  They were vulgar and sinful.  But Neb protected God‚Äôs people.  That was his role.  Same with Cyrus.
1314001714123603968 2020-10-08 08:36:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Again, the church &amp; its voters need to distinguish between people called to build the church (the faithful) &amp; people called to the messy, get in the mud work of defending and PROTECTING the church.  That‚Äôs Trump.  He‚Äôs proven he will do it. That‚Äôs his role. He‚Äôs not a Pastor.
1314000725492609024 2020-10-08 08:32:40 +0800 <just_mindy> That should be the attitude of every Believer
1314000620848848897 2020-10-08 08:32:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Evangelicals should care about the life of the unborn, our ability to worship and spread the Gospel, the ability to practice religious conscience in every facet of life, &amp; the protection of Israel &amp; safety of American Jews who are currently being targeted.  Period.
1313999718410792965 2020-10-08 08:28:40 +0800 <just_mindy> This is a lie.  Trump designated the KKK as terrorists on 9/25.

1313996636855599104 2020-10-08 08:16:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Praying people, say one for Mike Pence, because we know he will be debating the moderator and Kamala.

1313995773164560385 2020-10-08 08:12:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Glad to see the makings of a ratio happening here.  This guy is a complete hack, trying to accuse a Navy Vet who happens to be Latino, of sympathizing with the KKK. @ksatnews you aren‚Äôt giving us your best.
1313995001886629890 2020-10-08 08:09:55 +0800 <just_mindy> What do the eyes mean Dillon?  Are you side eyeing a hack reporting job? Surely that‚Äôs what it means.
1313994816993329152 2020-10-08 08:09:11 +0800 <just_mindy> An important discussion on the KKK? Is it 1960? Can anyone confirm we are in 2020 for me?
1313994556468350976 2020-10-08 08:08:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Trump designated the KKK a terrorist organization on 9/25, bro. Is there lots of KKK activity happening in Texas I‚Äôm unaware of? Do citizens of Texas list the KkK as a top concern?
1313992222963052547 2020-10-08 07:58:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 There is also nude pics and that is ripe for blackmail
1313992074308595718 2020-10-08 07:58:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Morgan Wallen broke the rules of the left and didn‚Äôt wear a mask while making out with U of Alabama co-Ed‚Äôs this weekend so now @snl cancelled his appearance.  Reminder SNL cast regularly overdose &amp; die and stuff but not wearing a mask is too far.

1313981177271914497 2020-10-08 07:14:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @prestonbaines At least Edwards was held accountable
1313981096439222272 2020-10-08 07:14:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @WellSetBanana And they‚Äôre right!
1313981035361832960 2020-10-08 07:14:26 +0800 <just_mindy> But ignoring it completely is brand new.  Dude is tweeting about the census today
1313980864657870849 2020-10-08 07:13:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @T_tothe2ndNGa He‚Äôs got cooties for all kinds of reasons
1313979994356547589 2020-10-08 07:10:17 +0800 <just_mindy> He can‚Äôt wear a mask correctly and he‚Äôs a disgusting cad.
1313979661135814657 2020-10-08 07:08:58 +0800 <just_mindy> The Daily Beast managed to turn this into an ad for how mean Republicans are to poor Cunningham and he‚Äôs raising money off it.  Gross.
1313978406250442753 2020-10-08 07:03:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, Cal Cummingham is trying the new Ralph Northam playbook of just ignoring scandal &amp; if you‚Äôre a Democrat, the media will make it go away.  Disgusting.
1313978034362494976 2020-10-08 07:02:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Romantic tweets?? How about the banging in the home he shares with his wife? Or the mocking her husband‚Äôs suicide attempts? Or even the second mistress who has been discovered.  Or maybe the nude photos she alleges are out there?
1313976190177214464 2020-10-08 06:55:10 +0800 <just_mindy> A blue check can tweet this and that‚Äôs fine.  Interesting

1313937215333060608 2020-10-08 04:20:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Lee is good with a man sleeping with his mistress in the same bed he shares with his wife.  That‚Äôs the kind of guy Lee approves of.  I hope Lee isn‚Äôt married. If he is, his wife should check his phone .
1313936431413370880 2020-10-08 04:17:11 +0800 <just_mindy> So did you count your mistress as living in your house or? Or do y‚Äôall just bang there?

1313909515809689601 2020-10-08 02:30:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 I don‚Äôt know what to think
1313908373042102272 2020-10-08 02:25:42 +0800 <just_mindy> There is zero chance Biden is up 11 points in Fl.  You would be hard pressed to find a Dem who wouldn‚Äôt laugh at that.  I fully believe Trump will win Fl, but if he doesn‚Äôt it will be a 1-2 point loss

1313868955405213701 2020-10-07 23:49:04 +0800 <just_mindy> A great example of implicit bias in Media: ‚Äú@GStephanopoulos worked for the Clintons. Now, he pretends to be a straight news reporter‚Äù.  Do you think he might have an implicit bias towards Democrats?

1313866019216261130 2020-10-07 23:37:24 +0800 <just_mindy> So Moss is going to bang her staff and then act like a martyr? Sounds like straight to Pornhub to me.

1313864698853457922 2020-10-07 23:32:09 +0800 <just_mindy> She could have made that a teachable moment.  ‚ÄúWe can disagree with the President‚Äôs policy while not using the r word out of respect for the differently abled‚Äù and then move right along.  The fact she wasn‚Äôt struck immediately at the offensiveness at that statement is telling
1313864116801613824 2020-10-07 23:29:50 +0800 <just_mindy> In case @KamalaHarris isn‚Äôt aware, using the verbiage ‚Äúretarded‚Äù as a pejorative is a no no.
1313863906071400452 2020-10-07 23:29:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Can someone ask @KamalaHarris tonight at the debate why someone calling the POTUS ‚Äúmentally retarded‚Äù was greeted with ‚Äúwell said‚Äù by her?!
1313862581086556160 2020-10-07 23:23:44 +0800 <just_mindy> ‚ÄúMentally retarded‚Äù and the crowd cheers and Kamala responds ‚Äúwell said‚Äù? Is this real life? If a Republican had said this, it would be all over Twitter

1313854091693625344 2020-10-07 22:50:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Mike Murphy, if you will all remember, spent the Jeb! money  destroying @marcorubio or attempting to, &amp; is a reason we have Trump.  Now, he‚Äôs getting rich grifting to ‚Äúdefeat Trump‚Äù, an issue he helped create. Nice work if you can get it.

1313568273485770753 2020-10-07 03:54:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @MollyRatty Right?? This mindset is the antithesis of a free society.

1313562847914401794 2020-10-07 03:32:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow @PastorKynan Def listen!!
1313562779706589189 2020-10-07 03:32:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @MichaelDKocian @PastorKynan Yes and I think a lot of Christians have erred in trying to make him like us, when God knew ‚Äúus‚Äù weren‚Äôt equipped to fight the cabal as Pastor Kynan terms it
1313562461228933121 2020-10-07 03:31:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 That‚Äôs for dang sure
1313562361714880512 2020-10-07 03:30:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow @PastorKynan He actually mentions LBJ in his talk
1313560639164624896 2020-10-07 03:23:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 That‚Äôs true
1313560537364656130 2020-10-07 03:23:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @chris_b4 Absolutely
1313560485388849155 2020-10-07 03:23:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @MichaelDKocian @PastorKynan But his behavior as a Believer had bothered me at times.  This talk allowed me to see his role isn‚Äôt to me my Pastor.  He‚Äôs fighting some really terrible enemies and it requires his demeanor
1313560080596504577 2020-10-07 03:21:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheLizMac @PastorKynan I was changing the sheets on my bed and listening and it was such an aha for me!
1313559797569073152 2020-10-07 03:20:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Azusa Street was began by a black man with one eye who could barely read.  Anyway, listening to @PastorKynan gave me clarity and offered new understanding I wanted to share. If you‚Äôre not a Christian, I love you &amp; you can scroll on by if this isn‚Äôt for you.  ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
1313559236396421120 2020-10-07 03:18:21 +0800 <just_mindy> The last thing @PastorKynan said is God revealed to him in a dream there is a pervasive effort to destroy the Black community via abortion &amp; the destruction of foundations because the Black Church have long been keepers of the faith. Pentecostals &amp; other charismatics can testify
1313558702574776322 2020-10-07 03:16:14 +0800 <just_mindy> This climate is hostile to the church.  We see it w/ casinos open, protests happening, airplanes flying, but churches forced to remain closed.  Yesterday, Cuomo threatened to close synagogues. He had no fear of making that threat.  It‚Äôs time for the scales to fall off our eyes
1313558096732655617 2020-10-07 03:13:49 +0800 <just_mindy> So when people say, Trump is so brusque and rude and not nice, how can Christians vote for him? Because he has and is proving he will protect the church. That‚Äôs his role.  Period.  He is picking judges that protect us. He‚Äôs doing what God ordained him to do.
1313557670792658946 2020-10-07 03:12:08 +0800 <just_mindy> And @PastorKynan continues:  Pastors &amp; Christians are in charge of building the church. Trump wasn‚Äôt tapped by God to build the church. Stop expecting him to behave like a Pastor.  Trump‚Äôs role is to PROTECT the church &amp; y‚Äôall sometimes bodyguards aren‚Äôt cute and don‚Äôt play nice.
1313556960042774535 2020-10-07 03:09:18 +0800 <just_mindy> So @PastorKynan was talking about his own realizations about current politics and he said God revealed to him there is difference between the ‚Äúbuilder of the church‚Äù and the ‚Äúprotector of the church‚Äù.  Y‚Äôall, this is so good.  Christians are characterizing Trump incorrectly.

1313131245715456002 2020-10-05 22:57:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoelWBerry @varadmehta It has its own room with en-suite
1313131127515873283 2020-10-05 22:57:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman Cheaters be putting way too much in writing.  Pick up the phone and call
1313130946628063232 2020-10-05 22:56:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara I feel so bad for him really
1313130383731552262 2020-10-05 22:54:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman Gotta stop texting them on phones that can be hacked too
1313130248817577992 2020-10-05 22:53:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @irishspy I thought I was special
1313130168458895366 2020-10-05 22:53:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @Philly_Hoosier It sure is
1313128818866114563 2020-10-05 22:48:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Hell hath no fury like one side piece finding out she isn‚Äôt the only side piece.  To the streets...all of them.
1313120332476284932 2020-10-05 22:14:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeamusPotStir It‚Äôs so hard to keep up
1313120232752414722 2020-10-05 22:13:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear Apparently not
1313110545004990465 2020-10-05 21:35:25 +0800 <just_mindy> So the 47% of Americans who pay no taxes, deserve no healthcare? That‚Äôs quite cruel of you.
1313110296697987072 2020-10-05 21:34:25 +0800 <just_mindy> The left will be back to hating Dr. Fauci again today
1313108300100177920 2020-10-05 21:26:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @MNobody67 Makes you wonder

1313077061456736256 2020-10-05 19:22:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Yeah he‚Äôs completely stable and sane
1313076947753332736 2020-10-05 19:21:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara Exactly
1313076893768392705 2020-10-05 19:21:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @justanurse25 @JustEric It‚Äôs astounding.

1313067478709350408 2020-10-05 18:44:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @justanurse25 @JustEric That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying.  The guy can‚Äôt do anything right.  Yes, it would be best if he rested quietly in the hospital for his health.  But when he does that, they say he‚Äôs on death‚Äôs door!
1313067035560116224 2020-10-05 18:42:31 +0800 <just_mindy> This thread is deranged

1312978975006830593 2020-10-05 12:52:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @xavierdreyman Tonight they are saying it‚Äôs North Korean style

1312977436888502273 2020-10-05 12:46:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Now the left is convinced this was a body double.

1312919664276762624 2020-10-05 08:56:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @MNobody67 @SaintRPh They‚Äôre running rampant on Twitter lately
1312919451134840833 2020-10-05 08:56:04 +0800 <just_mindy> And apparently there was an outbreak back in August at SS headquarters so logistically there would be immune personnel
1312919051476312064 2020-10-05 08:54:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrewHolden360 Yes!!!! Please Drew!

1312916101626564608 2020-10-05 08:42:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @FreeTreeBark100 Such a nice sentiment to root for the financial ruin of your fellow citizens

1312906075717369856 2020-10-05 08:02:55 +0800 <just_mindy> To be fair @JohnEkdahl tried to warn us
1312905709114265600 2020-10-05 08:01:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @rcjparry @RBPundit Oh I didn‚Äôt realize she‚Äôs an abortion doc
1312904514773684224 2020-10-05 07:56:43 +0800 <just_mindy> And that‚Äôs why the POTUS making appearances normal people wouldn‚Äôt make is valuable
1312903366394208258 2020-10-05 07:52:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @realboochon That‚Äôs for sure
1312902240785629185 2020-10-05 07:47:41 +0800 <just_mindy> That‚Äôs exactly right
1312901240020520960 2020-10-05 07:43:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth She would try
1312898890098671616 2020-10-05 07:34:22 +0800 <just_mindy> Good luck doing that to the President of the United States
1312898137556758529 2020-10-05 07:31:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy @SaintRPh Yes.  Matt had stated earlier it was a pretty common steroid so I was surprised when I read this lady stating this
1312895668885880832 2020-10-05 07:21:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Speaking of @Travistritt one of my all time faves of his     https://t.co/kKDsANnun9
1312895236599959552 2020-10-05 07:19:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @realboochon @SaintRPh That‚Äôs what I thought!
1312895138075729921 2020-10-05 07:19:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @independentgrly She has gone off her rocker
1312894637611405312 2020-10-05 07:17:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @jcburley @realDonaldTrump Right?
1312894511144677376 2020-10-05 07:16:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh Exactly!
1312894121162481665 2020-10-05 07:15:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @jcburley @technonovice Never
1312894029768654849 2020-10-05 07:15:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @independentgrly It‚Äôs sad
1312893949711912961 2020-10-05 07:14:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh I mean, maybe?

1312893475789078528 2020-10-05 07:12:51 +0800 <just_mindy> As if the SS isn‚Äôt around him constantly sick or well
1312893337377136640 2020-10-05 07:12:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Could any drug Rubin is taking contribute to her inability to comprehend how insane she sounds?

1312891462108024833 2020-10-05 07:04:51 +0800 <just_mindy> Cc:  @SaintRPh is this true
1312890145608265728 2020-10-05 06:59:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @TrumpGoldenAge True!
1312890023071625216 2020-10-05 06:59:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @BooRad859 And it‚Äôs better ice cream than you eat too
1312889887180419073 2020-10-05 06:58:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Yep!
1312885306656522242 2020-10-05 06:40:23 +0800 <just_mindy> I just wanted to pull the band aid off quick so y‚Äôall wouldn‚Äôt be shocked that the leader of the Free World lives differently than you.
1312885075265163265 2020-10-05 06:39:28 +0800 <just_mindy> To all the people shocked POTUS is getting better medical care than you:  (clears throat) He also: eats better food than you, lives in a nicer house than you, has a better staff than you, has better protection than you, flies on a better plane than you, has better cars than you.
1312883673583280129 2020-10-05 06:33:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @Maureen22198991 @OneFineJay Yes
1312883429076328450 2020-10-05 06:32:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @technonovice That would be great!
1312880191321055233 2020-10-05 06:20:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @independentgrly Me too
1312879932314390529 2020-10-05 06:19:02 +0800 <just_mindy> So @cnn finally admitting the SS agents had on masks, protective eyewear and gowns as I said 20 minutes ago
1312878272888410113 2020-10-05 06:12:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Maybe everyone decided the most important thing was Americans seeing their leader was healing and strong and Trump having COVID isn‚Äôt like your friend having COVID because your friend doesn‚Äôt run the country.
1312877477438554112 2020-10-05 06:09:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe Me too
1312877326133321734 2020-10-05 06:08:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Mark please don‚Äôt start doing this.  You used to be the one readable journalist left
1312876613042876418 2020-10-05 06:05:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @OceandocScott As usual
1312876566020489216 2020-10-05 06:05:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Do any of us know if those SS agents may have already had it? Are we saying masks don‚Äôt work now because the SS agents are masked.  They are also wearing gowns.  Someone should tell @cnnbrk @CNN
1312875346954510337 2020-10-05 06:00:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @kpsmith46 Apparently not since they are saying those SS agents are going to die now
1312875165051744261 2020-10-05 06:00:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Anyone that gets on a subway in NY tomorrow is way more in danger of catching COVID from a fellow passenger than what Trump just did
1312874786398314496 2020-10-05 05:58:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @jones4440 Exactly!!!
1312874577417166848 2020-10-05 05:57:45 +0800 <just_mindy> You are an insane person
1312874167583244288 2020-10-05 05:56:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @capnbrunchusa @KurtSchlichter Yep.  It‚Äôs what my son wears
1312873154818330624 2020-10-05 05:52:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest She does

1312872516248051713 2020-10-05 05:49:34 +0800 <just_mindy> are you asking Kamala to arrest him or?
1312872241630244866 2020-10-05 05:48:29 +0800 <just_mindy> And everyone was masked and wearing gowns.
1312872116870578177 2020-10-05 05:47:59 +0800 <just_mindy> He didn‚Äôt interact with the public crazy person
1312871314634551297 2020-10-05 05:44:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok all those panicked, everyone in the car with Trump had on full gown and mask and Trump was masked.  Trump didn‚Äôt exit the car.  You can all breathe.
1312869730001334272 2020-10-05 05:38:30 +0800 <just_mindy> He never got out of his vehicle and was wearing a mask.
1312868600118677505 2020-10-05 05:34:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @UriBlago @bennyjohnson @realDonaldTrump You know they will
1312868555105370112 2020-10-05 05:33:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @jones4440 @JohnEkdahl That‚Äôs also perfect!
1312823011280662529 2020-10-05 02:32:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy Yes!!!  Perfect!!! Lol@
1312819931273064448 2020-10-05 02:20:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth Truth
1312808946151944197 2020-10-05 01:36:58 +0800 <just_mindy> I also love a firm eggplant, fake Dr. Jill.  üçÜ üçÜ
1312808223955705857 2020-10-05 01:34:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  I hate the feminists for this.
1312806529565888517 2020-10-05 01:27:22 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôve watched this 20 times.  It‚Äôs hard to see someone else living your dreams.
1312803218427179008 2020-10-05 01:14:12 +0800 <just_mindy> By your logic people who pay no taxes deserve no medical care?
1312802864088133632 2020-10-05 01:12:48 +0800 <just_mindy> A note:  we saw her practically collapse into a van and her campaign refused to release basically any info
1312802357785309189 2020-10-05 01:10:47 +0800 <just_mindy> The real victim is his wife but she has decided to stay with him, so again, she has agency.  She knows what he is capable of.
1312802095398105088 2020-10-05 01:09:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Baby Mama is a lawyer.  Let‚Äôs stop acting like women have no agency and can‚Äôt decide not to sleep with married men and can‚Äôt practice birth control.  Is he a prick for not caring for his son?  Yes, if true.  But let‚Äôs stop petting her like she has limited capacities or something.
1312800971681148929 2020-10-05 01:05:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @NursePatrickQ I hope she has at least switched to Lights and quit the Reds now
1312800555320909826 2020-10-05 01:03:37 +0800 <just_mindy> I think Miller is a total cad but let‚Äôs be clear, Baby Mama knew he was married and for some reason, grown people didn‚Äôt practice birth control.  Let‚Äôs stop acting victimized.
1312800042865098758 2020-10-05 01:01:35 +0800 <just_mindy> How could anyone just be hearing of Miller‚Äôs child support and custody case? His Baby Mama has tweeted about it literally every day for the last 2 years.
1312798954371903490 2020-10-05 00:57:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @PetiteNicoco @_CrotalusAtrox_ I heard his mom stays hunkered down
1312798559360757760 2020-10-05 00:55:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @mooshakins Right.  As long as he has an R after his name, they‚Äôll never like him
1312798433225441280 2020-10-05 00:55:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @Dec1968 Definite TDS everywhere
1312797080851800091 2020-10-05 00:49:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @mooshakins It really makes me question his motives.
1312796913058680834 2020-10-05 00:49:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara @mooshakins Allow the Doctors to give medical updates.  This seems like a no brainer. It‚Äôs like when a Doc comes and gives an update to a family and then one family member goes on FB and adds their own commentary.  Never helpful.
1312796242376880128 2020-10-05 00:46:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @mooshakins I mean, Meadows knows how this press is!!  Why do such a dumb thing
1312796070934704131 2020-10-05 00:45:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @Dec1968 It really is
1312795788427382784 2020-10-05 00:44:41 +0800 <just_mindy> He should be.  Meadows was out of pocket.

1312794495277293574 2020-10-05 00:39:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  This is the one that makes me laugh the most
1312793626934743040 2020-10-05 00:36:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 Also yes
1312793568587788289 2020-10-05 00:35:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @Dec1968 Right!  He is allowed a measure of privacy
1312792832957087744 2020-10-05 00:32:56 +0800 <just_mindy> The Dr said he could be released as early as tomorrow.  They said his Oxygen level is 98 now. That‚Äôs really all the public needs to know.  We aren‚Äôt entitled to know the intricacies of his lung cilia. This is getting absolutely ridiculous.
1312790993092173825 2020-10-05 00:25:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 Yes he did.
1312790430203994112 2020-10-05 00:23:23 +0800 <just_mindy> That‚Äôs terrifying
1312790303502479366 2020-10-05 00:22:53 +0800 <just_mindy> He won‚Äôt win Florida.  Anyone who lives here knows that.  Even the Dems who live here know the chance of them winning here is low.
1312778765127294982 2020-10-04 23:37:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @ItsNorah88 I‚Äôm so glad we have Desantis
1312778664107540482 2020-10-04 23:36:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @rechnen And again you have the issue of incubation and time to show symptoms being too short since the rose garden event
1312778285408030722 2020-10-04 23:35:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @rechnen But it‚Äôs fine if you‚Äôre protesting
1312778220085878785 2020-10-04 23:34:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @CraigR3521 Yes!
1312778166478540803 2020-10-04 23:34:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @dieseldave97 Exactly
1312762734644277250 2020-10-04 22:33:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @ItsNorah88 üòÇüòÇüòÇ
1312758536225591301 2020-10-04 22:16:39 +0800 <just_mindy> I like this.  A lot.  The positivity.  The let‚Äôs get it done mentality.
1312757787542290439 2020-10-04 22:13:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @ItsNorah88 I‚Äôm shocked he hasn‚Äôt embraced masks.  We know how he loves to dress up!
1312757551377809412 2020-10-04 22:12:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear Exactly!!
1312757262948196353 2020-10-04 22:11:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear True
1312757210884321280 2020-10-04 22:11:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Leftists are so bizarre
1312756348409589760 2020-10-04 22:07:57 +0800 <just_mindy> *Spreader
1312756228544749573 2020-10-04 22:07:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Interesting.  I forgot Northam had it. I thought only dumb Republicans caught COVID.  We know Northam is a particular fan of masks of many kinds.  Wonder how he got it.
1312754718838599681 2020-10-04 22:01:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Because of my Dad‚Äôs cancer, he and my Mom sent in their ballots but we sent them in already and I will track them online to ensure they were received (that‚Äôs an option in our county).  So it you mail and can track, please double check.
1312754325693837312 2020-10-04 21:59:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Piggybacking on Mickey (@BiasedGirl) please try to vote in person this year.  It will make election night much clearer.  Also, drive someone else to the polls.  We have early voting in our huge library so I know we can social distance and vote safely.
1312753505162203142 2020-10-04 21:56:40 +0800 <just_mindy> As do all the rest of the conservative academics.  We know better.
1312752770533986304 2020-10-04 21:53:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @BeltoWNC Seriously? How strange!!
1312752655895277569 2020-10-04 21:53:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Here is an example.  Even Trump showing severe symptoms on Thursday don‚Äôt fit this ‚ÄúRose Garden Massacre‚Äù Timeline.  We know Hicks showed symptoms on Wed.  That would have only been 4 days after this.  No way.  Plus Tillis has it &amp; was wearing a mask at this event.
1312751674482663427 2020-10-04 21:49:23 +0800 <just_mindy> So all the ‚ÄúWAIT TWO WEEKS‚Äù and ‚ÄúYOU WONT KNOW ANYTHING FOR 2 WEEKS‚Äù any time DeSantis does any opening of Florida, becomes 2 DAYS if it happens in DC?  There is no way the ACB ceremony was the super spreader event and it also belies what we know a hit outdoor transmission.
1312750973526446081 2020-10-04 21:46:36 +0800 <just_mindy> So, to buy what Democrats and Media are selling, we have to believe in 2 1/2 days, POTUS/ First Lady started having symptoms and went to the debate any way.  2 1/2 DAYS for a virus we know can have a 10-14 day incubation period and then another 3-5 days for symptoms to begin.
1312750229511385089 2020-10-04 21:43:39 +0800 <just_mindy> ACB‚Äôs Rose Garden ceremony was 9/26. This is the event being dubbed the ‚Äúsuper speeder‚Äù. The Left &amp; Media (but I repeat myself) want us to believe Trump &amp; FLOTUS knew they had COVID on debate night 9/29. That flies in the face of everything we know about this virus.
1312748154043936768 2020-10-04 21:35:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy @TheValuesVoter @Atticus59914029 He can‚Äôt because the House controls the purse strings. The travel ban (it wasn‚Äôt a Muslim ban as 3 of the world‚Äôs largest Muslim countries were not on the list), fell under National Security &amp; he is given a wide berth to make executive decisions in that regard.
1312606673308090368 2020-10-04 12:13:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalFF Oh my word!!!  That‚Äôs crazy!!!  My son‚Äôs department hosted the Brotherhood Ride today. He said it was neat having them.
1312606263025569793 2020-10-04 12:11:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @SBroadie It is very sad
1312605389041664002 2020-10-04 12:08:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @BellAMerican Exactly right
1312605330161971200 2020-10-04 12:07:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes.  I blame the Media for filing people with this invective
1312605163853578240 2020-10-04 12:07:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @TurtledoveJB Fair point
1312605112590893056 2020-10-04 12:07:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheLizMac I know.  She needs an intervention
1312605036376137728 2020-10-04 12:06:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @henning_love At some point, people are so toxic, you have to.  A daughter posting a pic of her father while he is sick should not invoke this sort of vitriol
1312604576198123520 2020-10-04 12:04:52 +0800 <just_mindy> I really did not like President Obama.  If he had a health crisis, however, I would never have of dreamed of commenting something nasty if his daughters chose to post a pic honoring him.  What is wrong with people?
1312604108113817600 2020-10-04 12:03:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay I find it unbelievable too but that‚Äôs what her Wash Post Bio says
1312603966337937408 2020-10-04 12:02:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Right.  You would think they could control themselves until he is well
1312603567430172672 2020-10-04 12:00:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay She actually has a husband and sons. That‚Äôs why this astounds me!
1312603477865123840 2020-10-04 12:00:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomWhig Exactly
1312603417089576960 2020-10-04 12:00:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep.  It was a bad day for many teams
1312603146728992769 2020-10-04 11:59:11 +0800 <just_mindy> There are several offices in the Presidential wing.
1312602979971850240 2020-10-04 11:58:32 +0800 <just_mindy> You people are really sick.  Normal daughters post nice tributes to their parents on social  media during a health crisis.  That event makes you realize how precious your parents are to you and it‚Äôs a sentimental gesture.  You‚Äôre a mother. You should know better.
1312602277400715265 2020-10-04 11:55:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 We don‚Äôt deserve to be
1312601987947671552 2020-10-04 11:54:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @varadmehta Judging from the outcome of that campaign? Yes.
1312601601782185985 2020-10-04 11:53:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Take a look in the mirror
1312601499638394880 2020-10-04 11:52:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Love the underlying misogyny here that an accomplished woman and mother is still begging for her Father‚Äôs approval &amp; can‚Äôt just be posting a photo because she chose to honor him out of love.
1312599067273441281 2020-10-04 11:42:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes.  That‚Äôs my only comfort.  The Gators won
1312595662207365121 2020-10-04 11:29:27 +0800 <just_mindy> And she learned nothing
1312590119384371200 2020-10-04 11:07:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 They are a whole mess tonight
1312590026753048577 2020-10-04 11:07:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gormogons True!
1312585384971431941 2020-10-04 10:48:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Not usually this bad
1312584096397373441 2020-10-04 10:43:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @fionathepest He‚Äôs such a drama Queen
1312583386511355904 2020-10-04 10:40:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gormogons Right!! He has an office there and the Doctors have access to everything they need
1312582165540958214 2020-10-04 10:35:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gormogons Pretty sure the President isn‚Äôt taking up beds meant for others in the Presidential suite at Walter Reed.  Unless she is talking about Christie and I‚Äôm quite sure he has health challenges
1312580295233806336 2020-10-04 10:28:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheWatchdogDBQ See?  They‚Äôre peaceful.
1312578751969013760 2020-10-04 10:22:15 +0800 <just_mindy> They‚Äôre peacefully protesting Auburn.

1312564212129030144 2020-10-04 09:24:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @Annie_Bannany No don‚Äôt!!!  More is better
1312562132685389825 2020-10-04 09:16:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 It‚Äôs not so bouncy today because they are letting so few fans in but once it can fill up again, it will bounce like it should again
1312558283958484992 2020-10-04 09:00:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Thank goodness because our offense is trash today
1312558201909506049 2020-10-04 09:00:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I‚Äôm fun but loud.  Cute is probably in the eye of the beholder lol
1312556839012360194 2020-10-04 08:55:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I told you we are a mess tonight.  I scream and clap loud
1312555465079959553 2020-10-04 08:49:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 It just means you have good taste!  https://t.co/vz2jc8C447
1312554358693933057 2020-10-04 08:45:19 +0800 <just_mindy> Why do you require that number?
1312554202007252992 2020-10-04 08:44:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I‚Äôm hoping we move up.  It‚Äôs really rainy here so that‚Äôs not helping
1312553636858417152 2020-10-04 08:42:27 +0800 <just_mindy> The CDC recommends children NOT wear masks when engaging in outdoor activity as the masks get wet with sweat and inhibit breathing.  They should social distance. So, your child‚Äôs ballet school isn‚Äôt following guidelines.    https://t.co/OU8Ru2AjiB
1312551699735867392 2020-10-04 08:34:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 We still look sloppy but we are hanging in there
1312548290584621056 2020-10-04 08:21:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle Right.  I would put nothing past her

1312528817135603712 2020-10-04 07:03:50 +0800 <just_mindy> These people are insane.  This is in reference to our President, btw.  https://t.co/Rj9h7sMk76

1312517551298019329 2020-10-04 06:19:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gormogons @Darth_Mommie Oh I‚Äôm so sorry.  He‚Äôs sorry.  He‚Äôs a good boy
1312511948206956544 2020-10-04 05:56:48 +0800 <just_mindy> All these replies ‚Äúoh he can just check in?‚Äù.  Y‚Äôall know good and well that man is obese, probably has diabetes and high blood pressure, and if he has had any breathing issues, he will be admitted. Some of y‚Äôall need to chill.
1312497395649769472 2020-10-04 04:58:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay Yep.  Many republicans were so angry after the way the Dems acted and how Mitt was so complacent, it started this Trump phenomena
1312496559582445569 2020-10-04 04:55:39 +0800 <just_mindy> And while it was kind for Mitt to forgive, the damage wasn‚Äôt just to him.  Reid muddied the political discourse &amp; took character defamation to new heights. Mitt was the figure Reid used, but the damage was done to all Americans &amp; trust of our institutions.
1312491952567316480 2020-10-04 04:37:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gurgun1989 It‚Äôs ridiculous

1312477725123178497 2020-10-04 03:40:48 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôve literally never seen people who are so naive and dumb think they are so wise and nimble as people who worship the LP founders
1312473231400476673 2020-10-04 03:22:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @TrishFowler10 If the Dems don‚Äôt deny it, it must be true!
1312472780751790082 2020-10-04 03:21:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @geologyguy @SpeakerPelosi That‚Äôs how this works, right?!
1312470949829074945 2020-10-04 03:13:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 They would certainly accuse the GOP of it
1312470814084616193 2020-10-04 03:13:21 +0800 <just_mindy> See how easy it is to just make up facts to fit whatever narrative one would like?
1312470660698927104 2020-10-04 03:12:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh also all the Dem Senators thought ACB was going to get COVID from the person they sent in to her ceremony so that‚Äôs why they refused to meet with her.  It wasn‚Äôt about ethics.  They knew she had been exposed to COVID &amp; thought she could give it to them.
1312470077229330433 2020-10-04 03:10:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @xavierdreyman Or maybe the reporter intended it.  Who knows!
1312469629109825537 2020-10-04 03:08:38 +0800 <just_mindy> I have as much evidence for this as yall do for calling these Doctors at Walter Reed liars and quacks.
1312469368559693824 2020-10-04 03:07:36 +0800 <just_mindy> They figured they would get ACB and Senators sick, as well as the President, and that would delay her confirmation until after the election.  That‚Äôs my theory and unless Nancy Pelosi denounces it, I‚Äôll assume it‚Äôs true
1312468923359481856 2020-10-04 03:05:50 +0800 <just_mindy> If we are going to peddle in conspiracy theory, I‚Äôm going to just say the Dems sent someone in with CoVID to the Barrett ceremony to infect as many people as possible.  They wanted ACB also but didn‚Äôt realize she was immune.  This was Nancy‚Äôs ‚Äúarrow in her quiver‚Äù she discussed.
1312467932736233472 2020-10-04 03:01:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth Indeed
1312467883725709312 2020-10-04 03:01:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @AmberBinGA It was this one  https://t.co/PgR87RGFuz
1312467615940403200 2020-10-04 03:00:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Who cares?
1312466869995991040 2020-10-04 02:57:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth Yes!! Apparently these are quacks or something
1312466772436500481 2020-10-04 02:57:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @BKudron @CillizzaCNN They act like these Doctors are Q or something
1312466662088609792 2020-10-04 02:56:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 Exactly!!!

1312464278184632321 2020-10-04 02:47:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @katearthsis Those movies freaked me out!!  I kind of want to rewatch now.  They are on Amazon prime!
1312464130083713025 2020-10-04 02:46:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @blyon72 They don‚Äôt!
1312464056498831361 2020-10-04 02:46:30 +0800 <just_mindy> This is inflammatory.  These are highly trained professionals &amp; officers in the Army &amp; Navy.  To question their integrity over tiny errors relaying info is ridiculous
1312459988212695042 2020-10-04 02:30:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @katearthsis We had to watch it every year starting when I was like 9
1312459867983020032 2020-10-04 02:29:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @katearthsis Yes!!  Here is the trailer!!!  https://t.co/8ze75LrcDG
1312459186349907971 2020-10-04 02:27:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @Ethical_Ethyl @atomickristin I live in Fl and I didn‚Äôt know about this!!
1312459050655776768 2020-10-04 02:26:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @SackJD Ha!! I‚Äôm trying to remember that movie!!
1312458205042106368 2020-10-04 02:23:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @newstouse Yep! He might be more palatable to some Christians who can‚Äôt vote Trump
1312458050368729088 2020-10-04 02:22:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok other people who grew up Fundamentalist or Pentecostal.  The Rapture movies we all watched in the 80‚Äôs, doesn‚Äôt the President get sick and everyone speculates he is dead but then he is healed.  Y‚Äôall help me remember.
1312457483739262976 2020-10-04 02:20:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @newstouse They are hoping for his death
1312457411811180545 2020-10-04 02:20:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @mdh_jr As she should have been
1312456239536730112 2020-10-04 02:15:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @mdh_jr A great idea
1312456163758231554 2020-10-04 02:15:08 +0800 <just_mindy> This same press will then ask why the White House isn‚Äôt answering more questions and why the Docs aren‚Äôt updating more.  Maybe because when they do, y‚Äôall say they‚Äôre lying anyway. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1312455314675916800 2020-10-04 02:11:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @atomickristin Yes!!!!  You aren‚Äôt a princess.  Y‚Äôall can build together
1312455194530082817 2020-10-04 02:11:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @ReturnToGlory93 Oh RTR has shown up in my mentions
1312455048434085888 2020-10-04 02:10:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @TolleCpa I will hate for the both of us
1312449065586626561 2020-10-04 01:46:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @PeculiarBaptist I love it!!

1312448927778578433 2020-10-04 01:46:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear Oh next week you and I will have to smack talk
1312448557991907329 2020-10-04 01:44:54 +0800 <just_mindy> His brother‚Äôs name is Hawke. They have big boy names.

1312444478842523653 2020-10-04 01:28:42 +0800 <just_mindy> He was reared in public housing by a single mom and become a millionaire.  Yeah, he‚Äôs real dumb
1312444219168968704 2020-10-04 01:27:40 +0800 <just_mindy> The American people are entitled to know generally how our President is doing &amp; if the 25th has to be invoked.  We are not entitled to the very minutia of his healthcare.  He‚Äôs still a human with some privacy and agency.
1312443478157135873 2020-10-04 01:24:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @realDonaldTrump Glad to hear it!! Continuing to pray for you and our @FLOTUS
1312442317878427649 2020-10-04 01:20:07 +0800 <just_mindy> I still wake up every Saturday rooting for this.

1312429919637516288 2020-10-04 00:30:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @daysathome It‚Äôs so awesome you see it that way!!!!  I know it is so beneficial for your kiddos!

1312425649156624384 2020-10-04 00:13:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Please remember Florida has been back in school with no major outbreaks for almost 7 weeks
1312424107947053063 2020-10-04 00:07:45 +0800 <just_mindy> That‚Äôs great news
1312423504835497985 2020-10-04 00:05:21 +0800 <just_mindy> He can‚Äôt answer if Trump has ever been on oxygen ever,  you goofs

1312395819555971076 2020-10-03 22:15:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh @pinktastic615 She clearly has no clue
1312395719614046208 2020-10-03 22:14:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @S2VA123 @SaintRPh Yes!!
1312364049582247939 2020-10-03 20:09:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Sen Graham has already said anyone who chooses may participate via video feed.  You can choose that option if you feel your health is in jeopardy.
1312363091636649984 2020-10-03 20:05:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Be ready to kiss a lot cracks me up
1312362983251685377 2020-10-03 20:04:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @RLMO306 I know!! As if anyone would use a wheelchair if they could walk! Particularly across grass
1312362667278041089 2020-10-03 20:03:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Truth
1312362554866499584 2020-10-03 20:03:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @MNobody67 I agree
1312360446599585793 2020-10-03 19:54:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @AliLaurelG Amen
1312360350122217472 2020-10-03 19:54:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @Janemecom Right.  Why are the all so panicked if Biden truly has a 10 or 12 point national lead?
1312360160246071299 2020-10-03 19:53:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Because all of Twitter had muted your hysterical rantings
1312359422665072641 2020-10-03 19:50:43 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep.  He called that one right!!!
1312358698698842112 2020-10-03 19:47:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Should he have cartwheeled, had aides carry him on their shoulders? He was clearly capable of walking so why would he choose any other option?
1312358136838344709 2020-10-03 19:45:36 +0800 <just_mindy> Rick and Steve‚Äôs Excellent Grift
1312356955944620032 2020-10-03 19:40:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Making memes and tweeting sick burns isn‚Äôt Normandy, pal.
1312356543921295360 2020-10-03 19:39:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @ImmersiveeKevin She something, that‚Äôs for sure
1312356451025932288 2020-10-03 19:38:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay I literally cringed reading that
1312356269399977984 2020-10-03 19:38:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @slynhiggins Particularly when I know things they said and did before
1312356143495290880 2020-10-03 19:37:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Just don‚Äôt buy that these guys sit around at night devising plans to save America like modern day Paul Reveres or something.  It‚Äôs dolla dolla bills, baby.
1312355737771954178 2020-10-03 19:36:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Time will tell.  It‚Äôs in the favor for Trump to win again because then they can take in donations for 4 more years to ‚Äúfight Trump‚Äù.  If Biden wins, I assume they‚Äôll start taking money in to ‚Äúrebuild the GOP‚Äù.  Either way, they don‚Äôt think Trump is Hitler.
1312355242344960003 2020-10-03 19:34:06 +0800 <just_mindy> None of the the founders of Lincoln Project think Trump is a fascist.  They don‚Äôt like him, sure. He operates outside of the political structure that enriched them for years. They want that back and Biden is that old structure.  Maybe they‚Äôll get it.
1312354211586285568 2020-10-03 19:30:01 +0800 <just_mindy> they‚Äôre storming the beaches of Normandy now, apparently

1312352573454725120 2020-10-03 19:23:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @heartsabustin Oh absolutely!! No contest
1312351389327208455 2020-10-03 19:18:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @heartsabustin That is slimy.  He‚Äôs trying to make people think he was a war hero
1312350163319615488 2020-10-03 19:13:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @heartsabustin Oh he looks the type
1312349291424481281 2020-10-03 19:10:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @geologyguy Well yes, but he also is very bad at sexting
1312347504218906625 2020-10-03 19:03:21 +0800 <just_mindy> They are the driest sexters ever.
1312345044477673472 2020-10-03 18:53:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Says a person who has no problem writing that on the internet with zero fear of reprisal. If Trump was a fascist, this person would be scared of state police dragging him out of his home today &amp; arresting him.
1312245818410373120 2020-10-03 12:19:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas Yes.  I thought they had seen that need but it doesn‚Äôt seem like they are intervening enough
1312244356183658497 2020-10-03 12:13:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas I mean, right?  What in the world!
1312223983350280195 2020-10-03 10:52:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @AGimpsey Clearly he doesn‚Äôt mind her looks so maybe she should work on not being a jerk

1312157102228434945 2020-10-03 06:26:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chad6454 You know the Canadians are haters
1312156883805892608 2020-10-03 06:25:54 +0800 <just_mindy> The President looked good walking up into the helicopter.  That‚Äôs good.
1312155264796119042 2020-10-03 06:19:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Fox reported POTUS walked out on his own and waved.  That is reassuring.
1312154175183048704 2020-10-03 06:15:08 +0800 <just_mindy> These people are legends in their own minds, I swear
1312153481306804224 2020-10-03 06:12:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Perhaps the Press Pool would have more access, and have a Doc answering their questions, if they hadn‚Äôt set themselves as dishonest purveyors of information this whole administration.  Just spitballing.

1312139302139170816 2020-10-03 05:16:02 +0800 <just_mindy> This concerns me but let‚Äôs remember Boris Johnson had to go to hospital as well and he emerged very healthy

1312134915622756352 2020-10-03 04:58:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 He thinks he is going to stump me on political questions.  Nope.  Not today big boy

She discusses trying to reconcile a family.  Her larger point was all this was going on during Obama admin ppl like you didn‚Äôt make a peep.
1311864870330138627 2020-10-02 11:05:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, most Christians know Christ wasn‚Äôt born on December 25.  That‚Äôs the day we observe his Birth.
1311864592780455942 2020-10-02 11:04:26 +0800 <just_mindy> I urge you to stop supporting the wholesale slaughter of babies and funding violence in the womb.  Trust and believe that is way more offensive to Christ

1311859044035039232 2020-10-02 10:42:23 +0800 <just_mindy> As I tell my daughter all the time, women are the worst to other women.  And when you‚Äôre pretty, it‚Äôs ten times worse.  And when you‚Äôre smart and pretty, it‚Äôs 50 times worse.  You might find 2 or 3 women you can really trust.  Other than your sisters and me.

1311855162424778755 2020-10-02 10:26:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @Bluesbrotha I‚Äôm holding you to it!
1311855075061530625 2020-10-02 10:26:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @THgo69 Yes.  Clearly she needs to know there are people who think she‚Äôs doing just great!
1311854684349620224 2020-10-02 10:25:04 +0800 <just_mindy> That‚Äôs not what she said.  She said Obama did the same thing and y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt make a peep.  And she‚Äôs right.
1311854355734200320 2020-10-02 10:23:46 +0800 <just_mindy> Another grifter sharing the quotes out of context.  At least they are outing themselves.
1311853739708473350 2020-10-02 10:21:19 +0800 <just_mindy> That part

1311852159261081602 2020-10-02 10:15:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara I‚Äôve said way worse lol
1311852033520041987 2020-10-02 10:14:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @katearthsis We have all been there!!
1311851924434681856 2020-10-02 10:14:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest Exactly
1311851792838340608 2020-10-02 10:13:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Finally her friend is a c u next Tuesday for betraying her like this.
1311851565121261569 2020-10-02 10:12:40 +0800 <just_mindy> She didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúgive me a effing break‚Äù about the plight of the kids.  Her point was OBAMA DID THE SAME THING &amp; press was fine with it.  Yet, she was being criticized personally for not changing the policy.  Also, she apparently did try to help &amp; it was ignored by press
1311851033522569216 2020-10-02 10:10:34 +0800 <just_mindy> She isn‚Äôt complaining about Christmas or decorating.  She‚Äôs a frustrated wife and Mom trying her best and is constantly being criticized.  Any woman who listens will know it wasn‚Äôt about Christmas.
1311850741259214850 2020-10-02 10:09:24 +0800 <just_mindy> A pastor friend once told me ‚Äúwhen you are sharing what a person said, you have a moral responsibility to share the context‚Äù.  Edward-Isaac here is misrepresenting the context.  Please listen to the entire recording.

1311848906926501895 2020-10-02 10:02:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @Eightofnine8 @ProjectLincoln Yes but they‚Äôre trying to restore dignity or something

1311848450888261639 2020-10-02 10:00:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow I mean, I can totally relate!!! She sounds like me when I‚Äôm trying to do for everyone (kids, work, parents) and no one is satisfied. What woman hasn‚Äôt been there?

1311848076982747142 2020-10-02 09:58:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @less_tx @chadfelixg Exactly!! That was the other part that broke me. She can‚Äôt even have a true friend!!

1311847858530922499 2020-10-02 09:57:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @captnwentworth @chadfelixg Exactly!!! Her issue isn‚Äôt the Christmas!! All women know that!! That was the symptom that day.  Her issue was constantly trying her best and being mocked and made fun of in the press.
1311847349115850753 2020-10-02 09:55:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @SallyRoth Yep!!!! Exactly right!!
1311847258720284673 2020-10-02 09:55:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @Bluesbrotha 2021!!!
1311846635803234305 2020-10-02 09:53:05 +0800 <just_mindy> Probably same although different
1311846043068305409 2020-10-02 09:50:44 +0800 <just_mindy> I just read your timeline and as an American tax payer, I‚Äôm thrilled with the results of this EO.
1311845164911153152 2020-10-02 09:47:14 +0800 <just_mindy> She sounds like a woman frustrated that she is trying to do everything she can to fill a role but the Media only want to criticize her.  Since the media inserted their noses into the rectums of the Obamas, and still do, this would never have been released.

1311742324003741696 2020-10-02 02:58:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy @GOP also all of that
1311741871501250560 2020-10-02 02:56:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy @GOP And my point is large families getting along and working side by side and having their marital or intimate partners do the same is pretty rare in my experience.

1311735043346386945 2020-10-02 02:29:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy @GOP I find that all way more reprehensible than anything Trump says.  Also, that abortion up and until a baby comes out of the birth canal is way more offensive to me.
1311734769063993346 2020-10-02 02:28:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy @GOP I have a different experience.  Most of my friends with large families and multiple siblings usually have one sibling or their partner who is on the outs. It‚Äôs not the GOP burning down cities, accosting people while they eat, not allowing people to worship or go to school.

1311710283816202243 2020-10-02 00:51:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @DPaulMatthew I just thought about it today and it is quite unusual
1311710157571846146 2020-10-02 00:50:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @loudnuff4u I mean, it doesn‚Äôt even make sense!!!
1311710063510401024 2020-10-02 00:50:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @reeb1011 I know.  I‚Äôm blonde
1311709990374313985 2020-10-02 00:50:06 +0800 <just_mindy> BTW, Trump seems to get on well with all of his children‚Äôs intimate partners. Lara &amp; Kim work the campaign, Jared works w/ him, Tiffany‚Äôs boyfriend clearly likes him &amp; his Dad is an avid Trump defender. It‚Äôs very unusual to have that many kids &amp; all of them like Dad &amp; vice versa
1311709034928582657 2020-10-02 00:46:18 +0800 <just_mindy> I mean if he had demanded Ivanka not convert, or tolerated Jared for family harmony but still disliked him deep down, maybe I can see it, but none of this is accurate.
1311708746679279617 2020-10-02 00:45:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, the ‚ÄúTrump hates Jews‚Äù line is always a head scratcher for me.  He is obviously very fond of Jared, his SIL, &amp; gives him enormous decision making power.  His beloved daughter is also Jewish as she converted &amp; there is no indication he opposed this.
1311707658353868802 2020-10-02 00:40:50 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm very online obviously and I thought they were gay conservatives until a month ago

1311700439008714753 2020-10-02 00:12:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @StacyLynn624 Yes.  I am a teacher but do not want to teach my own kid.  We don‚Äôt do well together with me as teacher lol
1311699200757895169 2020-10-02 00:07:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @StacyLynn624 Got it.  Our kids have to stay masked so that probably has something to do with it too

1311697007917105154 2020-10-01 23:58:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @TrickDaddy116 @g8rlitig8r @PoliticalSock @rumpfshaker @Mediaite I was replying to his example of Spencer and Duke IF THEY TOOK UP ARMS.  Spencer hasn‚Äôt endorsed Trump so my point was ‚Äúif they took up arms‚Äù THAT would be on Biden to denounce, not Trump. Trump has forcefully denounced the KKK as well.  Even declared them a hate group.
1311696168192299011 2020-10-01 23:55:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @StacyLynn624 Yes! At our school, they did ask students who had been around the affected children for more than 15 minutes within 6 ft to stay home for 2 weeks.  That didn‚Äôt effect my child
1311695865870987266 2020-10-01 23:53:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest I‚Äôm so glad kids are back in school in Florida

1311679124927377408 2020-10-01 22:47:27 +0800 <just_mindy> We have been open in Florida for 6 weeks with no major outbreaks. Kids can choose to learn from home or go face to face.  My child is in a school of 2k and there have been 2 cases. It was announced to parents immediately.

1311664952164327425 2020-10-01 21:51:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @PoliticalSock @rumpfshaker @Mediaite Richard Spencer has endorsed Biden.  Biden needs to denounce him, not Trump
1311664706030108672 2020-10-01 21:50:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @Patriot_Musket @RantyAmyCurtis At minimum, it‚Äôs Alabama, so who would have thought this was a rule?
1311664443701555200 2020-10-01 21:49:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @rivkaehh @_David_Edward First of all, crazy person, you do not know David and how he respects women so why would you say such a thing? Many men value the unborn &amp; adult women and David is one of them.  Finally, who elected you the purveyor of who will rot in hell?
1311662565383114752 2020-10-01 21:41:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @UncleHotep @wi1d1ifenature To me, it‚Äôs an invitation for people to consider why our instinct is to seek attention on social media at our darkest hour.

1311662160632836096 2020-10-01 21:40:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @wi1d1ifenature I mean you can start here:   https://t.co/7lhSwrZeNl  And oftentimes the something that has gone ‚Äúhorribly wrong‚Äù is DS and that is not an excuse to rob a child of personhood
1311661855853641728 2020-10-01 21:38:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @wi1d1ifenature Wow.  That‚Äôs a very substantial retort full of information I will ponder

1311436116747333637 2020-10-01 06:41:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax I totally don‚Äôt blame you!! But then they see this on a PUBLIC SERVICE AD TO VOTE
1311435895850127367 2020-10-01 06:40:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb These are supposed to be female leaders and all they can come up with is ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get naked‚Äù tf?
1311435627221614596 2020-10-01 06:39:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax And they wonder why young girls feel the need show more and more on social media.  It astounds me
1311435284601544707 2020-10-01 06:38:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @SMW_Myron @ben_woods15 Just a line

1311434933328654337 2020-10-01 06:37:08 +0800 <just_mindy> There are no haters.  No one is jealous of these women. We are pointing out the hypocrisy in telling young women their worth doesn‚Äôt lie in their ability to attract attention with their bodies and now these ‚Äúleaders‚Äù are doing just that.
1311434364027392001 2020-10-01 06:34:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Women need to get naked for voter turnout and journalists think this is an amazing strategy
1311434127116242949 2020-10-01 06:33:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Women are tired of being objectified and women don‚Äôt have to take off their clothes to be successful and women should be lauded for their brains and accomplishments.  Got it.
1311430785111658499 2020-10-01 06:20:39 +0800 <just_mindy> And that was only because of who his dad was.  And everyone knows that

1311392470299795457 2020-10-01 03:48:24 +0800 <just_mindy> Honestly, with the way the Media defames and disparages the character of anyone who works for Trump, and does anything possible to make them appear as scourges of society and rob them of social capital, it doesn‚Äôt surprise me people struggle after working for him.

1311384511826063361 2020-10-01 03:16:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 I guess
1311379414735818753 2020-10-01 02:56:31 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden shouldn‚Äôt have addressed the military that way then.
1311374250478055425 2020-10-01 02:36:00 +0800 <just_mindy> And of course she is tweeting about her....custody case.  Good to know in the crazy year of our Lord 2020, she‚Äôs still tweeting about her custody case.  As she did in 2019 and 2018 and 2017......
1311373792015417344 2020-10-01 02:34:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Jason Miller was trending so I thought AJ must be telling more about their custody case.
1311356099417776129 2020-10-01 01:23:52 +0800 <just_mindy> So, if I walk up to a random man and start accusing him of rape, and he feels ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù because I called him a racist, he‚Äôs a hit dog? Interesting.

1311145266658062337 2020-09-30 11:26:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Trump won the Republican primary in 2016 because no one could match his cult of personality.  They all withered.  I saw the same thing tonight.  Biden was fine but he look withered next to Trump.  Trump owned the stage for good or bad.

1311103795770859520 2020-09-30 08:41:18 +0800 <just_mindy> The point is most people aren‚Äôt drinking alcohol that expensive either.  I can afford if.  I can afford the ice cream. So can you.  That‚Äôs because we are both white collar workers unaffected by COVID.

1310993072533184513 2020-09-30 01:21:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @CreativDisparit @BillyHallowell It‚Äôs not ‚Äúseparating church and state‚Äù when elected leaders allow people to fly/ go into casinos yet don‚Äôt allow Christians to worship in person.  It‚Äôs further not separation when govt compels religious orders to provide Birth control, for example, against religious beliefs

1310978815091519489 2020-09-30 00:24:40 +0800 <just_mindy> The approval of a MAGA man is so voluminous &amp; massive &amp; overwhelming &amp; filling I can only handle it from one MAGA man.  How does Mo handle the approval of multiple MAGA men? Reason 2,678 that Mo is my hero!

1310973564300951553 2020-09-30 00:03:49 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  Women absolutely did and do make false claims.  See Duke Lacrosse.  See Rolling Stone debacle.

1310440523551956992 2020-09-28 12:45:42 +0800 <just_mindy> A reminder while the Lincoln Project fellows drone on and on about tax debt and Russia ties, many of them have exactly what they deride Trump for themselves.  Methinks the ladies doth tweet too much.   https://t.co/vKaEgCEv5b

1310375867386920962 2020-09-28 08:28:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @melifix Tax evasion I guess? Who knows?!
1310375777381343237 2020-09-28 08:28:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, college educated white women are apparently very dumb.  I mean, I am one, but I‚Äôm not one of the dumb ones.
1310375478365237251 2020-09-28 08:27:14 +0800 <just_mindy> If Trump wins, I hope y‚Äôall know we owe it the Hoteps educating people the last 4 years.
1310375164333494272 2020-09-28 08:25:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @jeremyvyoral Probably but nah the abortion thing
1310374117280014336 2020-09-28 08:21:49 +0800 <just_mindy> Perfect
1310373813805363207 2020-09-28 08:20:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt going to like this, but I totally agree.  Men should confront men and it‚Äôs generally really inappropriate for men to confront women unless it‚Äôs a professional setting.  Too many men are afraid of other men so they target women.
1310372894661373953 2020-09-28 08:16:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 Right? It will be an unmitigated waste of time but Trump lives for this stuff
1310372444314783744 2020-09-28 08:15:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 They are very convinced Trump is scared to debate Biden.  I don‚Äôt think Trump is a great debater, but he won‚Äôt ever be upstaged
1310372155360710661 2020-09-28 08:14:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy He was literally denied Communion because of his support for abortion.  I doubt very seriously Trump is a Christian, but he‚Äôs actually doing things to prevent infanticide    https://t.co/RiHAE835gc

1310370723219812359 2020-09-28 08:08:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Why do they keep doing this?  If all Dems are doing it, the GOP should pass on the meetings and let‚Äôs go to a vote

1310366754846240768 2020-09-28 07:52:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Do they let him take Communion there?
1310364512210608133 2020-09-28 07:43:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @leepd84 Ha!!!
1310364464114552833 2020-09-28 07:43:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes.  He is retired from the National Guard after 20 years.  We are grateful he has Tricare with Medicare.  It helps get the best treatments.  We fish in Boca Grande which is by Port Charlotte several times a year.  Immokalee is about 3 hours from us
1310358608572485632 2020-09-28 07:20:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 He is doing well overall.  He has his 3rd treatment on Wednesday and he has to have a total of 8.  Everyone else is good! Thank you for asking!

1310350640745525249 2020-09-28 06:48:32 +0800 <just_mindy> A gentle reminder now that Blake Bortles is back in the NFL, there will be zero slander of him on this timeline.  He is revered to #UCF fans and it shall always be.  #BuiltByUCF
1310350132664315905 2020-09-28 06:46:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay Exactly.  Instead he lived off taxpayers his whole life
1310348964584136705 2020-09-28 06:41:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay Very true.  Even when he was at his best and he certainly isn‚Äôt now.
1310348804617654272 2020-09-28 06:41:14 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes he did!!  We love you Blake!!
1310348503093325824 2020-09-28 06:40:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay Yes!!!  I love watching those hearings
1310348401255624706 2020-09-28 06:39:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay Exactly.  Certainly not intellectuals, but to pretend they aren‚Äôt in the same league as Biden is laughable.

1310347524478251010 2020-09-28 06:36:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay I mean, let‚Äôs please not pretend Christie &amp; Giuliani can‚Äôt match Biden.  That‚Äôs nonsense
1310346767549030400 2020-09-28 06:33:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Have you heard Biden lately?

1310305079518523392 2020-09-28 03:47:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 When it gets loud and fans jump, our stadium actually bounces.  Lol.   That‚Äôs why they have to have major camera stabilizers for TV
1310304841630089227 2020-09-28 03:46:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Y‚Äôall know if UCF and UF meet at any size stadium in the state of Fl, it will sell out and be litty.   UCF has already proved we are a traveling fan base.  @RonDeSantisFL needs to make that happen more than FSU/UF which will be boring af and we all know it
1310303267172356098 2020-09-28 03:40:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 It will be interesting

1310302996564189192 2020-09-28 03:39:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @JordyOnTheRadio Because they want the Swamp.  It‚Äôs disrespecting our Stadium.

1310298629815533571 2020-09-28 03:21:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 We win bowl games and that still won‚Äôt shut them up

1310297826694492166 2020-09-28 03:18:40 +0800 <just_mindy> Would the Gators play in Gainesville outside the swamp? We don‚Äôt play at Camping World anymore.  We have the Bounce House.  Just like the Swamp is sacred to UF fans, UCF fans love the Bounce House on our campus.

1310288118969442304 2020-09-28 02:40:06 +0800 <just_mindy> Now y‚Äôall go cry about UCF being 11 and ‚Äúthey never play anyone‚Äù and ‚Äúthey need to join a conference‚Äù.  Go cry it out.  The tears sustain us while we always win.

These 2 girls were in a bar last night in Bend, Oregon and they overheard these other 2 girls talking in the bathroom.  One said she was sleeping with her sister‚Äôs fianc√©. So the other 2 girls made a Tik Tok to find the sister and THEY FOUND HER
1310274083226103808 2020-09-28 01:44:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrDathanPaterno I prefer that too but they won‚Äôt

1310269531907125250 2020-09-28 01:26:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @tolin43959 We really dodged a bullet
1310269355091988482 2020-09-28 01:25:32 +0800 <just_mindy> And that 60% number includes people who think it should only be legal in case of rape, health of mother and incest
1310269121146351618 2020-09-28 01:24:36 +0800 <just_mindy> They‚Äôre being intentionally misleading.  Polls tell us only about 16% of people support abortion up until birth as Democrats demand

1310234330715783171 2020-09-27 23:06:22 +0800 <just_mindy> This Supreme Court Battle will do wonders for Lindsay.  He won hearts and minds during Kav.  He‚Äôll protect ACB the same way.  This is great timing for him.
1310232259396501510 2020-09-27 22:58:08 +0800 <just_mindy> It‚Äôs so damn depressing to me that you still can‚Äôt come up with a compelling counter argument to Trump than Xenophobia, capitalism and white supremacy.   It‚Äôs boring at this point.

1310062302557863938 2020-09-27 11:42:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @kcherrick Yes.  He should be allowed to enjoy his family at this stage in life

1310061246306291716 2020-09-27 11:38:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @jadedwisteria I voted Johnson.  I would never vote Hilary

1310055631559241728 2020-09-27 11:16:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy A heavy right bench ostensibly will stand up for liberty.  They won‚Äôt allow encroachment into religious beliefs, won‚Äôt compel taxes, won‚Äôt force businesses to do things against the owners belief systems.

1310051776809390082 2020-09-27 11:00:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Can you imagine if Hilary would have chosen these 3 SC spots?  The court would be used by progressives to jolt us far left.  What a nightmare
1310051068202627074 2020-09-27 10:58:08 +0800 <just_mindy> I was a NT in 2016 who never thought Trump would keep his word on SC picks.  He has and he deserves credit for that and all of us who said he wouldn‚Äôt, should say our mea culpas. This is mine.  3 SC spots opening make me so thankful others had more foresight than me.

1310047093118173189 2020-09-27 10:42:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Nor do we want ACB to be RBG. If DJT had nominated someone like RBG instead of ACB, someone with the beliefs of AOC for example, the GOP would have been MAD

1310008649058844672 2020-09-27 08:09:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Can one of you please help me ‚Äúweaponize my white womanhood‚Äù? Is there a class I can take? Maybe some YouTube videos? Apparently I‚Äôm lacking this power and I would like to tap in.  https://t.co/BVpN9qFaM6

1310006594831298560 2020-09-27 08:01:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Now we‚Äôve moved on to the Sarah Palin playbook and will comment on her child with special needs.

1310004252098650112 2020-09-27 07:52:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes. Y‚Äôall stop this mess.  If you like someone, text back quickly.  If you are in a relationship and no longer feeling it, break up with dignity (not via text).  Let‚Äôs stop being turds to one another.

1310000475559858176 2020-09-27 07:37:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @BKudron I live in Fl, B.  I‚Äôve laid out with Crisco &amp; Baby oil since I was like 12.  That ship has sailed
1310000250027999233 2020-09-27 07:36:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @ImmersiveeKevin But he believes in the religion of abortion so he‚Äôs fine
1309999786158944257 2020-09-27 07:34:22 +0800 <just_mindy> My Knights won.  My Gators won.  ACB was nominated.  I laid in the sun and had a marg &amp; now I‚Äôm watching the instate rivalry between FSU vs UM. This day could be perfect if Missouri wins.  Make it so, Lord. üôèüèº
1309998289840939009 2020-09-27 07:28:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @DaGhostOfRichie and because her Dad was a man and men don‚Äôt face the same questions in that regard

1309971178325520387 2020-09-27 05:40:41 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm vital to my kids.  Even when I wasn‚Äôt a single parent, they would tell you I was more involved in their lives than their friends with SAHM often.  Working doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt rear your kids.  Also, my kids never spent a minute in day care.  We got creative
1309970391486660609 2020-09-27 05:37:34 +0800 <just_mindy> They are teaching it.  School districts are paying this man a lot of money to do Zoom meetings with their teachers to teach them this stuff

1309959335439675392 2020-09-27 04:53:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara I mean, unless Kamala knows something we don‚Äôt!
1309958884489146371 2020-09-27 04:51:50 +0800 <just_mindy> He is not, however, alive
1309954008572932097 2020-09-27 04:32:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy @fi_virginia Right?  Be a man, bro!
1309943730418470913 2020-09-27 03:51:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @SouthernKeeks @LegallyAutumn @MollyRatty It can‚Äôt be Kamala because she has no kids. This isn‚Äôt Klobuchar‚Äôs lane, so it has to be Hirono
1309943092477386752 2020-09-27 03:49:05 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep.  And that‚Äôs why any time any of these people start the adoption attack, or the mothering attack, or the religious attack, their mentions need to be swarmed with ppl telling them it‚Äôs not ok.  There needs to be zero tolerance for that nonsense.
1309942653971300355 2020-09-27 03:47:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Thanks!!! It‚Äôs beautiful today

1309939219536650240 2020-09-27 03:33:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @nevadaracer00v Fair point
1309939165874786304 2020-09-27 03:33:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 As if RBG owned that seat.  They‚Äôre so silly
1309939028964372483 2020-09-27 03:32:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes it will be interesting to see if they can challenge Clemson with Lawrence still there.  I will watch because having football right now is so glorious but I will still hate them
1309937017959088128 2020-09-27 03:24:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @nooil4pacifists @thefactualprep If you also believe in abortion

1309934892747288578 2020-09-27 03:16:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 The FSU UM game will just be fun because of in state rivalry.  My ex was a Bama fan. It‚Äôs too much Bama
1309933473805860867 2020-09-27 03:10:52 +0800 <just_mindy> As I was saying last night. This person was just paid 20k by the Fairfax school system to educate teachers for 1 hour on Zoom.
1309932940827201536 2020-09-27 03:08:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 You‚Äôre a Bama fan too?  Dear God.

1309922848912404481 2020-09-27 02:28:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @6vaughts I think many people are having bigger families these days.  I love it
1309922684546019332 2020-09-27 02:27:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @Calcrash Exactly right
1309922645257977864 2020-09-27 02:27:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @nogooddeed2 Me too.  I wasn‚Äôt a fan of being an only child
1309922564488212480 2020-09-27 02:27:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark Yep.  It‚Äôs going to be a long road
1309922473727668224 2020-09-27 02:27:09 +0800 <just_mindy> So attacking her ability to parent didn‚Äôt work so now we‚Äôll attack her looks.  Now, y‚Äôall see why Dolly Parton said don‚Äôt call her a feminist.  Feminists are the worst.
1309922019161636864 2020-09-27 02:25:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomWhig I totally get that!!!
1309921913700048898 2020-09-27 02:24:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @GaffinMark I mean, seems sexist
1309921725166088194 2020-09-27 02:24:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomWhig And you manage to love them?! How do you do that?! üòÇ
1309921613266198531 2020-09-27 02:23:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Antonin Scalia had 5 children.  Did you have concerns about his ability to do his job or do you just have a ‚Äúnumber of kids‚Äù test for women?
1309920942794121222 2020-09-27 02:21:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @RandomWhig On my Mom‚Äôs side of the family, me having four was slacking.  My cousins all have between 7-9 kids
1309920687662956545 2020-09-27 02:20:03 +0800 <just_mindy> For the record I reared 4 children while working &amp; getting certification and degrees, and it was hard, but my children were loved and well attended
1309920131108175872 2020-09-27 02:17:51 +0800 <just_mindy> If this was a man with 7 kids, these types of tweets would not happen.  Notice that.   Her husband cares for the kids.  Feminists celebrated this, I thought? Guess not so much when it is a successful conservative woman.
1309919011547811840 2020-09-27 02:13:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @LisaTurnage12 They can‚Äôt manage saying anything about her without snark
1309917508435144704 2020-09-27 02:07:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep  https://t.co/vrBHM74weT
1309917302868111360 2020-09-27 02:06:36 +0800 <just_mindy> ‚ÄúLarge family‚Äù? Why can‚Äôt it just be a family?
1309916593019908097 2020-09-27 02:03:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Go Stone! Go Kyle!
1309915709389053952 2020-09-27 02:00:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheKimboBryce You can‚Äôt play teams that won‚Äôt schedule you
1309914665825206272 2020-09-27 01:56:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Do the Eagles always win too?
1309911463277068288 2020-09-27 01:43:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @fi_virginia @iamalittlehappy It is

1309910216784465921 2020-09-27 01:38:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @CliffDavisJax Yes.  That doesn‚Äôt help!
1309910119828926465 2020-09-27 01:38:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy Oh I hate that!!!  Thankfully people are generally helpful and I make my son help always!

1309907782343237633 2020-09-27 01:28:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @is_tyranny @RantyAmyCurtis Totally agree
1309905190817013760 2020-09-27 01:18:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Go Gata!
1309903997516623872 2020-09-27 01:13:44 +0800 <just_mindy> As I said last night
1309902878123929601 2020-09-27 01:09:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @myssissippi @mjmullen73 Yes! Should be way more of a focus!
1309899024569380866 2020-09-27 00:53:58 +0800 <just_mindy> It never changes
1309897821672398851 2020-09-27 00:49:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @BKudron I won‚Äôt apologize for the exceptionality of Florida teams

1309895330658385922 2020-09-27 00:39:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Much better Gata
1309894989615333376 2020-09-27 00:37:56 +0800 <just_mindy> No Gata

1309884441666433026 2020-09-26 23:56:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @ronni_g @StacyLynn624 Yes! He started yesterday!

1309879757316784131 2020-09-26 23:37:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @Queen2Five I‚Äôm headed to it!
1309878774654283776 2020-09-26 23:33:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheMaverick21 @xavierdreyman When Mac gets to Fl, I guess he‚Äôs taking the TV out
1309878420663304192 2020-09-26 23:32:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @xavierdreyman I have one but we have people coming over
1309877971184947200 2020-09-26 23:30:19 +0800 <just_mindy> I need to get out of my bed for our noon football watching but my bed is so dang luxurious.  As is my heating pad.
1309877708579631106 2020-09-26 23:29:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow That‚Äôs the truth
1309875051043397632 2020-09-26 23:18:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @ScarilyCheerful @PeculiarBaptist Yes! Me too!!
1309874858273234945 2020-09-26 23:17:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @JaneBond462 Of course
1309874356542205952 2020-09-26 23:15:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @JaneBond462 Right!
1309874263709671424 2020-09-26 23:15:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @ScarilyCheerful @Flipper628 @IncHeathen @PeculiarBaptist Yes
1309859795348992000 2020-09-26 22:18:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @RWNutjob1 This is so stressful!!!
1309859393719197696 2020-09-26 22:16:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear His Dad is my friend since we were 14! His dad played at UCF and then a little pro ball.  And yes, he‚Äôs a giant!
1309859194057654273 2020-09-26 22:15:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @StacyLynn624 They just have him Clindamycin for 2 weeks.  His poor tummy
1309859053800226816 2020-09-26 22:15:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @RWNutjob1 My mind cannot do this!!
1309857630609911808 2020-09-26 22:09:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Wait? UCF &amp; UF are both at noon? What the heck is that?
1309856811638575110 2020-09-26 22:06:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @ronni_g Right?!
1309856657518755840 2020-09-26 22:05:37 +0800 <just_mindy> Let‚Äôs go Stone!!
1309856180173443072 2020-09-26 22:03:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @RantyAmyCurtis @DRussell76 Oh yes
1309855905857626113 2020-09-26 22:02:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 Yep.  It‚Äôs all awful
1309855832918589441 2020-09-26 22:02:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @ronni_g He has a N-95 because he‚Äôs a firefighter but I‚Äôm not sure cleaning protocol.  I will have to ask
1309855635241082880 2020-09-26 22:01:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrDathanPaterno It makes me so sad
1309855510355734528 2020-09-26 22:01:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @sarah_wxtx Yes.  I am feeling all those terrible feelings I felt a year ago when my friend went through it just finding my old screenshots this morning.  I can‚Äôt imagine how you feel
1309855207468290048 2020-09-26 21:59:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @capnbrunchusa @ATLSAHM Bingo
1309855149897273345 2020-09-26 21:59:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @sarah_wxtx @heartsabustin Exactly.  I‚Äôve had the privilege of watching Liam grow and thrive in a family through you.
1309849639860961280 2020-09-26 21:37:44 +0800 <just_mindy> I mentioned last night these groups had gone after Thomas Rhett (country singer) and his wife. Here was the start of that  https://t.co/b22iO2eAle
1309849298365018112 2020-09-26 21:36:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @Queen2Five She is
1309849261094383617 2020-09-26 21:36:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU Oh yes and they will do anything to destroy ACB so it will seep other places
1309846495936557056 2020-09-26 21:25:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU I don‚Äôt blame her.  I really don‚Äôt.  Praying for y‚Äôall, seriously
1309846301593526273 2020-09-26 21:24:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @Queen2Five Yes she is thankfully.  It took a really great counselor
1309846048404312065 2020-09-26 21:23:28 +0800 <just_mindy> And a couple more  https://t.co/ArUA8rckPX
1309842201841733632 2020-09-26 21:08:11 +0800 <just_mindy> Here is another  https://t.co/6Evl3DAIm2
1309842089186820097 2020-09-26 21:07:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @Queen2Five Oh I was real sheltered until these people literally drove my friend to a nervous breakdown
1309841400826077185 2020-09-26 21:05:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @MarcACaputo That account? Oh no. It‚Äôs an IG account with 3/4 million followers that has been around for a while.  She does IG lives etc
1309841121200287745 2020-09-26 21:03:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Yes.
1309841074911928327 2020-09-26 21:03:42 +0800 <just_mindy> My friend had about 15k followers on her account about fostering &amp; adopting (trying to get people to be foster parents if they felt that call) and she had to lock down for months.  The harassment was that bad.
1309840664138481666 2020-09-26 21:02:04 +0800 <just_mindy> I learned this had become a thing on the left a year ago when my friend who adopted a foster child she had since his Birth, was attacked by one of these accounts.  My coping mechanism is always to learn and that is when I discovered this backlash against transracial adoptions
1309839902167764992 2020-09-26 20:59:02 +0800 <just_mindy> This is the general gist  https://t.co/QvuwC9D1VV
1309839695480786944 2020-09-26 20:58:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @KristinBoymom I totally see how it can happen!!!
1309838205135605760 2020-09-26 20:52:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @KristinBoymom It just seems too coincidental
1309837583883685890 2020-09-26 20:49:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes.  Very very very.
1309835204467580928 2020-09-26 20:40:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @heartsabustin I really think this might be it.  I couldn‚Äôt figure out why he staying sick and this makes so much sense!!
1309835040059203584 2020-09-26 20:39:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @myssissippi @mjmullen73 I have my Master‚Äôs Degree in Reading Ed and it wasn‚Äôt until I got to the graduate level that I learned about really teaching phonics and graphemes and phonemes.  Thankfully, as a child, my Granny taught me with ABeka, so I already understood a lot because of my childhood
1309834140607549448 2020-09-26 20:36:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @myssissippi @mjmullen73 For some reason, teaching phonics, the thing we know works, has fallen out of fashion. English is a weird language, obviously and kids have to have Phonics. We know this, but we don‚Äôt even teach teachers how to teach phonics correctly anymore
1309833479660732418 2020-09-26 20:33:31 +0800 <just_mindy> After reading that thread on COVID &amp; thinking about how sick my son has been twice in the last 6 weeks when he generally is extremely healthy, I‚Äôm wondering if the mask wearing he‚Äôs required to do at work 24 HOURS A DAY isn‚Äôt contributing to this strep/ear infection/tonsil issue.
1309828566167810049 2020-09-26 20:14:00 +0800 <just_mindy> I plan to listen to this as well, but please please read these tweets.  Please.  Also so proud @RonDeSantisFL is my Governor &amp; so glad to see so many in the comments beginning to recognize how right he was about all of this because he read, studied, &amp; sought experts.
1309749111965483008 2020-09-26 14:58:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @yeahrightgirlhg  https://t.co/6bwpveqOUq
1309710947532107777 2020-09-26 12:26:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU I know y‚Äôall are great parents.  That‚Äôs why she is so happy
1309710469230465024 2020-09-26 12:24:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep! That‚Äôs why we need to get on with it
1309710305010868225 2020-09-26 12:24:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @GregWilson28 @noahsmom7 They could all leave as far as I‚Äôm concerned
1309710113821818881 2020-09-26 12:23:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU Or that she won‚Äôt know about her heritage.
1309709971404328960 2020-09-26 12:22:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @Joseph_MSU I love her.  She is everything!
1309709859609346048 2020-09-26 12:22:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 There is no other explanation
1309709791384788992 2020-09-26 12:22:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrDathanPaterno Probably!!
1309708484833873922 2020-09-26 12:16:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Democrats have no scruples.  Fin. It‚Äôs why Trump won.  People were sick of it and elected someone capable of slinging mud with them because he knows them.  They were his former friends.
1309707669645778944 2020-09-26 12:13:36 +0800 <just_mindy> One justice can‚Äôt impose anything
1309707518155857920 2020-09-26 12:13:00 +0800 <just_mindy> Told ya!
1309706550538391552 2020-09-26 12:09:09 +0800 <just_mindy> Good!!!!  I hope this keeps everyone from thinking that‚Äôs an acceptable road to go down
1309703588520828928 2020-09-26 11:57:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 @SaintRPh That‚Äôs how I feel
1309703495059230725 2020-09-26 11:57:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jadkins151 @SaintRPh I‚Äôm all for it
1309703432987648006 2020-09-26 11:56:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @EdB_Ohio @SaintRPh French hopefully will advocate for leaving the kids alone.
1309698700617359366 2020-09-26 11:37:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh Quick quick
1309698638663372800 2020-09-26 11:37:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 We will see.  I hope there is enough humanity left to leave children alone
1309698497831211010 2020-09-26 11:37:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @CarlingBen Of course they won‚Äôt.  They always think the solution is to be more disgusting harder
1309698361327583237 2020-09-26 11:36:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Me either
1309698284873809923 2020-09-26 11:36:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh I know it‚Äôs coming.  I‚Äôve seen friends who‚Äôve adopted children of other races have to lock their accounts on IG. One friend had a pic of her son in some wildflower fields and overalls (totally normal) &amp; they said she was trying to make him look like he was a cotton picker. No lie
1309697812628635648 2020-09-26 11:34:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 He can‚Äôt.  Look at how much he had to allow with Kav
1309697563726163970 2020-09-26 11:33:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @CarlingBen For the kid‚Äôs sake, I hope they leave them alone.  I just do not have any faith in that side of the aisle any longer
1309696810852798465 2020-09-26 11:30:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl It is. Rhett‚Äôs wife handles it well.  I don‚Äôt know how she does it
1309696665679474689 2020-09-26 11:29:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoeFL65 Oh, I‚Äôm confident it is.  I just know how they‚Äôll try to manipulate family members who are desperately impoverished
1309696465074356225 2020-09-26 11:29:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @JBO562 At least we have each other
1309696361110147072 2020-09-26 11:28:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @BiasedGirl Oh yes.  They are disgusting
1309696285411287040 2020-09-26 11:28:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @Monkey3ddd Exactly. He has no idea how her family operates
1309696165097676801 2020-09-26 11:27:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @KPBeachGirl Exactly
1309696120499691520 2020-09-26 11:27:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @henning_love It made me laugh
1309696074521751553 2020-09-26 11:27:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 Weird, right?
1309695983832436736 2020-09-26 11:27:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @KristinBoymom He makes me ill
1309695927263920128 2020-09-26 11:26:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 One would think but abortion has become its own cult and religion and it‚Äôs gross
1309695753573601282 2020-09-26 11:26:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @JBO562 It‚Äôs about me!
1309695665170264070 2020-09-26 11:25:54 +0800 <just_mindy> There‚Äôs whole organizations now that do this and harass celebrities with Black children on IG.  Thomas Rhett‚Äôs wife gets it a lot.  It‚Äôs sickening but I‚Äôve seen the play book.
1309695276383383553 2020-09-26 11:24:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Mark my words
1309692485199949825 2020-09-26 11:13:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep.  Which should apply to any child after week 20
1309691665033105408 2020-09-26 11:10:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @MaryFernandez This idea that the right should just shut up and the left should get basically infanticide astounds me
1309691439367024640 2020-09-26 11:09:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Exactly and in cases of rape, women are offered Plan B if they report, &amp; if they choose not to, it‚Äôs easily available at all drugstores. A woman who is raped is terrified of pregnancy.  They aren‚Äôt waiting until they‚Äôre 20 weeks pregnant to check on it
1309690507229048832 2020-09-26 11:05:24 +0800 <just_mindy> LITRALLY me irl
1309689973839454209 2020-09-26 11:03:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yes and it‚Äôs ok to hire specialists or provide vouchers for families to hire specialists like me to fix the issue
1309689785397673984 2020-09-26 11:02:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @KevinInABQ Very true
1309689728325779456 2020-09-26 11:02:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Knowing what we know, I believe the SC has an obligation to ban abortion past viability.  That‚Äôs a human rights issue imo.  So 20 weeks should not even be a discussion anymore.  I really believe through week 12 is a huge compromise for the right.
1309688452116623368 2020-09-26 10:57:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @KevinInABQ I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if they tried it in these debates because gaslighting
1309688162931834880 2020-09-26 10:56:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @TrumpGoldenAge Exactly.  If we slowly change the mindset and culture around abortion, and science continues to change hearts and minds, we will get where we need to be
1309687821494636547 2020-09-26 10:54:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @KevinInABQ That‚Äôs ridiculous.  There isn‚Äôt enough support for Plan B to be overturned
1309687655916097537 2020-09-26 10:54:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeanBannion Right?
1309687596600176640 2020-09-26 10:53:50 +0800 <just_mindy> I don‚Äôt want any abortion, but I am a pragmatist and would fight for a ban after 12 weeks.  The left won‚Äôt agree to any restrictions.  That is unconscionable.
1309686093126815744 2020-09-26 10:47:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Plan B is available at any pharmacy for oops encounters or if a woman doesn‚Äôt want to report a rape. We need to stop allowing the left to gaslight us on this topic.
1309685811647053825 2020-09-26 10:46:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Most European nations don‚Äôt allow abortion after 12-14 weeks.  Only North Korea &amp; China (noted human rights abusers) disrespect the unborn to the level the US allows.  We are in horrible company.
1309685298541072386 2020-09-26 10:44:42 +0800 <just_mindy> Understand that current abortion laws are only supported by 16% of the population.  Talk about minority rule!  We are being railroaded by fringe activists on this topic.  At minimum, our laws should line up with those of other industrialized nations.
1309684782876504064 2020-09-26 10:42:39 +0800 <just_mindy> What they don‚Äôt say, in those same polls, 61% of Americans either want it limited to rape or health of mother or only within the 1st trimester.  Only 16% of Americans believe abortion through the 3rd trimester should be legal.
1309683436739866625 2020-09-26 10:37:18 +0800 <just_mindy> Yeah, Iowans are huge religious bigots who love abortion
1309682677910573056 2020-09-26 10:34:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe They still need to do the bulletin boards
1309682576630730752 2020-09-26 10:33:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Also that.  And if they can‚Äôt read on grade level, hiring people like me who can fix it when they‚Äôre little, rather than in the 11th and 12th grade when I now get them.
1309680705266421761 2020-09-26 10:26:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe @Spotify Very well could have something to do with it.  It def isn‚Äôt about him presenting out there ideas.  Spotify is full of those kinds of podcasts.
1309680407722549249 2020-09-26 10:25:16 +0800 <just_mindy> There is zero zero zero possibility they can legally censor him and let some other podcasts stay.  There are podcasts from the fringe left &amp; right on there and they should all be allowed to stay.  I want to hear what the other side thinks and so should you.
1309679864782479360 2020-09-26 10:23:07 +0800 <just_mindy> Re: @Spotify staff censoring Rogan: I‚Äôm a podcast junkie while riding the boring recumbent bike. There are tons of ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù opinions &amp; conspiracies &amp; way out there beliefs on that platform. They‚Äôve picked Rogan because of audience size &amp; his lack of support for Biden.
1309674536003088384 2020-09-26 10:01:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @CheriPrice1966 I think so!

1309657943416229888 2020-09-26 08:56:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 I wouldn‚Äôt blame him

1309657434462588928 2020-09-26 08:53:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Remember when feminism was about women being individuals and making their own choices and other women cheering them on?  And not all men are bad, and we must have unfettered rights to abortion until up until the minute of delivery.  Good times.

My Dad‚Äôs cancer, my son being sick, my divorce, my daughter dealing with the divorce, blah blah blah.  Not everyone is built to deal with that. I get it.  He walked in on a bad chapter for me. I know better seasons are coming
1309134884552744961 2020-09-24 22:17:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Thank you.  I really do appreciate it.  It will fade.  I needed to hear some good stuff about me today!
1309134653010386944 2020-09-24 22:16:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I totally agree.  I think once the newness wears off, and you have to deal with the person and their intricacies and their problems, many people find it no longer worth it

1309134164466307072 2020-09-24 22:14:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy I just don‚Äôt see it these days.  Friends, yes.  But my intimate partner needs to share basic ideals with me
1309124414521442304 2020-09-24 21:35:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Is there a ‚ÄúHas Biden called a Lid before noon‚Äù account on Twitter yet?
1309123312912564224 2020-09-24 21:31:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok y‚Äôall. Is anyone at all going to admit this is nuts?!

1309122138625003521 2020-09-24 21:26:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Oh yes.  Wish I would have found out months ago, but certainly glad it was all laid out now before thing went any further
1309121958802587657 2020-09-24 21:26:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep!! That is what it is all about.  Some people grow complacent with that though.  It isn‚Äôt exciting enough
1309104290670227460 2020-09-24 20:15:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 And how bad they can make you feel when you realize you weren‚Äôt important at all
1309104145866031108 2020-09-24 20:15:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 One would think so but I‚Äôve learned contentment is a character trait some people have &amp; others never develop
1309103839774150662 2020-09-24 20:14:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @T_tothe2ndNGa Very true

1309087109643415558 2020-09-24 19:07:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep.  Tons of fulfillment can be found in a long term comfortable relationship. Not taking the other person for granted is the crucial part
1309086689072164867 2020-09-24 19:06:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep.  Very recent.  I‚Äôm too much of a believer in love to write relationships off.  I just have to hope to find someone with similar intentions
1309082736028798977 2020-09-24 18:50:20 +0800 <just_mindy> Dead cops is the world they wish to see
1309082442872033285 2020-09-24 18:49:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Just really smart people like you, apparently
1309080051158319110 2020-09-24 18:39:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Yep.  A huge waste of 6 months that could have been avoided
1309079863630888960 2020-09-24 18:38:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 They always fear they are missing out on something when reality is there is tons of fulfillment being with one person
1309076678296186889 2020-09-24 18:26:16 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep.  Hard to accept sometimes but absolutely true.  https://t.co/IXe3Ulg6Xi
1309076491569856512 2020-09-24 18:25:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I think most southern women are still pretty faithful to their man and good men still are faithful.  There are just too many who aren‚Äôt
1309076232659783680 2020-09-24 18:24:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Oh that‚Äôs so good.  I hadn‚Äôt thought about that story in years.  Perfect analogy

1308954316401713152 2020-09-24 10:20:02 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh, my parents are sending it to all their elderly Dem friends right now.  All live in Fl. Asking them if they‚Äôre ok with this.  I appreciate the mess out of this video

1308949842287382530 2020-09-24 10:02:16 +0800 <just_mindy> Yep.  I texted this to 4 older Dem relatives tonight and told them to consider that couple before they voted Biden. They were shocked that was happening in Florida.
1308948896593391618 2020-09-24 09:58:30 +0800 <just_mindy> In Florida, yes.  Our Stand Your Ground law is ‚Äúdid you feel in imminent threat of harm‚Äù.  Could anyone argue that couple didn‚Äôt meet that standard?

1308948002330095616 2020-09-24 09:54:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe I have no idea other than he was believing initial reported facts
1308947230968119296 2020-09-24 09:51:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @JustinRWalton @eriContrarian Right.  As @JustEric it was a dumb question by dumb people
1308947097631313921 2020-09-24 09:51:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh, they would have caught these hands had that been my parents.  Also, Florida is a stand your ground state and I would have no problem convincing a jury I felt threatened when I pulled out my pistol.  And my dad pulled out his.
1308946679777853442 2020-09-24 09:49:42 +0800 <just_mindy> And when we say rarely, we mean never.  Right @chrislhayes You were calling out groups earlier

1308945749753958404 2020-09-24 09:46:00 +0800 <just_mindy> This isn‚Äôt far from where @PolkCoSheriff Grady Judd is in charge.  He needs to take a drive over &amp; show St. Pete how to get this under control.

1308941389577752581 2020-09-24 09:28:40 +0800 <just_mindy> These folks are my parent‚Äôs age and this makes me so ragey.  Enough.
1308940628781395969 2020-09-24 09:25:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Thanks for helping turn Florida red.  Also @RonDeSantisFL check this out
1308940101909647360 2020-09-24 09:23:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Pray also for their wives, husbands, children and parents.  This night will be awful for them too.
1308939637348536320 2020-09-24 09:21:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @JustEric @LibertyJen And I wish he would have said what you just said instead  https://t.co/LH2A0FXnrz
1308939340442210305 2020-09-24 09:20:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, Trump is a very bad dictator fascist because he has started zero wars and is trying to bring our military home while brokering peace in the ME &amp; respecting Israel.  He really sucks at being an authoritarian.
1308938847951171584 2020-09-24 09:18:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Trump should tweet a clarification so the Media has it in writing and can move on
1308938588340588549 2020-09-24 09:17:33 +0800 <just_mindy> And this is why Trump being a goof ball is being made the big news of the day by Media.  So, everyone can ignore that the other candidate is barely functioning
1308938109212667904 2020-09-24 09:15:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Obama said he had a pen and a phone intimating he could do whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted.  Spare me.
1308937145659338753 2020-09-24 09:11:49 +0800 <just_mindy> And finally, the only people who haven‚Äôt accepted election results as of late have been @TheDemocrats such as Hilary, Stacy Abrams, Gillum.  Abrams still hasn‚Äôt conceded for cripes sake.  The press should be asking Kamala and her VP candidate if they will accept the results.
1308936413224800257 2020-09-24 09:08:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, a reminder Trump let cities burn while people were suggesting he take a firmer stance.  His base was begging for it.  He didn‚Äôt do it.  The dude isn‚Äôt trying to sit in jail.
1308935885354827776 2020-09-24 09:06:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @LuluVol @Neoavatara Yes and he‚Äôs always trying to think of a sick burn so he says dumb stuff
1308935752986890250 2020-09-24 09:06:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @Annie_Bannany @Neoavatara Right.  He‚Äôs not going to utter those words ever in his life
1308935662276669442 2020-09-24 09:05:55 +0800 <just_mindy> And again, instead of the American media asking ‚Äúwhy is Joe Biden basically a no show for this campaign‚Äù, now they get to go pretend our military are all going to back the President against the will of citizens and the FBI &amp; CIA are suddenly Trump allies.  https://t.co/3B3jOlbbPT
1308934792390508545 2020-09-24 09:02:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara But he won‚Äôt because he loves the song and dance with them as much as they crave it.  Like I said, he needs to stop the tango but they feed off each other
1308934288151281666 2020-09-24 09:00:27 +0800 <just_mindy> It‚Äôs also the press trying to make Trump look like some crazy dictator commie boogie man so the public will insist he not make this SC pick.  Let‚Äôs all take a breath.
1308933874026717185 2020-09-24 08:58:49 +0800 <just_mindy> Y‚Äôall know good and well Trump will leave the WH if he loses.  Stop being silly.  This is nothing but the press trying to distract the public from the fact Biden isn‚Äôt even campaigning. Trump allows the press to goad him &amp; he shouldn‚Äôt, but this argument is dumb.
1308923564981202946 2020-09-24 08:17:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy She was great

1308885490523922435 2020-09-24 05:46:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @LuluVol Yes!
1308869315555479552 2020-09-24 04:42:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 Of course
1308863325695025152 2020-09-24 04:18:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Thread
1308859748624855043 2020-09-24 04:04:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @james_penrod Yes.  He‚Äôs also absolutely an enabler. No doubt
1308859603258662916 2020-09-24 04:03:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @07Brooks31 @ChickfilA Yes!!  Try it!!!
1308859533624848385 2020-09-24 04:03:24 +0800 <just_mindy> As much as children, even adult ones, like to romanticize their addict parents, it‚Äôs mostly a living hell.  Hunter might be sober now (who knows), but it is clear he lived off the connections his father provided.  He also needs to be a father to his new kid.
1308859126580211712 2020-09-24 04:01:47 +0800 <just_mindy> My daughters can now see this because they went through al-anon and other codependency counseling.  Loving an addict is always waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Always.  Which is why Hunter has illegitimate children and crazy romantic entanglements.
1308858577315155969 2020-09-24 03:59:36 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm going to comment on this because Naomi could be my daughters talking about their Father.  He‚Äôs a musician &amp; has many great qualities and we have some good memories.  But my ex husband like Hunter, is an addict and that means they also have another awful side.
1308855904050216964 2020-09-24 03:48:59 +0800 <just_mindy> False, but also, what are you and what have you done?  You‚Äôre literally a troll on Twitter stirring up divisiveness and trampling the reputations of people who have actual accomplishments.  Those who can, do.  Those who can‚Äôt, apparently work for Vox.
1308845358940913669 2020-09-24 03:07:05 +0800 <just_mindy> I did the new @ChickfilA mocha Cream and it was delish.  https://t.co/e0OfJ0LW0I

1308839573729030147 2020-09-24 02:44:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @smittie61984 I think that is possible, but I really think they want 2020 too.  Biden would after a year and then Harris would take over

1308539715122089995 2020-09-23 06:52:34 +0800 <just_mindy> Yeah, totally.  Joe Biden who has to go to bed every day at 9 am will save us all
1308538490787958784 2020-09-23 06:47:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @Blue_MD Lebron has been paying them in Fl.  Fine with me.  Victims get their money
1308537952260194305 2020-09-23 06:45:33 +0800 <just_mindy> Literally me  https://t.co/BXhkHUJ8yU
1308537608298004480 2020-09-23 06:44:11 +0800 <just_mindy> So @realDonaldTrump needs to tweet tonight his belief this will happen.  That is the only way it might not happen
1308525689847656448 2020-09-23 05:56:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheMaverick21 @kimmrz60 Ha!!!  Come shop with me!
1308524635307364353 2020-09-23 05:52:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @kimmrz60 The clogging is annoying but the whipping around you really bugs me
1308524487525179404 2020-09-23 05:52:03 +0800 <just_mindy> @PublixHelps Thank you!!
1308524428813381634 2020-09-23 05:51:49 +0800 <just_mindy> @skov1 That‚Äôs a fact
1308524364900564999 2020-09-23 05:51:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @Chad6454 It will be interesting to see
1308519278166118401 2020-09-23 05:31:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @PublixHelps Clermont, FL Citrus Tower ‚ù§Ô∏è
1308512995589402625 2020-09-23 05:06:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas Girl.  I almost got heated today.  And it‚Äôs always men.  Like back tf off of me
1308512822415032321 2020-09-23 05:05:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy They‚Äôre the people you pay to shop for you
1308511247047036935 2020-09-23 04:59:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Are the Instacart shoppers at your grocery stores unnecessarily aggressive? Like fast walking and whipping around you in the store.  It‚Äôs starting to get super annoying. Like make your money but chill.
1308489611635720195 2020-09-23 03:33:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @albrechtwo We‚Äôll see
1308487039713767430 2020-09-23 03:23:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @albrechtwo I don‚Äôt think it will happen
1308486727229677571 2020-09-23 03:22:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @joecaradine This is a great song.  The lyrics really move me
1308483888780652544 2020-09-23 03:10:44 +0800 <just_mindy> A friend just shared this on FB:  https://t.co/DVCvCPIJ1F
1308482640262168576 2020-09-23 03:05:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @albrechtwo Yes.  Sept 29
1308482249357168641 2020-09-23 03:04:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @albrechtwo I wonder when the announcement will come
1308482051176366082 2020-09-23 03:03:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest That‚Äôs true
1308482012030918660 2020-09-23 03:03:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @joecaradine I prefer a nooner personally
1308481851896586241 2020-09-23 03:02:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @mooshakins @politicsofamy They will definitely try their best
1308481742232223751 2020-09-23 03:02:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicsofamy No. He‚Äôd look foolish
1308481390611181569 2020-09-23 03:00:48 +0800 <just_mindy>  https://t.co/vy9KP3EEYq
1308479913519976450 2020-09-23 02:54:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest That would be insane though.  People don‚Äôt like Clinton
1308479799724257283 2020-09-23 02:54:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicsofamy I don‚Äôt see any way he could
1308478242748346380 2020-09-23 02:48:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe @SaintRPh He probably does and not the girl kind
1308478138935119875 2020-09-23 02:47:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest I think they know too much of their base would hate that
1308477303014535170 2020-09-23 02:44:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @SaintRPh @politicsofamy Too late
1308477067927924741 2020-09-23 02:43:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy Yep.  Back him into a corner
1308476469484630016 2020-09-23 02:41:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest Exactly!!!!
1308473448713379840 2020-09-23 02:29:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Biden is absolutely going to get COVID or be around a COVID positive person and need to quarantine for 14 days. This will mean he cancels debate
1308473036597792768 2020-09-23 02:27:36 +0800 <just_mindy> 36% of the time Biden calls a lid before noon
1308455168879595522 2020-09-23 01:16:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @reeb1011 @WaltzingMtilda Exactly
1308455112130662407 2020-09-23 01:16:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @T_tothe2ndNGa @WaltzingMtilda I‚Äôve read some information I did not before over the last couple of days so I think so too
1308454919352004609 2020-09-23 01:15:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy üòçüòçüòçthat was so kind!
1308453985377026048 2020-09-23 01:11:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @WaltzingMtilda Is the announcement about charges against the officers? I assume that is what it is.
1308453576512069634 2020-09-23 01:10:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle Indeed!
1308453543637118976 2020-09-23 01:10:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @ATxFellow You‚Äôre probably not too far off
1308447418845990922 2020-09-23 00:45:49 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh, Christian has moved on from anonymously harassing women on Twitter, I see
1308445904744189953 2020-09-23 00:39:48 +0800 <just_mindy> The whole campaign is silent.  They are banking on the media doing their job.
1308445680801910787 2020-09-23 00:38:54 +0800 <just_mindy> It‚Äôs stunning.  Trump is running the country plus jetting off to two or 3 states a day and making speeches.  No matter your politics, it‚Äôs clear Trump has way more vigor.
1308444642573254657 2020-09-23 00:34:47 +0800 <just_mindy> What candidate in recent history has spent days and days before the debate ‚Äúpreparing‚Äù
1308442797456928769 2020-09-23 00:27:27 +0800 <just_mindy> They seem to think the military and police will be on their side which seems like a huge assumption
1308441841570897920 2020-09-23 00:23:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Hook me up Yasso! ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
1308441666513235970 2020-09-23 00:22:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @genethelawyer @melifix @NiedsG Oh I haven‚Äôt tried those!!
1308441566193881090 2020-09-23 00:22:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @yassofroyo @melifix @NiedsG I totally am but they are on clearance at my Target so now I‚Äôm scared they are going away!!  I bought 4 boxes!
1308435499275739136 2020-09-22 23:58:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @kimmrz60 Exactly.  You can‚Äôt plan things like that
1308429148281544704 2020-09-22 23:33:13 +0800 <just_mindy> The only reason it hasn‚Äôt is the restraint of conservatives
1308428942341267456 2020-09-22 23:32:23 +0800 <just_mindy> Dude, no one is scared of you
1308428787567263745 2020-09-22 23:31:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy @hale_razor And it‚Äôs every time.  How about one time and then let me opt out
1308428142047105025 2020-09-22 23:29:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 Ew
1308427905341501441 2020-09-22 23:28:16 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm going to cash in my dying wish early and ask for Trump to fill RBG‚Äôs seat
1308427499471351808 2020-09-22 23:26:39 +0800 <just_mindy> Maybe it‚Äôll be a boy?
1308426417940705281 2020-09-22 23:22:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @Laura56007622 There is too much Biden in our Trumpy area too
1308424905336258562 2020-09-22 23:16:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @hale_razor Exactly!!
1308424842992115714 2020-09-22 23:16:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @Laura56007622 I am finally starting to see a good amount
1308424737178218499 2020-09-22 23:15:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @BobsFunGirl Right?
1308423549288407047 2020-09-22 23:10:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @Laura56007622 Ha!!  We have two yard signs
1308423472142585857 2020-09-22 23:10:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeclay22598848 Drives me nuts
1308421732936675335 2020-09-22 23:03:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @Laura56007622 Yes. It‚Äôs utterly ridiculous
1308421415176200196 2020-09-22 23:02:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @I_am_Thatman I‚Äôm hoping he isn‚Äôt playing word games
1308420501153427456 2020-09-22 22:58:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @Laura56007622 She is wearing a very breathable cloth mask that passes their test but probably doesn‚Äôt actually do much
1308420349575475201 2020-09-22 22:58:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @Laura56007622 Yes they have no choice
1308420298908356608 2020-09-22 22:58:03 +0800 <just_mindy> I knew a good Mormon couldn‚Äôt back away from protecting life and as much as he infuriates me, I give him credit for this.
1308419524211945473 2020-09-22 22:54:58 +0800 <just_mindy> My kid is on week 5 of face to face school in Florida. 2 cases in a school of 2000.  Now just hoping they can stop wearing masks all day soon.  She doesn‚Äôt even complain about the mask anymore because she is just so glad to be back with other kids.
1308357105657810944 2020-09-22 18:46:56 +0800 <just_mindy> And Dems should def keep trying to defend this because it was super popular with the American people
1308356899893633024 2020-09-22 18:46:07 +0800 <just_mindy> He was accused of gang rape &amp; drug cartels when he was 16 &amp; 17 yet somehow he was magically reformed and never harassed a woman in his whole professional career other than the girls on his kid‚Äôs basketball team he coached or something.  Sounds fair.
1308252855787302912 2020-09-22 11:52:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @WaltzingMtilda @noahsmom7 It‚Äôs been so odd! I can‚Äôt shake it.  Sending you love and hugs too, Amy! ‚ù§Ô∏è
1308252557274484737 2020-09-22 11:51:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @MichaelBruner @Gator_Country @MollyRatty Yes!! I think many coaches could relate to that fear of being falsely accused
1308250261220139009 2020-09-22 11:42:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy Ha!!!!
1308250173198524417 2020-09-22 11:42:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @raymond04489465 Yes!
1308250062418587648 2020-09-22 11:41:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gator_Country @MollyRatty Oh yes!!! Forgot that!!

1308248372495683584 2020-09-22 11:34:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @noahsmom7 I‚Äôm sad tonight too.  Sending you love and light and hugs and good vibes from Florida. ‚ù§Ô∏è
1308247698479480833 2020-09-22 11:32:12 +0800 <just_mindy> He should withhold federal funding as he threatened, then.
1308247433546268673 2020-09-22 11:31:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gurgun1989 @MollyRatty They will go with the ‚Äúcult‚Äù angle with her.  At the minimum
1308247215329153024 2020-09-22 11:30:16 +0800 <just_mindy> @MollyRatty @Gurgun1989 Bingo
1308246060947603461 2020-09-22 11:25:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I needed that 2 cents tonight.  Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
1308245924054007808 2020-09-22 11:25:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gurgun1989 @MollyRatty If the other side is honorable and also makes concessions, I agree.  The Dems never ever concede one inch. At some point, you have to take your wins when you can knowing full well they will do the same
1308244244159762432 2020-09-22 11:18:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @jstan_7561 She‚Äôs a nut
1308244066673590274 2020-09-22 11:17:46 +0800 <just_mindy> @MollyRatty And running a narcotics ring
1308243782941450241 2020-09-22 11:16:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @jstan_7561 That‚Äôs an interesting choice she made!
1308243711940268033 2020-09-22 11:16:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Thank you for saying that.  Just wish it was as easy to lose weight now as then lol
1308243511448399874 2020-09-22 11:15:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy She‚Äôs getting ready for the second Trump term
1308243358889005056 2020-09-22 11:14:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @N5Tiny @ChickfilA Awesome!!  Kind of excited to try it now!

1308243224511885312 2020-09-22 11:14:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @mimizhusband Very true
1308240902742310912 2020-09-22 11:05:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 The good old days when I was still in my 20‚Äôs and fine lol
1308240682612666374 2020-09-22 11:04:19 +0800 <just_mindy> What‚Äôs hiding under her dress?
1308240409919991811 2020-09-22 11:03:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @paulsyy01 I mean at some point, he needs to answer a question
1308240165027164161 2020-09-22 11:02:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @viperstrike74 I sure hope so!!
1308240098891313152 2020-09-22 11:02:00 +0800 <just_mindy> @DrDathanPaterno It was!
1308240038979919878 2020-09-22 11:01:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 I was 27 and he was like 45 so there were always Monica comparisons, yes
1308239855609098240 2020-09-22 11:01:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas True! You‚Äôre probably going to have to to get it really under control
1308239704761004033 2020-09-22 11:00:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @henning_love @ChickfilA Ahhh!!! Good to know!!! I‚Äôm going to try it tomorrow
1308239599114878977 2020-09-22 11:00:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @JTHVerhovek @WBAY He should just ride around in a glass chariot waving at all the citizens as he rides around the country and never utter an opinion or a policy stance so the focus won‚Äôt change.  He also shouldn‚Äôt debate.  Just stand there &amp; blow kisses to the crowd.
1308239125171130370 2020-09-22 10:58:08 +0800 <just_mindy> He should hole up in his basement and not say anything and then he can‚Äôt make any errors!!  What could go wrong?
1308238586215530496 2020-09-22 10:55:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Isn‚Äôt that sort of the point of vetting a candidate?
1308238193276354561 2020-09-22 10:54:25 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas Do
1308238175760941056 2020-09-22 10:54:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas But so y‚Äôall have mosquitoes?!
1308238083763113984 2020-09-22 10:53:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Because everyone knows it‚Äôs between one of two women who went through the process for lower court noms not that long ago.
1308237758520078337 2020-09-22 10:52:42 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas Girl, we live in Florida.  They eat mosquitoes
1308237500939415552 2020-09-22 10:51:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @owen_smommy Yes!!!  It brought back such awful memories
1308237403291881473 2020-09-22 10:51:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 Ha!!!  This ex was something.  He was Literally a Bill Clinton impersonator for a living when we dated.  It was an interesting relationship to say the least
1308236542108938241 2020-09-22 10:47:52 +0800 <just_mindy> Everyone should watch this again.  I forgot the pain.  We all need the reminder of what the left is capable of.
1308235314402676739 2020-09-22 10:42:59 +0800 <just_mindy> He‚Äôs so good

1307731217186467843 2020-09-21 01:19:53 +0800 <just_mindy> The other advantage to voting Trump? The Democrats and the Media (but I repeat myself) are on constant guard to every move he makes, so you know there is accountability.  Our Media loses their inquisitiveness when Dems get into office.

1307712163465834496 2020-09-21 00:04:10 +0800 <just_mindy> Because they know he is unfit and Kamala will be the actual President

1307679646247419905 2020-09-20 21:54:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @JaneBond462 That‚Äôs really awesome.  And I‚Äôm hoping for DIL who loves me like your mom loved hers.  My mom was that way to her MIL too.
1307679124803194880 2020-09-20 21:52:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Another reason to vote Trump.  This kind of mess.  It never ends. Why would anyone want these people in charge?
1307678884842876928 2020-09-20 21:51:56 +0800 <just_mindy> Ain‚Äôt that the truth.
1307678792433926151 2020-09-20 21:51:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 @thekimcam Exactly.  My mom and her friend were chatting on the sidewalk outside the post office the other day.  My mom had her mask in her hand because outside and this guy started yelling at her to put it on.  She was outside and her friend was standing 6 ft away.  Ppl are ridiculous
1307678173442846721 2020-09-20 21:49:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @EdwardsPartick @montaga I hope!
1307678097286852608 2020-09-20 21:48:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @JaneBond462 My cousins def helped me.  It‚Äôs hitting me more now that my Dad is ill.
1307677551981142019 2020-09-20 21:46:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Amen
1307677240050831361 2020-09-20 21:45:24 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, if you can‚Äôt vote Trump, at least vote Republican down the rest of the ballot so there are checks and balances on the agenda Harris plans to usher in. Your local races, too.  That will matter when they start flipping tables in your town like this.
1307676366201122816 2020-09-20 21:41:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @thekimcam I also don‚Äôt understand the mask police.  If you have on a mask, and they work, go away from people who don‚Äôt have them on.  I don‚Äôt agree with yelling at women of any age by a man, but she engaged.  Those people were eating dinner and minding their own.
1307675794383286273 2020-09-20 21:39:39 +0800 <just_mindy> What I don‚Äôt understand is the ‚Äúburn it all down‚Äù because Republicans are led by Trump. He‚Äôs got 4 more years tops. If you give people like Kamala Harris &amp; AOC power for 4 years, there is no telling where we‚Äôll be and once the genie is out of the bottle, it‚Äôs hard to put it back
1307675159642492928 2020-09-20 21:37:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Wouldn‚Äôt you be thrilled to have a gentleman like Pence leading our country? A man of his word, conscience, and faith.  Y‚Äôall swoon over Mitt.  Pence is Mitt on steroids.  Won‚Äôt even meet with women alone! So pull the lever for him then!
1307674641071304705 2020-09-20 21:35:04 +0800 <just_mindy> And if your answer to that is, ‚ÄúTrump can‚Äôt hold a glass, and he looks feeble‚Äù, ok, let‚Äôs go with that. That means Pence would be President and hallelujah to that.  No more worries about mean words &amp; he‚Äôs a completely faithful spouse.  Isn‚Äôt that what you were looking for?
1307674183330037761 2020-09-20 21:33:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Finally, it‚Äôs clear we can look at Biden and know Harris will be the actual President.  She is rated the 2nd most liberal Senator ABOVE BERNIE, so you know where that is heading. A right leaning or centrist is voting for that because bad orange man?
1307673328426143745 2020-09-20 21:29:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest That should be the net effect and let‚Äôs hope it is.
1307673210419376128 2020-09-20 21:29:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @ByronHoffman6 Right? Yes.  I wish Trump would shut TF up sometimes.  I wouldn‚Äôt want to be his wife or even his friend.  But he‚Äôs been a decent President up against this social justice brigade who haven‚Äôt given him a moment‚Äôs peace since inauguration.
1307672735028568064 2020-09-20 21:27:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Trump hasn‚Äôt burned down your town.  Trump isn‚Äôt trying to teach kids they are inherently evil &amp; America is bad. Trump isn‚Äôt trying to get you fired fr your job if you don‚Äôt BLM hard enough.  Trump isn‚Äôt taking over sports.  Why would you punish yourself because Trump is mean?
1307671976404832257 2020-09-20 21:24:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @smittie61984 She‚Äôs quite the hottie
1307671469997121536 2020-09-20 21:22:28 +0800 <just_mindy> This is why I‚Äôm so confused.  May I share? I understand people‚Äôs reluctance to vote Trump. He‚Äôs abrasive.  But, a  party who supports this is the alternative.  And I assure you, this is way more abrasive. Trump hasn‚Äôt ever shouted in your face while you enjoyed a meal.
1307670686148833281 2020-09-20 21:19:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Y‚Äôall must not remember how mad Graham got that day.  I remember his righteous anger. That is when Lindsay Graham was red pilled imo

1307523356116254722 2020-09-20 11:33:55 +0800 <just_mindy> @PaperworkNinja Obviously I have no spouse now but my adult kids help when they can
1307523224377405447 2020-09-20 11:33:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @AlexJPappas One positive is y‚Äôall will be so close!! My parents have a house right behind me and are my best friends.  It also made them able to give my 4 kids lots of attention.  My dad never misses a ball game or a track meet.
1307522734260400128 2020-09-20 11:31:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @Gurgun1989 Right!
1307522642740641792 2020-09-20 11:31:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @genethelawyer I would love a sibling to share life with.  I‚Äôm lucky to have cousins I‚Äôm close to but they have their own parents to care for

1307522176912887808 2020-09-20 11:29:14 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm an only child who ached for siblings.  Now that my folks are aging, everything falls to me.  My 4 children will tell you they are so thankful to have each other and are glad they have several siblings. They are also all well loved even though I often did it alone.

1307521154182254598 2020-09-20 11:25:10 +0800 <just_mindy> That‚Äôs a terrible experience for you, but many women have large families and are affectionate and loving.  Some women have 1 child and can‚Äôt handle it. Your experience doesn‚Äôt mean that is true of all large families
1307516780408168451 2020-09-20 11:07:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @raymond04489465 Love it!

1307140665646682112 2020-09-19 10:13:14 +0800 <just_mindy> I reported this for threats of self harm

1307139846520139776 2020-09-19 10:09:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy Yes!!!!
1307139768954875905 2020-09-19 10:09:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Thank you @GovRonDeSantis
1307139518747860994 2020-09-19 10:08:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @InezFeltscher @lyndseyfifield That‚Äôs amazing
1307138680881061890 2020-09-19 10:05:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @grumpypachyderm Right?
1307138614011269122 2020-09-19 10:05:05 +0800 <just_mindy> This ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
1307138121641979908 2020-09-19 10:03:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @TweekKC I didn‚Äôt but it‚Äôs clear he isn‚Äôt up to this job
1307137943295987712 2020-09-19 10:02:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Point of clarity:  Jesus did not see women as second class citizens, and in fact some of his closest friends and confidants were women.  He exhorted men to love women perfectly as Christ loves the church so a ‚ÄúJesus Freak‚Äù would never subjugate women.
1307137057307983872 2020-09-19 09:58:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @auntieamy90 Yes!! Y‚Äôall too!
1307135956508708865 2020-09-19 09:54:32 +0800 <just_mindy> We‚Äôre different in Fl. We live with mosquitoes, alligators, snakes and flying cockroaches on the surface of the sun in a swamp.  We are not the same.  ‚ù§Ô∏è
1307135129224130561 2020-09-19 09:51:14 +0800 <just_mindy> We did.  Trump and the current Senate.

1307134371317583874 2020-09-19 09:48:14 +0800 <just_mindy> literally Pelosi got her hair cut when no one else could so I‚Äôm not interested in her equality nonsense
1307133982182715395 2020-09-19 09:46:41 +0800 <just_mindy> Or you could go light money on fire in your backyard

1307132773136822274 2020-09-19 09:41:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @ladykrystyna @Gil1957 Exactly

1307129956867112963 2020-09-19 09:30:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @ben_woods15 Right?
1307129819629580290 2020-09-19 09:30:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Evidently Trump has had a Xanax
1307129678600306696 2020-09-19 09:29:35 +0800 <just_mindy> I need a Xanax
1307129115447889927 2020-09-19 09:27:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @ajzeigler Amen
1307129024100159490 2020-09-19 09:26:59 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok.  Now go speak to your handlers and don‚Äôt say anything else
1307128116511469569 2020-09-19 09:23:22 +0800 <just_mindy> @JHarper28317302 Ha! Very true!
1307127506542231552 2020-09-19 09:20:57 +0800 <just_mindy> @JHarper28317302 My dad is straight from the hills.  I learned to argue from him
1307127140937355266 2020-09-19 09:19:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay Me too!! Defended the guy.  He is a total rino
1307126827106873344 2020-09-19 09:18:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Well, that‚Äôs balanced and sane
1307126652389003265 2020-09-19 09:17:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotaEmay When you‚Äôre a Mormon, I expect you to defend the unborn.  Why is this hard?
1307125475639201792 2020-09-19 09:12:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @UriBlago Fair point
1307125062739341313 2020-09-19 09:11:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @janetney Yes
1307124761424789506 2020-09-19 09:10:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @GameOnJD @ajzeigler Yep
1307124598081835009 2020-09-19 09:09:24 +0800 <just_mindy> I kind of feel like this is an ‚Äúinterrupt the President‚Äù kind of moment
1307124333672837120 2020-09-19 09:08:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @JDandTurkelton I thinks it‚Äôs Barrett for sure
1307124244657119233 2020-09-19 09:07:59 +0800 <just_mindy> @ajzeigler I hope so
1307123582301077505 2020-09-19 09:05:21 +0800 <just_mindy> Also not convinced but think Mitch will do his darndest
1307123342739148802 2020-09-19 09:04:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @PeculiarBaptist Exactly
1307123279904362496 2020-09-19 09:04:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @ajzeigler I agree.  But it won‚Äôt be for lack of trying
1307123115487621129 2020-09-19 09:03:30 +0800 <just_mindy> The Right to Life and stopping violence to the pre-born in the womb is too important.  This is a moment we cannot let pass.
1307122522358456325 2020-09-19 09:01:09 +0800 <just_mindy> @iamalittlehappy If the Senate and the President were held by different parties
1307122370575036417 2020-09-19 09:00:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @PeculiarBaptist It‚Äôs like the poem on the Statue of Liberty and stuff
1307121162930057219 2020-09-19 08:55:45 +0800 <just_mindy> Anyone who thought Mitch would change is mind, hasn‚Äôt spent much time around a Kentucky man.  I was raised by one, and trust me, they don‚Äôt budge.  A Florida man has nothing on a Kentucky man with his mind made up and score to settle
1307120085987921920 2020-09-19 08:51:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @NickP13 @BenSisko197 At least
1307120068241887234 2020-09-19 08:51:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @NickP13 @BenSisko197 Oh there‚Äôs enough time.  Trump has until January
1307119545493184512 2020-09-19 08:49:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @lyndseyfifield Absolutely.  Period.
1307117915288854528 2020-09-19 08:42:50 +0800 <just_mindy> @BenSisko197 Not sure about him or Jones.   He knows he‚Äôs going to lose in Alabama so he probably won‚Äôt cave
1307117748154228736 2020-09-19 08:42:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @e2pilot Collins and Murk have already said tonight they won‚Äôt confirm
1307117573461471238 2020-09-19 08:41:29 +0800 <just_mindy> 100% yes
1307117479014133760 2020-09-19 08:41:06 +0800 <just_mindy> @BenSisko197 Very likely
1307117419199115265 2020-09-19 08:40:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @ladykrystyna Every time
1307117093461078017 2020-09-19 08:39:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @joeogden17 Yep!
1307117022153773056 2020-09-19 08:39:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @PoliticalSock Exactly!
1307116867023233030 2020-09-19 08:38:40 +0800 <just_mindy> As I was saying
1307116365568933888 2020-09-19 08:36:41 +0800 <just_mindy> @JoePCunningham Me too
1307116200330231809 2020-09-19 08:36:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Does Trump know yet

1307114768331833345 2020-09-19 08:30:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @RBPundit I will now crawl over glass to vote Trump
1307114592842194944 2020-09-19 08:29:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @rcjparry They can, of course but then you risk 4-4
1307114511468580870 2020-09-19 08:29:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest I don‚Äôt want to
1307113529036738560 2020-09-19 08:25:24 +0800 <just_mindy> @RealBillOkeefe I know technically no, but we should want that
1307113189952417792 2020-09-19 08:24:04 +0800 <just_mindy> This is a very important point I hadn‚Äôt thought of
1307111722809950208 2020-09-19 08:18:14 +0800 <just_mindy> @mattbearnest He was very composed
1307111639460777985 2020-09-19 08:17:54 +0800 <just_mindy> 70% of this country is not for unfettered, up to the time of delivery abortion/infanticide so stop.
1307109998061813762 2020-09-19 08:11:23 +0800 <just_mindy> @Hellnutt @ComfortablySmug Yes it‚Äôs true

1307098053468401664 2020-09-19 07:23:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Closing the Border, stopping evictions, manufacturing PPD &amp; ventilators, shutting down our economy, sending stimulus checks, ramping up testing within weeks, sending military hospital ships.  Yep, nothing at all.  ü§°
1307097403162492929 2020-09-19 07:21:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @LynnWilson111 @bigmike5143 @SwattyKay @Lsubet @CalebJHull And your side called him a Xenophobe and a racist.  The only travelers he allowed were American Ex pats and they had to quarantine
1307096585562660869 2020-09-19 07:18:05 +0800 <just_mindy> @jcharping71 That is annoying. I totally get it

1307040448062599170 2020-09-19 03:35:01 +0800 <just_mindy> Wilson RT‚Äôing Act Blue for donations to turn Georgia Blue is just Lol to me. I swear he better not ever work in conservative politics again.
1307040143266770945 2020-09-19 03:33:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @jadedwisteria She wasn‚Äôt but she certainly isn‚Äôt an extreme conservative imo
1307039266267160585 2020-09-19 03:30:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @ajzeigler Exactly!!  She called him a fantastic retail politician but EXTREME
1307038577440808961 2020-09-19 03:27:35 +0800 <just_mindy> She loathes Trump, won‚Äôt vote for him but even that is ‚Äútoo extreme‚Äù for these people.  They‚Äôre insane.
1307038241615417345 2020-09-19 03:26:15 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes. This is why I don‚Äôt begrudge failed marriage . People say ‚Äúyou would have had kids with other people too.  You didn‚Äôt have to walk through that hurt‚Äù.  True, but it wouldn‚Äôt be these kids, my 2 kids are perfect for me and they needed their Dad‚Äôs DNA too.

1306700498263736322 2020-09-18 05:04:10 +0800 <just_mindy> The 1619 project is riddled with historical inaccuracies as any noted historian will attest.  This has been opined on at length.

1306302489269018626 2020-09-17 02:42:38 +0800 <just_mindy> One thing objectively wrong w/ this article is public schools have NOT been underfunded in the US.  The funding has increased exponentially.  Also, both ppl in this article thrived because of acceptance into schools of choice. They got out of bad government schools.

1306298714307399680 2020-09-17 02:27:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly.  They aren‚Äôt 16 year olds
1306298296332320772 2020-09-17 02:25:58 +0800 <just_mindy> Lots and lots and lots of people in prison have terribly sad back stories and families that adore them, but justice is to be blind to all of that.
1306297870597984256 2020-09-17 02:24:16 +0800 <just_mindy> That‚Äôs nice. Being children of immigrants somehow makes you immune to consequences?

1306292926289530882 2020-09-17 02:04:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @CheriPrice1966 Exactly

1306290456083468289 2020-09-17 01:54:49 +0800 <just_mindy> He‚Äôs not a spokesperson for CNN but commented only on Trump &amp; Fox &amp; not the Cuomo Bro Variety Show or Tapper? Strange, that.

1306240689617997824 2020-09-16 22:37:03 +0800 <just_mindy> One thing Trump learned is the Media is never going to be fair, so you have to troll better than them.  For better or for worse, that‚Äôs where we are.

1305727664364433409 2020-09-15 12:38:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Also, apparently if you believe parents should be able to choose the best educational setting for their child and tax dollars should follow the student, you want segregated schools.  Riddle me that one.

1305722937354391554 2020-09-15 12:19:42 +0800 <just_mindy> So the technical next line is ‚Äúwhy do you roll smoke‚Äù, but if you‚Äôre country country, you know you scream, ‚Äúto get drunk‚Äù first.  Saw someone having this debate on Tik Tok and had to settle it here.
1305722471337857024 2020-09-15 12:17:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Well yes
1305722385916727297 2020-09-15 12:17:30 +0800 <just_mindy> There we go!  Yes, the next line is ‚Äúwhy do you roll smoke‚Äù BUT before that, you always insert ‚Äúto get drunk‚Äù
1305722125966336000 2020-09-15 12:16:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @mooshakins Yes. That is one of 2 correct responses
1305721569419952128 2020-09-15 12:14:15 +0800 <just_mindy> If I say ‚ÄúHank, why do you drink‚Äù, what do you say next?

1305602939701075970 2020-09-15 04:22:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @jadedwisteria Of course it doesn‚Äôt.  I‚Äôm sure she expected a level of fidelity
1305602598754488320 2020-09-15 04:21:31 +0800 <just_mindy> The Democrats couldn‚Äôt accept this win and they have been divisive from LITRALLY the minute he was inaugurated.  Starting with the Women‚Äôs March and never stopped
1305602084155330562 2020-09-15 04:19:28 +0800 <just_mindy> Then Biden should be happy to agree to this debate
1305601848041234433 2020-09-15 04:18:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Yeah Trump really fears a camera and unfettered time to talk üò©

1305595546414059526 2020-09-15 03:53:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @TheAmishDude Right.  It‚Äôs fine that they agreed on a certain kind of marriage.  I‚Äôm sure she didn‚Äôt agree to having it exposed after a meth addled night with a prostitute
1305592442813665280 2020-09-15 03:41:09 +0800 <just_mindy> I can‚Äôt stand Andrew Gillum and his divisive politics but this is really awful for his wife

1305538433474015235 2020-09-15 00:06:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @CarlaMarco20 @HotepDadMax I also have this concern as my son is a firefighter and I fear sometimes a woman might not be able to save him if something went wrong.  There is a woman at his station that he knows could do it.  So, like you said, case by case.
1305537652041691141 2020-09-15 00:03:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @HotepDadMax @UncleHotep There is no doubt a woman who is a Mother will fight like hell to see her child again

1305309884079104002 2020-09-14 08:58:22 +0800 <just_mindy> I never block, just mute, but I made an exception. Go be dumb elsewhere.
1305309672245780480 2020-09-14 08:57:32 +0800 <just_mindy> Like I don‚Äôt care if people don‚Äôt see the resemblance.  That‚Äôs fine.  That‚Äôs an opinion.  I get some people really like her and might find my opinions strident so they don‚Äôt want her compared to me.  Also fine, but why get your panties in such a wad?

1305253995045359617 2020-09-14 05:16:17 +0800 <just_mindy> All these NFL players staying in locker rooms look real ugly &amp; petty with 2 officers fighting for their lives in LA rn btw
1305253290045779968 2020-09-14 05:13:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jammin2dmb Probably so but I don‚Äôt disrespect my country

1305245454918201345 2020-09-14 04:42:21 +0800 <just_mindy> @Bluesbrotha Clearly I do the same
1305239582389174274 2020-09-14 04:19:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear I definitely understand the cynical angle.  I have to fight it because I know that‚Äôs not reality.
1305238487906607112 2020-09-14 04:14:40 +0800 <just_mindy> @PlayboyPuryear For women who have their own money, we aren‚Äôt looking for what a man can do to enrich us.  We are looking for a companion.  Someone to connect with emotionally, spiritually and that enjoys our company.  It‚Äôs a different dynamic.
1305236103998443520 2020-09-14 04:05:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @Sjanderson86 It‚Äôs true.  I‚Äôm not even trying to front

1305200140559486977 2020-09-14 01:42:17 +0800 <just_mindy> @shnikies78 @MiamiDolphins Stayed in the locker room for the anthem.  The pats came out and no one kneeled
1305199618511253504 2020-09-14 01:40:13 +0800 <just_mindy> When they find the perpetrator, Kamala will go meet with his family and say how incredible they are.
1305193166962929665 2020-09-14 01:14:34 +0800 <just_mindy> @JimJwbubba @MiamiDolphins Yes it‚Äôs not sunny today.  We are excited about the Bucs game too

1305189221431414784 2020-09-14 00:58:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Really disgusting showing @MiamiDolphins.  I‚Äôm a Floridian rooting for the Patriots now.

1305176735667884032 2020-09-14 00:09:17 +0800 <just_mindy> Hmmm
1305176400605917184 2020-09-14 00:07:57 +0800 <just_mindy> I honestly cannot imagine any First Responder or anyone who loves one, voting for Biden at this point. Biden/Harris are totally committed to propping up organizations that seek to make their work more dangerous.  Period. #BackTheBlue #BackTheRed

1305174406600196098 2020-09-14 00:00:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @clairmarie @JCinQC Oh yes
1305172813951782912 2020-09-13 23:53:42 +0800 <just_mindy> A gentle reminder, public schools have been bad for 68 years and throwing more money at them hasn‚Äôt fixed anything.  Also a reminder, parents know what is best fit &amp; placement for their child. Trust parents.
1305170260635660292 2020-09-13 23:43:33 +0800 <just_mindy> @OneFineJay Lumberjack son would approve
1305167034318229505 2020-09-13 23:30:44 +0800 <just_mindy> Particularly if you live in Florida
1305166311702646787 2020-09-13 23:27:52 +0800 <just_mindy> @October49285201 Oh yes
1305166255133949958 2020-09-13 23:27:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Does Lincoln Project have an ad out yet praising the protestors calling cops ‚Äúpigs‚Äù and screaming for their death?
1305165955539120129 2020-09-13 23:26:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Kamala, however, will be meeting with the perpetrator‚Äôs family as soon as we know who he is, for a special screening of Cuties.
1305165172688982017 2020-09-13 23:23:20 +0800 <just_mindy> @Jaihawkk He wants to prove how bad he hates Trump
1305165043529584642 2020-09-13 23:22:49 +0800 <just_mindy> There have been a total of 771 ppl killed by police this year.  164 of them were Black.  607 of them were white or Hispanic or Pacific Islander.  But go off.
1305163820801945600 2020-09-13 23:17:58 +0800 <just_mindy> @nukechaser @KatMcKinley Very true!!

1305117716462829570 2020-09-13 20:14:46 +0800 <just_mindy> apparently protecting children from sexual abuse is only a Qanon position now so I guess I‚Äôm Qanon.  Who knew?
1305115927856459777 2020-09-13 20:07:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @America71005572 Nope.  He‚Äôs a man.  He works full time, saves people‚Äôs lives and property, and if he was exposed to COVID somewhere and had to quarantine, I would expect someone to provide him food.  That‚Äôs sort of a basic human need
1305115289378586624 2020-09-13 20:05:07 +0800 <just_mindy> @America71005572 I don‚Äôt know how he got it which is why I said ‚Äúif accurate‚Äù. Where I live in Fl, we teach ppl to read.  My son did go to school to be an EMT &amp; he went to Fire Academy. That kid is paying hefty tuition to that Uni. They have a responsibility to students they force to quarantine

If they were sent straight to quarantine &amp; they aren‚Äôt allowed to leave, the Uni has responsibility to students. My son is 20 and already a full time FF/EMT &amp; has been since age 19 so I raise men. Thx!

That‚Äôs where Disney Springs is located and where people can go shop and eat at Rainforest Cafe and such.  No ticket needed in those areas.  They blocked one of the roads there.
1305107654747058180 2020-09-13 19:34:47 +0800 <just_mindy> If Donald Trump tweeted this morning ‚ÄúCuties is a masterpiece in modern cinema..a must watch‚Äù, Netflix would remove it by noon today.

1304632027245948934 2020-09-12 12:04:48 +0800 <just_mindy> Felonies aren‚Äôt unpaid parking tickets.  These were felons.  They often have restitution to pay to victims.

1304627327100477441 2020-09-12 11:46:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Once again, many of these ‚Äúfines‚Äù are restitution to victims or payments into the violent crimes victim fund.  This was part of the sentence from the beginning.  Victims deserve to be made somewhat whole.  Incarceration isn‚Äôt the totality of a sentence.  Stop lying.

1304502515824812034 2020-09-12 03:30:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @eddgimenez They voted felons can vote when complete with sentence.  Restitution is part of the sentence as well as fines
1304501484869038081 2020-09-12 03:26:05 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôve commented on this before but once again, some of these fines are owed as victim restitution and no, your sentence isn‚Äôt complete until you provide said restitution.  That‚Äôs part of the sentence.  A sentence isn‚Äôt just incarceration.

1304449112792850440 2020-09-11 23:57:58 +0800 <just_mindy> Vice President Pence is a very decent and good man and why when I sometimes struggle with Trump, I can overlook it because he‚Äôs next in line.

1304437599461875714 2020-09-11 23:12:13 +0800 <just_mindy> @wolfpack197721 It‚Äôs ridiculous
1304437164797763585 2020-09-11 23:10:30 +0800 <just_mindy> A police Officer and former Marine was shot in the face and killed last night in the line of duty.  His name was Ryan Hendrix and he was the father of a 6 and 9 year old.  Just awful.
1304434942689120256 2020-09-11 23:01:40 +0800 <just_mindy> And neither of those things have anything to do with Donald Trump.  All of those people have been killed in cities and states run by Democrats.  You‚Äôre mad at the wrong political party.  Also, you teach Math.  Do that.
1304434675725803522 2020-09-11 23:00:36 +0800 <just_mindy> You have made it political by indicating Trump is somehow responsible for either of those things

1304432042965381123 2020-09-11 22:50:08 +0800 <just_mindy> So why are you discussing your political opinions at all?

1304423829532532743 2020-09-11 22:17:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Then guy should support Trump because he‚Äôs trying to stop the wars
1304423689744797697 2020-09-11 22:16:57 +0800 <just_mindy> Done nothing? Schools were out for 8 months, business closed and many failed, people stayed in their homes for months, people didn‚Äôt have weddings, funerals, surgical procedures for months.  GTFOH
1304423175640547328 2020-09-11 22:14:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Don‚Äôt try to act like your side supports cops or Fire Rescue today.  Spare me.
1304422819401523205 2020-09-11 22:13:29 +0800 <just_mindy> Like is this really the day for this? Really? George has 364 other days of the year to be a grifting scum ball riding his wife‚Äôs success.  The devil works hard, but damn if George Conway doesn‚Äôt work harder.

1303399676532711424 2020-09-09 02:27:53 +0800 <just_mindy> The majority of corporate tax scholarships are used by minority students and many of them are in Miami Dade &amp; Broward.  Those parents aren‚Äôt going to give up the schools their child loves.  Period.

1303365269549711364 2020-09-09 00:11:10 +0800 <just_mindy> We can investigate police brutality while simultaneously acknowledging the victim.  Remember #BelieveWomen

1303198388750618624 2020-09-08 13:08:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @DRussell76 @HotepDadMax I was about to say.  With parents who named their kids Hennessey &amp; Bacardi, I don‚Äôt know that they grew up in a pew.

1303196651675422720 2020-09-08 13:01:08 +0800 <just_mindy> This isn‚Äôt praising Trump. This is called ‚Äúpraying over‚Äù Trump.  Any one who believes the presence of God brings wisdom, peace &amp; favor, should pray over their leaders any time they can.  This has nothing to do with the character of the leader but rather with the greatness of God

1303192855784157185 2020-09-08 12:46:03 +0800 <just_mindy> Also the irony that Kamala put low level drug offenders and the parents of kids who skipped school in jail, yet calls this family ‚Äúincredible‚Äù is not lost on me.

1302929219618566145 2020-09-07 19:18:27 +0800 <just_mindy> This is outrageous.
1302928882530684941 2020-09-07 19:17:07 +0800 <just_mindy> This is why people love Grady Judd.  He defends our rights to protect our homes,  but he has zero problems calling balls and strikes when he feels a suspect used unnecessary force and killed someone.  He doesn‚Äôt care about race &amp; he will give residents all the facts. The best.

1302746813317951491 2020-09-07 07:13:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @mjmullen73 That‚Äôs how it should be.   As an Educator, I know for sure my students don‚Äôt have any idea what my politics are.  Other teachers don‚Äôt practice that kind of discretion which is why many of them don‚Äôt like having cameras in their classrooms now
1302746474464374784 2020-09-07 07:12:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @DCDev2020 Oh for sure!!  Like Trump is the new punk lol
1302744532778442754 2020-09-07 07:04:35 +0800 <just_mindy> My daughter and her friends can‚Äôt say what they believe politically in class.  They know they‚Äôll be ridiculed &amp; it would be poorly received from their Instructors.  One side demands strict loyalty but it ain‚Äôt Trump‚Äôs side.

1302724989414711298 2020-09-07 05:46:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Does this mean he is going to stop breaking into homes and putting his fingers in the vaginas of women whilst their children sleep next to them?  That would be an awesome change!

1302627819311312898 2020-09-06 23:20:48 +0800 <just_mindy> and every time a man in Media tweets approvingly of this man, he is telling women like me, and Blake‚Äôs victims, our abuse doesn‚Äôt matter.  I‚Äôm sick to death of it.

1302091237596581888 2020-09-05 11:48:37 +0800 <just_mindy> It‚Äôs always hilarious to me when leftist women think they were the only ones who went to college and earned advanced degrees.

Trump isn‚Äôt a kleptocrat &amp; you‚Äôre not scared of him or you wouldn‚Äôt write stuff on the internet for fear his secret police would drag you out of your home. As a conservative, I hv way more to fear

1302061563722051584 2020-09-05 09:50:42 +0800 <just_mindy> Sad, but what kids have to do to make it in academia rn  https://t.co/ijDCstMBte

1302060353010966530 2020-09-05 09:45:53 +0800 <just_mindy> Apparently only single Moms who own hair salons in San Fran
1302060235054632964 2020-09-05 09:45:25 +0800 <just_mindy> Like how Pelosi is treating the single mom in Cali who has no money or resources to protect herself?

1302058019350556679 2020-09-05 09:36:37 +0800 <just_mindy> @melifix @MollyRatty Yep.  Discussed w/ bf tonight.  I can totally see Trump saying he didn‚Äôt get why ppl serve.  He‚Äôs an ROI guy.  He saw the salary and probably was shocked how little they make.
1302054967130419200 2020-09-05 09:24:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @sleepdoctorjoe Awesome!!!!

1302049696375091201 2020-09-05 09:03:33 +0800 <just_mindy> You should probably delete this
1302049462437720067 2020-09-05 09:02:37 +0800 <just_mindy> And I know I‚Äôm a broken record but Biden literally ruined a man‚Äôs life claiming he killed Biden‚Äôs wife and child when the accident wasn‚Äôt his fault and he wasn‚Äôt drunk so yes, to all of this...also Biden doesn‚Äôt acknowledge his baby grandchild which is bizarre behavior
1302036428797423616 2020-09-05 08:10:49 +0800 <just_mindy> My son is at Daytona Truck Meet this weekend so y‚Äôall pray for the safety of all the kids there trying to salvage some fun out of 2020  https://t.co/GNXnJjrIpt

1302026186038669318 2020-09-05 07:30:07 +0800 <just_mindy> It wasn‚Äôt his uncle‚Äôs vehicle. The police later admitted gun residue from the back of a police vehicle could have accounted for it.  Witnesses recanted &amp; the gun was found in a gutter near the home of who they now believe the suspect really is.

1302024267207512071 2020-09-05 07:22:30 +0800 <just_mindy> This is not even close to the truth.  There is little to no evidence
1302024038039064578 2020-09-05 07:21:35 +0800 <just_mindy> In this case, it did
1302023502237700097 2020-09-05 07:19:28 +0800 <just_mindy> It was one Prosecutor and I agree
1302023311669579784 2020-09-05 07:18:42 +0800 <just_mindy> Yes!!!!!!! I‚Äôm so sad his Mom isn‚Äôt alive for this day. I‚Äôm convinced she orchestrated it all from Heaven!
1302022814304800768 2020-09-05 07:16:44 +0800 <just_mindy> @AverageArkieGuy I like it
1302022442328743936 2020-09-05 07:15:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth It‚Äôs easy to be morally superior when you don‚Äôt have to get in the mud and defend North America
1302020735603531776 2020-09-05 07:08:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeanBannion That‚Äôs true.  They depend on us.  We don‚Äôt depend on them
1302020606666461184 2020-09-05 07:07:57 +0800 <just_mindy> One of my favorites of this Navy hero!  https://t.co/ZlsU2sze1L
1302020124740923394 2020-09-05 07:06:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @SeanBannion Exactly
1302019744393039884 2020-09-05 07:04:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @BarbMorgenroth They are way too opinionated about US politics
1302019472245567488 2020-09-05 07:03:27 +0800 <just_mindy> @it_is_me_GH True, but Canada is very close and we could decide we want to own it tomorrow
1302019344189272065 2020-09-05 07:02:56 +0800 <just_mindy> @JackO87790530 We love the rest tho!
1302019083114868736 2020-09-05 07:01:54 +0800 <just_mindy> @BECrusader86 Exactly!
1302018871742918661 2020-09-05 07:01:04 +0800 <just_mindy> Canadians are very mouthy for a country we allow to exist
1302018704700575750 2020-09-05 07:00:24 +0800 <just_mindy> Kind of like Canada

1302017227198267392 2020-09-05 06:54:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @FergusFSU Exactly right.
1302017136190201857 2020-09-05 06:54:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @T_tothe2ndNGa Yes!
1302015967212572677 2020-09-05 06:49:31 +0800 <just_mindy> @T_tothe2ndNGa Imagine how much differently that could be if he didn‚Äôt have records
1302015709464141827 2020-09-05 06:48:30 +0800 <just_mindy> Police are trying not to arrest people and it‚Äôs emboldening bad behavior which leads to escalation which leads to cops having to make lethal force decisions.   Shut it down early and right away.
1302015352612716546 2020-09-05 06:47:04 +0800 <just_mindy> As soon as these people get in officers faces and point their fingers and post up, they should go in handcuffs and in paddy wagons.  Shut this nonsense down.
1302013376030179328 2020-09-05 06:39:13 +0800 <just_mindy> This is kind of lengthy but really important.   If you have teens share it with them too.  It‚Äôs indicative of how media can shape a narrative.  Grab a drink and read it.  Good stuff I‚Äôll use in my Author‚Äôs Bias lessons.

1301978449440112641 2020-09-05 04:20:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @auntieamy90 That one cracked me up
1301978359061254146 2020-09-05 04:20:05 +0800 <just_mindy> I will say since a good portion of Democrats say soldiers are trained mercenaries &amp; child killers and colonizers &amp; should be tried for war crimes, this newfound concern they have for honoring the reputations of service members is slightly jolting tbh

1301939544422481923 2020-09-05 01:45:50 +0800 <just_mindy> Ok.  People with eyeballs know Biden isn‚Äôt capable of kicking anyone‚Äôs ass physically or cognitively.  Can we just stop?

1301915487081816064 2020-09-05 00:10:15 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm assuming the point of releasing these bombastic claims is to change the minds of voters. So, put your money where your mouth is and go on record so the person you‚Äôre accusing can defend themselves
1301914957680910336 2020-09-05 00:08:08 +0800 <just_mindy> Oh, like the way the salon owner in San Fran has been slandered by Pelosi? That‚Äôs the risk you take to be a brave American exposing corruption.  These big brave men afraid to go on record should get a lesson in courage from that single mom.
1301914472915836930 2020-09-05 00:06:13 +0800 <just_mindy> So now everyone are liars except the people who refuse to attach their names to their accusations.  Seems legit.
1301913771309441024 2020-09-05 00:03:26 +0800 <just_mindy> Throw up your degrees, my friend! Let‚Äôs see them! Show my how highly educated you are supporting a candidate with clear neurological concerns.
1301912704492412930 2020-09-04 23:59:11 +0800 <just_mindy> This is always a favorite retort when I know I‚Äôm more ‚Äúeducated‚Äù than the person lobbing the insult.

I don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúlook it up‚Äù because I heard their excuse about fear of ‚Äúmean tweets‚Äù earlier. I suggest they should be as brave as the average American business owner who was willing to risk ‚Äúhate‚Äù to expose a corrupt government official.  Why so cowardly?

But also today, a picture dropped of his massive booty hole (don‚Äôt look.  I did. I‚Äôm sick). So that‚Äôs why he is trending. I‚Äôm here to keep conservative twitter in the loop.

1301557685696036864 2020-09-04 00:28:28 +0800 <just_mindy> @PoliticalSock Yep! I was 29 and my ex husband was 49.  I‚Äôm mature so it wasn‚Äôt as bad but the age difference started becoming more of an issue when I was 45 and he was 65.  Different places in life
1301556638965534720 2020-09-04 00:24:19 +0800 <just_mindy> @KRS_JAC I would sing about him, I‚Äôm so happy

1301517785223307266 2020-09-03 21:49:55 +0800 <just_mindy> Smart guys on Twitter.  My kids bathroom toilet is making this super loud noise constantly and keeps flushing.  What is happening?  https://t.co/b89xVZd5vY
1301514536508428291 2020-09-03 21:37:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @politicalFF Also true
1301514462944538625 2020-09-03 21:36:43 +0800 <just_mindy> @S_A_Smoot Exactly
1301512748195610626 2020-09-03 21:29:54 +0800 <just_mindy> Literally a scientific study concluded conservative women are more attractive than leftist women.  So, Fox anchors will trend more attractive. Also, conservatives are self-sufficient.  We can go to Sally‚Äôs and mix up some root touch up, Joe.
1301512276109864964 2020-09-03 21:28:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @MNobody67 Yes. They are all obsessed with the looks of the Fox anchors
1301511714324787200 2020-09-03 21:25:48 +0800 <just_mindy> @S_A_Smoot Yep. Just making the hole deeper

1301510173459197955 2020-09-03 21:19:40 +0800 <just_mindy> It‚Äôs not illegal to have security cameras in a business and maybe Pelosi shouldn‚Äôt break the law  https://t.co/cY7vbPXwwX

1301509585690390528 2020-09-03 21:17:20 +0800 <just_mindy> I promise you your stylist likely has security cameras in the salon.  That‚Äôs not secretly filming.
1301509340541734913 2020-09-03 21:16:22 +0800 <just_mindy> Vindicated how? She broke the law and it matters not who the salon owner is.  She also didn‚Äôt wear a mask as she insist others do.

1300673032818700292 2020-09-01 13:53:11 +0800 <just_mindy> My son has a nodule that is vascular on his thyroid found during his annual FF exam last week. There are zero endocrinologist in our area seeing patients in office to check my son. I‚Äôm taking him to our regular doc tomorrow hoping he can get the hospital to see him.
1300672129512419329 2020-09-01 13:49:35 +0800 <just_mindy> Our county schools in Florida has been open for a week already.  No turning back please

1300631720853635072 2020-09-01 11:09:01 +0800 <just_mindy> @shortyintexas Yes and this story elevating this abuser to some kind of deity is making me nuts
1300631512711299072 2020-09-01 11:08:11 +0800 <just_mindy> @_wintergirl93 @jannyfayray @NFL @drewbrees @Vikings Exactly.  I‚Äôll stick with college and hope they don‚Äôt go crazy
1300631324181639168 2020-09-01 11:07:26 +0800 <just_mindy> @geologyguy I‚Äôm thankful for my peace now.  Also, thankful that 8 month old baby is now 20, 6‚Äô3 260 pound firefighter with an arsenal guns who lives in a house right behind me.  I feel very protected.

1300628105279811586 2020-09-01 10:54:39 +0800 <just_mindy> @_wintergirl93 @jannyfayray @NFL Yes!! I‚Äôm so angry with particularly @drewbrees
1300627961331286023 2020-09-01 10:54:05 +0800 <just_mindy> Horrific.  This is what women endure
1300627662793322498 2020-09-01 10:52:53 +0800 <just_mindy> @GetOuttaHeah @TheH2 Absolutely
1300627590445707264 2020-09-01 10:52:36 +0800 <just_mindy> @gubmintworker @NFL I sure hope she does!
1300627488545148936 2020-09-01 10:52:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @jannyfayray @_wintergirl93 @NFL Thank you Janice.  It makes my blood boil.
1300625048470990855 2020-09-01 10:42:30 +0800 <just_mindy> @princessmcleia @Neoavatara Thank you for sharing and I‚Äôm so sorry you know this pain.  So so very sorry
1300616751579881473 2020-09-01 10:09:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @Pristinesara üíïüíïüíï
1300616623766863872 2020-09-01 10:09:02 +0800 <just_mindy> @noahsmom7 Love you!
1300616357541601280 2020-09-01 10:07:58 +0800 <just_mindy> Amen @drewbrees &amp; @NFL
1300613129492201473 2020-09-01 09:55:08 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG @dbm_freedom I also have guns.  The stun gun is on my table and the real gun in my drawer
1300607574035890179 2020-09-01 09:33:04 +0800 <just_mindy> @LoveCruzMissle @czechmate88 @RantyAmyCurtis Absolutely.  Knowing your child is there makes it so much more terrifying
1300607453852250112 2020-09-01 09:32:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @AmberL_Evans @RantyAmyCurtis Praying for wisdom for both of y‚Äôall!!

1300607233424752642 2020-09-01 09:31:43 +0800 <just_mindy> The @nfl @drewbrees are laughing in the face of domestic violence victims
1300606746449391617 2020-09-01 09:29:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @CheriPrice1966 Great news!
1300606261004820485 2020-09-01 09:27:51 +0800 <just_mindy> @AmberL_Evans @RantyAmyCurtis Thank you for helping her and making her feel safe.
1300605404913774594 2020-09-01 09:24:27 +0800 <just_mindy> Don‚Äôt ever ever tell me the @TheDemocrats are the party of women. All the conservative men I know support women saying Jacob Blake deserves no praise for being a rapist.
1300604864083394560 2020-09-01 09:22:18 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG üíï‚ù§Ô∏è
1300604482775126017 2020-09-01 09:20:47 +0800 <just_mindy> Par for the course for the @nfl to elevate domestic abusers
1300604339237646338 2020-09-01 09:20:13 +0800 <just_mindy> And his wife should be ashamed
1300603941869301760 2020-09-01 09:18:38 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG Every time
1300603906456682496 2020-09-01 09:18:30 +0800 <just_mindy> So many women with these stories.  The @NFL spits in all our faces
1300601653205307393 2020-09-01 09:09:32 +0800 <just_mindy> @NiedsG Me too, now plus a stun gun by my bed
1300599625569665025 2020-09-01 09:01:29 +0800 <just_mindy> @MadridFederer Thank you.  Lots of Granny‚Äôs prayers
1300599546205089792 2020-09-01 09:01:10 +0800 <just_mindy> @ThatOne86089707 It‚Äôs outrageous.  If he was selling drugs or counterfeiting money, that‚Äôs one thing.  HE WAS RAPING A WOMAN
1300599160610205700 2020-09-01 08:59:38 +0800 <just_mindy> Exactly.  No one is listening but I‚Äôm going to keep telling the gruesome details of Blake‚Äôs crime because I‚Äôm so tired of women being victimized
1300598897438527488 2020-09-01 08:58:35 +0800 <just_mindy> @Neoavatara Alcohol and a bad temper don‚Äôt mix
1300598812839469057 2020-09-01 08:58:15 +0800 <just_mindy> @acena124 Yes, thankfully he was in his crib and not in the bed with me like this case
1300598695264571392 2020-09-01 08:57:47 +0800 <just_mindy> @ThatOne86089707 It was almost 20 years ago now but man this has me riled
1300598565954293760 2020-09-01 08:57:16 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôm so angry right now.  PUT HER NAME ON A JERSEY @NFL! Put some respect on her name.  I celebrate that Blake lives so maybe she gets justice.  All this hashtagging his name is more violence against her.
1300598009110179840 2020-09-01 08:55:03 +0800 <just_mindy> I got a restraining order the next day and he did abide by it.  Thank God.  But I know how Blake‚Äôs Ex felt laying in that bed with a child next to her helpless while he penetrated her.  If you aren‚Äôt a woman, you don‚Äôt get how demeaning that shit it. The @nfl hates women.
1300597572432691204 2020-09-01 08:53:19 +0800 <just_mindy> When I was 25 years old with an 8 month old baby, my estranged husband kicked in my front door, dragged me out of my bed by my hair, kicked my TV and our child‚Äôs playhouse to pieces, spit in my face, took his golf clubs and left me with a door off the frame. So I know that terror
1300597038959284224 2020-09-01 08:51:12 +0800 <just_mindy> @deerskin1789 This Blake thing has me fired up
1300596133689950209 2020-09-01 08:47:36 +0800 <just_mindy> She‚Äôs not crazy.  She‚Äôs complicit.  She‚Äôs no different than those women on North Korean state news who spin events to favor her political party.  She‚Äôs out to convince you your lying eyes are wrong.  It‚Äôs sick behavior.
1300592393117405186 2020-09-01 08:32:45 +0800 <just_mindy> @KyR1775 @fancythis Only without beans!!!
1300584591414235138 2020-09-01 08:01:44 +0800 <just_mindy> I‚Äôve got the morning sun, And I‚Äôve got the evening breeze. I‚Äôve got the man that I love, lying close to me... I‚Äôve got a few good friends and my bills are paid.. I live in Florida with this sunset, and I got it made.  üé∂ üéµ  https://t.co/FvOu11PQ5h
