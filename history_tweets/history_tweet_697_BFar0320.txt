1343295064571867138 2020-12-28 04:37:55 +0800 <BFar0320> @mrsubbbb 2 bad head coaches, bad offensive line (but much improved this year after adding Becton). Right HC could fix his issues (still makes bad decisions). But i think he could be a good qb, he‚Äôs shown he can make all the plays. And he‚Äôs still young (only 23), he can turn it around
1343288084029440000 2020-12-28 04:10:10 +0800 <BFar0320> @mrsubbbb I can relate, I want Gase gone and I wanted Trevor Lawrence (I‚Äôm ok staying with Darnold, but I think Lawrence is going to be really good)

1325140281772056577 2020-11-08 02:17:17 +0800 <BFar0320> @Ayatollah8888 The only question that remains, will normal conservatives just accept this as they‚Äôve accepted the Lefts bullshit for decades? Or will they finally take a stand? Because we, on this side of the internet, are not a majority of the right wingers in this country

1325095288923697155 2020-11-07 23:18:30 +0800 <BFar0320> @AutistLvsMatter Biden will not make it thru his first year. Maybe they‚Äôd let him have his first 100 days. But he will be a sacrifice (old white man dying) to be replaced by the middle aged ‚Äúblack‚Äù woman.

1316713609586761728 2020-10-15 20:12:42 +0800 <BFar0320> This is my district. Two Jewish women arguing over who loves Israel more. How does this help the people where I live?  https://t.co/89MhIcdGYj
1316710203497361411 2020-10-15 19:59:10 +0800 <BFar0320> Good morning, I hope you all have a great day

1316128057070059520 2020-10-14 05:25:55 +0800 <BFar0320> @HopingThan @talibantrump @seducerscrt I agree. Looks are just one factor, because physical attraction is important in a relationship. But the type of woman who only cares about looks, or how much money a guy has, isn‚Äôt the kind I‚Äôm looking for. I want a good/nice woman, who wants kids
1316125726823919617 2020-10-14 05:16:40 +0800 <BFar0320> @HopingThan @seducerscrt The unkempt beard in my pfp, I‚Äôd guess . But even so, the advice to ‚Äúget fit and keep clean‚Äù doesn‚Äôt seem like bad advice. I don‚Äôt presume malice in people‚Äôs words unless it‚Äôs obvious they mean harm.
1316122030102777856 2020-10-14 05:01:58 +0800 <BFar0320> @HopingThan @seducerscrt I didn‚Äôt take it as rude, just him being blunt

1316100766092849152 2020-10-14 03:37:29 +0800 <BFar0320> @FaustianAutist It‚Äôs almost like these people hate those who love Christ

1316066247541510146 2020-10-14 01:20:19 +0800 <BFar0320> Why is the top political issue for most women whether or not they can kill their kids?
1316063891932303361 2020-10-14 01:10:57 +0800 <BFar0320> @AmericanLadz Funny how? Like a clown?
1316062763328966656 2020-10-14 01:06:28 +0800 <BFar0320> Gained quite a few new followers recently, which is nice, but I don‚Äôt tweet often, that‚Äôs not expected to change. But I will like and reply to your tweets, even the occasional retweet. Thank you.
1316062000724807680 2020-10-14 01:03:26 +0800 <BFar0320> @seducerscrt And picking up signals is something I need to learn. I‚Äôm not good at understanding subtle  non verbal communication, which leads to a lot of misinterpretation (and embarrassment)
1316061586616971264 2020-10-14 01:01:48 +0800 <BFar0320> @seducerscrt The putting on muscle is sort of difficult currently, I have a mystery shoulder injury for the last few months, doctors have no idea what, but very sharp constant pain, so it‚Äôs very painful to lift.
1316058799241859074 2020-10-14 00:50:43 +0800 <BFar0320> @seducerscrt I‚Äôm working on it, I‚Äôve lost 60 lbs since this time last year
1316058424745091075 2020-10-14 00:49:14 +0800 <BFar0320> @seducerscrt I‚Äôm happy for them but sad for myself now thank you

1316044479783108609 2020-10-13 23:53:49 +0800 <BFar0320> @CoolHeteroGamer Just watched the replay of your stream from last night, gotta say I had no idea what goes on behind the scenes because I‚Äôm just a guy who watches content/follows people on here. I just unfollowed the üêç. #TeamBeardson
1316009212242268160 2020-10-13 21:33:41 +0800 <BFar0320> @CainLondon03 @AngeloJohnGage I read both links, the huffpo article does have some interesting info in it. I‚Äôm not 100% convinced, but it is something to think about. I do find it interesting that Simon Wiesenthal also claims Columbus as a Jew (because he‚Äôs such a known truth teller).

1315793955519377414 2020-10-13 07:18:19 +0800 <BFar0320> @CainLondon03 @AngeloJohnGage Got anything to link? Or just assertions? Like it mentions nothing of that in his bio on Wikipedia (which if we trust the Wikipedia early life section to tell us about if someone is Jewish or not, shouldn‚Äôt be an issue)
1315716180271755269 2020-10-13 02:09:16 +0800 <BFar0320> @AngeloJohnGage If you have anything pointing to Columbus‚Äô Jewish ancestry, I‚Äôll take a look at it
1315707899122003974 2020-10-13 01:36:22 +0800 <BFar0320> @AngeloJohnGage Vespucci‚Äôs father was part of the money changers guild, Columbus‚Äô father was a wool weaver, but yeah Columbus was Jewish

1315091295321436163 2020-10-11 08:46:12 +0800 <BFar0320> So antifa can just go around murdering people and the media will run cover but James fields is in jail for like 400 years because a fat woman had a heart attack and died? Am I understanding this correctly?
