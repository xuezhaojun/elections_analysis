1344014548286763018 2020-12-30 04:16:53 +0800 <RSkarma1> @angiecthomas @richardmarx Mitch McConnell is an evil and nasty man.  Someone like him does not deserve to be in a place where he has the power to take food and shelter away from people, and yet, here he is, doing exactly that.
1343993783168475137 2020-12-30 02:54:22 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DonaldJTrumpJr Haha!! Oh please!!! Your dad is the worst president that our country has ever had in the entire history of America!!  I would say that "most admired" is a HUGE UNDERSTATEMENT!!

1343671633920339969 2020-12-29 05:34:16 +0800 <RSkarma1> @davidmweissman That's because he stopped doing any kind of Presidential duties the day after he lost the election. (not that he did very many presidential duties in the first place) His time is spent causing hatred and division, not offering any kind of sympathy or empathy.

1341787746411683850 2020-12-24 00:48:22 +0800 <RSkarma1> Lindsey Graham is Trumps favorite puppet. He will go along with whatever his boss says.  And I don't believe for a second that they intend to increase the checks to $2000. There is ALWAYS an ulterior motive that actually has nothing to do with helping people.

Trump was claiming fraud in the summer, before the election. So he knew exactly what he was going to do if he lost. Biden won. End of story. I don't know why people keep arguing that fact.

They complain that we are trying to steal the vote, but they are the ones trying to disenfranchise millions of votes. So it seems that they just want Trump in, no matter how they do it

1339266147192107008 2020-12-17 01:48:26 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Carla_Baron Love these but I've never made them.  I will be this Christmas. Thank you for sharing.

1338999905973653506 2020-12-16 08:10:29 +0800 <RSkarma1> This is my company while I'm working at home. Coco (19) on the left and Louie (10) on the right. The treat jar is right next to my computer. I love these sweeties. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§  https://t.co/QO46Fz5ZEC

1338998658365337601 2020-12-16 08:05:32 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ChrisPawelski My ex had an injury like that. His started to smell horrible and it was infected and the infection was close to going into the bone, which is serious. So please keep a close eye on it. He had no idea because it was splinted.
1338913026221727751 2020-12-16 02:25:15 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar Yet, people are still giving him money. Unbelievable that anyone would be so gullible or even worse, so committed to him that they are willing to give him money that they probably barely have.  I want to see that karma train when it comes for Trump.
1338878054828007425 2020-12-16 00:06:18 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump OMG!! Give it a rest already!! It's over! You are out on January 20!  Deal with it!  It's going to be a happy day when Twitter deletes your account and you can no longer spew out lies all day long. Do they even ALLOW cell phones in prison? Doubt it!!
1338854982955757575 2020-12-15 22:34:37 +0800 <RSkarma1> @SoCalVillaGuy @brianrayguitar @parlertakes Yes, they do!!! I love challenging my mind to decipher code words. ü§£ü§£ü§£

1338844123613302784 2020-12-15 21:51:28 +0800 <RSkarma1> @RyanNegri I'm so sorry for your loss.  I love animals more than I love most humans and I know how much they can just take over your heart. üò¢üò¢üíîüíî I hope that the good memories will help you through this.
1338843599069437953 2020-12-15 21:49:23 +0800 <RSkarma1> @funder @realDonaldTrump And they can't delete the account soon enough for me. It's about time that Trump became irrelevant.  He thrives on attention and if his account is deleted, we may not have to hear his useless lies and ramblings anymore.
1338842807419752448 2020-12-15 21:46:14 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump I cannot wait until January 20 and Twitter can finally take away your tweeting privileges when you lie like this. In fact, you should just go over to Parler.  They love you over there.
1338842179352096769 2020-12-15 21:43:44 +0800 <RSkarma1> @SoCalVillaGuy @brianrayguitar @parlertakes I know. If you need a break from "real life" just go and read a few of the comments that people make there.  I actually think most of those people are legit crazy. And I just need to add the fact that most of them can't spell either. LOL
1338701348854923265 2020-12-15 12:24:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Valerie_Becker @parlertakes I'm impressed. Lol
1338692996913618944 2020-12-15 11:50:56 +0800 <RSkarma1> @parlertakes @brianrayguitar Delusional people. Sometimes it seems like they are watching a completely different election that the one we saw. I've never seen so much altered reality.
1338686958273503234 2020-12-15 11:26:57 +0800 <RSkarma1> @funder I agree!
1338686408601513986 2020-12-15 11:24:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar Follow @parlertakes . They troll parler so we don't have to and tweet screenshots of a lot of the posts. I'm tellin' ya, people are freakin' nuts over there.

1338666968703000577 2020-12-15 10:07:31 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JeanChancellor2 @TXKyleYarbro @JebBush I thought the same thing. Filled with Trumps "great accomplishments" and how great is was to serve Trump. BS. Barr was fired and there was nothing friendly about this.
1338650614654521344 2020-12-15 09:02:32 +0800 <RSkarma1> @MMFlint But is anyone got to be charged or held accountable for any of this crazy shit they've been doing? I call it TREASON.

So he is getting a little vacation. Not much of a punishment at all. He should be immediately let go and not be able to run for any office again!
1338544094700822530 2020-12-15 01:59:15 +0800 <RSkarma1> @MalcolmNance These people are out of their minds!!!  "alternate electors"?? So they are going to send alternate electors votes to Congress for what?? They aren't real!! I feel like I have been sent to the Twilight Zone during this election. I've never HEARD such craziness
1338536318494789633 2020-12-15 01:28:21 +0800 <RSkarma1> @travisakers I just realized that this doesn't mean shit!! When are they going to give serious repercussions to people who incite violence?? No political representative, anywhere, should be allowed to stay in office if they are inciting violence!!
1338535582058864640 2020-12-15 01:25:26 +0800 <RSkarma1> @travisakers @DogStarGirl It's about time someone was held accountable for inciting violence.  I hope that there will be more to follow.

1337914381351444480 2020-12-13 08:17:00 +0800 <RSkarma1> I agree
1337912248493367299 2020-12-13 08:08:31 +0800 <RSkarma1> Drinking some Jose Cuervo tonight and watching A Star Is Born for the 4th time (remake) Lady Gaga is amazing. Bradley Cooper is the perfect guy for his role.
1337911502389522434 2020-12-13 08:05:34 +0800 <RSkarma1> I hate wearing a mask. I'm 65 years old and I have asthma. But I wear a mask anywhere I go. Because it protects other people. I can only hope that people have the same consideration for me.
1337909727141957633 2020-12-13 07:58:30 +0800 <RSkarma1> I'm so sad to hear that Charley Pride passed away. My dad always loved his music. We sang his songs together all of the time. RIP Charley. I hope my dad is singing with you in heaven. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

1337845380252381186 2020-12-13 03:42:49 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ChrisPawelski That looks nasty. Hope it heals quickly.

1337220427282833409 2020-12-11 10:19:28 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar I'm just so nervous about how much information he might hold over the ones who are on his boat. I've just never seen anything like this in my life. I've been through Vietnam, Nixon, 911 and sill I am afraid of what this man is doing.

1337217307643432963 2020-12-11 10:07:05 +0800 <RSkarma1> I n eed my America to stand together for DEMOCRACY! Our country is based on this. For a president to try to destroy that is TREASON !!!
1337216719127982080 2020-12-11 10:04:44 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar I'm scared. They are trying to break down our democracy. But I don't understand how this can even be happening.
1337198948927352833 2020-12-11 08:54:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> @marceelias He and his followers want a dictatorship. Not a democracy. I'm ashamed of this government, or the Republican side of it anyway. Something else is going on or all of these representatives would not be joining him. What is it???
1337198281127059456 2020-12-11 08:51:28 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump So you'll go down in the books as the president who won those by " a lot" and yet you did. And you are only challenging the states you lost in. YOU LOST!!! YOU LOST!! No matter how you say it, YOU FUCKING LOST!!! You have no dignity left. No pride. Go away!
1337180597828120576 2020-12-11 07:41:12 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ChrisMurphyCT I truly hate what is happening here. Trump supporters have called for martial law. They are willing to follow him no matter what! I say they follow him to Russia when he runs away and then they can see what exactly he wants to have happen here.

Actually, it's supposed to look like a double planet because they are so close together but I think that would be if you use a telescope. It also said that we would be able to see this through the month of December.
1336722694071574528 2020-12-10 01:21:40 +0800 <RSkarma1> I want to know how this POS is allowed to threaten a former President and not be arrested??  Something is very, very wrong if this guy can get away with this!! Where are the people who are there to protect and serve???

1336681408748810246 2020-12-09 22:37:36 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar It was such a sad time.  I remember he had been doing all sorts of interviews because Double Fantasy was being released and it was so exciting.  And then, just like that, he was gone. Horrible day in history.
1336510971012059141 2020-12-09 11:20:21 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar We all know what Trump is doing to our country, but what happens once he is legally out? These followers are crazy for him. I just pray that our new president can prosecute him for the crimes he has committed, then, people will see him for what he really is.
1336493218620469250 2020-12-09 10:09:48 +0800 <RSkarma1> @BigDfromCinci I don't think that they have any idea about what martial law is. They talk about how we are losing our freedom but they are wanting to give their freedom up if martial law were to go into effect. They need to research the history books.

They need to be held accountable for their attempts at destroying our democracy. I hope that someone will prosecute them once this is over.

1336472171946840070 2020-12-09 08:46:10 +0800 <RSkarma1> @davidgura He probably doesn't even know that he can't fire her. He thought she owed him so she would be with him. But that's not how it works Don.
1336471879494889477 2020-12-09 08:45:01 +0800 <RSkarma1> @davidgura He's going to try to fire her next. üòÇüòÇüòÇ

1336468862280343557 2020-12-09 08:33:01 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JulianLennon Your dad was someone who gave us hope. Always. My love and prayers are with you today. I wish we could turn back the clock and that we could just have him back.

These guys loyalty only goes as far as what will help them. So when one of them spills the beans, the rest will follow suit, I'm sure.
1336368186640510977 2020-12-09 01:52:58 +0800 <RSkarma1> @atrupar @PolitiFact Well, looking at his reaction, it appears that Dan Gable felt like it might have been awkward AND rude.

And Donald Trump is at the top of my list of the slimiest, worst kind of person. He thrives on injustice. This has to stop!!
1336113794536312832 2020-12-08 09:02:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> This is insanity and something needs to be done about it.
1336057233382256646 2020-12-08 05:17:21 +0800 <RSkarma1> This is despicable!!!
1336049233636564998 2020-12-08 04:45:34 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump They have counted and recounted the votes. It's over dumbass!! You just keep talking and losing. It's hilarious!! You should've just conceded when it was called and saved yourself the humiliation. Have you no pride?? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
1336048480935088128 2020-12-08 04:42:35 +0800 <RSkarma1> @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump As if he could even BEGIN to compare to any of those Presidents up there.  The fact that he would even have that thought for one second shows how deranged he actually is.
1336031106974572545 2020-12-08 03:33:32 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DanielNewman I have about 6 feeders and I have food for everyone out there.  I had a possum, 2 deer, many very fat squirrels and in the summer &amp; fall, lots of skunks all eating in the same area, PLUS the birds. They love it. I do too!
1336027777749950470 2020-12-08 03:20:19 +0800 <RSkarma1> Please stop listening to Trump's claims that there is fraud. They have counted and recounted the votes and Biden STILL won Georgia.  There was NO FRAUD! He is only claiming this so that you people will keep giving him money that is going into his pocket.
1336021336121110528 2020-12-08 02:54:43 +0800 <RSkarma1> @BlueSt0rmRising He isn't doing shit while he is in the White House anyway, so why not?  He hasn't been doing anything but spewing lies everywhere.  Although it just may be that he doesn't want anyone to see him "have" to leave or be escorted out in January. What a wuss!!
1336020690575745025 2020-12-08 02:52:09 +0800 <RSkarma1> @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I'm so sick of seeing his face!!! I feel like I need to just stay away from social media and the news until this is over, but I can't do it.  This is too serious for our country and it's people. Why can't he just go away already??!!
1336019885684649987 2020-12-08 02:48:57 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar @BeschlossDC It's obvious they don't give 2 shits about anyone who died because of their lack of action re: this pandemic. They DO NOT CARE.  We have a president who dances at rallies, denies that this is serious &amp; builds new walls &amp; buildings. I despise him!!

1335938055082045447 2020-12-07 21:23:47 +0800 <RSkarma1> @marceelias So I just read that there were dozens of armed people outside the Michigan Secretary of States home, demanding that she reverse the election results!! WTF?? How do people get away with this? You can't just go threatening someone with guns and not get arrested.
1335678274417070081 2020-12-07 04:11:30 +0800 <RSkarma1> Everyone, Please share. Donald Trump is using his followers and taking money for his own pockets.

How he can stand there and tell lie after lie &amp; keep a straight face is beyond me. How is he allowed to? Followers actually believe him. That they have lots of evidence of fraud.

So I'm not the one who isn't opening their eyes. The court has seen whatever evidence they have, if any, and it was not enough. The proof is in the fact that they have not won any of the cases so far.
1334229462695759882 2020-12-03 04:14:27 +0800 <RSkarma1> @zMorbid @TzuSays @MrCazares44 @realDonaldTrump But they DON'T have data to back it up. They have counted and recounted in GA and there was no evidence of fraud. Any discrepancies were usual errors that happen in every election. If they have so much data to back it up why haven't they presented it?

They keep saying they have all of this proof and then when they get the chance to present it, there is none. But Trump followers continue to believe anything he says, which is just what he wants.  He just wants to keep that seed of doubt planted.
1334227988871847937 2020-12-03 04:08:35 +0800 <RSkarma1> @zMorbid @bestlotionsdeal @realDonaldTrump If there's so much evidence, why hasn't it been presented in the 50+ lawsuits? Because there isn't any evidence of fraud. Even Republican leaders have said that. But you people will continue to believe your king instead of the courts decision.

They were not saying anything under oath. If there was actual proof, the courts would not be throwing all of Trumps cases out. THERE IS NO PROOF OF FRAUD.

All I heard were a couple of people saying they didn't request absentee ballots, without any proof that they are who they say they are OR without proof that they, in fact, DID NOT request a ballot. That is not evidence.

He is intent on destroying everything that he can before he has to move out.  I don't think that there is anything else on his mind other than that

They are all stations that veer heavily toward their opinion, if not completely.  But the fact of the matter is, Biden won the election, Biden is President Elect and Trump is out as of January 20. The End.
1331407739415826435 2020-11-25 09:21:56 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Lrihendry @nycSAYEED OANN is a Propaganda channel.

1330999565751701504 2020-11-24 06:19:59 +0800 <RSkarma1> @TaraLV_7451 @my1rstthrowaway @marceelias It's not going to change anything. I think that they probably want everyone (R's and Dem's) to know that their votes were counted. Although, judging from the chat that was on the YouTube page, Trump supporters aren't ever going to be convinced no matter what.
1330998878045409281 2020-11-24 06:17:15 +0800 <RSkarma1> @RonNehring His legacy of being president is damaged beyond repair. If he ever had a slight chance of being shown as doing anything for America, (which I don't believe he ever did) he certainly has altered THAT course. MAGA??? HAHAHA!! Yeah right!!

Funny though, that he had his final little speech all typed up already so he had already made his mind up, no matter what any of the poll workers said. Glad that part is over, at least.

I think the most interesting thing was that the only people who said anything negative were Shinkle, and John James attorney and the lady who talked about the death threats. All of the other reports were positive.

1330687380219686922 2020-11-23 09:39:29 +0800 <RSkarma1> @theFishstache My thought is that he is putting a message out there about police brutality and injustice to people of color. I love that he is not only getting his music out to us but also doing it with a purpose and a cause. It needs to be heard now.
1330686610556510209 2020-11-23 09:36:25 +0800 <RSkarma1> @theweeknd I Adore you and your message. You are amazing!!
1330679644325097475 2020-11-23 09:08:44 +0800 <RSkarma1> And now with @justinbieber . Love it!
1330679392297684993 2020-11-23 09:07:44 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ShawnMendes Holy shit!! Looking good with the long hair on the AMa
1330665272240435200 2020-11-23 08:11:38 +0800 <RSkarma1> @marceelias I signed up to see if I could see what's going on there but I really didn't want to follow any of those people so I've seen nothing. Lol I would love to see what kind of things they have to say though. It's probably all based on propaganda though, anyway.

1330595453491163136 2020-11-23 03:34:12 +0800 <RSkarma1> @sanaonline__ @realDonaldTrump If he can't even show enough proof state by state to win any cases, the SCOTUS certainly isn't going to take his case. You people are nuts! Trump is taking advantage of the stupidity of his followers. You people will believe anything. Lol
1330594332051648513 2020-11-23 03:29:44 +0800 <RSkarma1> @velocerere @realDonaldTrump Because instead of going to super spreader rallies, we chose to vote from home. You people really ARE dumb as rocks, aren't you? You can't seem to grasp that concept that your dictator wannabe is getting the boot on January 20.
1330592753747701760 2020-11-23 03:23:28 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump Fuck you you lying piece of shit! Every single thing you tweet is LIES UPON MORE LIES!! You care nothing for this country or the people in it. I can't wait to see what karma has in store for you and your family. You deserve to rot in prison!!
1330591882771116033 2020-11-23 03:20:00 +0800 <RSkarma1> I think that since Trump is no longer doing the duties of president, he needs to leave the White House NOW! He shouldn't be allowed to live in the People's House when he is going golfing on our dime and doing NOTHING FOR THE PEOPLE he's supposed to serve.
1330340553003823104 2020-11-22 10:41:19 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DrMcKinn Fucking asshole!!

1330218097257680902 2020-11-22 02:34:43 +0800 <RSkarma1> @StephenKing I totally believe this. He and his sons were in Michigan daily during the 2 weeks leading up to the election. Michigan cases were down and were were opening up. Now cases are at an all time high and we are shut down again. He doesn't give a shit about anyone!
1330001713860894722 2020-11-21 12:14:53 +0800 <RSkarma1> @cebrazil My daughter, son in law and my grandsons. Only because they tested positive 4 weeks ago and now go nowhere.
1330000955371364353 2020-11-21 12:11:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I would like to know about how much the cost of the cancer care drugs will go down. Oh wait... They won't. Because under you, it's going to be a pre existing condition. These drugs are up to 35, 000 a month. So okay insulin will be cheaper but cancer meds..no
1329998994718732290 2020-11-21 12:04:05 +0800 <RSkarma1> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Is this old? Because his hair is as orange as his face.

1329968719527866368 2020-11-21 10:03:47 +0800 <RSkarma1> @GovRonDeSantis What a fucking idiot you are. Get your head out of Trumps ass and do something to help the people in your state. Most of them are elderly and you haven't shut anything down? YOU ARE A HORRIBLE HUMAN.
1329966690835247107 2020-11-21 09:55:43 +0800 <RSkarma1> @doyersince74 @kaitlancollins I don't even understand how we ever let this man be in power over anything. Or how anyo e Republican or Democrat could ever condone this kind of behavior from a president. Donald Tump needs to be taken out of office immediately!! Not 1/20. NOW!!

1329963103619067906 2020-11-21 09:41:28 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Carla_Baron @JoeBiden Thank you so much. I thought the same but needed your reassurance. I completely trust your readings. Love &amp; peace to you.
1329956432888926208 2020-11-21 09:14:57 +0800 <RSkarma1> @GotJanie He has gone everywhere in my state of Michigan and didn't give 2 shits about anyone. Only that he could spread lies &amp; get people together without any precautions. I do not give one shit about any of them anymore. This is not my nature, but I hate that family
1329950128812269568 2020-11-21 08:49:54 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JArquire @BlueSt0rmRising Please never give up. No matter what is happening in your life today, please know that tomorrow is just 24 hours away. You may have a purpose in this world that you aren't even aware of yet. Just live day by day and ask for it to be shown to you and it will.
1329948533454147584 2020-11-21 08:43:34 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Carla_Baron I would just like to be reassured that our country will recover from the damage that our current president is causing. Will Joe Biden be able to heal our country?
1329905247138050048 2020-11-21 05:51:34 +0800 <RSkarma1> @EricTrump ABSOLUTELY!!! Your dad is a hated man in the U.S.  He is also a liar and a rapist!! So why is it so hard for you to believe that Joe Biden got 6 million more votes than your criminal father??
1329879638944964608 2020-11-21 04:09:48 +0800 <RSkarma1> @yesitsmikebrown @mfstern It seems like he can just do whatever he wants and nothing ever gets questioned.
1329861417986650123 2020-11-21 02:57:24 +0800 <RSkarma1> @KikiBean42 Geraldo has turned out to be a real asshole. I used to respect him. He stood for justice and humanity. Name the vaccine after the guy who did NOTHING to protect us from this pandemic??? Has he lost his mind???
1329855977336827904 2020-11-21 02:35:47 +0800 <RSkarma1> @yesitsmikebrown @mfstern All they have to do is say that they didn't accept a promise of anything and that the decision is truly their decision. This smells of corruption and Trump should be prosecuted for interfering with the election. But, as always, nothing will happen to him.
1329855599824265217 2020-11-21 02:34:17 +0800 <RSkarma1> @mfstern Bribery and interfering with the election.
1329800784880480258 2020-11-20 22:56:28 +0800 <RSkarma1> @marceelias It's like they won't give up until they get the results that they want. It's just ridiculous!!!

1329260372629594113 2020-11-19 11:09:03 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar I am just so sad about this whole transition and what it means to our country right now. I'm depressed and sad and I just feel like there is nothing more that I can do. My heart is breaking for our country right now.
1329226036802973697 2020-11-19 08:52:37 +0800 <RSkarma1> He needs to be prosecuted. No question about it!!
1329224571636097025 2020-11-19 08:46:48 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DonnaNickens I'm so sorry. My prayers that you will beat this and come out strong and healthy.

1329198367201783808 2020-11-19 07:02:40 +0800 <RSkarma1> What an asshole.

I'm so sorry you had to go through so much.   The music created from that made such a difference in my life. Thank you for that
1329104037988491265 2020-11-19 00:47:50 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump Too late babycakes!!! Biden won Michigan.
1329054028211380224 2020-11-18 21:29:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ddale8 That's how he rolls. He only accepts comments and news that affects him in a positive way. Anything else, he just pretends doesn't exist.

He was obnoxious and arrogant to me back then and he has only gotten worse since he was elected.  I just don't understand how anyone in their right mind thought that him being president was EVER a good idea.
1328774251889954822 2020-11-18 02:57:23 +0800 <RSkarma1> @richardmarx @DaisyFuentes Happy Birthday Daisy!!  https://t.co/GGjvUB9MEb

1328746646109368320 2020-11-18 01:07:42 +0800 <RSkarma1> @marceelias @DemocracyDocket I hope that this one is a VICTORY like the others.
1328746255091179528 2020-11-18 01:06:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Carla_Baron I don't blame you. There are so many accounts that are just stalkers. If you follow them back, they immediately DM and start hitting on you and trying to get more information. It's ridiculous.
1328735798603239425 2020-11-18 00:24:35 +0800 <RSkarma1> @jake_holmes14 @MorganWallen I'm not even sure if it's new but it was "I love you more than my hometown"  or something like that. He played it on the CMA's. I'm a new fan so I don't know if it's an older song or what but I loved it!
1328528596005220354 2020-11-17 10:41:14 +0800 <RSkarma1> @TeeTurner Hope you had a great birthday.  https://t.co/kwZbPNTTGo
1328524624414564352 2020-11-17 10:25:27 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DoYouEvenLif Something needs to happen to him. And if there was a threat made and it was turned over to the authorities, you would think they'd be on it so fast.
1328522856507072512 2020-11-17 10:18:26 +0800 <RSkarma1> @KETVRob I wish people in Michigan would do the same. There are so many that simply don't like the governor, so the will defy her orders just because. It's infuriating.
1328521698577145862 2020-11-17 10:13:50 +0800 <RSkarma1> @CwMcculloughjr @DanRather As they should be. And I can't wait to see it happen. Some of these guys are going to wish that they had separated from Trump the day after the election instead of getting mixed up in his BS. They deserve equal punishment as far as I'm concerned.
1328516004788531202 2020-11-17 09:51:12 +0800 <RSkarma1> @LawLiberal @DanRather I hope so.
1328515543402418179 2020-11-17 09:49:22 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DanRather Can't Lindsey Graham be prosecuted for this or does anyone on the Trump train just get to do whatever they want to do with no repercussions?
1328505781101137920 2020-11-17 09:10:35 +0800 <RSkarma1> @SarahLou1211 @SSNBubblehead @perlmutations THAT, in itself, pisses me off. He's doing it just for spite. He needs to be taken away in a straightjacket. What kind of president acts this way? He's going to do as much damage as he can before he has to leave.
1328503779646435328 2020-11-17 09:02:38 +0800 <RSkarma1> @perlmutations I don't understand how he can get away with everything he does.
1328460507322470401 2020-11-17 06:10:41 +0800 <RSkarma1> @EricTrump It's called social distancing, something that you &amp; the rest of the family doesn't seem to comprehend. I wouldn't really be bragging about those huge rallies which have now caused Covid cases to spike everywhere you held rallies. You're contemptable!
1328439215672201222 2020-11-17 04:46:04 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JimmyWayne @Walk2BEAutiful @ProjectMMH Wow! What an amazing thing to do. How long have you been walking? And how far are you going?
1328417551265787904 2020-11-17 03:19:59 +0800 <RSkarma1> I totally NEED to see a video for this!! Love this song!!
1328415760176263173 2020-11-17 03:12:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ddale8 You might as well just report the things that he says that are true. I think it would be a lot less work.
1328415589468172291 2020-11-17 03:12:11 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar Are you serious??? This is my new favorite song!! I would love to see it being performed.
1328415300749041676 2020-11-17 03:11:03 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Debootsie Hey girl!!! How are you?
1328401173003587586 2020-11-17 02:14:54 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump Biden won!! If anyone is trying to steal this election, it's you!!  You are trying to change the outcome however you can, whether it's convincing everyone that there was fraud, or delaying the certification.  That is NOT a WIN, YOU LOSER!! You sicken me.
1328392675943469056 2020-11-17 01:41:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA OPEN UP YOUR TAX RETURNS!!!  And by the way, what you said to Michigan residents, telling them to "rise up" against Governor Whitmer, simply because she is trying to get COVID under control here, makes me sick!! You are a danger to society dude!!
1328392103752241155 2020-11-17 01:38:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> I wish I could see it done live!! I'll bet it's even more amazing!!!
1328366036949868546 2020-11-16 23:55:17 +0800 <RSkarma1> Another victory!!!
1328355138914955265 2020-11-16 23:11:59 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump Bullshit! The only thing that you did, was encouraged people to gather at your rallies without masks. Michigan was doing great until you and your spawn came here 50 times the weeks before the election. Now we are spiking daily and closed down again.
1328164976440340486 2020-11-16 10:36:21 +0800 <RSkarma1> @dfwybharry I just hope that everyone does it. So many people here hate Governor Whitmer, so they won't do anything that she orders. And Trump telling people to "rise up" against her, doesn't help at all.
1328161670452142081 2020-11-16 10:23:12 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DanielNewman I do too. The other day I just googled "magic eye pictures" and got a bunch of them to look at.

1327787053564780544 2020-11-15 09:34:37 +0800 <RSkarma1> @pulte I don't even know what that means. So I guess I'm out. But I just love seeing you give to people. You are a good man

That's what he does to everyone who doesn't side with him. But the problem is that his followers will believe everything he says. They hate who he hates.
1327771328024371200 2020-11-15 08:32:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> @mccaffreyr3 We can only hope and pray.
1327770749013286914 2020-11-15 08:29:50 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JimmyWayne I just found you on Twitter. I've loved you since "Stay Gone" (sounded like I could have written that song) and "I Love You This Much". I've listened to everything ever since. Seen you several times. You are amazing. Please follow me back.
1327759177549312001 2020-11-15 07:43:51 +0800 <RSkarma1> @MorganWallen Love your new song. Congrats on winning a CMA. I just started following you. I hope you will follow me back.
1327748652333461506 2020-11-15 07:02:01 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Wow. Is there ANY American institution that you aren't trying to bash faith in? TIME TO CONCEDE. YOU ARE THE SCUM OF THE EARTH! The majority of Americans have spoken. Face it. You're history. And NOT a good part.
1327705772764123142 2020-11-15 04:11:38 +0800 <RSkarma1> @AshleyRParker It's more like 15,000 to 20,000.

1327415032045596678 2020-11-14 08:56:20 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA I will so happy when you are out of the White House and in prison. And you know that you can't have your phone in prison, right? That means NO MORE TWEETS!!

1327360759303647232 2020-11-14 05:20:40 +0800 <RSkarma1> @MeliMels99 Not yet. In a couple minutes.
1327356232643076096 2020-11-14 05:02:41 +0800 <RSkarma1> "LANDSLIDE"  And I don't mean the song. 306 is the magic number.  According to Trump in 2016 he won by a landslide. He better start packing his bags.
1327355767863857152 2020-11-14 05:00:50 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Wyn1745 @Ginlefebvre You're out of your F**KING mind!! You people are all living in la la land. Do you know how ridiculous this sounds. "Trump Won the Election" and "will win the recount"? He isn't even CLOSE!!! My God People!! Get a grip on reality for a second.
1327354038246137857 2020-11-14 04:53:58 +0800 <RSkarma1> @adjunctprofesor @Ginlefebvre There is NOT overwhelming evidence of any such thing. Not a stolen election or any of the other things that you have accused Joe Biden and the Democrats of all throughout this thread.  You have about 100 tweets in this thread all propaganda and LIES!
1327348130560565253 2020-11-14 04:30:29 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar I have a question. Did Donald Trump inspire "Got A New Thing" in any way?  Just sayin.... some of the things you're saying, I could say about him. ü§£üòÇ
1327337837205852164 2020-11-14 03:49:35 +0800 <RSkarma1> @el_opinionated @GeorgeTakei Go assemble to your little hearts content.  It's not going to make a difference. TRUMP LOST!! He is trying to cause problems so that he can declare a state of emergency and stall some more.  IT'S HIS LAST RESORT AND WE AREN'T FALLING FOR IT!!
1327336862638346242 2020-11-14 03:45:43 +0800 <RSkarma1> Please stay home tomorrow.  Let them march if they want. That's not why they are there. They want confrontation so that Trump can call in forces and then blame Dems for violence. They want a reaction. Don't give it to them.
1327327777968840704 2020-11-14 03:09:37 +0800 <RSkarma1> @MxedChiq @DogStarGirl @realTuckFrumper I think they should all leave the country and go to an island in the middle of nowhere with no phone service so that we aren't subjected to his tweets anymore. LOL
1327320063217717252 2020-11-14 02:38:58 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump THE ELECTION WAS NOT RIGGED!!! YOU ARE A VERY BAD LOSER. YOU JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET IT THROUGH YOUR ORANGE HEAD THAT 77+ MILLION PEOPLE I AMERICA THINK YOU SUCK AND WANT YOU GONE!!
1327318867161518080 2020-11-14 02:34:12 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DogStarGirl @realTuckFrumper Actually, I wish that he would do exactly that!! Good riddance.
1327317643167223808 2020-11-14 02:29:21 +0800 <RSkarma1> You've all got to check this new music out!! It'll get you right from the first couple of notes!! @brianrayguitar

1327314106592931840 2020-11-14 02:15:17 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar I can't wait to check it out! I've been listening to some of your other stuff on YouTube and I'm really liking it. I knew you were going to be great on your own because I thought that you were amazing with Paul!  Congrats on the new music!!
1327289939793416196 2020-11-14 00:39:16 +0800 <RSkarma1> I've never, before now, seen a president who's lying and fighting so hard to convince everyone that he won the election, but at the same time, NOT be performing ANY of the duties of president while doing it. Seems he is done being president, even before Jan.
1327288468997885952 2020-11-14 00:33:25 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ddale8 Further proof that Trump is a lunatic. So it was the most secure because of him, but it was rigged because of the Democrats. LMAO!! ü§£üòÇüòÇü§£ü§£üòÇüòÇü§£
1327270771253800966 2020-11-13 23:23:06 +0800 <RSkarma1> I love this!  I need a copy of each of these magazines NOW!
1327256765562572807 2020-11-13 22:27:26 +0800 <RSkarma1> @SebGorka @realDonaldTrump @Geoffyoungrepub Hell no!! The election is over so there's no reason for him to do any rallies. He needs to start packing his bags, NOT be doing super spreader rallies.  He's done enough damage here in Michigan. We had it under control until he and his spawn kept coming here.
1327077894288531458 2020-11-13 10:36:40 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Carla_Baron I understand. ‚ù§‚ù§
1327034558072688641 2020-11-13 07:44:28 +0800 <RSkarma1> Please do NOT participate in this. They are trying to cause violence.

1326985737431101444 2020-11-13 04:30:28 +0800 <RSkarma1> @XandraRice @marceelias Marc deleted the tweet. I wonder why?
1326985525253824520 2020-11-13 04:29:38 +0800 <RSkarma1> @XandraRice @marceelias I tried to open that tweet to see the replies and it says that the page is unavailable. Can you see the replies?
1326984509196275712 2020-11-13 04:25:35 +0800 <RSkarma1> @XandraRice @marceelias That's what it says on that document. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£He is making a mockery of this election and the whole court system. Someone needs to shut his ass down!!
1326984019284807680 2020-11-13 04:23:39 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Amy_Rumberger @marceelias But anyone could do this then, just to avoid the election to go on the way it's supposed to.  I would think that someone would put a stop to it, knowing full well that he is just stalling with the chance that he will bypass the voting giving him an advantage.
1326982853331193856 2020-11-13 04:19:01 +0800 <RSkarma1> @marceelias Plaintiff is "Donald J. Trump for President, Inc?? So his run for president is Incorporated? WTH does THAT mean? My God, he is just suing everyone just for the fun of it, it seems!! I can't stand sue happy people. Never have been able to.
1326954693315194881 2020-11-13 02:27:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> @BarackObama I know that with the number of followers that you have, the chances of you even seeing this is minimal.

1326953825744326656 2020-11-13 02:23:40 +0800 <RSkarma1> @toddcarey Love, love, love it!!!
1326951880292003841 2020-11-13 02:15:56 +0800 <RSkarma1> @marceelias He breaks the law all the time and nothing has touched. This is so typical. Fox served it purpose. As long as they were pro Trump they were the best.  But now, they aren't kissing his ass anymore and he is trashing them. And people are agreeing with him. ü§£ü§£
1326950626778034177 2020-11-13 02:10:57 +0800 <RSkarma1> @AussiePunter32 Apparently Trump people like propaganda channels. LOL They really DO need to leave the USA and go create their own government somewhere. Then they can hear one side of the story all day long if they want.
1326948835906760709 2020-11-13 02:03:50 +0800 <RSkarma1> Just to put some truth out there you Trump supporters should read this. What Trump is saying on Twitter is NOT what is really going on.
1326938316651061253 2020-11-13 01:22:02 +0800 <RSkarma1> @freedmfighter02 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump He already won. Where have you been?  And the more they count the votes, the MORE BIDEN IS WINNING!! Now go put your head back in the sand, please.
1326903662313172994 2020-11-12 23:04:20 +0800 <RSkarma1> So while we are listening to Trump and his accusations, maybe we should look into this as well.
1326892177327345667 2020-11-12 22:18:42 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ddale8 I just don't understand how anyone can think that that is logical. But people actually believe this.
1326880191717715968 2020-11-12 21:31:04 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump YOU LOST!!! Joe Biden does not need AZ to win!! He has already won!! Just because you are in denial is not going to change the outcome. GET OVER IT!!!
1326727194614362115 2020-11-12 11:23:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Carla_Baron I was just curious if, in any of your readings, if anyone has asked about the outcome of all of the craziness and whether or not our country will be able to heal from this? I don't sleep well anymore and I'm sure I'm not the only one.
1326726133652484096 2020-11-12 11:18:54 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JamesOKeefeIII @Ginlefebvre @Project_Veritas Did he win the $1 million prize that was offered?
1326725240496533510 2020-11-12 11:15:21 +0800 <RSkarma1> I'm just curious of there are any previous Trump supporters who no longer support him since he has tried to dispute our democracy. I don't want to hear from cult members on this. I'm just curious.
1326724062673051648 2020-11-12 11:10:40 +0800 <RSkarma1> @W_Marks17 I'll be watching. Have a great night.
1326722827521826816 2020-11-12 11:05:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump And Joe Biden, our new President, received about 5 million votes more and the electoral votes he needed to win. So face it. Trump is history. And NOT a GOOD part of history. Especially once he goes to prison.

Because in MY UNITED STATES which is a DEMOCRATIC society where the VOTES count and dictators don't exist, JOE BIDEN WAS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE. Get off the Trump Train already.

1326633057139494913 2020-11-12 05:09:03 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump You are a fucking moron and you are going to go down in books as the worst president EVER in the HISTORY of the UNITED STATES!!!

If they have all this evidence that they said they have, why would they be offering that kind of money? It's all just a stall tactic. I heard that here in MI they have Feds involved. Lotsa luck!
1326615883268165633 2020-11-12 04:00:48 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DonaldJTrumpJr @nypost Next he will recant the recant that he recanted after he lied. He sounds a little bit confused. Haha!!

And now, I've seen people talking about opening up other accounts to donate money to him. The guy needs to get his stories straight. LOL
1326614868636688385 2020-11-12 03:56:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DonaldJTrumpJr ü§£ü§£If he is offering $1 million for someone to step forward, I'm surprised there aren't hundreds of people rushing forward. If I didn't think Trump was a dangerous as I do, I WOULD find SOMETHING for $1 million. Just sayin. You really ARE desperate! ü§£ü§£
1326582815488696320 2020-11-12 01:49:24 +0800 <RSkarma1> @pbump I don't doubt that one bit. They are cult members. This is what he wanted to happen. He will be gone soon. Once he gets arrested and thrown in prison, maybe they will come to their senses.
1326581888388128768 2020-11-12 01:45:43 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DonaldJTrumpJr YOU ARE PATHETIC!!!
1326581598318374912 2020-11-12 01:44:34 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar My son showed me this yesterday!! LMAO!!!
1326580986012897280 2020-11-12 01:42:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Johnnyb500 @brianrayguitar Big deal.  Biden doesn't NEED Georgia!! And it seems that whenever they are counting, Biden gets more votes. I'm cool with that! I don't know what anyone thinks that this will accomplish. Trump is just stalling being kicked out because he hates losing.
1326578052671934471 2020-11-12 01:30:29 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar Great photo op for him. He's such a hypocrite!
1326575338743234560 2020-11-12 01:19:41 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar I know he wanted to be known as the greatest in history, but his behavior is going to cause him to be known as just the opposite.  What Biden said yesterday was correct.  His legacy is NOT going to be pretty, in any case.

1326572106524594179 2020-11-12 01:06:51 +0800 <RSkarma1> @MiloVentimiglia Every day. I have many veterans in my family, both retired and active, and the active ones make great sacrifice when they have to be away from their families during the holidays or for the birth of a child. They deserve our respect every day.
1326562973817692161 2020-11-12 00:30:33 +0800 <RSkarma1> Does this alarm anyone? Are we entering into a dictatorship if Trump refuses to step down?  He is replacing all of these people with loyalists during a presidential transition. WHY? And what does it mean for Biden stepping in on Jan. 20?

1326541094943813633 2020-11-11 23:03:37 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump YOU ALREADY LOST YOU PATHETIC LITTLE MAN!! GET OVER IT!!!
1326537917020266497 2020-11-11 22:50:59 +0800 <RSkarma1> @roisin_allsopp @shimpokh @EricTrump How can you honestly say that when Biden's ahead with the popular vote by 5 mil votes?  Do you seriously think that they are all fraudulent? Come back to reality here. Just because Trump SAYS he won, doesn't make it so. The numbers prove differently.
1326535575948709888 2020-11-11 22:41:41 +0800 <RSkarma1> I can't wait to see how fast Trump turns against people as they slowly come out and and disagree publicly with his current tantrum. He only likes the people who back him 100%. If you disagree with him in any way, he will turn on you like a cornered animal
1326524859665485826 2020-11-11 21:59:06 +0800 <RSkarma1> @SuAZ15639 @JamesOKeefeIII I could say the same about you. LOL

1326523573058613248 2020-11-11 21:54:00 +0800 <RSkarma1> @marceelias Trump is certainly keeping you busy.  We appreciate your work and also thank you for keeping us updated.
1326363301610184705 2020-11-11 11:17:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JamesOKeefeIII Not anymore because he recanted his story. But I would hope that anyone that donated money to that account is going to be reimbursed.

1326357144938090496 2020-11-11 10:52:40 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DanRather @RadioAndySXM I think before anything can happen, Trump needs to concede and get out of the White House. It's going to be bad enought with him recruiting people on Twitter. But we can't begin to heal with him spreading lies and mistrust.
1326355769223213056 2020-11-11 10:47:12 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump Well that should get a lot of people to lie for you.
1326349107456339969 2020-11-11 10:20:44 +0800 <RSkarma1> @richardmarx Not sleeping well. Stressed. Trying to avoid the news but not really succeeding. And you?
1326341920159903744 2020-11-11 09:52:10 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Scrilana369 @Tommyyob @ggreenwald The only reason you don't trust any news channels is because Trump told you not to. There was never fake news before Trump. He doesn't like anyone that reports anything negative about him. THAT'S why he has said it's"fake news". Never Fox. They cater to him.
1326340661658996736 2020-11-11 09:47:10 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Scrilana369 @Tommyyob @ggreenwald Certainly not Fox. I've actually been watching both Fox AND CNN to get both sides.

1326319618110189569 2020-11-11 08:23:33 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Tommyyob @ggreenwald There is no proof, which is why legitimate news channels are not reporting the story. Fox is pretty much a propaganda network and greatly exaggerates the truth and most of the time only give their opinion, not facts.
1326318902360543234 2020-11-11 08:20:42 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Tommyyob @ggreenwald So far, the court has thrown out the cases.
1326318500542107648 2020-11-11 08:19:06 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews Why? Because Fox is the only station that will repeat your BS? They aren't a news channel. They are a Propaganda network.

I guess I kind of already knew that, but still, they just keep spreading lies and people actually believe them. It's just unbelievable. I'll be glad when it's over.
1326258785632055305 2020-11-11 04:21:49 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ArielOfficial I want a front row seat on that day!! I think it should be televised after all of this crap that he is putting everyone through, so that we can all have a front row seat!! I would even pay to watch!!
1326255168615223299 2020-11-11 04:07:27 +0800 <RSkarma1> Nice to hear a calm and thoughtful president speak finally. Amidst all of this, he is trying to be tactful and thoughtful about the words that he says.
1326254856722640905 2020-11-11 04:06:13 +0800 <RSkarma1> @thekjohnston It really is calming and reassuring to hear a president speak who is trying to be tactful and who is thoughtful about the words he says. And he is right when he says that this is only going to be damaging to Trumps pathetic legacy as a sore loser.

How did this government ever get to this point.  These people who support Trump don't realize how our whole Democracy is in danger. They just follow their messiah mindlessly.
1326232410481061889 2020-11-11 02:37:01 +0800 <RSkarma1> You people who support Trump don't realize that they are going to take all of our rights away right under our nose, and with YOUR support!! Trump is a crazy and dangerous dictator wannabe and you are crazy to think otherwise.
1326232094268416000 2020-11-11 02:35:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> @VerityPace @JoshNBCNews That's exactly what it sounds like to me.  And he said it with a F**king smile on his face!!
1326231768895279104 2020-11-11 02:34:28 +0800 <RSkarma1> @therecount @JoshNBCNews My hatred for these people knows no end! The way he smirks when he says that it will be smooth transition for Trump. This is a dictatorship!! They had this planned all along. They are going to raise questions of Nat'l Security so it goes to the Supreme Court.
1326230022991048705 2020-11-11 02:27:32 +0800 <RSkarma1> Our current president is a DISGRACE!!!

1326221448202096646 2020-11-11 01:53:27 +0800 <RSkarma1> @thekjohnston Is this going to become the new normal. Donald Trump is the worst example ever of how to graciously step aside when the people have spoken. What is going on in our country that we can allow this kind of behavior from ELECTED officials once they're terminated?
1326209231322816517 2020-11-11 01:04:55 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DannyDelano5 Thank you for the reassurance. I think I've just been reading so many things &amp; watching so much news that my mind is reeling by the time I go to bed. You're right, though. OUR votes will prevail. Trump is always trying to exert power that he doesn't have.
1326189133266620417 2020-11-10 23:45:03 +0800 <RSkarma1> I have been losing sleep worrying about what is going to happen. Last night, even when I did sleep, my dreams involved voting and winning &amp; losing. I want to just quit the news and social media until it's over, but I can't. Is anyone else having this problem?
1326187627486310401 2020-11-10 23:39:04 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump You are an embarrassment to yourself and to our country. Your behavior proves just how little you care about the United States. You are trying to tear down this Democracy just to save your own ego from being bruised. You are a sad and pathetic little man.
1326180957121110016 2020-11-10 23:12:34 +0800 <RSkarma1> @RealDavidRush That's an interesting thought. Nothing would surprise me from the Trump camp.
1326173178218033157 2020-11-10 22:41:39 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JarrettBellini I say we order a recount of the votes that elected this asshole into office again.
1326169463071399937 2020-11-10 22:26:53 +0800 <RSkarma1> @LawLady2019 @stevenportnoy Because Trump can't win without PA. So he is trying to do everything he can even if it means that anyone who mailed in a vote won't be counted. Great move on Democracy, Trump.
1326153426863071232 2020-11-10 21:23:10 +0800 <RSkarma1> He can't just do that, can he?
1326011768741703680 2020-11-10 12:00:16 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DonaldJTrumpJr Not sure what "a lot" means in YOUR book but so far 10 cases dismissed and we haven't seen shit for evidence you little asshole. I wish you &amp; your family would just accept the fact that daddy lost &amp; get the fuck out of the White House. I'm so sick of you all.
1326000405894098945 2020-11-10 11:15:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> @MickMulvaney Biden does not need Arizona. Even if Trump were to get the AZ votes, it does not make any difference. Trump is just humiliating himself more by refusing to concede. Yes the votes all need to be counted. He still lost.
1325986312952885251 2020-11-10 10:19:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> @whalesorg @Rachelch35 I could watch this for hours.

LOL  December 14 for the electoral college and I think the inauguration is Jan. 20 or around there. I just can't wait for the whole thing to be over &amp; for Biden to officially be President
1325905408528183303 2020-11-10 04:57:38 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ddale8 In his warped mind, no matter what the results prove, he is not going to admit that he was beaten fair and square. His ego and narcissism are beyond repair. I kind of wish he would just run away to another country. In prison, there's always a chance of parole

Once Trump is out of the White House, I have a feeling that there will be all sorts of people coming out revealing deals that were made. He usually doesn't make good on his business deals.

I suppose that he will be tweeting stories from the "National Enquirer" and "Star" magazine next. He must be having a hard time finding legit stories in their favor.

1325240901959102466 2020-11-08 08:57:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> Am I on Twitter? I haven't seen 5 million tweets from @realDonaldTrump . Finally he has nothing to say!!
1325240512480210949 2020-11-08 08:55:34 +0800 <RSkarma1> @marceelias She has good reason to be. Thank you for everything that you have done and also for the fights ahead.
1325240095562149888 2020-11-08 08:53:55 +0800 <RSkarma1> @johncusack Yes. Please.
1325234600776511493 2020-11-08 08:32:05 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar I think that they will when it's time for Trump to leave. That's the only way they are going to be able to get him OUT!
1325234207996710912 2020-11-08 08:30:31 +0800 <RSkarma1> @CNNPR @ddale8 @FoxNews Yes you did. I heard it. Almost everyone had masks on but there were a few who didn't. But you guys did absolutely discuss this and were concerned.
1325233757721423872 2020-11-08 08:28:44 +0800 <RSkarma1> @OmarJimenez @ddale8 Yes they did. They also said that they were glad that most people were wearing masks. There were a few that I saw that weren't. But don't even TRY to say that they weren't concerned about people gathering like this.
1325233050393993221 2020-11-08 08:25:55 +0800 <RSkarma1> @clayaiken I felt the same way. Follow me please. I loved you as a performer but since this election has started, I also love your politics. Can I get a follow? Today is a great day for our country. Have a wonderful night.
1325217224999710724 2020-11-08 07:23:02 +0800 <RSkarma1> @thejtlewis @Ginlefebvre Trump is, for about 20-30 years
1325216879812747264 2020-11-08 07:21:40 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/wHxhDWLOb6
1325216168286834688 2020-11-08 07:18:50 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DonaldJTrumpJr Sounds like that pisses you off.
1325215962623336448 2020-11-08 07:18:01 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump And yet you lost. Get over it.
1325215288560791553 2020-11-08 07:15:20 +0800 <RSkarma1> I just want to thank everyone from countries other than The United States for standing by us and letting us know that you are in our corner. We appreciate you. #LetTheHealingBegin
1325214359484727298 2020-11-08 07:11:39 +0800 <RSkarma1> @sarahslean @BurlingtonPAC Beautiful name and you'll be able to tell one day just why you gave her that name. It's very fitting. I can't wait until 8:00 either. Have a wonderful evening.
1325175131799425025 2020-11-08 04:35:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar @sharkthang Just turned it up &amp; heard the actual song. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
1325174718220021768 2020-11-08 04:34:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> @sharkthang @brianrayguitar OMG!! I just turned the music up. üòÇüòÇüòÇ This is hilarious!!
1325174438443298816 2020-11-08 04:33:01 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar @sharkthang I'm so glad we won't be subjected to his funky little "dance" anymore, as entertaining as it was.
1325134266456543233 2020-11-08 01:53:23 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar Thank God!! My first thought was, NOW what are we gonna do?" üòÇüòÇ But I'm welcoming the normal tweeted conversations, recipes and music discussions and animal videos.
1325127601766109188 2020-11-08 01:26:54 +0800 <RSkarma1> I am so happy today! I know the next couple of months will not be easy because I'm sure that Trump will not go gently into the night. But we are going to have a President that truly cares about us. And one that does not attack anyone who disagrees with him. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
1325118992437174272 2020-11-08 00:52:41 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JarrettBellini Trump missed it while he was GOLFING!! How fitting is THAT??
1325118363178160130 2020-11-08 00:50:11 +0800 <RSkarma1> @itsJeffTiedrich Ha! I forgot that he just left for the golf course awhile ago. Bet this news is going to screw up his game.
1325117963180118016 2020-11-08 00:48:36 +0800 <RSkarma1> Congratulations President elect Joe Biden and Vice President Elect Kamala Harris
1325116306371325955 2020-11-08 00:42:01 +0800 <RSkarma1> @mmpadellan @phaverkamp1 It was so heartfelt and he made me cry.

1325112916962578432 2020-11-08 00:28:33 +0800 <RSkarma1> @marceelias Thank you for everything you have done.
1325112631674408967 2020-11-08 00:27:25 +0800 <RSkarma1> IT FINALLY HAS HAPPENED. CONGRATULATIONS PRESIDENT ELECT BIDEN AND VICE PRESIDENT ELECT HARRIS.
1325112277759102981 2020-11-08 00:26:01 +0800 <RSkarma1> CNN just announced that Joe Biden is the projected President elect!!! The just called PA for him.
1325086618475229185 2020-11-07 22:44:03 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Ginlefebvre @josepheschmitz @newsmax Name-calling is so classy.
1324935095585820673 2020-11-07 12:41:57 +0800 <RSkarma1> @josepheschmitz @Ginlefebvre @newsmax  https://t.co/mfBts5XzTt
1324931666268344320 2020-11-07 12:28:19 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DonaldJTrumpJr You keep tweeting about fraud but have no proof so drop it! You're really annoying and you're getting on our nerves. Stop spreading lies and start packing.
1324925398359154688 2020-11-07 12:03:25 +0800 <RSkarma1> @joshscampbell @johncusack @JoeBiden Isn't it nice to hear someone speak without attacking, name calling or spewing hatred and encouraging division? I'll be able to sleep well.
1324924855142191104 2020-11-07 12:01:16 +0800 <RSkarma1> @theyearofelan Hell yes!
1324924637088714752 2020-11-07 12:00:24 +0800 <RSkarma1> @johncusack I feel like I'll finally be able to get a good nights sleep. It was so nice to hear a calm and positive speech for once.
1324924214281969671 2020-11-07 11:58:43 +0800 <RSkarma1> @benhiggi Very classy and gracious. May he RIP.
1324921967162630145 2020-11-07 11:49:47 +0800 <RSkarma1> @simplysarah25 @deanie_babies I still love Obama. Michelle too. They are just such a wonderful couple. He was one of my favorite presidents. Jimmy Carter was my other favorite ( my first vote at 18 years old)
1324921417805271046 2020-11-07 11:47:36 +0800 <RSkarma1> @deanie_babies This is class. A certain someone could take direction from John McCain here, may he RIP.
1324890399115268096 2020-11-07 09:44:21 +0800 <RSkarma1> @deanie_babies I'm with you on every account.
1324885999940460544 2020-11-07 09:26:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> @marceelias This is his M.O. It's ALWAYS someone elses fault. Never his. Always someone else to blame. Never himself.
1324885691172593665 2020-11-07 09:25:38 +0800 <RSkarma1> @marceelias üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
1324884196515524609 2020-11-07 09:19:42 +0800 <RSkarma1> @TheRickWilson @AussiePunter32 I'd like that too but they are still counting votes and I think every vote needs to be counted before they call it.
1324880747400982529 2020-11-07 09:05:59 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DrGJackBrown Like We've Never Seen
1324879702721515521 2020-11-07 09:01:50 +0800 <RSkarma1> @susanzh77455188 @realDonaldTrump WTF are you talking about? Democrats ARE Americans you twit!! You had better go back to school Ms. PhD.
1324878444430323713 2020-11-07 08:56:50 +0800 <RSkarma1> @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump I swear he just doesn't seem to comprehend that fact. Unless he planned on doing this all along, hence, the reason for telling his voters not to vote by mail knowing the mail ins would be counted last and he could claim fraud.
1324877862642520064 2020-11-07 08:54:32 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump IT'S BECAUSE YOU TOLD YOUR FOLLOWERS NOT TO VOTE BY MAIL. THEY VOTED IN PERSON. THOSE WERE COUNTED FIRST. WE VOTED BY MAIL FOR BIDEN. THOSE WERE COUNTED LAST. WTF IS WRONG YOU YOU? YOU'RE TOO STUPID TO BE PRESIDENT!!
1324871737109057537 2020-11-07 08:30:11 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar And once this is over, we need to handle the results with humility and not create more seperation between us all. A lot of damage has been done in 4 years and a lot of healing is needed in our country.
1324823729059352576 2020-11-07 05:19:25 +0800 <RSkarma1> @RickSmithShow To get more viewers and high ratings.  It sucks!!
1324793953544249346 2020-11-07 03:21:06 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump  Here is another example of how it's done, just in case you needed some instruction.
1324793349195313153 2020-11-07 03:18:42 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump  THIS is how you do it.
1324792612256157697 2020-11-07 03:15:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> @SusanSarandon This is love of country and also shows class. We are all Americans and whether you are a democrat or republican, no president should EVER try to divide us.
1324773949880868870 2020-11-07 02:01:37 +0800 <RSkarma1> My heart is smiling right now. This is the best thing I have seen in a long time. ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç
1324773428881219589 2020-11-07 01:59:33 +0800 <RSkarma1> @thekjohnston My heart is smiling for the first time in 4 years. ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç
1324769842780606465 2020-11-07 01:45:18 +0800 <RSkarma1> @tired_red @TrumpVoterWTF @realDonaldTrump Joe Biden is NOT Radical Left.
1324769482296958977 2020-11-07 01:43:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar I agree 100%.
1324745637750079489 2020-11-07 00:09:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> @BlueSt0rmRising Exactly.
1324745209859760129 2020-11-07 00:07:25 +0800 <RSkarma1> @emzarcher Hell no. That isn't in his nature. No responsibility, no apology and no words to Biden.
1324742123669913601 2020-11-06 23:55:09 +0800 <RSkarma1> @SkepBy @I_amBlueJay I feel the same way. I don't think that we will ever see Trump stop spreading lies, and threatening lawsuits. I don't want to see us become what they have been though. I would like to think that we can be better than that. There is much healing to be done.
1324741568801157122 2020-11-06 23:52:57 +0800 <RSkarma1> @I_amBlueJay If Trump was being humble about losing and congratulated Biden, I would say, absolutely. But I have a feeling that we are going to still be seeing threats, law suits, and lies until this is completely over. I do think that we should avoid fueling the fire
1324737216355176448 2020-11-06 23:35:39 +0800 <RSkarma1> @tracypierceall1 @clayaiken We can't become what they have been. 2 wrongs do not make a right.
1324732173245648896 2020-11-06 23:15:37 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump @Varneyco @FoxBusiness I think you're projecting again. Seems to me that YOU and YOUR FAMILY are the ones with the lack of integrity here. You're just bashing any state or people who aren't in your favor. Time for you to pack your bags little man.
1324726731673133056 2020-11-06 22:53:59 +0800 <RSkarma1> @RickSmithShow Best day ever!!!!
1324721550252216321 2020-11-06 22:33:24 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DonaldJTrumpJr Absolutely. Just because your dad's followers were louder and didn't give a rats ass about spreading COVID at rallies, doesn't mean squat. WE are the silent majority, son. Deal with it!
1324713712872235008 2020-11-06 22:02:15 +0800 <RSkarma1> Biden has the lead in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia. It's a narrow lead but he doesn't need all 3 to win this!!
1324704455120588800 2020-11-06 21:25:28 +0800 <RSkarma1> Uriah Heep‚Äôs Ken Hensley Dies at 75  https://t.co/4lUII2yAlY via @Yahoo  Your album Proud Words On A Dusty Shelf was and is one of my favorite albums ever (and it isn't even mentioned in this article) RIP
1324556814667698176 2020-11-06 11:38:48 +0800 <RSkarma1> @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump He thinks saying it, makes it so. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
1324543348481413120 2020-11-06 10:45:17 +0800 <RSkarma1> THIS IS HOW DEMOCRACY WORKS
1324541340928139264 2020-11-06 10:37:19 +0800 <RSkarma1> @joelockhart @dragons_loot That's how I feel about it too. Not doing anything to stop it is just as bad as participating in it. Who will be the brave ones to stand up and tell this president (and I use that ter loosely) that enough is enough? No more lies. Step down.
1324530938366316549 2020-11-06 09:55:58 +0800 <RSkarma1> @SamGiud16 I'm just glad "he was even better than I expected". Lol

1324529637612048388 2020-11-06 09:50:48 +0800 <RSkarma1> I think he's thinking the show is gonna just go on. NOT that he's gonna be expected to propose.  #TheBachelorette
1324527350151843840 2020-11-06 09:41:43 +0800 <RSkarma1> I'm glad you're in love Clare. Buh bye now. #TheBachelorette
1324526685711118337 2020-11-06 09:39:05 +0800 <RSkarma1> @laurrstar Me too. It's well needed and well deserved.
1324525021952380930 2020-11-06 09:32:28 +0800 <RSkarma1> @EricTrump There IS no election fraud. There is no proof of anything illegal going on. Your dad ( and apparently the rest of your family) are bad losers. IF YOU HAVE NO PROOF, YOU CANNOT CALL FRAUD!! STOP THE LYING.
1324523641669910528 2020-11-06 09:26:59 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JoeBiden Thank you for your calm demeanor throughout the past few days. You are going to make a wonderful President.
1324514103642247173 2020-11-06 08:49:05 +0800 <RSkarma1> @marceelias I'm hoping that some of them will speak out and stand up to Trump. He certainly is not making the Republican party look good. I believe that doing nothing is just as bad as participating and supporting the lies. He's trying to destroy our democracy
1324510840364609541 2020-11-06 08:36:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> @FOX2News That was such a racial statement, and it was not surprising to hear HIM say that. I give props to everyone in Detroit &amp; Philly for getting their votes out there so that their voices will be heard. Trump is a racist. We all know that!
1324510308082327552 2020-11-06 08:34:00 +0800 <RSkarma1> @NicholsUprising @johncusack I thought that I heard the governor speak and say that it's all being done properly and that there is no cheating going on there.
1324509909547945984 2020-11-06 08:32:25 +0800 <RSkarma1> @davelevinthal @Clustrephunk @RickSantorum @CNN @realDonaldTrump I was happy to hear @RickSantorum say that. It's time for the Republicans who surround Trump begin speaking out about this because it's making you all look bad when you stand by and watch and do nothing.
1324504804765409280 2020-11-06 08:12:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> Why would judges have to rule when the votes are being counted? Why do people believe him? He is making our country look like a joke. He is a pathetic little man.
1324504083940691971 2020-11-06 08:09:16 +0800 <RSkarma1> I have never in my life heard a president talk so hatefully about democrats. He is propagating hatred and violence and it's going to get worse. He is an evil piece of üí©
1324496529135149056 2020-11-06 07:39:15 +0800 <RSkarma1> @johncusack @johnkruzel If you mean popular vote I'm watching right now. Biden: 72,693,454.  Trump: 68,818,339
1324465729274523651 2020-11-06 05:36:51 +0800 <RSkarma1> @mandalynngill @court_larrivey Wow!! Well, I think we have that one right!! And his singing voice SOUNDS like his speaking voice and his character isn't a very tall guy or very big.
1324462889768505346 2020-11-06 05:25:34 +0800 <RSkarma1> @court_larrivey @mandalynngill I must have missed that clue.  I was talking to my son and telling him to come and watch. But absolutely, yes. It's got to be him!!
1324461595964149766 2020-11-06 05:20:26 +0800 <RSkarma1> @BadgerinFlorida @longhorn_jen @TheNewDeal And it IS very possible that this was a HUGE job and maybe they weren't prepared to count that many votes. This was the most votes that have ever been mailed in in history. It IS a sizeable task and takes time.
1324461202035146753 2020-11-06 05:18:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> @BadgerinFlorida @longhorn_jen @TheNewDeal Somehow, I don't think that our answers would be the same.  Counting ALL of the ballots is a part of the process. Trump was calling to stop counting where he was winning and at the same time saying that there were missing ballots where he was losing.
1324458727907483648 2020-11-06 05:09:02 +0800 <RSkarma1> @longhorn_jen @BadgerinFlorida @TheNewDeal  https://t.co/NtLIMBPAT6
1324453435438206977 2020-11-06 04:48:00 +0800 <RSkarma1> @BadgerinFlorida @TheNewDeal BS. Just like all the other BS that's being thrown around.  Trump is the one that is leading the pack in lies. Why do you think that his tweets keep getting taken down? But if you're a follower, you won't listen to reason anyway, so I will not argue about it.
1324448772777279491 2020-11-06 04:29:29 +0800 <RSkarma1> @EricTrump Why is it such a surprise that Wayne County came out and voted for Biden? That's just how badly the people of Detroit want your daddy fired!!  They came out like never before for Joe Biden and I'm proud that they did!!
1324429304982343685 2020-11-06 03:12:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar  I don't know if the whole thread will show but here is what I saw.
1324429078297038851 2020-11-06 03:11:13 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar I tweeted something earlier that I saw where there was an explanation of what is going on.
1324424669097844736 2020-11-06 02:53:42 +0800 <RSkarma1> In case anyone doesn't remember this. She hit it spot on.

Thank YOU for tolerating my obsessive retweeting of your obsessive tweeting. ü§£ü§£ü§£ Hopefully, once this is over, we can tweet about your music or vacations or just nice normal life in general.

1324410115735302149 2020-11-06 01:55:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> @johncusack Exactly. These lawsuits are going to come to nothing but a waste of time.  He has based his whole business career on lawsuits. It's what he does best if he doesn't get what he wants.  He cares nothing about Democracy.
1324403264461414403 2020-11-06 01:28:39 +0800 <RSkarma1> @EricTrump After seeing that fake "ballot burning" tweet that you posted, I don't believe anything from you anymore (not that I actually did before)
1324398939114770437 2020-11-06 01:11:27 +0800 <RSkarma1> @kirs2016 @JoshNBCNews Not true. You are still a resident for that 45 days before the election.
1324398775251718144 2020-11-06 01:10:48 +0800 <RSkarma1> @330ohiofan @MrMikeD42 @JoshNBCNews That's how I read this. It doesn't say that you have to actually BE in Nevada for a whole 45 days before an election. Once again, they are grasping at straws.
1324397257437945858 2020-11-06 01:04:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Chris19317 @davidcicilline @brianrayguitar He says what he thinks, true or not, and they mindlessly think it. He tells them to do something, they do it without question.
1324396905154174976 2020-11-06 01:03:22 +0800 <RSkarma1> PLEASE READ THIS THREAD IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ALLEGHENY COUNTY VOTES NOT BEING COUNTED YET.
1324392525004705794 2020-11-06 00:45:58 +0800 <RSkarma1> @RaceFan348 @SandDollar04 @EricTrump How do you know that was a ballot and not the mailer that it came in?  This still doesn't prove anything. You just keep listening to the Trump family. Although it depends which state your in. They say "Count the ballots" in some and "stop counting" in others.
1324391879459414016 2020-11-06 00:43:24 +0800 <RSkarma1> @RaceFan348 @SandDollar04 @EricTrump I didn't see anyone throwing anything away. All I saw was a guy getting frustrated about something.  This proves NOTHING!!
1324391641860419584 2020-11-06 00:42:28 +0800 <RSkarma1> @nuggetmommy @EricTrump Exactly!! I can't believe that they actually don't realize how CRAZY this makes them look!! Ya can't have it both ways!!
1324391380072992769 2020-11-06 00:41:25 +0800 <RSkarma1> @RaceFan348 @SandDollar04 @EricTrump Oh please DO!!! If there was actually proof that someone was throwing valid ballots away, don't you think someone would have stepped in already.  You are just grasping at straws.
1324390840228302849 2020-11-06 00:39:16 +0800 <RSkarma1> @EricTrump OMG!!! Will you DROP IT ALREADY???  Biden already won Michigan and Wisconsin so stop beating that dead horse. PA is still not finished and your dad is suing that state which, so far, has him winning. ü§£ü§£ü§£ Your family is NUTS!!!
1324390301805563912 2020-11-06 00:37:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Chris19317 @davidcicilline @brianrayguitar They do. It's just amazing to me that there are so many gullible people in this country. Or maybe it's just people that like to follow the crowd or be a part of something. But wow! I sure wouldn't choose HIM to take my orders from, which is what they do.
1324384676484648960 2020-11-06 00:14:47 +0800 <RSkarma1> Thank you. Keep up the great work you are doing!!
1324384293536309249 2020-11-06 00:13:16 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump But wait!! Is that one of the states that you are suing? And are we continuing the vote count there or is that one of the states where you DON'T want the votes to be counted? I'm kind of confused because you can't have it both ways.
1324371599257145344 2020-11-05 23:22:49 +0800 <RSkarma1> @emzarcher The votes will count. The votes had to be received before 7 pm on Nov. 3. They are not going to win. All of Trumps lawsuits don't mean squat. He just sits waiting to see if the count gets close and then sues that state? He is a joke! Stalling the inevitable.
1324363831888535553 2020-11-05 22:51:57 +0800 <RSkarma1> IMPORTANT!!!
1324357881597206535 2020-11-05 22:28:19 +0800 <RSkarma1> Dems demand Twitter suspend Trump's account until all ballots counted  https://t.co/xw35tpe54r  He needs to be stopped from tweeting all of the lies. He is only creating more hatred and division during this election.
1324344543425290240 2020-11-05 21:35:18 +0800 <RSkarma1> @daltonharris Trump is the epitome of everything that I hate in this world. There is no place in this world for racism, bigotry, hatred and a person who calls for violence instead of understanding. He has done enough damage over these last 4 years.
1324343742518726656 2020-11-05 21:32:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> @MeliMels99 I know. I was pretty disappointed too. But they have a lot of votes to count.
1324341545361965056 2020-11-05 21:23:24 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ginabunzz Got it and read it. Wow! Crazy but it makes sense. Thank you.
1324188279315595265 2020-11-05 11:14:22 +0800 <RSkarma1> @WandaTyler @donnyosmond I think the broccoli is Robert DiNiro.
1324187831074541568 2020-11-05 11:12:35 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump Because your supporters were too afraid to mail in votes because YOU told them it wasn't safe. So now, the mail in votes are being counted, which are probably predominantly Biden votes. God, dude, do we have to explain EVERYTHING to you?
1324187084106727425 2020-11-05 11:09:37 +0800 <RSkarma1> @clayaiken üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
1324186790866128897 2020-11-05 11:08:27 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Robo1224 @coachcook44 @JamesOKeefeIII @Project_Veritas So you don't trust the voting system when your guy is losing, but it's not questioned if he's winning. Voting has always been done this way, but because Trump says it's bad, suddenly it's bad. There was no "fake" news until him either. You're all nuts!
1324181689988489217 2020-11-05 10:48:11 +0800 <RSkarma1> @idiots_sick @dark1025 @kahnblond @MariaBartiromo @EricTrump @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness That's why the majority of mail in votes are Biden votes. Because WE were trying to stay safe by voting absentee. Trump convinced you all that mail in wasn't safe so you all showed up in person. Those were counted first so Trump was ahead at first.

1324171242925117440 2020-11-05 10:06:40 +0800 <RSkarma1> @edgyvegetable @bobsaget My guess WAS Obama. üòÜ
1324169639002312705 2020-11-05 10:00:18 +0800 <RSkarma1> @MaskedSingerFOX Barack Obama. üòÜ
1324168166625452035 2020-11-05 09:54:27 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JennyMcCarthy It's Robert DeNiro. He was in the movie Casino and also Goodfellas.
1324167713984491521 2020-11-05 09:52:39 +0800 <RSkarma1> @MaskedSingerFOX Robert DiNiro was in the movie Casino and also Goodfellas
1324166682714218498 2020-11-05 09:48:33 +0800 <RSkarma1> @SasquatchWade @MaskedSingerFOX I guessed Robert Deniro too.
1324166530809081856 2020-11-05 09:47:57 +0800 <RSkarma1> @MaskedSingerFOX Robert Deniro It totally sounds like him
1324156773050273794 2020-11-05 09:09:10 +0800 <RSkarma1> @marceelias I think he's stalling. Trying to delay the inevitable.

1324086423482486785 2020-11-05 04:29:38 +0800 <RSkarma1> @EricTrump You do realize that the voter turnout was so high because people cannot stand another 4 years of your daddy in office. The only house that we want to vote him into, is the BIG HOUSE. Voters came out more than ever because your dad is such a horrible president
1324085858929168390 2020-11-05 04:27:23 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DrEricDing @MeliMels99  https://t.co/cVeBAJIRSx

1324075340629745668 2020-11-05 03:45:35 +0800 <RSkarma1> Trumps Twitter account needs to be suspended before he starts tweeting out orders as well as lies.
1324075163600756743 2020-11-05 03:44:53 +0800 <RSkarma1> @davidcicilline @brianrayguitar I agree. His account needs to be suspended. He is going to incite some kind of violence, I'm sure, once this thing is final and for Twitter to wait until he does that before deleting the tweet, will be too late. People DO what that maniac says. Suspend him!!
1324074346831400964 2020-11-05 03:41:39 +0800 <RSkarma1> @SusanSaintsFan @CNNPolitics @cnnbrk üêèüêèüêèüêèüêèüêèüêèTrump said it, so it MUST be so. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
1324073725017337856 2020-11-05 03:39:10 +0800 <RSkarma1> @PatriotNews8 @CNNPolitics The only reason you think that is so, is because Donald Trump told you it's so. You will believe anything he says as fact. üêèüêèüêèüêèüêè You all consider him the new messiah or something and don't ever doubt a word that he says, even when it's proven to be a lie
1324051168809701376 2020-11-05 02:09:32 +0800 <RSkarma1> @kevinnichols120 @WSJ He's desperate because he knows if he can't fight the ruling on the votes, and he loses, he WILL be going to prison. And I can only say, "IT'S ABOUT TIME!"
1324050669234540544 2020-11-05 02:07:33 +0800 <RSkarma1> @BobbyAxelcoin @WSJ ü§£ü§£ü§£
1324040953804529665 2020-11-05 01:28:57 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump They are doing what they are supposed to be doing. Counting Votes. Now, you might think that that is UNAMERICAN, but that's how it works buddy!! If those votes are catching up to yours, it's because absentee ballots were cast against you. Get it?
1324037462235271169 2020-11-05 01:15:05 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ddale8 He is something else. "Finding" votes?  He seriously doesn't get how this works. LOL
1324012723911446528 2020-11-04 23:36:47 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ididseerussia @ddale8 I don't even know the people that made all of the comments. It was on the page of a news broadcasters FB page. I'm not replying anymore. I said what I said and they can argue all they want. I'm not taking the bait. LOL
1323997151710584837 2020-11-04 22:34:54 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ddale8 I just had many people on my Facebook page say that because Biden is ahead in MI &amp; WI, it's voter fraud, just like when Obama won. ü§£ü§£ü§£ So it's only voter fraud when a Democrat wins. ü§£ Either people have faith in the voting system or they don't, PERIOD.
1323990683426934785 2020-11-04 22:09:12 +0800 <RSkarma1> I'm praying like I've never prayed before. üôèüôèüôè I don't think I can take another 4 years of Trump.
1323808450762149890 2020-11-04 10:05:04 +0800 <RSkarma1> If Donald Trump becomes president, we will be a country where sick and elderly people die every day from Covid and he doesn't even care. He is thinning the population. Next what will it be? He cares about NO ONE!!
1323807432284528640 2020-11-04 10:01:01 +0800 <RSkarma1> @theyearofelan I have no sobriety at this point.
1323807172111847424 2020-11-04 09:59:59 +0800 <RSkarma1> @EricTrump If he wins, you will see in the next 4 years what he does to all of us. It's not going to be pretty. He lies. If you don't get that, then God help us.
1323806241337024518 2020-11-04 09:56:17 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Carla_Baron @Boston1050 My heart is going to break for America if Joe Biden doesn't win. You have kept me believing in the goodness of our American people. I am putting every affirmation out there for him to win.

1323768136219459585 2020-11-04 07:24:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> @johnlegend @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Thank you for your words. I just pray that the American people want this racist, crazy guy out.
1323767704340340738 2020-11-04 07:23:09 +0800 <RSkarma1> @mdoolittle I tried to watch a little but geez, the voting isn't even finished. Their projections will drive us all nuts. I just can't even listen to the guessing games on the news channel. I'm just waiting to hear that Biden is going to be our new president.
1323703841523728384 2020-11-04 03:09:23 +0800 <RSkarma1> @richardmarx I wish he was someone that we could trust to actually keep that promise.  We don't want him here.

1323685319309512704 2020-11-04 01:55:47 +0800 <RSkarma1> @clayaiken Absolutely LOVED watching you grow and change on that show. You were my favorite for almost the entire season. My dad and I continued to be fans long after the show was over. I was surprised when you went into politics, but we need good people like you.
1323666349885894657 2020-11-04 00:40:25 +0800 <RSkarma1> @pulte I need $50.00 for medication and somehow my bank account is overdrawn by $1.57 so now I can't get my prescriptions.  I wondered if you might be able to help me. I feel so stupid for asking but I don't have anyone else to ask.

1323449261254676480 2020-11-03 10:17:47 +0800 <RSkarma1> Well said!!

1323366534618750979 2020-11-03 04:49:03 +0800 <RSkarma1> I think that we have more countries than just Scotland who can't believe what they are seeing. It's embarrassing.

1323365971235610624 2020-11-03 04:46:49 +0800 <RSkarma1> @MiaFarrow And Trump says that he has made America GREAT again?  Who would have ever thought that in America, fear from our Presidential election, would ever come to this? And this is all because our almost ex-president is a violent man who incites horrible behavior.
1323357103122194435 2020-11-03 04:11:34 +0800 <RSkarma1> We need to get this joker out of the White House. It's this stupid kind of talk that is making us the laughing stock of the rest of the world. What president gets up and starts saying how this opponent is "little" and he could "knock him over with a tap?"
1323353136191414274 2020-11-03 03:55:49 +0800 <RSkarma1> Come on my Michigan peeps and Wisconsin friends. #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica2020
1323078407215861762 2020-11-02 09:44:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> @clayaiken I hope and pray that this is how it turns out.
1323064830950023176 2020-11-02 08:50:11 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar They are so cute! Hope you all had a great Halloween.
1323034643260723200 2020-11-02 06:50:14 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump You're just sounding desperate now.
1322954697855172617 2020-11-02 01:32:33 +0800 <RSkarma1> Wow!
1322954493500313600 2020-11-02 01:31:45 +0800 <RSkarma1> @robreiner I swear, there isn't any truth that comes out of his mouth.
1322954241980379140 2020-11-02 01:30:45 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ddale8 He's like a 5th grade schoolyard bully.
1322921200063053827 2020-11-01 23:19:27 +0800 <RSkarma1> What a piece of shit! He should be arrested for inciting violence and endangering lives. How do these guys get away with this kind of thing?
1322915913797160960 2020-11-01 22:58:27 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump And YOU still haven't released your tax returns. So your point is....?
1322713598905487368 2020-11-01 09:34:31 +0800 <RSkarma1> @thedavidcrosby Your feelings about the President, the elections and what is going to happen to our country if Trump is elected again.
1322708656757051397 2020-11-01 09:14:53 +0800 <RSkarma1> @RoxannaHenzman @ddale8 I saw that. It is real. Damn.
1322708380209848321 2020-11-01 09:13:47 +0800 <RSkarma1> @grock1963 @ddale8 It sickens me.
1322707946401419264 2020-11-01 09:12:03 +0800 <RSkarma1> @kenolin1 @Rosie BRAINWASHED??
1322707652917534721 2020-11-01 09:10:53 +0800 <RSkarma1> @jdftweet You're lucky you aren't here. Wishing you love, health and love from the U.S.
1322706858294054912 2020-11-01 09:07:44 +0800 <RSkarma1> @irejoyyce @ddale8 I just keep praying that he will be gone after the ballots are all counted. I am not a big religious person but I have faith that there is no way that God woul let this evil man continue to lead this country. Trump needs to GO!
1322705785957289984 2020-11-01 09:03:28 +0800 <RSkarma1> @jdftweet @ddale8 I am afraid for anyone who is going against Trump. This is not our everyday election. Our lives depend on this.
1322705099504930816 2020-11-01 09:00:45 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ddale8 This just shows how Trumps people work. I am sickened by this. We are going to be living in a Communist country if he is elected again.
1322704625313742856 2020-11-01 08:58:51 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump @CheleFarley FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU! Did you have sex with her?
1322704071166464007 2020-11-01 08:56:39 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ddale8 Is this true? I'm not sure from the tweet.
1322703420311195648 2020-11-01 08:54:04 +0800 <RSkarma1> DONALD TRUMP KEEPS SAYING THAT HE PAID TAXES. PAID THEM AHEAD OF TIME. IF HE REALLY DID, DON'T YOU THINK HE WOULD BE SHOWING PROOF OF THAT RIGHT NOW? HE IS LYING. IF NOT, THEN WE NEED HIM TO PROVE IT!!!
1322702803475812353 2020-11-01 08:51:37 +0800 <RSkarma1> ALSO I WANT TO ASK YOU IF HE HAS SHOWN YOU A PLAN THAT DOES NOT CUT MEDICARE? If he has a plan, he sould be able to show it to us.
1322702253829083138 2020-11-01 08:49:26 +0800 <RSkarma1> I WANT TO ASK YOU, CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT TRUMP HAS AS A PLAN FOR YOUR HEALTH CARE??
1322701668581072896 2020-11-01 08:47:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump FUCK YOU DONALD TRUMP!! You have done everything to deflect attention from all of the unrest and division you have caused in this country. Wanna go down in history? You will. As the WORST PRESIDENT EVER IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY!!!
1322700729769971715 2020-11-01 08:43:23 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar If Trump loses and takes this to the Supreme Court, it's not going to be the outcome we need. I am so afraid right now that he is going to, somehow, take this election in his favor. Please give me some reassurance. It's just so horrible.
1322699580706836480 2020-11-01 08:38:49 +0800 <RSkarma1> @mdoolittle ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§Right back to you. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
1322699388901330944 2020-11-01 08:38:03 +0800 <RSkarma1> @italycm We need to pray that he goes. Our country can't take another 4 years of him. He is going to destroy us. We can't let him do that. My passion has always been music. But right now, it is getting our country back.
1322698404460433409 2020-11-01 08:34:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> @mdoolittle I love yours too. Within your music and within your heart.
1322675014588637184 2020-11-01 07:01:12 +0800 <RSkarma1> @mdoolittle I voted early because I wanted to make sure that it actually got there so I would still have time to do it again. This election is the most important one I have ever been a part of. It's about saving our country &amp; democracy. Sorry. Got carried away.
1322673676257472525 2020-11-01 06:55:53 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ChrisPawelski Of course. Because they are the ones not wearing masks. So they are going about their life like Trump tells them to, and getting others sick. I despise that man for what he stands for. And I also hate liars and he is the biggest one I've ever seen.
1322672843365191680 2020-11-01 06:52:34 +0800 <RSkarma1> @StefSilvano @SignoraBrunetti @ddale8 So do I. Some of them are my immediate family. I can't stop loving them, but my respect for them has gone right out the window.

1322671295302172673 2020-11-01 06:46:25 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ChrisPawelski As long as that man is able to, he will be encouraging people to gather with no masks. Him and his sons have been to Michigan numerous times in the past 2 weeks and I am afraid that this will be disastrous to our state. Yet they hat Whitmer for lockdowns. SMH
1322668279995998208 2020-11-01 06:34:26 +0800 <RSkarma1> My niece had a double lung transplant on 12/19/20. Her paternal grandparents are Trump ppl. They went to 2 rallies in Georgia &amp; NC no masks &amp; the grandpa walked into my sisters house without quarantining. She made him leave. These ppl don't care.
1322636837278670848 2020-11-01 04:29:30 +0800 <RSkarma1> @johncusack I just got on here and seriously, every other tweet is Trump. Wtf? Our president has nothing better to do than to sit and tweet on Twitter all day? He's pathetic.
1322369305602887682 2020-10-31 10:46:25 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump Still grasping at straws, aren't you? Anyone who has an ounce of sense knows you are full of shit.
1322357953475809281 2020-10-31 10:01:18 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Scaramucci @dragons_loot 100%  What the world needs now, is love, sweet love. And we need a president who actually cares about the people the he represents. The president is not someone who controls us. He should be someone who sets an example for us. THAT IS NOT DONALD TRUMP.
1322356800772079616 2020-10-31 09:56:44 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump What about the 500 children that you snatched from their parents you pathetic piece of shit?? And you don't even know, now, where the parents are while these children are in cages...but "taken very good care of". You fucking piece of shit! #Compassionwins
1322355447509196801 2020-10-31 09:51:21 +0800 <RSkarma1> @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump And Trump is trying to make Michigan the next one. And he won't be able to blame @GovWhitmer for that. I just wish he would just STOP coming here.
1322350311118352384 2020-10-31 09:30:56 +0800 <RSkarma1> @j_buchko Exactly. I have 2 brothers that hunt. We agree to disagree about it. But they use every part that they can and they only eat what they kill. I still don't really like it but I know how I feel.

1322345598419427334 2020-10-31 09:12:13 +0800 <RSkarma1> @johncusack Thank you so much John for getting your voice heard. I'm trying too, every day but no one hears me. I will just keep retweeting. It's all I can do. Love ya!
1322344474245320704 2020-10-31 09:07:45 +0800 <RSkarma1> @EricTrump Yep! Get that Covid spreading. That seems to be your mission in life.

1322343824216252422 2020-10-31 09:05:10 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Audaciously1DAF He is an asshole. He represents EVERYTHING that is WRONG with this country.
1322342261447950336 2020-10-31 08:58:57 +0800 <RSkarma1> @j_buchko It makes me sick. Anyone that doesn't respect animals and their place in this world sicken me. When you see how people treat animals, their true nature shows through.People who abuse animals and trophy hunters. There's a place in hell for you.
1322340979551162370 2020-10-31 08:53:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JoeBiden I just hope and pray that we will be set free from the nightmare of the last 4 years. What Trump has done to our country is a disgrace. We are the home of the free. NOT just home of those who agree with the president. Freedom of choice and speech.
1322338277643472896 2020-10-31 08:43:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Fucking ruined our country and created racial tension, unemployment and hatred in our country. Your dad is NOT a leader. He is a wannabe dictator. The American people want your family gone!!
1322337020396642307 2020-10-31 08:38:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> @EricTrump 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 RUINED OUR FUCKING COUNTRY YOU ASSHOLE!!!
1322336635472826368 2020-10-31 08:36:36 +0800 <RSkarma1> @EricTrump And you are fucking BRAGGING about that?? You guys are encouraging the spread of Covid. No other country has a leader doing this kind of shit! You make me SICK!
1322335379572314112 2020-10-31 08:31:36 +0800 <RSkarma1> So now Trump is comparing himself to Jesus Christ??? What next? He is GOD???

1322334171654692864 2020-10-31 08:26:48 +0800 <RSkarma1> @gretchenwhitmer Thank you for doing your best to keep Michigan safe. You are doing a great job. I just wish that we had a president that cared as much as you do. #BidenHarris2020
1322324370107342849 2020-10-31 07:47:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump Every vote should be counted. WTF? If you are behind, you will be changing that opinion.
1322323666403762177 2020-10-31 07:45:04 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Hiatt03 @skozm1426 @EricTrump I wasn't trying to be hilarious but thank you anyway.
1322270842659786752 2020-10-31 04:15:10 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump Biden wasn't in charge of this country for 47 years so I don't know why you keep saying that he did all of those things. He was not president! I hope that when you lose, you are so humiliated &amp; embarrassed that you go crawl into a hole never to be seen again.
1322269525564395520 2020-10-31 04:09:56 +0800 <RSkarma1> @theyearofelan If someone has cancer and their immune system is weak and they get Covid and die, it WAS Covid that caused their death.  Had they not gotten Covid they would still be fighting cancer. So where is the confusion over this? What an ass!!!
1322261135014461442 2020-10-31 03:36:35 +0800 <RSkarma1> @EricTrump I don't believe this for a second.  You guys keep saying that all these illegal activities are going on and yet there is never any proof. That ballot in the picture doesn't prove shit!! It's just another last ditch effort to try to change peoples minds.
1322251407915945985 2020-10-31 02:57:56 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump For you if you are making over $400,000 a year. That certainly does NOT apply to most of us.
1322236513682399233 2020-10-31 01:58:45 +0800 <RSkarma1> @italycm I agree with you 100%.  I just want them all to go away. And now Trump is headed back here to Michigan right now for yet another rally. And to Wisconsin which is a hot spot right now. He just shows no common sense or decency.
1322236045551960064 2020-10-31 01:56:53 +0800 <RSkarma1> @usualnurse1 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Thank you. They were lucky. It is very frustrating to hear people think that this is no big deal. They obviously haven't been affected by it yet. If people would just take a few weeks to wear masks and social distance and only go out when necessary..... smh.
1322225577642831873 2020-10-31 01:15:18 +0800 <RSkarma1> I'm sorry for retweeting this disgusting picture, but these disgusting human beings think that this is something to SMILE about?  I'd like to see them corralled in and then setting some leopards loose to see how far THEY get!! Pieces of shit!!!

1322206607669866497 2020-10-30 23:59:55 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ddale8 I'm thinking it must have been a nightmare to have to try to follow everything that he and his family said. I bet you'll be glad once there is someone else in office. LOL
1322196662794805248 2020-10-30 23:20:24 +0800 <RSkarma1> Trump and Trump Jr. are lying to you all. Covid is NOT going away anytime soon. Maybe once he is out of office, we can start getting our country healthy again.

We have the freedom to voice our opinion, although Trump tries to suppress that voice by crying "fake news" &amp; crucifying anyone that doesn't agree with him.
1322186380504608768 2020-10-30 22:39:32 +0800 <RSkarma1> @biglump007 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Those are the same reasons that we haven't been one of the hot spots until recently, after the Trumps made a thousand trips to Michigan holding rallies. He does not care about people in this country.
1322185532693188609 2020-10-30 22:36:10 +0800 <RSkarma1> @biglump007 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump And you enjoy your orange kool aid. I'm not arguing with anyone because I know that people have their minds made up.
1322185316502016003 2020-10-30 22:35:19 +0800 <RSkarma1> @biglump007 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Sorry if I made an assumption about you, personally, but here in Michigan, where I am from, people refuse to wear masks and social distance, but they hate Whitmer because she has tried to control the spread of Covid. Many said she deserved to be kidnapped.
1322183872478674946 2020-10-30 22:29:34 +0800 <RSkarma1> @usualnurse1 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump I hope that your friend is better soon. My daughter and her husband and my 2 grandsons just got out of quarantine. They all tested positive 2 1/2 weeks ago. My daughter and my one grandson were really sick. Son in law and other grandson had mild symptoms.
1322183053888937984 2020-10-30 22:26:19 +0800 <RSkarma1> @biglump007 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Typical Trump supporter answer.  It's amusing that the same people who support Trump and think like you do about our Governor and bitch about being locked down, are the same people who refuse to wear a mask and social distance. You can't have it both ways.
1322176001988874240 2020-10-30 21:58:18 +0800 <RSkarma1> @dibba_anna @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump With women in general. Governor Whitmer has done a great job here, despite having no backing from Trump whatsoever. She might not appear to be, but she IS a tough cookie. Although the Trump followers here absolutely hate her (of course, he encourages that)
1322175350214955008 2020-10-30 21:55:42 +0800 <RSkarma1> @usualnurse1 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump I live near Grand Blanc, in Flint Township, and I know that our hospitals up here are becoming heavy with Covid patients, as well. I believe, that Saginaw is having the same thing happen. This reckless behavior by our president is a disgrace. He needs to go!!
1322174314544656386 2020-10-30 21:51:36 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump You are a disgrace to this country. I hope that once you lose next week , you will either begin your journey to prison or that you high tail it out of the country, never to be heard from again. #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
1322172777126940673 2020-10-30 21:45:29 +0800 <RSkarma1> @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump He has done nothing but fight Governor Whitmer on everything. She has done a great job, and the Trumps, with all of their damn rallies here, are causing Covid cases to again be on the upswing.  He needs to GO!!! #MichiganForBiden

1321915854066458625 2020-10-30 04:44:34 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump So now you're going to try playing THAT card?  But you're correct, you DON'T play by the rules.  Rules of humanity.
1321913929765949446 2020-10-30 04:36:55 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump Judging from the very few people wearing masks in this picture, I would say Florida is losing. üò∑üò∑üò¢
1321892411291951106 2020-10-30 03:11:25 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ThatGirlLoups I know. It's scary not knowing what is going to happen. There definitely is a lot of healing that is needed.
1321888306632757248 2020-10-30 02:55:06 +0800 <RSkarma1> @NinaHKatz @ddale8 I feel exactly the same. Hate is normally not a word in my vocabulary (unless I'm saying that I hate bleu cheese or something LOL) but with him, I'm having very negative thoughts and feelings.
1321887036639485954 2020-10-30 02:50:03 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ThatGirlLoups Yes and I will be so happy when it is over.

1321655429563404288 2020-10-29 11:29:44 +0800 <RSkarma1> I just hope and pray that my grandsons can have a better world than what we are seeing right now. In 6 days we will have a better idea of what kind of world they'll have. One of compassion &amp; caring or one of hatred &amp; revenge. What do YOU want for your family?
1321651688336482304 2020-10-29 11:14:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> Fox news is talking about a regime. But they are not talking about Trump. You've got to be kidding me!
1321651245925437441 2020-10-29 11:13:06 +0800 <RSkarma1> @SawyerFrdrx Good night sweetie.
1321651168381206528 2020-10-29 11:12:48 +0800 <RSkarma1> So, in trying to see both sides and watching Fox news, I see that they ONLY show biased news that is Pro Trump. All of the other stations show both sides and let people make up their own mind. Try to watch Fox once and you will see.
1321649129492238336 2020-10-29 11:04:42 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Hoosiers1986 @Ginlefebvre @JoeBiden I DO give a crap about America. My whole life, I've never seen people drawing sides with so much hatred about anyone that doesn't agree with them. I grew up with no hatred toward anyone just because we don't agree. In Trumps world I am afraid. Your opinion?
1321644076488417280 2020-10-29 10:44:37 +0800 <RSkarma1> @kayleighmcenany @Ginlefebvre Ya know what? If there was a crime committed, he wouldn't be able to continue to run. Girl, you better run while you can because the second your boss is prosecuted, your ass is gonna be thrown under the bus.
1321642665075744774 2020-10-29 10:39:00 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ddale8 6 more days.
1321642427355144192 2020-10-29 10:38:04 +0800 <RSkarma1> I have never watched FOX news until tonight. WTF is wrong with these people? Are they paid actors? I am finding hate in my heart that I didn't know was there. I pray that this so called president will be gone in 6 days.
1321641461948030981 2020-10-29 10:34:14 +0800 <RSkarma1> I don't usually watch Fox news. But OMG! Now I understand why Trump says that every other news source is fake news. Does he fucking own FOX news? Seems to me that he does. They just said that Joe Biden might be the next Jimmy Carter. God, please make it so.
1321640021250744320 2020-10-29 10:28:30 +0800 <RSkarma1> I just tried to watch Fox News thinking that I should try to see why Trump loves them. Thinking I might get another point of view. But nope! There was nothing there that could ever do that. They are proud of what Trump has done.
1321632043269300224 2020-10-29 09:56:48 +0800 <RSkarma1> I'm a person that is about love &amp; peace. If you don't agree with me, please unfollow me now. We need to come together and care about each other. We cannot let Trump tear us apart. He hasn't lived our lives. Unless you are wealthy, he is not going to help you.
1321611902615724032 2020-10-29 08:36:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump And if you vote for him, we will NEVER be able to do ANYTHING without social distancing wearing a mask. I wish he would get Covid again and maybe not recover. Sorry but his bullshit has gone on long enough. HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU!!#
1321611171095523329 2020-10-29 08:33:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> @MarkRuffalo He is a fucking idiot!!
1321609233180315648 2020-10-29 08:26:10 +0800 <RSkarma1> All I want in this life is for my kids and grandsons to live in a world where they are able to live, vote, and be whoever they are without fearing for their lives. Trump propagates hatred and separation. There is NOTHING united about his thinking.
1321607870597705728 2020-10-29 08:20:45 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump You want to talk about corruption yet you have no proof. Stop trying to discredit your opponent and maybe try to say what YOU have DONE. Oh wait. NOTHING! Which is why the only thing you can do is make up lies about your opponent. LOSER!!
1321601252963323909 2020-10-29 07:54:27 +0800 <RSkarma1> @vaughanjay33 @KamalaHarris I absolutely agree. Thanks for clarifying.
1321589521385967622 2020-10-29 07:07:50 +0800 <RSkarma1> @karell920 @SawyerFrdrx @YouTube I loved this song the first time I heard it way back. He is amazing. Brings a smile to my face every time. I love seeing him growing and changing from that kid that played everywhere he could get in. Love ya Sawyer!!!
1321588616477528071 2020-10-29 07:04:14 +0800 <RSkarma1> Love this guy!!!
1321587770008260615 2020-10-29 07:00:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> @vaughanjay33 @KamalaHarris Well we can agree on that for sure.  I can't convert anyone who might be a follower of his. I just hope that you will remember, that this is America and we all have a right to our opinion. We can agree to disagree and no one needs to kill anyone over it.
1321585184630779904 2020-10-29 06:50:36 +0800 <RSkarma1> @vaughanjay33 @KamalaHarris I agree with you on that. But in this time where we need to protect each other, he isn't doing anything to prevent it from getting worse.  He just keeps going out there and gathering people, no matter what the cost. I just don't get it. Why doesn't he care?
1321582921522827269 2020-10-29 06:41:36 +0800 <RSkarma1> @vaughanjay33 @KamalaHarris Don't you feel a personal responsibility to people who are not breaking the law or threatening people because of their vote?  This is America. Democracy.  So it only works if Trump is elected?
1321581094840504327 2020-10-29 06:34:21 +0800 <RSkarma1> @vaughanjay33 @KamalaHarris Not sure of your meaning but I can say that I know many Trump supporters and none of them have said anything like you just said. We are looking at a country that has been divided with people hating each other. Why would you ever want this for your family?
1321576995038396419 2020-10-29 06:18:03 +0800 <RSkarma1> @vaughanjay33 @KamalaHarris Is that a threat??
1321572298218942464 2020-10-29 05:59:24 +0800 <RSkarma1> @KamalaHarris As far as I can see, he is still doing nothing to protect anyone!! He needs to just go away!!! ONLY 6 more days!!! God willing (and voters) we can get him out of there so that we can try to begin repairing all of the damage that he has done to our country.
1321559345314803714 2020-10-29 05:07:55 +0800 <RSkarma1> So do I.
1321547768939356160 2020-10-29 04:21:55 +0800 <RSkarma1> @SenSanders @karlita_pani There is a medication that was prescribed to me by my doctor. The cost at my pharmacy was over $1200.00 for 1 pen. Someone told me about a pharmacy in Vancouver. I called them and the cost of 5 pens was $498.00 (including shipping) How is that even possible?
1321539546635476992 2020-10-29 03:49:15 +0800 <RSkarma1> @peterframpton Is THIS for REAL?? Tom Hanks, a Pedophile?? OMG!! And there wouldn't be so many old people unresponsive if they stopped counting them??? What planet is this idiot from??
1321536152231415810 2020-10-29 03:35:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> PLEASE I AM BEGGING ANYONE WHO HASN'T VOTED. TRUMP CANNOT WIN THIS ELECTION. OUR COUNTRY, AS WE KNOW IT, WILL BE DESTROYED IF WE HAVE HIM AS PRESIDENT FOR ANOTHER 4 YEARS.  HE DOES NOT WANT THE BEST FOR US. HE DOES NOT WANT PEACE. HE ONLY WANTS POWER.
1321530412439658498 2020-10-29 03:12:57 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Amy_Siskind My faith in humanity has been shattered by this election. I am just shocked by the craziness around us. There is no regard for anyone anymore. People have blinders on when it comes to Trump. I am so afraid of what is going to happen when he loses.
1321529567279042561 2020-10-29 03:09:36 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump Because it's all in your pathetic orange, bald head. Nothing you say is credible. The only thing that your words tell us, is what YOU and YOUR PEOPLE are doing that is corrupt. So just keep revealing your evil self to us.
1321520700579000330 2020-10-29 02:34:22 +0800 <RSkarma1> @psychicmediumje Nope. Not shocking at all. But I AM shocked by the number of people who see his true colors and they still are ready to kill for him. I feel so disappointed in mankind right now. Donald Trump is the poison and so many Americans are drinking from his cup.
1321519391759060997 2020-10-29 02:29:10 +0800 <RSkarma1> @IMSiegfried @HalSparks @richardmarx If we don't believe what they believe, then we are in danger with no repercussions from law enforcement at all. It's not as if Trump hasn't shown his true colors. I just can't believe that so many have been waiting for someone like him. They worship him.
1321509028607021057 2020-10-29 01:47:59 +0800 <RSkarma1> @chelywright @richardmarx @realDonaldTrump I am in shock right now. I just can't even believe what I just saw and heard. It breaks my heart and horrifies me at the same time. I just can't even .... I retweeted it in hopes that someone with some soul left will change their vote.
1321508611919466501 2020-10-29 01:46:20 +0800 <RSkarma1> I am horrified to even be retweeting this but this is another example of Trumps followers. I can't even believe that there are still people in America who would behave this way. It's horrifying to me &amp; heartbreaking that some Americans support this behavior.
1321504781928669184 2020-10-29 01:31:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JackPartin6 I realize that.  I was just hoping that someone would see that this just isn't about the people at the rallies. It's also about the people who live or work near them, or go into the same stores as they do. I wasn't directing my reply at you.
1321503894292357122 2020-10-29 01:27:35 +0800 <RSkarma1> @HalSparks @richardmarx Why doesn't anyone do anything about these assholes? Why does Trump and his people get away with this kind of thing without worrying about the consequences?
1321503508714180611 2020-10-29 01:26:03 +0800 <RSkarma1> These are the kind of people who support Trump! THUGS!! To the guy that said "You're gonna vote for Trump whether you like it or not! You've got no choice. We fuckin' got you." THIS IS AMERICA!! WE DO HAVE A CHOICE ASSHOLE!!! Someone should arrest his ass!!!
1321502652157595651 2020-10-29 01:22:39 +0800 <RSkarma1> @HalSparks @richardmarx As idiotic as these people are, why doesn't someone do something about it. Especially the guy that said "You're gonna vote for Trump whether you like it or not! You've got no choice. We fuckin' got you." Doesn't he realize this is America? WE DO HAVE A CHOICE
1321492080485715968 2020-10-29 00:40:38 +0800 <RSkarma1> @jakemiller Thanks! I just found your fan club. Done. Have a great day! üòä
1321485931518578688 2020-10-29 00:16:12 +0800 <RSkarma1> @jakemiller Follow me back? üòä
1321485355049197568 2020-10-29 00:13:55 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JackPartin6 @MeidasTouch Because they do not wear masks and after the rallies, they continue about their normal lives, again, wearing no masks, and infecting people who aren't attending large gatherings so that they can avoid Covid.  So they become super spreaders.
1321483088220856329 2020-10-29 00:04:54 +0800 <RSkarma1> @AussiePunter32 OMG!! The mentality of these people. ü§£ü§£
1321482293546987522 2020-10-29 00:01:45 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar Prime example of his caring and compassionate nature. He doesn't have one single ounce of either. I hope that this rally backfires on him and that these people can see the truth about him. (although, I won't hold my breath)
1321471410053828610 2020-10-28 23:18:30 +0800 <RSkarma1> THIS IS HOW MUCH DONALD TRUMP LOVES HIS FOLLOWERS. NOT ONLY ENCOURAGING THEM TO GATHER AND SPREAD COVID, BUT LEAVING THEM TO GET SICK FROM BEING LEFT IN THE COLD.
1321470962630565888 2020-10-28 23:16:43 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump Hopefully, these people that you left to freeze in the cold have not voted yet, and will change their support from you to the better choice #JoeBiden .  Or maybe their families will be able to change their minds now that many have ended up in the hospital.
1321470287041495040 2020-10-28 23:14:02 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump If you love them so much, you sure have a weird way of showing it. You should be ashamed of yourself for leaving those people to freeze in the cold. Oh that's right, you are a typical narcissist and would never take responsibility for anything. #VoteBlue2020
1321458183756517376 2020-10-28 22:25:57 +0800 <RSkarma1> This is SO important!! Please get out there and vote on November 3 so that we can start building this country up again and undo the damage that has been done by our current liar-in-chief. #VoteBidenHarris2020 Our lives depend on it!!
1321457632721469443 2020-10-28 22:23:45 +0800 <RSkarma1> Do you really think that Trump is best for our economy?
1321440902880108545 2020-10-28 21:17:17 +0800 <RSkarma1> 6 MORE DAYS.
1321436103564558336 2020-10-28 20:58:12 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump I love how Joe is keeping people safe during his rallies, as opposed to you trying to kill as many as you can. This video only proves that you don't have a caring or compassionate bone in your body and compared to #Joebiden you are a worthless human being.
1321435027478032385 2020-10-28 20:53:56 +0800 <RSkarma1> @EricTrump I'd rather it be Publishers Clearing House.
1321434509385097217 2020-10-28 20:51:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> Yeah, this guy really cares about his supporters, doesn't he?
1321433854046031872 2020-10-28 20:49:16 +0800 <RSkarma1> @NiallOfficial I don't think there is any question as to who you would vote for. I wish you could vote in this election too. #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
1321433289903738880 2020-10-28 20:47:02 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Debootsie Good morning. Hope you have a great day!
1321292852014534657 2020-10-28 11:28:59 +0800 <RSkarma1> @espinaDuran @donwinslow I hope that is true.
1321289774561435653 2020-10-28 11:16:45 +0800 <RSkarma1> @NBCThisisUs @RyanBartholomee Holy shit!!!
1321289639274172419 2020-10-28 11:16:13 +0800 <RSkarma1> YOUR RIGHTS ARE ON THE LINE.
1321289488061108231 2020-10-28 11:15:36 +0800 <RSkarma1> @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump That's how sick his mind is. He doesn't even realize that he is projecting his actions onto other people. But he's been doing exactly that, all along. I just don't understand how his followers can't see it.
1321288261382393856 2020-10-28 11:10:44 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump Somebody needs to drain YOUR swamp, you lying piece of üí©.
1321286764972179456 2020-10-28 11:04:47 +0800 <RSkarma1> @AussiePunter32 I don't know. I listened a few times and never even thought of assuming he meant "tired". I guess that is because of his nature. He is a bad man and I never expect anything more than the most disgusting words to come out of him. My bad.
1321283123938840585 2020-10-28 10:50:19 +0800 <RSkarma1> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump THE SUPER SPREADER? NO THANKS! I'll stay with the good guys team. You can go down with the rest of Trumps thugs and criminals.
1321282567157518336 2020-10-28 10:48:06 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump Your administration is the most corrupt administration we've ever had in the history of America. The worst we've ever seen!!
1321282058975674369 2020-10-28 10:46:05 +0800 <RSkarma1> @AussiePunter32 Typical to defend Trump. I heard what he said and he wasn't talking about Biden being tired, you brainwashed sheep. When you people finally come to your senses and see this evil for what it is, I hope it's not too late. He is a danger to us all. You'll see.
1321281029294952454 2020-10-28 10:42:00 +0800 <RSkarma1> @marycmccormack HE IS A THUG!!!
1321280554386546688 2020-10-28 10:40:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> @OneKimSavage @marycmccormack He is seriously dangerous!!
1321280236881911808 2020-10-28 10:38:51 +0800 <RSkarma1> This is the person who you want for another 4 years??? You can't be serious! He is a THUG!!
1321279921495416832 2020-10-28 10:37:36 +0800 <RSkarma1> @marycmccormack I heard it exactly the way you heard it. Is see people saying he meant shot as in tired but I don't believe that for one second. I know what I heard and never in my life would I ever think a president would say that about his opponent. HE MUST GO!!!
1321267407885914119 2020-10-28 09:47:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> @KathrynCAgirl @DrRobDavidson @Jeff_Daniels @JoeBiden He leaves Covid everywhere he goes. And he was here in Michigan today and Don Jr is going to also be here so I'm sure we will be homebound again soon. I despise the Trump family. They don't care about anyone or anything yet people will die for him. It's crazy
1321265674707177474 2020-10-28 09:40:59 +0800 <RSkarma1> Think about it! Trump's rallies are causing Covid to spike everywhere he goes and HE DOES NOT CARE. NOT ABOUT ANY OF YOU. EVEN THOUGH YOU ALL WOULD DO ANYTHING AND BELIEVE ANYTHING HE SAYS. PLEASE VOTE BLUE. WE HAVE TO TURN THIS AROUND.
1321263399980933120 2020-10-28 09:31:57 +0800 <RSkarma1> @richardmarx Also, in Lansing, Trump said " 3 days after the election, Biden shot, they say Kamala, you're in charge now" something to that effect. What kind of fucking president says in a speech that his opponent will be shot 3 days after he is elected?
1321261277113667584 2020-10-28 09:23:30 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Pristina99 @johncusack @robreiner You've got this. Please don't be afraid. We need to be afraid only if Trump wins the election. We need to make sure that doesn't happen.
1321229970941845506 2020-10-28 07:19:06 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ddale8 He is the epitome of evil and no one will ever convince me otherwise.
1321229632411238400 2020-10-28 07:17:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> Please...America is counting on you.
1321229285059944449 2020-10-28 07:16:23 +0800 <RSkarma1> @richardmarx This is absolutely the lowest he could go. WTF?? I wish that someone would find a reason to throw his ass in prison and throw away the key. He is a despicable human.
1321228609433063428 2020-10-28 07:13:42 +0800 <RSkarma1> This disgusting piece of üí©üí©. What kind of president would even think about mentioning the killing of his running mate?  Trump needs to be put away for good.
1321227189933821956 2020-10-28 07:08:03 +0800 <RSkarma1> @BlueDragonfly76 Interesting.
1321226373453778945 2020-10-28 07:04:49 +0800 <RSkarma1> @timwilliamsart @thekjohnston Yep. This is Trump's America. If someone doesn't agree with him or feed his ego, they find themselves in danger. It's horrible!
1321225033449115648 2020-10-28 06:59:29 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Roberto85456020 @I_Jonny_ @harrisdoran @SenKamalaHarris Exactly. Every vote will count!

1321196438211207169 2020-10-28 05:05:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> @dvillella @realDonaldTrump He is a disgusting piece of human waste. üí©üí©üí©
1321194957928046594 2020-10-28 04:59:59 +0800 <RSkarma1> @LuckyLindyL @realDonaldTrump Exactly!! I wish they would just stay out of Michigan. We are going to end up, once again, with a stay safe/stay at home order. How can Governor Whitmer win up against all of Trumps brainwashed followers? They make it impossible for her to keep us all safe.

1321180075740614659 2020-10-28 04:00:51 +0800 <RSkarma1> PLEASE PLEASE:  When you cast your vote, PLEASE don't take it lightly or do it as "a joke" as this woman did in 2016. If you don't like Trump, VOTE BIDEN. #BidenHarris2020
1321179603021553664 2020-10-28 03:58:58 +0800 <RSkarma1> @BlueSt0rmRising I don't see anyone finding her "joke" very funny at all.
1321167011079217153 2020-10-28 03:08:56 +0800 <RSkarma1> @jackdwagner @rikkimiller I wouldn't mind a couple days of this kind of "normal." LOL
1321166317337092097 2020-10-28 03:06:10 +0800 <RSkarma1> It would be "very proper and very nice" if we had a president that could speak the truth once in awhile. Maybe he should study up on the laws if he doesn't think that this is within the law to be still counting votes after Nov. 3.
1321165481810841600 2020-10-28 03:02:51 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump I worked for a medical office at the time of the H1N1 breakout and it was nothing like this one. Instead of trying to talk shit about everyone else, you should be spending your last days trying to convince people that you have a shred of compassion.
1321160243041214464 2020-10-28 02:42:02 +0800 <RSkarma1> @sarahslean @kenjeong I meant 30 years ago. LOL I stand corrected. It's hard to believe that 2009 was that long ago. Geez! I'm OLD!! üò≠üò≠
1321159899020222471 2020-10-28 02:40:40 +0800 <RSkarma1> @sarahslean @kenjeong Oops! I don't know what I was thinking. LOL
1321156045109104649 2020-10-28 02:25:21 +0800 <RSkarma1> @YNB @kenjeong ALWAYS!!! If I have to see his face on TV and social media for the next 4 years, I'm going to go into hibernation until the next election.
1321149117767290889 2020-10-28 01:57:50 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar I hope you don't mind that I keep retweeting your tweets. It's just so important for everyone to know that this is serious. There are underhanded things going on instead of a normal election.
1321146132127457281 2020-10-28 01:45:58 +0800 <RSkarma1> @richardmarx I didn't realize that he had always been a big crybaby. I knew he was always an asshole but wow! 10 years later and he is still bitching about the questions that reporters ask him and still stomping out if he doesn't like the questions. #TrumpIsACoward
1321140783433555968 2020-10-28 01:24:43 +0800 <RSkarma1> This is no joke.  Please, if you haven't voted already, get your ballot and vote! Everything depends on this.
1321128114064445442 2020-10-28 00:34:22 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JhnyMac I am counting the days.  It just sickens me to look at his tweets, hear his voice or see his face. Of course, now that we are getting down to it, he is lying more than ever. And he is in my state of Michigan today, allowing people to super spread with him.
1321087532155785216 2020-10-27 21:53:06 +0800 <RSkarma1> This is a fact checkers response to Trumps claim that we are "rounding the turn" and that COVID is going away. You can clearly see, that it is just the opposite. I don't care how much you love Trump. He is a liar and refuses to believe the facts!!
1321084528493027328 2020-10-27 21:41:10 +0800 <RSkarma1> If you mailed your ballot in, go online to make sure that it was received. It will give you the date it was received. We need to make sure that our votes are counted.
1321084258115616769 2020-10-27 21:40:06 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar @thesoyjim I'm in Michigan and I mailed mine in weeks ago and checked to make sure it was received and it was, 4 days later. So I would recommend that everyone who mailed their ballot in, check to see if your ballot was received.
1321083717260115971 2020-10-27 21:37:57 +0800 <RSkarma1> IT'S TOO LATE TO MAIL IN YOUR ABSENTEE BALLOT. DROP OFF IN PERSON SO THAT YOUR VOTE WILL BE COUNTED.
1321083197527044099 2020-10-27 21:35:53 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump You're full of shit!!!  They are going full on COVID because COVID cases are still rising, all thanks to you and your rallies. You're pathetic.
1320901187491815424 2020-10-27 09:32:38 +0800 <RSkarma1> @sighnatasha @xodaniiii I'm proud that both of Michigan votes we nay. But what can we do now to keep her from taking women's rights away. Because she will.
1320894835407114240 2020-10-27 09:07:24 +0800 <RSkarma1> @KamalaHarris I am so ashamed of anyone who supports this. This is going to take us back to the 60's.
1320890444096671745 2020-10-27 08:49:57 +0800 <RSkarma1> If you follow me from a fake account or immediately dm me after I follow you, I will report and block you. Get it? I'm not looking for a boyfriend. Stay the hell away from me. Thank you.
1320868979137794050 2020-10-27 07:24:39 +0800 <RSkarma1> ONLY 8 MORE DAYS AND WE WILL BE RID OF THIS PIECE OF SHIT HUMAN THAT IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE!!
1320866300168687616 2020-10-27 07:14:01 +0800 <RSkarma1> @SenKamalaHarris I agree. This should not even be happening right now.
1320864063153442816 2020-10-27 07:05:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ChelseaClinton Yes I believe in all of that. Please follow me back.
1320863640644423682 2020-10-27 07:03:27 +0800 <RSkarma1> @marceelias Please follow me back
1320857774591512582 2020-10-27 06:40:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> 8 MORE DAYS AND TRUMP WILL BE VOTED OUT!! I DON'T TRUST WHAT HE MIGHT DO BETWEEN ELECTION DAY AND INAUGURATION. IS ANYONE ELSE NERVOUS?
1320855533423906816 2020-10-27 06:31:14 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar I have seen a few tweets about Kanye but I am hoping that no one takes him seriously.
1320855094120849408 2020-10-27 06:29:29 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Stu_McCartney @brianrayguitar What??? I have seen Brian and the rest of the band and WTF are you even talking about?? This is not even about Paul &amp; the band. But really? You have nothing else to comment on regarding the subject at hand? Go away!
1320854367164157952 2020-10-27 06:26:36 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar ABSOLUTELY NOT!!
1320833760653414400 2020-10-27 05:04:43 +0800 <RSkarma1> @dbongino @StruxMel So am I!!
1320833636116156416 2020-10-27 05:04:13 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump LIES!!! LIES!!! This man is not capable of speaking the truth!! Only 8 more days and hopefully he will be OUT!!!
1320824090295488513 2020-10-27 04:26:17 +0800 <RSkarma1> 8 MORE DAYS.   #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
1320822417695100929 2020-10-27 04:19:38 +0800 <RSkarma1> The White House health care plan is still not a health care plan  https://t.co/qOMpL7Q81V via @msnbc  So, as we all suspected, Trump has NO HEALTH PLAN.
1320806198338375687 2020-10-27 03:15:11 +0800 <RSkarma1> @KamalaHarris I voted weeks ago and my ballot was received several days later.  Now I can only pray that Trump is voted OUT and we never have to hear his voice or see his face again.
1320795873148866561 2020-10-27 02:34:10 +0800 <RSkarma1> @glitzylady @HEvelynRobinso1 @friel_waite @adamlambert I feel the same way about him.  And actually, I prefer people, whether they are entertainers or not, to put their message out there and to try to make a difference. I mean, that's what we are ALL here for, right? To make a difference? The world does need him.
1320788350228418563 2020-10-27 02:04:16 +0800 <RSkarma1> Please vote!!  Our country cannot take another 4 years of Donald Trump.  He's doing nothing to prevent the spread of COVID. Instead, he is encouraging people to gather, unmasked in large groups at his rallies. States where he has been are spiking. Stop him
1320783389927100418 2020-10-27 01:44:33 +0800 <RSkarma1> @richardmarx I sooooo loathe this man!!! I can't even bear to hear him talk anymore (not that I ever could)  I want him to just go away!!! I will do anything to not see his face or have to hear his voice ever, ever again!!!
1320732242860249091 2020-10-26 22:21:19 +0800 <RSkarma1> When are people going to get the fact that Trump has no plan for ANYTHING. Healthcare, COVID control (aside from causing the spread) NOTHING!! He needs to go!! This man is ALL TALK and NO ACTION!!! Please people, don't let him do nothing for 4 more years.
1320727086806552579 2020-10-26 22:00:50 +0800 <RSkarma1> This is absolutely ridiculous that they are allowed to do this. Total disregard for any rules.
1320709456771096576 2020-10-26 20:50:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> El Paso sees 200 percent rise in Covid-19 hospitalizations; people urged to stay home 2 weeks  https://t.co/jbZi7POU3b via @YahooNews Seems like everywhere Trump goes, Covid-19 spikes.
1320109137427124224 2020-10-25 05:05:19 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump It doesn't matter if many are low risk or not. My daughter, son in law and 2 grandsons had it and everyone they came in contact with have now had to quarantine. This disrupts lives, affects income and schooling as well as health. It IS a big deal you asswipe.
1320108145792909313 2020-10-25 05:01:23 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump We will be as soon as your ass is out of there.
1320050517469499394 2020-10-25 01:12:23 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump So you think if you just make it up, it makes it true?  MY POLL SAYS: BIDEN 100%   TRUMP 0%. There.... It looks like you lost.
1319811060925423617 2020-10-24 09:20:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DavidVeevers1 JFK's assasination. I was in 3rd grade and I just knew that something horrible and life changing had happened. Everyone around me was crying. I watched the funeral procession and John Jr salute as it passed by. I remember thinking how sad Jackie looked.
1319799431190007813 2020-10-24 08:34:39 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar @marceelias Done. Thanks!
1319798789172088832 2020-10-24 08:32:06 +0800 <RSkarma1> @MeliMels99 Amazed and thankful.
1319797551390986242 2020-10-24 08:27:11 +0800 <RSkarma1> @MeliMels99 I'm feeling the same way. I'm so tired of the mud slinging and people verbally attacking other people. It's mentally exhausting. I will be so happy when this is over. Hang in there. Only 11 more days. Then if we can make it until the inauguration, we're good.
1319795787866558464 2020-10-24 08:20:11 +0800 <RSkarma1> @richardmarx @Richard11352387 I meant follow them back....lol
1319795411729764354 2020-10-24 08:18:41 +0800 <RSkarma1> @richardmarx @Richard11352387 I've been followed by 4 Rick Springfield and 3 Luke Bryan accounts. I usually follow them bank and wait for their dm. Then I report them and Bam! They're gone. Lol
1319737553356980224 2020-10-24 04:28:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Actually, I find it kind of entertaining to watch him squirm, like the little worm that he is.
1319737261546668037 2020-10-24 04:27:37 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump You're just going to keep on trying to cause trouble until you are booted out of the White House aren't you? Like you are really concerned about what President Obama thinks. I don't think that there is one previous president that would vote for your ass!!!
1319699545450827777 2020-10-24 01:57:45 +0800 <RSkarma1> So, once again, another lie!! He needs to turn over his tax returns. But I'm sure that the reason he doesn't is because he knows he is in deep shit!!  Do you really think that the IRS would be able to keep him from showing them if it proved he's not lying?
1319684887901835264 2020-10-24 00:59:30 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar Looks pretty disgusting to me.
1319671115665596416 2020-10-24 00:04:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> @kokoyumyum @gcruzeiffel @johncusack @Gizzyart @vectorbae @FunnyFarmer5150 My thoughts exactly.
1319670904062955521 2020-10-24 00:03:56 +0800 <RSkarma1> @johncusack @Gizzyart @vectorbae @FunnyFarmer5150 Is he on blood thinners? My dad used to get multiple purple spots and bruises when he was on blood thinners.
1319670418563883014 2020-10-24 00:02:00 +0800 <RSkarma1> @thomaswhushu @MarkRuffalo I'm prayin' right along with you.
1319651326247260160 2020-10-23 22:46:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> If you watch this, you will CLEARLY see that Trump DOES say the things that he has continued to say "I never said that" about. Why do his followers continue to side with him when the proof of his lies is right in front of them?
1319649767908048896 2020-10-23 22:39:57 +0800 <RSkarma1> @thomaswhushu @MarkRuffalo You are NOT alone. I don't hate anyone (typically). I feel that everyone has the right to their opinion &amp; to speak their mind. Having said that, there is no way that I can even fathom how he thinks.  I don't think he tells the truth about anything. I hate him
1319648827717144576 2020-10-23 22:36:13 +0800 <RSkarma1> @MarkRuffalo He is a big fucking baby and I can't believe that the way he acts hasn't turned away more Republicans. The man lies with every breath he takes, he says things &amp; then says he didn't say it, he is making accusations with no proof. HOW do people still like him?
1319481974852100097 2020-10-23 11:33:12 +0800 <RSkarma1> @AussiePunter32 I was hoping to see him muted once or twice so we could see him throw one of his little tantrums and walk off.
1319479780056629248 2020-10-23 11:24:28 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ddale8 So?  Your point is?
1319477268360712192 2020-10-23 11:14:30 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar  https://t.co/cFKiuRMSyl
1319468360195805184 2020-10-23 10:39:06 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar @jessiwhiteside  https://t.co/MqzmpB4toW
1319463091311169537 2020-10-23 10:18:10 +0800 <RSkarma1> What?? The LEAST RACIST PERSON?? OMG!!
1319461142503264257 2020-10-23 10:10:25 +0800 <RSkarma1> I can't even look at Trump's face anymore. The faces he makes...
1319460138827321346 2020-10-23 10:06:26 +0800 <RSkarma1> @johncusack I want YOU to run for president John.
1319459797457162241 2020-10-23 10:05:04 +0800 <RSkarma1> So well taken care of?? You lost their fucking parents you moron. You are the devil himself!!!
1319458976736661511 2020-10-23 10:01:49 +0800 <RSkarma1> What an asshole!!
1319458021806923779 2020-10-23 09:58:01 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar Amen to that. I feel like crying myself just listening to him.
1319455917868539904 2020-10-23 09:49:39 +0800 <RSkarma1> I thought Trump said in the 60 mi.nutes interview that he already HAS a new health plan. Now he said he wants to come up with a better plan.
1319455293751894021 2020-10-23 09:47:10 +0800 <RSkarma1> I wish I had a mute button.
1319446519473410048 2020-10-23 09:12:19 +0800 <RSkarma1> According to Trump, we're going to have a vaccine within weeks. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
1319444531956338695 2020-10-23 09:04:25 +0800 <RSkarma1> BRIAN GOT BLOCKED BY ERIC TRUMP JR. HE'S DOING SOMETHING RIGHT.
1319444261423763458 2020-10-23 09:03:20 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar I'm impressed!  https://t.co/Mz1TQFJHol
1319360084082831361 2020-10-23 03:28:51 +0800 <RSkarma1> @CMT @GabbyBarrett_ I absolutely love this song and I think @GabbyBarrett_ is awesome. She was my #1 pick on her season of Idol all the way through. Great job!!
1319353309547941890 2020-10-23 03:01:56 +0800 <RSkarma1> VOTE!! VOTE!! VOTE!!
1319345687633498113 2020-10-23 02:31:38 +0800 <RSkarma1> @TheRickWilson Magnificently Brilliant????  ü§£ü§£ü§£
1319339678609399808 2020-10-23 02:07:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> This man is pathetic. He's being asked the harder questions because even though he says America is doing SO MUCH BETTER than EVER, clearly it is not! Unemployment is up, economy is down and he has done NOTHING with healthcare in 4 years. What does he expect?
1319338945797328898 2020-10-23 02:04:51 +0800 <RSkarma1> @mehdirhasan @johncusack Joe Biden has not been the President for the past 4 years. Of course Trump is going to get the hard questions because he keeps spouting everything he's done and how EVERYTHING is better than it has been in US history, and clearly it is NOT!! He's a big baby
1319337476113244163 2020-10-23 01:59:01 +0800 <RSkarma1> @RollingStone He is insane. I think that after he loses, he needs to go into a psychiatric facility.
1319336333798707201 2020-10-23 01:54:28 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JustVent6 @kylegriffin1 He looks like he is still short of breath at the beginning. I watched about half of the interview, and I just couldn't stand to listen to him for the rest of it. I'm so glad they have a mute button for tonights debate.
1319302488445603842 2020-10-22 23:39:59 +0800 <RSkarma1> And THIS is the guy that Republicans want to re-elect? I don't ever remember the Republican party being like this asshole. He is such a disrespectful and abusive person with no heart, no conscience and no soul. Please vote #BidenHarris2020  Save our country.
1319297291618897920 2020-10-22 23:19:20 +0800 <RSkarma1> How in the world is this allowed to happen. Isn't there something that someone can do?  If it's a committee rule, someone should be able to stop this.
1319110012942299142 2020-10-22 10:55:09 +0800 <RSkarma1> Goodnight my friends. I wish you all sweet and peaceful dreams.
1319085350896214016 2020-10-22 09:17:09 +0800 <RSkarma1> I will never ever again watch something like this. My heart is breaking but I am pissed off just as much as I was when this first happened. I thought this was going to be a tribute to him. It's not.
1319069592141037569 2020-10-22 08:14:32 +0800 <RSkarma1> Not sure, so far, how I feel about this.
1319066608057389059 2020-10-22 08:02:41 +0800 <RSkarma1> I am finally getting around to watching the John Lennon thing on 20/20. I had to wait for my own reasons. He wanted ‚úå peace and equality. I wonder what he would say about what is going on now in our country. We need harmony.  #GIVEPEACEACHANCE.
1319052662881615872 2020-10-22 07:07:16 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Lucky55158823 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump WHAT?? You cannot be serious.

I kept seeing commercials on TV for them but there weren't any around here. But within the last year, one opened by my daughter and 2 months ago another opened near me. Give it a try if you find one.

1318910410205122560 2020-10-21 21:42:00 +0800 <RSkarma1> So he "doesn't stand by anything?" WTH does that mean? I guess we pretty much knew that all along though. Trump is a big baby that walks away when the questions get too hard or don't go the way he wants. This infant has to go. #BidenHarris2020

1318735749081124868 2020-10-21 10:07:58 +0800 <RSkarma1> Clare seems very into herself. I didn't like her on The Bachelor or any of the Paradise or Winter Games.

1318288174838370306 2020-10-20 04:29:28 +0800 <RSkarma1> @EricTrump The polls are not wrong.

Real good reason to vote for someone who has turned this country upside down. He's a reality TV person &amp; he thinks this is is his show. He's a racist who doesn't respect women. Not MY cup of tea.

1317926026530443264 2020-10-19 04:30:25 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar He always seemed to be very arrogant to me. The fact that he's calling his group The Beach Boys, proves it. Brian Wilson is the genius of The Beach Boys. I think it's so dishonest for a performer to try to fool people into thinking they're seeing the original
1317674949658726401 2020-10-18 11:52:43 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ThisIsRobThomas Exactly!! I just don't understand why nobody gets it. You are wearing a mask to protect others, not yourself. Stay away from anyone without a mask. My daughter &amp; her family all have COVID because of someone without a mask.

1317174848637014019 2020-10-17 02:45:30 +0800 <RSkarma1> @johncusack @the818 Of course he is lying. I don't think he is capable of uttering one true word.   And I have seen some of his followers argue &amp; swear that he's brought their insulin prices down to practically nothing. I think his inability to tell the truth is rubbing off.

The Town Hall last night proved it to me. He was calm, direct and honest while Trump ( I recorded his) was his usual self.
1317087168070864897 2020-10-16 20:57:05 +0800 <RSkarma1> @WeWillPressOn @JoeBiden That may be true, but Trump has done absolutely nothing to encourage people to wear masks and social distance. He convinced his followers that this was not anything to be taken seriously and now no one will take it seriously.

1316923461575606277 2020-10-16 10:06:35 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar @NBCNews I totally agree. He has enough air time every day to spew his lies. Frankly, I'm just sick of his face, his voice, his hands flapping around....I am going to have the biggest celebration when he is dragged out of Washington. NBC never should have done this.

We wear a mask to protect OTHERS. Those who don't wear a mask can infect US and they just don't care.  Why can't people understand that?

1316904832935075840 2020-10-16 08:52:33 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Abhi_finance @KamalaHarris Oh boy. There's going to be hell to pay.
1316904332030365696 2020-10-16 08:50:34 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Carla_Baron @PalmerReport Donald Trump doesn't know how to listen. Not even for one second. He just rudely interrupts. He is a horrible person. I can't even watch him. I always know there will be bits of his crazy comments here &amp; there later. I can't take a whole hour at once.
1316903429781004291 2020-10-16 08:46:59 +0800 <RSkarma1> @khloekardashian Can you see this?
1316903338613657600 2020-10-16 08:46:37 +0800 <RSkarma1> @khloekardashian Twitter was broken. I think it's fixed now.
1316902507730378752 2020-10-16 08:43:19 +0800 <RSkarma1> Twitter is broken
1316902323440988160 2020-10-16 08:42:35 +0800 <RSkarma1> @KrisJenner #KUWTK
1316843954860630016 2020-10-16 04:50:39 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump @NBCNews @cspan Why don't you get off Twitter and try doing some work for a change? You're worse than a teenager. Also, the only reason anyone would be watching you tonight is to, once again, see what an ass you can make of yourself. I will be watching my NEXT President.
1316812295893389315 2020-10-16 02:44:51 +0800 <RSkarma1> @johncusack @joshscampbell This just keeps getting worse. We are all going to have to fear for our lives pretty soon, just for disagreeing with this evil maniac of a person. How can ANYONE in their right mind think that there is ANYTHING that is okay about this? WTF??? I'm sickened!!
1316811897883238400 2020-10-16 02:43:16 +0800 <RSkarma1> So is this the kind of Law and Order we want in our country? "15 minutes it was over. They knew who he was, they didn't want to arrest him." So now our court system will be obsolete and they can just kill someone if they don't feel like arresting them?
1316810290059710471 2020-10-16 02:36:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> @atrupar @brianrayguitar He cannot get up in front of a crowd without trashing anyone whose name gets mentioned.  By now, EVERYONE should be able to see that he shits on anyone who disagrees with him. If you follow him and change your mind, he will shit on you too. What a leader. üí©
1316798931943264263 2020-10-16 01:51:44 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Matt24Jays @ddale8 Surefire way to win over voters. ü§£ü§£ He is really a piece of work!
1316793513669996546 2020-10-16 01:30:13 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump This is what total disregard for other people looks like. In this time of a pandemic, Trump (our so-called president) encourages people to gather in large masses without any masks to protect the people around them. This absolutely makes me furious!!
1316784414463062017 2020-10-16 00:54:03 +0800 <RSkarma1> DO NOT LET THIS GUY BE CORRECT!  NO MATTER WHAT, WE MUST CONTINUE TO SUPPORT #JoeBiden AND GET OUT THERE AND VOTE, IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY. TRUMP HAS GOT TO GO!!!
1316783837951791104 2020-10-16 00:51:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> @EricTrump So now you're going to start tweeting "Fake Polls" everywhere?  You guys really don't trust ANYONE do you?
1316769133363630081 2020-10-15 23:53:20 +0800 <RSkarma1> Please keep your TV's tuned into ABC tonight to hear Joe Biden.  Don't give Trump the opportunity to brag to everyone how he had the most viewers in the history of America.  #BidenTownHall #BidenHarris2020 #BidenForPresident
1316768539987062784 2020-10-15 23:50:58 +0800 <RSkarma1> @itsJeffTiedrich Same here.  I know that we will see enough of Trumps crazy behavior on the replays. I just hope that everyone else makes the choice to watch Joe Biden instead of giving Trump the satisfaction of bragging how he had the most viewers in the history of the US!
1316761968213209094 2020-10-15 23:24:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> I absolutely LOVE this song!! I wanted so bad to see this show but it doesn't look like it is coming anywhere near me. üò¢
1316733809589616640 2020-10-15 21:32:58 +0800 <RSkarma1> @FrankAmari2 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Where is he getting $100 million? He is in debt!!
1316733099733135360 2020-10-15 21:30:09 +0800 <RSkarma1> @GOP @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump, YOU owe the people of America an apology because you have been a HORRIBLE President. You will forever be known as the WORST PRESIDENT IN ALL OF HISTORY!  Your days are numbered and YOU are grasping at straws!
1316732235886845952 2020-10-15 21:26:43 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ToddMichaelHall Happy Anniversary and Congratulations!!
1316557634208706564 2020-10-15 09:52:55 +0800 <RSkarma1> @NicoleScherzy Do the "bad singers" really sing that bad?? It was awful!! Lol
1316541913185517574 2020-10-15 08:50:26 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JennyMcCarthy Definitely a professional singer. Beautiful voice.
1316540871203008519 2020-10-15 08:46:18 +0800 <RSkarma1> @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump @VP @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @LaraLeaTrump I wish you would take the time to go to Hell. üëøüî•üí© And I DON'T mean Hell, Michigan.
1316537589667684353 2020-10-15 08:33:16 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JennyMcCarthy @kenjeong You guys crack me up!! Follow me back please.
1316510405938814976 2020-10-15 06:45:15 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar Thank you so much for the follow. You made my day! Hope you have a great evening.
1316507029121441792 2020-10-15 06:31:49 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar I was wondering if you would please follow me back. It would sure make my day a little better. But if not,  have a great evening anyway. ‚úå‚úå
1316481953902800900 2020-10-15 04:52:11 +0800 <RSkarma1> @TitusNation @richardmarx This is what sheer desperation looks and sounds like. You can be sure that everything they accuse the Bidens of,  that they are guilty of. It's confession by finger pointing.
1316473176189263873 2020-10-15 04:17:18 +0800 <RSkarma1> This is the kind of man that we need in charge of our country right now. A man with compassion. A man who cares about suffering. A man that we can trust.  Please VOTE #BidenHarris2020
1316463172178632704 2020-10-15 03:37:33 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar @thedailybeast @djrothkopf I just want him to be OUT!  He is so dangerous to everything that is moral and decent about this country. And I think that when he loses, there is going to be some kind of chaos in getting him out of the White House. Everyone needs to VOTE!
1316461499750248450 2020-10-15 03:30:54 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Chrishell7 @DancingABC @chrishell I was so excited for you. It was cute to see someone who has fans of their own, fangirling for a boy band.
1316448643331895299 2020-10-15 02:39:49 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar Truer words have never been spoken.
1316441427413475329 2020-10-15 02:11:09 +0800 <RSkarma1> @LiveFromDarylsH I would be so honored if you would follow me back. ‚ù§Ô∏èüåûü§©‚úåÔ∏è
1316431715544555530 2020-10-15 01:32:33 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realTuckFrumper @brianrayguitar SMH at this loser!! His whole life has been based on lying and cheating. I just don't understand how anyone can believe and trust in anything that comes out of his orange pie hole.
1316431222701256707 2020-10-15 01:30:36 +0800 <RSkarma1> @brianrayguitar Apparently they have not! And while it is very tempting to consider watching Trump make an ass of himself once again, we need to hear what our next president has planned to bring our country back from the destruction of the Trump administration.
1316417807639248896 2020-10-15 00:37:17 +0800 <RSkarma1> This absolutely sounds like it is going to be a huge problem when @JoeBiden is elected as President. I've never seen a president who disregards the Constitution like Trump does. WE HAVE TO GET HIM OUT!! THIS IS A DEMOCRACY, NOT A DICTATORSHIP!!
1316407350652215296 2020-10-14 23:55:44 +0800 <RSkarma1> @harrisonjaime @BradBosseMusic @LindseyGrahamSC Is HE freaking serious? Or was he being sarcastic?  I mean, it really sounded to me like the was dead serious about the days of segregation being the "good old days". WTF is wrong with these people? And why are so many people still accepting this kind of shit
1316406505105690624 2020-10-14 23:52:23 +0800 <RSkarma1> @o2bnobx @Rosie Isn't that what they do? Totally and constantly contradict themselves and accuse everyone else of doing exactly what they do.
1316406090825953280 2020-10-14 23:50:44 +0800 <RSkarma1> It is so important that everyone VOTE!!! This is unacceptable!!!
1316360069064396800 2020-10-14 20:47:51 +0800 <RSkarma1> @toddcarey What a little cutie! ‚ù§Ô∏è
1316359699672043522 2020-10-14 20:46:23 +0800 <RSkarma1> @toddcarey @jakemiller I have a few friends in Wisconsin. They moved from the Detroit suburbs to Wisconsin 20 years ago and they absolutely love it there.
1316355758964060160 2020-10-14 20:30:44 +0800 <RSkarma1> @toddcarey Thank you for following me.
1316204269339582465 2020-10-14 10:28:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> Now THIS is the kind of person we need as our leader and President. He is for ALL AMERICANS. Not just the ones who vote for him.
1316176484470489088 2020-10-14 08:38:21 +0800 <RSkarma1> @jakemiller Please follow me back. ‚ù§

1316140142638309376 2020-10-14 06:13:57 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump You haven't either. You talk the big talk but have never had any thing to back it up with.
1316118216775733250 2020-10-14 04:46:49 +0800 <RSkarma1> @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump He probably hired them and paid them.
1316098978233167872 2020-10-14 03:30:23 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump You haven't shown us crap!! All you do is talk, talk, talk with no action whatsoever.  You have already made that promise once and you've had 4 years to accomplish what you promised and still NOTHING!! There is no reason to ever trust you or anything you say
1316054411068801025 2020-10-14 00:33:17 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump You just aren't going to be satisfied until you have infected the rest of the country that has managed to stay safe, are you, you worthless imitation of a human being?!! You're a real piece of work!! I can't wait until they carry your ass out of the WH!!!
1316045278173167616 2020-10-13 23:56:59 +0800 <RSkarma1> ONCE THIS IS DONE, IT WILL BE TOO LATE.  DON'T LET THEM TAKE YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE. IF YOU HAVE A  PREEXISTING CONDITION, YOU SHOULD BE VERY WORRIED!!
1316040556536049665 2020-10-13 23:38:14 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump I SAY GO HOME!!! You can't by my vote with your promises.  You are a big talker and that is all you are. Promises of huge things to come... and no action, EVER!
1316040137466417152 2020-10-13 23:36:34 +0800 <RSkarma1> If he has a plan that is going to go into effect immediately after he is in, why isn't he telling America what that plan is?  Because he DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN!!  HE IS ALL TALK AND NO ACTION. WE HAVE SEEN IT SINCE 2016. HE TALKS BUT NEVER DOES ANYTHING!!
1315685415303688193 2020-10-13 00:07:01 +0800 <RSkarma1> @msnbcnorth @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump FAKE ACCOUNT! STOP SPREADING LIES. THERE IS ENOUGH OF THAT ALREADY!
1315676228976807936 2020-10-12 23:30:31 +0800 <RSkarma1> @gretchenwhitmer I think you have done an amazing jobe and I support you. You are a badass!
1315665551994355712 2020-10-12 22:48:06 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Kenny_Sowellfan @realDonaldTrump I don't think Trump could even pronounce some of those words, let alone put them in a complete sentence.
1315420604904992768 2020-10-12 06:34:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump @CNN @nytimes You have NEVER been qualified to be our president. You're a little boy inside, just begging for acceptance. Your soul is filled with hatred and you've proven it over and over. You hate everyone who opposes you &amp; approve any actions taken by those against you
1315412774927904771 2020-10-12 06:03:39 +0800 <RSkarma1> @simplymeally We still have not seen any results. Not his last negative test, his positive test or his most recent test. So there is no reason for me or anyone to trust anything that him or his doctors say.
1315410313987141635 2020-10-12 05:53:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> This is how our president handles COVID and everything else. BU SUPRESSION!
1315409523151175682 2020-10-12 05:50:44 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump ARMY FOR TRUMP??? WTF is WRONG with you?? We are NOT fighting AGAINST each OTHER!!  OR IS THIS YOUR CALLOUT TO ALL OF YOUR WHITE SUPREMECIST REDNECKS???
1315384680733175809 2020-10-12 04:12:01 +0800 <RSkarma1> SO WHO IS ACTUALLY PACKING THE COURT?? SEEMS TO ME IT'S THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSING #BidenHarris OF STACKING. EVERYTHING TRUMP MAKES ACCUSATIONS ABOUT, IS WHAT HE HIMSELF IS DOING. NOT THE DEMOCRATS. WHY CAN'T EVERYONE SEE THAT???
1315111760135884801 2020-10-11 10:07:31 +0800 <RSkarma1> @karell920 @SawyerFrdrx @DarylsHouseClub @YouTube He is awesome!!

1314751069977825281 2020-10-10 10:14:16 +0800 <RSkarma1> @kylegriffin1 The President is trying to destroy us. Our country, our Democracy and our freedom and everything else that made us strong. He is trying to take us down. Please Vote. #BidenHarris2020
1314750268450406400 2020-10-10 10:11:05 +0800 <RSkarma1> @CarolDolan @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Thank you so much.
1314733881850040320 2020-10-10 09:05:58 +0800 <RSkarma1> @CarolDolan @JoeBiden Thank you to all of you and also everyone in other countries. I hope you all know that we are trying to get this dictator @realDonaldTrump. out of here.
1314724286570074117 2020-10-10 08:27:50 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ashleyiaco I like them.
1314710387976269831 2020-10-10 07:32:37 +0800 <RSkarma1> @StevenTDennis @PDreams4ever Do you really think that they will give an answer to that question? And if they do, are they going to back it up with any proof? Probably not, because it seems that they are allowed to do whatever they want.
1314709391556456448 2020-10-10 07:28:39 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Debootsie Enjoy it!! It's gonna be gorgeous!!
1314708743859441664 2020-10-10 07:26:05 +0800 <RSkarma1> @StevenTDennis @johncusack And Michigan isn't even on that list, yet our @GovWhitmer had her life threatened by terrorists because she chose to protect us even though she was attcked constantly by rednecks who were arrested as "militia". Prosecuters, do your job now!!!

1314681441570168833 2020-10-10 05:37:35 +0800 <RSkarma1> @mmpadellan Insanity from an insane person isn't that much of a surprise.
1314667325463965703 2020-10-10 04:41:30 +0800 <RSkarma1> @betteryear2021 @LightningDuck @joncoopertweets @vipertuff Exactly. HIPAA would prevent them from giving ANY medical information about him.  The NDA says that Trump is lying about something very important. We know damn well that if he had tested negative earlier, he would be waving the results around like a flag.
1314666698268651520 2020-10-10 04:39:00 +0800 <RSkarma1> @LightningDuck @joncoopertweets @vipertuff The fact that they released other medical information on Trump, this would have nothing to do with HIPAA. But the fact that Trump had everyone sign a non disclosure agreement says for sure he is hiding or lying about something, and we all know what it is.
1314664273017278465 2020-10-10 04:29:22 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Debootsie I've got a half hour (15 minutes of it is my last break) LOL  Have a great weekend. It's gorgeous out!!
1314655936905203712 2020-10-10 03:56:15 +0800 <RSkarma1> @NiallOfficial @inmyheadnjh I've felt that way too. Like, this can't really be happening. It's a nightmare. And it just keeps getting worse. He is a freakin' lunatic.
1314641342174294018 2020-10-10 02:58:15 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump For someone who has been so vocally against mail in ballots, you sure are enthusiastic about this.  Are you sure that you are off that medication because you're talking out of both sides of your face again. #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
1314640796403068928 2020-10-10 02:56:05 +0800 <RSkarma1> @TWIT_ANTHONY @realDonaldTrump I'm hoping that this is parody.  If not, ARE YOU NUTS???
1314640288812617730 2020-10-10 02:54:04 +0800 <RSkarma1> @richardmarx The fact that he verbally attacked her after this thing was uncovered shows the kind of evil human being he is. I live in Michigan and Gov. Whitmer did her best to keep us from being a "hotspot" in our country. HE NEEDS TO GO!! #25thAmendmentNow
1314639798406086656 2020-10-10 02:52:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Rosie @thedailybeast The have proven over and over again that they do not care about anyone. Trump has not said one word about his wife or any of the others with COVID. Because he simply does not even think that they are worth the thought. He is a monster and a danger to us all.
1314636200356073473 2020-10-10 02:37:49 +0800 <RSkarma1> @REALENTERTAINER @mmpadellan My feelings exactly.  It seems that he is so far above the law that no one can touch him.  I just don't understand it. But his followers follow him, no questions asked and defend him no matter what. He is dangerous to our freedom and democracy. #BidenHarris
1314634195877138434 2020-10-10 02:29:51 +0800 <RSkarma1> @BradMossEsq @richardmarx Yet his followers will believe it but then when he says that he never said it, they will believe that and say that it's fake news.  How did we ever allow this monster to be elected to be in charge of our country?  HE NEEDS TO GO!! #BidenHarris2020
1314632877045407746 2020-10-10 02:24:37 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Carla_Baron I am hoping that his instability can be assessed. No one that tweets such craziness all day long, changes his mind all of the time, thinks that he can just sign anything and it will happen, rule the country with hatred &amp; prejudice should ever be president.

1314619060173320199 2020-10-10 01:29:43 +0800 <RSkarma1> @kylegriffin1 Obviously, they are hiding the fact that he put himself out there even though he KNEW that he had COVID.  If there was nothing to hide, he would be tweeting proof everywhere.
1314607026463371265 2020-10-10 00:41:53 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ehananoki Can he get a psychological evaluation while he's at it?  America needs to know just how crazy he is.

1314598633778618368 2020-10-10 00:08:33 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump I think YOU are the crazy one. And you need to be replaced by @JoeBiden .  #JoeBidenForPresident2020 #BidenHarris2020
1314591365129527300 2020-10-09 23:39:40 +0800 <RSkarma1> @OzzyOsbourne @MrsSOsbourne HAPPY BIRTHDAY SHARON!!!  I hope that your day is special and filled with the love of your family and that you are surrounded with happiness.
1314584843058065409 2020-10-09 23:13:45 +0800 <RSkarma1> Please!!! Do not write in Kanye or cast your vote for him!! This is throwing away your vote!!!  You may as well be giving it to the guy we are trying to vote out of office.  #VoteJoeBiden2020
1314571943190945792 2020-10-09 22:22:29 +0800 <RSkarma1> @rickygervais @FelineFriendsUK What a cutie!!!
1314571785648644097 2020-10-09 22:21:51 +0800 <RSkarma1> @PreetBharara He confuses me more everyday. He is nuts and I don't care what anyone says. The man has serious mental and psychological issues.  His handlers shouldn't even allow him to get in front of a camera and speak. He has made America the laughing stock of the world.
1314568638255558665 2020-10-09 22:09:21 +0800 <RSkarma1> @renee_miller2 @realDonaldTrump WOW!!! What kind of person ARE you??  So you think that because she tried to protect us from being one of the COVID "hot spots" that she deserved to be kidnapped and killed?  You are no better than the rednecks that were arrested!!  MICHIGAN IS GOING BLUE!
1314568002210275328 2020-10-09 22:06:49 +0800 <RSkarma1> @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump I am just hoping that this will not be tolerated by the majority of our people in Michigan and he will lose this state big time!! HE NEEDS TO GO NOW!!!
1314567576882737153 2020-10-09 22:05:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump You ARE a White Supremacist! And after these rednecks were plotting to kidnap and kill her, you did not offer any compassion or caring. Because this is the shit that you love!! As long as it's coming from YOUR side, you're find with it. YOU NEED TO GO NOW!!!
1314566806871433217 2020-10-09 22:02:04 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump You are delusional.  And your condition is worsening. I think it's time for you to go.
1314563886771851265 2020-10-09 21:50:28 +0800 <RSkarma1> @pugherd @chipfranklin I wish more people felt the way that you do. Being from Michigan myself I have seen many posts on FB from people who are from MI saying that she deserved it. We don't all have to agree on politics, but must come together as humans and condemn this behavior.
1314280689509040134 2020-10-09 03:05:09 +0800 <RSkarma1> @LiveFromDarylsH I thought that I saw somewhere that @SawyerFrdrx  is going to be on the show but now I can't find the tweet. Please say that it's true. I've followed him since his first song on The Voice. He is an amazing artist. Going to be an amazing show
1314042879053045761 2020-10-08 11:20:10 +0800 <RSkarma1> @SawyerFrdrx Good night. I can't wait to see you on @realdarylhall. @LiveFromDarylsH. I'm so excited!!
1314031877112688642 2020-10-08 10:36:27 +0800 <RSkarma1> We need a president that lifts us up as people and then as a country. Please vote for @JoeBiden
1314023177241194496 2020-10-08 10:01:53 +0800 <RSkarma1> I am about to puke!! #joebiden
1314008564307030017 2020-10-08 09:03:49 +0800 <RSkarma1> @MillerStream That is an asshole thing to say. She is beautiful inside and out. Has a great heart and soul.
1313997127975043083 2020-10-08 08:18:22 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Kacee602 @mavericksmovies @TrumpWarRoom üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ So you seriously do not see Trump bullying or name calling on a daily basis? Take off your blinders honey. Do you even read his tweets or hear his interviews and press conferences? WTF???
1313994366466306048 2020-10-08 08:07:24 +0800 <RSkarma1> A little Cat Love for anyone who needs it amidst all of this political stuff. Coco who is 19 and Louie who is 10.  https://t.co/n4v30qoWzq
1313949846244659209 2020-10-08 05:10:30 +0800 <RSkarma1> @mavericksmovies @TrumpWarRoom Exactly what I was thinking while reading all of these comments. We have a president that makes fun of, bullies and name calls anyone he doesn't like. He does it constantly and no one seems to have a problem with it.
1313855714490806273 2020-10-07 22:56:27 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ehsvr ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ He is insane!!!
1313855355785539589 2020-10-07 22:55:01 +0800 <RSkarma1> @shineb4 @JoeBiden Trump tweeted yesterday about giving no help to Blue States as opposed to Red States.  I'd say that is how he views our country.  Divided between parties when we are all Americans and should not be singled out by our president according to our political view
1313650892332302337 2020-10-07 09:22:33 +0800 <RSkarma1> @htownastro @love_avocadoe @pheadrick @realDonaldTrump @SteveFDA You can't be serious!!

1313587040735367168 2020-10-07 05:08:50 +0800 <RSkarma1> @WolfVanHalen I'm so sorry for your loss. My heart and prayers are with you and your family. üôèüôèüôè
1313586261131698183 2020-10-07 05:05:44 +0800 <RSkarma1> @johncusack Agree 100% !!  Trump has gone completely off his rocker. He was bad enough before but I think he has gone off the deep end since he came out of the hospital.
1313585281187090432 2020-10-07 05:01:50 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JoeBiden Trumps whole position seems to be "DIVIDE".  He talked about stopping any help for Democrat states. What kind of president even DOES that?  He has gone completely insane. I don't think he even KNOWS how crazy he sounds. He needs to be removed from office!!!
1313575292649308170 2020-10-07 04:22:09 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ChrisPawelski I don't understand either.  I don't understand anything anymore.  I don't understand why his people still support this kind of behavior.  And I don't understand why someone doesn't take away his damn phone!!!
1313573962622926848 2020-10-07 04:16:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ChrisPawelski You will NOT be re elected and we don't give 2 shits what kind of money you hold over our heads.  You are insane!!! The sooner you are out of office the better.  You are a disgusting excuse for a human being.
1313573038965903360 2020-10-07 04:13:12 +0800 <RSkarma1> RIP Eddie Van Halen.  There will never be another like you.
1313564206483021825 2020-10-07 03:38:06 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DogStarGirl @Mocraig13 He also said that "after he is elected again" he will put a very large stimulus package through. To be honest, I'd give up any amount of help just to have him kicked out of the White House. He is an evil, evil man. Blackmailing U.S. Citizens. Way to go ass!!!

1313519750375497729 2020-10-07 00:41:27 +0800 <RSkarma1> IF YOU ARE AN UNDECIDED VOTER, PLEASE TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT WHAT THE CURRENT PRESIDENT HAS DONE TO US. HE THRIVES ON FEAR AND HATRED. IT MAKES HIM FEEL STRONG. HE WANTS US TO TURN AGAINST EACH OTHER. HE ISN'T MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, HE IS DESROYING IT!!
1313517795498430464 2020-10-07 00:33:41 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump You are an idiot!!!
1313459328423260161 2020-10-06 20:41:21 +0800 <RSkarma1> @LiveFromDarylsH I absolutely love your show and I want to apologize for thinking that you were a fake account when you liked one of my tweets. I'm so embarrassed. I loved seeing you &amp; Tommy Shaw @tsgreatdivide collaborating. One of my favorites.
1313281403782651904 2020-10-06 08:54:20 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ProjectLincoln He reminds me of Jim Jones telling his followers in Guyana not to be afraid. Drink the kool aid. Do not be afraid. He is a fucking psychopathic, narcissistic excuse of a human being. He's going back on the campaign trail. Come one, come all. Infect yourselves
1313251167204507649 2020-10-06 06:54:11 +0800 <RSkarma1> @LiveFromDarylsH You DO know, don't you, that when you are simply retweeting everything from the official page, it pretty much proves you to be a fake account. I'm so sick of you fakes trying to make fans believe you are really following. LOSER!!!
1313250016300064771 2020-10-06 06:49:37 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump The Trump COVID tour. You are the most despicable human being I have ever seen in my lifetime. So you will go out there infecting America with this virus with not a care in the world? How do you even sleep at night? EVIL is what you are!!!
1313201162586402816 2020-10-06 03:35:29 +0800 <RSkarma1> @matthewjdowd TEN!!! TEN!!! TEN!!!
1313195034280439809 2020-10-06 03:11:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump I agree. Before that statement, I believed that he probably was sick. But there is no freaking way that after 3 days, he is feeling better than he was 20 years ago.  America, we have been had by this conman, lying president!!

1312551980175327232 2020-10-04 08:35:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JoeBiden My future president. Please do not have empathy for @realDonaldTrump . He has spread this virus with no regard for anyone. Please keep your campaign commercials going. Please do not let that man take you out.
1312550783578263552 2020-10-04 08:31:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ChrisPawelski I thought it's illegal to try an experimental drug on someone unless they are in a trial. So they gave him this infusion when he wasn't enrolled and it's not FDA approved. But he breaks the law always. Someone needs to make him responsible.
1312541650821042176 2020-10-04 07:54:50 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump It's not him.

1312190147715166208 2020-10-03 08:38:05 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JoeBiden I admire and respect you for this.
1312186006104276992 2020-10-03 08:21:37 +0800 <RSkarma1> @BarackObama I adore your compassion during this time. Joe has showed the same compassion. I am still afraid.
1312185434844196864 2020-10-03 08:19:21 +0800 <RSkarma1> @BHPIII13 @ddale8 After I heard about this, it's so hard to have compassion for Trump. I know that he would never do the same. Sick or not, he is a piece of shit human. God please do not let him get a sympathy vote.
1312184414038679553 2020-10-03 08:15:18 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ddale8 Are you fucking kidding me??
1312160433772457984 2020-10-03 06:40:00 +0800 <RSkarma1> @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump Perhaps if your dad had NOT discouraged Americans from wearing masks and avoiding crowds and social distancing, he might not have tested positive. Think of all of the Americans attending his rallies. Just ignorant behavior. I hope he, unlike so many, recovers
1312103671186948096 2020-10-03 02:54:27 +0800 <RSkarma1> @VoLinxx Yes, several.

1311833948721479681 2020-10-02 09:02:40 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Rosie @RudyCerda Ha! That was my first movie too.
1311672503039909888 2020-10-01 22:21:09 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump I don't think Joe was weak at all. You were so insecure about your position and lies that you had to talk over him every chance you could so that you weren't exposed like the Nazi White Supremist that you are. You looked like a 2 year old having a tantrum.

1311037090885513217 2020-09-30 04:16:15 +0800 <RSkarma1> @kylegriffin1 @DonaldJTrumpJr He learned to lie from the master.  He acts like this is some breaking news story or something, when actually, "alleged" is the word used several times as well as them stating that they do not know the accuracy of the allegation. Grasping at straws.
1311036115026051073 2020-09-30 04:12:22 +0800 <RSkarma1> @DonaldJTrumpJr You didn't bother to mention the fact that "alleged" is used several times on these accusations.  Stop trying to make it look like this proves anything.
1311019374447296513 2020-09-30 03:05:51 +0800 <RSkarma1> @caitrionambalfe @KelleAlexander8 Donald Trump is the one who started crying "fake news" about any article that was not showing him in a good light. He has caused mistrust of the press and news reporters everywhere. This is a drop in the bucket of everything he has done to cause division here
1310975316597395457 2020-09-30 00:10:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ChrisPawelski Dreaming of chasing mice. LOL  He looks so cozy and content.

1306385663030427651 2020-09-17 08:13:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> @howiemandel Tried many times. Never has happened. üò¢
1306385475595374592 2020-09-17 08:12:23 +0800 <RSkarma1> @StevieNicks Love you Stevie. You have forever been my favorite songwriter, artis and performer.
1306382417306030081 2020-09-17 08:00:14 +0800 <RSkarma1> @BrettLoudermilk @AGT I am rooting for your crazy ass! Lol
1306375342811238411 2020-09-17 07:32:07 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ChrisPawelski Flyers and other cat lovers. ‚ù§‚ù§

1306366075051925509 2020-09-17 06:55:18 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ChrisPawelski Thank you. Her sister is my 19 year old, Coco. She is a Tortie and the sweetest cat I've ever had. She got out of the house 2 weeks ago and my heart was broken. But thanks to the flyers we put out there, she was found. I'm the total cat lady. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
1306332175818776582 2020-09-17 04:40:35 +0800 <RSkarma1> @ChrisPawelski Oh my heart. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I always loved dinnertime when I had my 6 fur babies.  They would stand in a row, eating, with their tails straight up in the air. My ex got 3 when we split and I got 3. My calico passed away from asthma in 2012 but I have a 19 &amp; 10 year old
1305945196476215296 2020-09-16 03:02:52 +0800 <RSkarma1> Seems to me that this is exactly what our "so called President" is trying to do, considering his tweets today.
1305636330492383237 2020-09-15 06:35:33 +0800 <RSkarma1> @adamlambert My heart and prayers are with you all.
1305635187359875072 2020-09-15 06:31:00 +0800 <RSkarma1> @pulte HELP!!
1305635111690534913 2020-09-15 06:30:42 +0800 <RSkarma1> @adamlambert Eh..its Monday. But I watched The Show Must Go On again yesterday. I was so excited to see that my #1 pick on AI was such a great choice  Love you Adam.
1305634645690724355 2020-09-15 06:28:51 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Did it occur to you that they hate what America has become with your sorry ass in charge??
1305634370850562050 2020-09-15 06:27:46 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Debootsie I can totally relate!!
1304656344046333952 2020-09-12 13:41:26 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Quad_Finn THIS is the reason I prefer animals over humans any day. üêãüê¨
1304239677701054469 2020-09-11 10:05:45 +0800 <RSkarma1> @pamelab53951810 @dvillella @realDonaldTrump Because he just doesn't give a shit about anything but his ratings. His followers don't question anything he says or does. We've done well in Michigan, thanks to the Governor, and he is going to ruin it all &amp; set us back.
1304236370177785857 2020-09-11 09:52:36 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Quad_Finn So lucky for them. Why would they even THINK of trying to get close, especially when she has a calf with her? How beautiful though to see this mom &amp; her calf.
1304234174719692801 2020-09-11 09:43:53 +0800 <RSkarma1> @SawyerFrdrx Goodnight Sawyer. ‚ù§
1304064519627591680 2020-09-10 22:29:44 +0800 <RSkarma1> @pulte Covid has wreaked havoc on my finances. I'm trying to catch up on everything but I can't seem to do it. Even $5000 would fix everything. Someone else could be helped by getting the other $5000.
1303857874679066624 2020-09-10 08:48:36 +0800 <RSkarma1> @seanonolennon I am in shock. You look like your dad. You sound like your dad. I think I am a new huge fan. Thank you.
1303436982647914496 2020-09-09 04:56:08 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump So, you're saying that there should be NO low income housing?? WTF???  Whose American Dream are you talking about?  I cannot even believe the shit that comes out of that pea sized brain of yours!! I just pray that you are taken by force out of the WhiteHouse!
1303435133882699776 2020-09-09 04:48:47 +0800 <RSkarma1> @Fran79434361 @kdreed3164 @AngelaBelcamino @realDonaldTrump I thought the same thing. Easy to get a front row view. LOL
1303365810967244801 2020-09-09 00:13:19 +0800 <RSkarma1> @realDonaldTrump I swear to God, I am so sick of you name calling every single person that you ever mention!!! Bullying and name calling is a huge problem in this country and when our so called president does it, it encourages that kind of behavior.  Stop already!!
1302361171069145089 2020-09-06 05:41:14 +0800 <RSkarma1> @JackOsbourne I've been binge watching Jack &amp; Ozzy's World Detour and I absolutely LOVE Pearl. I love seeing her with you and her Papa. She is such a sweet child. You are an amazing dad. Love the show. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
1302249212445372416 2020-09-05 22:16:21 +0800 <RSkarma1> @tyhenrymedium I love yellow but am very drawn to the aqua. So what attributes does that signify?
1301671048518283266 2020-09-04 07:58:56 +0800 <RSkarma1> @tacobell. Mexican Pizza will be gone? So will I!!
