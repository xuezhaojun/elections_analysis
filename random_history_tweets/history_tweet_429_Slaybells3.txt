It does not approve of slaughtering babies. It does not approve of arson, rioting and looting. Look for the businesses marked racist and visit them frequently. Yelp is a Dem patsy.

These policies piss off most liberals but why? Do they want the black people you locked up still locked up or are they just  pedophiles or pedophile supporters?

You called him a racist and xenophobic for that. Prescription prices going down incredibly  including insulin. You know how you get rich from drug prices? Not him.

1311236466064977920 2020-09-30 17:28:29 +0800 <Slaybells3> @BretBaier Trump won this round. Joe couldn't answer any of the questions. It was a lot of, "The fact is" with no facts." Biden had no good points. He couldn't control his temper and resorted to childish behavior and name calling. Not the qualities of a leader. Chris Wallace is human trash
