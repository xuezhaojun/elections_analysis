1344041021638729733 2020-12-30 06:02:05 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @dennisromboy Well, we all know Romney doesn't need any more money.
1342882064429850624 2020-12-27 01:16:48 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @HowardA_Esq I once made a pizza with sauerkraut, thousand island dressing, and swiss cheese. I had a LOT of extra dough in the fridge, so decided to experiment. It was actually tasty.

1341564515897360384 2020-12-23 10:01:20 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @RepKinzinger @realDonaldTrump Could he be any more incompetent? And he wants to instigate a coup. So, that's troubling, too.
1341528066011492352 2020-12-23 07:36:29 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> This is not a comforting thread.

1340351873803460609 2020-12-20 01:42:43 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @RepKinzinger @realDonaldTrump He has now tweeted, but claims the cyber attack isn't all that bad and it was probably China at fault! He's a traitor. Please gather all your like minded colleagues and speak out together. Even if it's only two of you.

1340001441147047939 2020-12-19 02:30:14 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @1CuriousHippy @ASlavitt Because we had laptops/important documents, etc., we'd eat dinner before checking into our room, so we wouldn't have to leave the room (and leave everything unattended).
1339998784789467139 2020-12-19 02:19:40 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @1CuriousHippy @ASlavitt We also requested first floor rooms so we wouldn't have to use the elevator.
1339989472545439745 2020-12-19 01:42:40 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @1CuriousHippy @ASlavitt Here's what we did. Insist movers wear masks. Open all windows.  Don't use heat/ac for 3 hours after they leave. Traveling: Bring your own pillows, fresh cases each night. Bring your own blankets. Camp chairs to eat outside w/takeout food. Hot Pot to make coffee/tea in room.

1336825543019282432 2020-12-10 08:10:21 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @RepKinzinger Thank you for speaking out on this, but today the AG's of 17 states are joining Texas in a lawsuit to overturn the election. That's treasonous. Please keep speaking out. Why not join Senator Romney in a news conference?
1336818251473403905 2020-12-10 07:41:22 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @VoteDarlene @UtahAG Can citizens of Utah sue the AG? He's committing treason against our country by trying to overturn an election.

What about murder? Incest? Meth production? Spreading covid in your own home affects everyone.
1330948608640700417 2020-11-24 02:57:30 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @JordanSBrock @UtahCoronavirus Utah governor now telling us we need to be thankful, because our death toll is no where as bad as it was for the pilgrims at the first Thanksgiving????????? Also, he says Utah is the best state in the country????
1330944412260597760 2020-11-24 02:40:50 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @fox13 Herbert speaks out of both sides of his mouth: When you get together, wash your hands, have one person do the serving!  Also: Don't get together! I lived in Maryland and saw how Gov. Hogan handled covid. Hogan was amazing on messaging and getting covid under control.
1330942292593545216 2020-11-24 02:32:24 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> Herbert is a coward. December is going to be a disaster here in Utah. He's basically telling folks to get together for Thanksgiving. He starts his presser by emphasizing washing hands?
1330940015472328705 2020-11-24 02:23:22 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @Cristina2News @GovHerbert And go ahead, get together for Thanksgiving!! Just wash your hands with warm water and soap! Cook with a mask! BUT EVERYONE HAS TO REMOVE THEIR MASK TO EAT. Going to be a deadly December here in Utah.

1330937895813738499 2020-11-24 02:14:56 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @fox13 He starts by emphasizing washing your hands? How about wearing masks, social distancing, and not getting together with people outside of our own home? Christmas season will be deadly in Utah.

1327131673968959494 2020-11-13 14:10:22 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @MollyBeck Wisconsin legislators have blood on their hands.

1326988811063103489 2020-11-13 04:42:41 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @juliegoldberg I attempted to roast a goose and all the excess fat dripped over the edge of the pan, fell on the floor of the oven, and my house became a smelly, smoky mess.

1326963920414781441 2020-11-13 03:03:47 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @Aggiesalltheway Utah exempted churches from the mask mandate. It's beyond crazy here.
1326961199154561024 2020-11-13 02:52:58 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @HerbScribner When indoor dining shut down in Maryland, they allowed them to sell carry-out mixed drinks.
1326960305860009985 2020-11-13 02:49:25 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @HerbScribner Utah needs to ban inside dining snd drinking and include churches in mask mandate.
1326958385598615553 2020-11-13 02:41:47 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> WHAT? Is this a typo?
1326952071023620097 2020-11-13 02:16:41 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> Please call your Senators and Congressman today, especially if they're Republicans.
1326935064274370561 2020-11-13 01:09:07 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @tech_52 @chrislhayes We're the same. However, back in March, it was a lot scarier because mask use wasn't a thing. Now, I can go to the store and almost everyone is wearing a mask. I'm just tired because so many other people haven't take this seriously. And there's going to be so many more deaths.
1326933807258202112 2020-11-13 01:04:07 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @RockyMountViews I don't make crust, but I know that lard is the best for texture. I would think a combo of lard and butter would be great for taste.

1326931551905443845 2020-11-13 00:55:09 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @CheckRare Churches are exempt, which is completely mad.

1326914555084230660 2020-11-12 23:47:37 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @Loliz @BillKristol I agree, but Romney is 100% better than Utah's other Senator.
1326645015813058560 2020-11-12 05:56:34 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> Sums it up nicely.

1325858961279479808 2020-11-10 01:53:04 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> He didn't include churches! Rgh

1324439246342561792 2020-11-06 03:51:37 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @GovHerbert You're going to have to have a mask mandate that includes religious meetings.

1324386470786854913 2020-11-06 00:21:55 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @PatrickW Yup. Jill Stein did that 4 years ago.

1323357009840807938 2020-11-03 04:11:12 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @RockyMountViews I also like passive-aggressive toddlers. Especially the ones with their noses hanging out.

1322320002238742528 2020-10-31 07:30:30 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @gtshimes @CALRanch Exactly. We won't shop at stores in Weber County unless employees are wearing masks.

1322216377583759362 2020-10-31 00:38:44 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @FPWellman They said the same about Hillary.

1321592046960824321 2020-10-29 07:17:52 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @world_covid19 @sltrib Just went for a walk in a park in Weber County. Several groups of moms and kids, sitting closely in groups, no masks. We are never going to get this under control.
1321541656689061889 2020-10-29 03:57:38 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> @SandraTayler Yep. Saw two store clerks yesterday in Weber County not wearing masks. Left quickly and went to their competitors to shop.

1321201137253453824 2020-10-28 05:24:32 +0800 <CarlaBLABLABLA> Check out Gov. Hogan in Maryland. There, Covid positivity rate is BELOW 4%. They just arrested someone for refusing to wear a mask at a polling place. @GovHerbert is NOT EVEN TRYING. Positivity in #Utah is 17.5%. I am angry.
