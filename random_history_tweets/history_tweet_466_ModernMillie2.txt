1338329195735363585 2020-12-14 11:45:19 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @RyanRobinsonJ @BardsFM teaches to let our speech be unambiguous-yes means yes, no means no. Ambiguity can be a kin to deception. We are to be careful taking oaths, which promise behaviour. If one renigs on an oath, God is not happy, but He’s not against them. Be careful how one speaks and be true.

He uses people to do the work (has to b/c He gave us dominion over the Earth. But no one HAS to play (freedom). He’ll substitute players if need (Esther). Our part is to keep faith in Him and do our part.
1337775289804484615 2020-12-12 23:04:18 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Cog_Ni_Zant @Colorado_Right I understand the issue. That’s why we’re to take the log out of our own eye first. When we “find” ourselves, and are in right relationship with the Creator, other people see the light and are drawn to God also. That’s my understanding.
1337763303934873601 2020-12-12 22:16:40 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @CoralineElise Correct.
1337762756666208258 2020-12-12 22:14:30 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right @Cog_Ni_Zant Christianity grew out Judaism (with all its faults as Y’shua pointed out. He was a Jew.) And I would agree on your description of what we need to do, and include repentance. We are told to encourage and uphold each other. No one wants to be in a foxhole with a pessimist.

1332363817360248836 2020-11-28 00:41:02 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @RealMFlynnJr Beautiful story! I recall the folks who curse USA for sending carriers to foreign shores when catastrophe strikes b/c they’re “war machines.” They are ignorant of the massive capabilities of the US military to do good and help during times of crisis. God sees.

1332333110931955713 2020-11-27 22:39:01 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milliman @GovofCO I guess we have to go to Larimer County.

When people, in this case LEO, take oaths to uphold the Constitution and then act like this, God can get very angry. In general, I back the blue. Who’s coercing this behavior?

1331955032380542978 2020-11-26 21:36:40 +0800 <ModernMillie2> A good read for this great day: George Washington’s proclamation given 3 October 1789 recommending 26 November to be a solemn day of thanksgiving.
1331954322188476421 2020-11-26 21:33:51 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty And to you! We read George Washington’s proclamation given 3 October 1789 as part of our celebration. It’s pretty powerful. I recommend all to give it a read.

1329898384497532931 2020-11-21 05:24:17 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @QPrayerTeam Everyday this is my world. I want out.
1329870902016831488 2020-11-21 03:35:05 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @FogCityMidge @MajorPatriot @realDonaldTrump The sentiments of many.
1329868120903864322 2020-11-21 03:24:02 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @drmtsu @BlueSky_Report @MajorPatriot That would be true, good guys and bad guys. God helps the good guys.
1329806454258237442 2020-11-20 23:18:59 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @cjtruth God bless you!
1329805375848075268 2020-11-20 23:14:42 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @_Discernment_ 🙏🙏🙏 Y’ovah is good.

1329795798754856963 2020-11-20 22:36:39 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @mjd_america We need targeted citizen campaigns: 1 to show privately owned businesses that we will support them in their DEFIANCE of “orders.” (2) targeted at our local department of dis-health that we recognise their mafia tactics &amp; we THE PEOPLE stand together against the tyranny!
1329793650201604102 2020-11-20 22:28:07 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @StopTheCoup2020 And we’re not surprised.
1329787574941065218 2020-11-20 22:03:58 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @PaulWestonEden @JoeBiden You are correct.
1329739171506819072 2020-11-20 18:51:38 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @100_shades @IranNewsUpdate1 @HeshmatAlavi Sadly, we can believe it to be true.
1329735304895488000 2020-11-20 18:36:16 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Usatorz1 Indeed, we must pray. Recognising the enemy is “within” is the first battle. We’ve never experienced this before and people MUST wake up. Now.
1329732911470415872 2020-11-20 18:26:45 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @WayneDupreeShow Wish one of the Broncos wives would have the guts to say the same for Colorado. I guess Polis pays his friends more than Whitmer.
1329671147689025536 2020-11-20 14:21:20 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @jeffhunt God have mercy on this nation.
1329668879786926082 2020-11-20 14:12:19 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @prayingmedic @78Morpheus True of many local talk-radio show hosts also.
1329668371328212992 2020-11-20 14:10:18 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GeorgenewsOrg Indeed. Sweet rest to the departed, comfort to the family, b’shem Y’shua.
1329664708807372802 2020-11-20 13:55:45 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @BlondK8 @dmills3710 We’ve always been pro-choice for each and EVERY individual. That’s why we stand up to protect the choice of those who cannot speak for themselves: the unborn! Those who claim pro-choice only for themselves are narcissistic at best, and pure evil at worst.
1329655576918433792 2020-11-20 13:19:28 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @AwakenedOutlaw 😂😂🤣 Belly laugh! Thank you!
1329651647082061824 2020-11-20 13:03:51 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @FieldofFight So true. But the left is sadly accustomed to mob rule. Justice is a God thing, and they will have a rude awakening.
1329588612514672645 2020-11-20 08:53:22 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @2020FeelingBlue @GovofCO When do you get to take the mask off, dear little one? When your master says you can get off your knees?
1329581739166081038 2020-11-20 08:26:03 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem Yes, it does.

1329564258661765121 2020-11-20 07:16:36 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @CoralineElise Thanks for the heads up. I’ll check it out.
1329529263431831555 2020-11-20 04:57:32 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @anonpatriotq @MajorPatriot I love that kind of talk.
1329529004534210560 2020-11-20 04:56:30 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @mjd_america Yes, those are grand memories. Mine are adults now-good men, still good sons, and we get to have adult conversations. Enjoy it all and be blessed!
1329491515379380224 2020-11-20 02:27:32 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @co_hurricane @jaredpolis Valid questions all. Looking forward to the answers.
1329490407365906432 2020-11-20 02:23:08 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @ColoradoWinds Can we do the same for Polis?
1329453835627147273 2020-11-19 23:57:49 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milehihappy May the LORD lighten his load! God wins.
1329279891779579904 2020-11-19 12:26:37 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @ColoradoWinds A reasonable suggestion. If one comes with a grand idea, don’t expect someone else to do the work of it. I’ll take butter on mine please.
1329278974040698880 2020-11-19 12:22:58 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milehihappy Grateful for his work and happy he gets connected to the good guys!
1329278496087158784 2020-11-19 12:21:04 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @AwakenedOutlaw Of course, Australia.
1329273619537678336 2020-11-19 12:01:42 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @DeAngelisCorey Agreed.
1329252341535678465 2020-11-19 10:37:09 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Allenma15086871 God bless you and your work!
1329244270402920449 2020-11-19 10:05:04 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milehihappy I’m with you! I love when a thunderstorm or a blizzard comes, knowing my loved ones are safe: I’m grateful that my God shows His power to stop, quiet (control) the earth. No change. No control. FREEDOM!

1329218091037888514 2020-11-19 08:21:03 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MajorPatriot Indeed!
1329218027523624961 2020-11-19 08:20:48 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @prayingmedic @MajorPatriot So true.
1329193448856055808 2020-11-19 06:43:08 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @cjtruth The fear and oppression was palpable today. Praise Yah! He wins. And POTUS gets four more years!
1329192734264004608 2020-11-19 06:40:17 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milliman Oh indeed it is. Yet today, when visiting a long-time family owned hardware store, the fear is palpable. Where is the American spirit to protest and throw off tyranny?
1329187500699639827 2020-11-19 06:19:29 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Emmee83 Cause if we don’t laugh, we’ll cry.

1328996899525980161 2020-11-18 17:42:07 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @sanaonline__ @catturd2 It probably only cost that. His self-esteem comes from his noble alliance to (imagined) social justice, not anything material. Just wish he had some brains under that “do.”

1328794329402499072 2020-11-18 04:17:10 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milliman @GovofCO That’s their motto!
1328794090738229249 2020-11-18 04:16:13 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milliman @GovofCO @CDPHE So I’ve heard rumor that each state has its “plan.” Hadn’t got around to looking up specifics for CO. What proof can you share?
1328716927116701697 2020-11-17 23:09:36 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right @FBI @TheJusticeDept So what?

1328440930265870339 2020-11-17 04:52:53 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @mjd_america Makes me ill to watch him. So I don’t. His opinion is as meaningless as he is.
1328440072027463684 2020-11-17 04:49:29 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MapleSyru_p Encouraging.
1328424667355471874 2020-11-17 03:48:16 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Emmee83 Yeah, he’s been arrested. I hope there’s no bail.
1328424306351755271 2020-11-17 03:46:50 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @codeofvets Amen.

1328423236275761154 2020-11-17 03:42:35 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @StopTheCoup2020 I fear this may be a very long list.
1328401976422502401 2020-11-17 02:18:06 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @CrunchyDoughnu1 Just got back from two shops, one large retail, another privately owned. No masks, and NO ONE said anything. JUST DO IT PEOPLE!
1328368366294282242 2020-11-17 00:04:33 +0800 <ModernMillie2> This is SO good! Aptly phrased and true!
1328367031540912128 2020-11-16 23:59:14 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @LWDoyleUSA Not shocked, hopeful.
1328363714576338947 2020-11-16 23:46:04 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @ctwilliamsiii @MattWalshBlog Had the same question.
1328351796184690691 2020-11-16 22:58:42 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @SeanCordanon I like that description: much of God is open source. At least the parts we need on a daily basis.
1328350742634254342 2020-11-16 22:54:31 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Emmee83 @dbongino I agree, it makes no sense. This is the current state of our world.
1328349225277644802 2020-11-16 22:48:29 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Emmee83 A common tactic of cowards and dirtbags: hide behind the women and children.
1328346948445876224 2020-11-16 22:39:26 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right The state wants total control.
1328332494333235202 2020-11-16 21:42:00 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @flynn_neill Agreed.

1328325797518733313 2020-11-16 21:15:23 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milehihappy @co_hurricane @josephmarsh I find this so hard to believe. People were checking ID’s to verify signatures when collected; the plan was to over-collect; petitions get turned in on the 13th and all is done on 14th. Doesn’t jive in my mind.

1328041413502767104 2020-11-16 02:25:21 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @StopTheCoup2020 @TheDemocrats That they did.

1328014800698421248 2020-11-16 00:39:36 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MajorPatriot That’s a lot of upset people. God help us set it right.

1327988756071243777 2020-11-15 22:56:06 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right Is he bribed or blackmailed?
1327988574789234690 2020-11-15 22:55:23 +0800 <ModernMillie2> Add the profits from all the made-in-China crap being sold to the sheep: masks, gloves, face shields...

Can’t do that without gloves, masks, and signing tracking papers! I walked out! God forbid the day no vaccine - no health care, no food!

1326717799683731458 2020-11-12 10:45:47 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem I can believe that. Their hearts are evil and their policies follow
1326716833534271490 2020-11-12 10:41:56 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty Happy for you! If people need a wake-up about human trafficking, I would heartily recommend the documentary film - America’s Forgotten. Praise Yah we have a POTUS who wants to stop this evil!

And there’s much I don’t “know.” But I am confident that the LORD did not give us Trump, and ACB, and SO much more, only to have HIS enemies succeed. Shalom, shalom folks.

1326293087702888449 2020-11-11 06:38:08 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right Same here. My point remains, the answer to our conundrum is a return to God, that our good foundation (Constitution) remains.
1326284916838068225 2020-11-11 06:05:40 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right Not if those laws are unjust or are unjustly enforced.  Y’shua illustrated that perfectly.

The eldest went on to graduate summa cum laude from a top rated engineering school. The youngest, with Downs Syndrome, has been independently (sans gov’t assist) and gainfully employed for 15+ years.

1326258930989883392 2020-11-11 04:22:24 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Emmee83 Satan hates people &amp; would like to get rid of them. Truth. We have been told by God to be good stewards of the land. Truth. Environmental “religion”claims humans are a cancer &amp; must be reduced in # to save earth. So satan perverts killing of humans into being good stewards. BS!
1326251225906548739 2020-11-11 03:51:47 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right Elections are a man-made process. We cannot expect them to solve spiritual problems. Politics is the art of living together. My Messiah was politically “incorrect” because He acknowledged an authority higher than man. That’s where we solve many of these troubles.

1325613365495013377 2020-11-09 09:37:09 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @BardsFM Because God does.
1325573917843533826 2020-11-09 07:00:24 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem ALL elective offices will be illegitimate. We will no longer have Representative Republic, or even an honest democracy. It will be very bad, very quickly.
1325568911358779397 2020-11-09 06:40:31 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @WayneDupreeShow She is beautiful and the love of her family &amp; friends is inspiring. BUT, Amazon profits and average Americans get screwed. That’s the meta-message
1325566611433074693 2020-11-09 06:31:22 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @DanielMannix10 Correct!
1325563943985799169 2020-11-09 06:20:46 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem They live in an echo chamber. Are you surprised?
1325563375871471619 2020-11-09 06:18:31 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @DanielMannix10 This isn’t over till the electoral college meets, so don’t despair. Remember all that positive energy at the rallies? Be strong, be strong and of good cheer!
1325536009191350274 2020-11-09 04:29:46 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MajorPatriot Yes indeed!
1325528641380478978 2020-11-09 04:00:29 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MajorPatriot Amen. We are all a half-shekel in His eyes. Exodus 30:13-25.
1325527529843732490 2020-11-09 03:56:04 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @QPrayerTeam Agreed.
1325518065480708096 2020-11-09 03:18:28 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @TheOnlooker18 And He laughs at their plans.
1325498808487309313 2020-11-09 02:01:57 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Emmee83 You’re sensible, the world is not.
1325450174978781185 2020-11-08 22:48:42 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @CoralineElise I delight in the light at those times, when it’s pinkish. It’s almost tangible, and SO peaceful, reassuring. God is good.
1325440124558184449 2020-11-08 22:08:45 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MajorPatriot Telling it is.
1325271641308467202 2020-11-08 10:59:16 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MapleSyru_p @BretBaier @marthamaccallum @FoxNews Better than having a headache.
1325254968392224773 2020-11-08 09:53:01 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @StopTheCoup2020 Yes, two different ones over the course of six days.
1325227688135700481 2020-11-08 08:04:37 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milehihappy I seem to only become more abashed for living here. Were we part of the testing ground these past few elections?
1325227090271219713 2020-11-08 08:02:14 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem Well we knew he was an ass, right? Am I allowed to say that?
1325226840055832576 2020-11-08 08:01:14 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @jaredpolis You are an ass. But we knew that didn’t we.
1325226586472321032 2020-11-08 08:00:14 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @StopTheCoup2020 @USPS While watching, I saw several of those also: “I didn’t get mine.” The malfeasance may have been higher than the individual carrier though. I don’t want to jump on the wrong person.
1325213738081939457 2020-11-08 07:09:11 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @StopTheCoup2020 @USPS I’ve a friendly relationship with my carrier. I think I’ll tell him what he can tell his manager on my behalf AND write a letter. If management knows their people are hearing about it, the effect may be greater.
1325182563078426624 2020-11-08 05:05:18 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem Let me know...
1325089521051070465 2020-11-07 22:55:35 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @doqholliday Painful but pretty? Painful, but GOOD.
1325089169895542784 2020-11-07 22:54:11 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Emmee83 Valid question.
1325076160364077056 2020-11-07 22:02:30 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem Agreed.
1325075960597803008 2020-11-07 22:01:42 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @March_for_Life True.
1325072861514641408 2020-11-07 21:49:23 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @united__UK @dyolltrah @realDonaldTrump And there are many like you!
1325005898843033600 2020-11-07 17:23:18 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milliman @COSecofState Yes.
1325005375154892800 2020-11-07 17:21:13 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milliman @GovofCO Agreed. Fear and intimidation are used to force compliance because there is no logic.
1324873066636304384 2020-11-07 08:35:28 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @RepKenBuck You’re walking a fine line: The state GOP in Colorado has been screwing their own for too long. You get no brownie points for speaking up now.
1324871880956911616 2020-11-07 08:30:46 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @KirstenCompton0 @RepKenBuck That’s NOT what’s happening. There’s been little to NO transparency in some places.
1324870973183700995 2020-11-07 08:27:09 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @laurenboebert Yes!
1324805794018316294 2020-11-07 04:08:09 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem The wolves are everywhere it seems.
1324788011205160961 2020-11-07 02:57:29 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @ThomasSowell Well put and sadly true.
1324767763798364163 2020-11-07 01:37:02 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @SKYRIDER4538 @EricTrump Yes, we do!
1324766534137466881 2020-11-07 01:32:09 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Wizard_Predicts @CoreysDigs With military oversight?
1324766148622209025 2020-11-07 01:30:37 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @moreywrites @Chris_Ryan1984 @DocSweney @GregRubini Which is so telling of your heart and the corruption you side with. Sad.
1324763211946696704 2020-11-07 01:18:57 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @PaulWestonEden I use to keep that quote on my locker at work. Time again?
1324762351057461248 2020-11-07 01:15:32 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @PatrickForCO No joke.
1324761682938368001 2020-11-07 01:12:52 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right Hope for the best. Plan for the worst. Do the most. Leave the rest.
1324761210777206790 2020-11-07 01:11:00 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @CoralineElise @joyinliberty Psalm 2 - three voices.
1324736722618503170 2020-11-06 23:33:41 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @CNN Bull crap.
1324720628361027584 2020-11-06 22:29:44 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @WeTheInevitable @kate_awakening Agreed.
1324714539645108225 2020-11-06 22:05:32 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @cjtruth We continue to pray for all in this epic battle. #GodWinsALWAYS
1324714095342505985 2020-11-06 22:03:46 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @shekinah1313 Correct. My LORD and Saviour was political. I think it’s time to turn some tables over.
1324712082042986496 2020-11-06 21:55:46 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @cjtruth Preach it!
1324708008530759680 2020-11-06 21:39:35 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @steelcitycrazy @TBeansprout True in many states: the GOP screws their own.
1324707178159243265 2020-11-06 21:36:17 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @codeofvets Now.
1324706205240053760 2020-11-06 21:32:25 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right @DonaldJTrumpJr I disagree. Hunter’s laptop was his. My vote is MINE. This war is becoming personal for a whole lot of folk right now, and that will change the dynamic greatly.
1324705004624687104 2020-11-06 21:27:39 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @andreamoede Amen to number six.
1324704557218365440 2020-11-06 21:25:52 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right True. There’s a lot of garbage. And whenever we deep clean the house, the mess typically gets worse before it it gets better.
1324635495016603648 2020-11-06 16:51:27 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @SeanCordanon Indeed.
1324630521482235905 2020-11-06 16:31:41 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @SeanCordanon When life gets a little too interesting, my friends and I joke that God doesn’t want His children to get bored. Maybe that goes for His angels also.🤷‍♀️
1324625023051681793 2020-11-06 16:09:50 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @DanielMannix10 @MrAndyNgo Rain is God’s blessing.
1324610074766135298 2020-11-06 15:10:26 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty I don’t, but in  my state, the fear porn persists. Local county health has put us back to same restrictions as months ago, increased threat of citation, etc. It’s sad the level of compliance.
1324569079613673472 2020-11-06 12:27:32 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @ScottPresler God bless your efforts.
1324563404334530560 2020-11-06 12:04:59 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @mjd_america Several newly sold homes in my neighborhood, all have cars with California plates.
1324506447015804928 2020-11-06 08:18:39 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @theWPMyth Agreed, every “legal” vote.
1324505160199131137 2020-11-06 08:13:32 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @TheOnlooker18 Good man.
1324503314281701379 2020-11-06 08:06:12 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @lalovestrump @Emmee83 Yes.
1324501456427384834 2020-11-06 07:58:49 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MapleSyru_p @CPRverlee Indeed.
1324501302123155457 2020-11-06 07:58:13 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right @Acosta Ah those pesky anonymous sources.
1324464883115741189 2020-11-06 05:33:30 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem Say something righteous and hopeful. Our faith should not be in anything of man, it must be in our LORD.
1324415628782915585 2020-11-06 02:17:47 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem Agreed.
1324408137747673095 2020-11-06 01:48:01 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @andreamoede It’s very dark in once Colorful Colorado.
1324389771876028416 2020-11-06 00:35:02 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @codeofvets @Mike25458538 Amen!
1324389659410010113 2020-11-06 00:34:35 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milehihappy I hope so.
1324388450175381504 2020-11-06 00:29:47 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @prayingmedic God bless the folks who take the long view!
1324388222630125569 2020-11-06 00:28:52 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @DC_Draino That was my sister’s dream last night. She’s not on bird-talk.
1324387730214674432 2020-11-06 00:26:55 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @bradfordmoneys @chiIIum You can do it! Keep a light heart and keep marching.
1324386811666288641 2020-11-06 00:23:16 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @DanielMannix10 God wins and those with Him!
1324384190184460291 2020-11-06 00:12:51 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @NeedTermLimits Me too!
1324375255239008258 2020-11-05 23:37:21 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @RitaVotesRed @dyolltrah 🤢🤢🤮 Party affiliation is worthless. One loves the Republic and upholds it or LEAVE!
1324374450603700224 2020-11-05 23:34:09 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @CoralineElise If we desire God’s blessing, we must: do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly. When we clean up this mess, He will be pleased.
1324373362219667459 2020-11-05 23:29:49 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty Colorado! Should we do it again?
1324350692312731650 2020-11-05 21:59:44 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right @wattystrick @laurenboebert Our system may be pretty good, but it is not without risk. And yes, we need Lauren X 1000, and a GOP that actually cares.
1324347870078771201 2020-11-05 21:48:32 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right Stop cursing.
1324338946466291712 2020-11-05 21:13:04 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @codeofvets Beautiful day to all who serve!
1324306904814964736 2020-11-05 19:05:45 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @SeanCordanon God bless all you good folk here on bird-talk that encourage, tell truth, and bless the world. Your Creator delights in you.
1324304055884283904 2020-11-05 18:54:25 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @SeanCordanon God is good.
1324301078393925633 2020-11-05 18:42:36 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @cjtruth I am so grateful for the good folk, like you, here on bird-talk, that fear God, speak blessing, tell truth, and hunger and thirst for righteousness. God bless you ALL mightily!
1324298181644079111 2020-11-05 18:31:05 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @BeholdIsrael Call itinto being! Praise Yah! He wins!
1324294363581734912 2020-11-05 18:15:55 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty @realDonaldTrump 🥰🇺🇸🙏
1324293825976848385 2020-11-05 18:13:46 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MapleSyru_p Hallelu-Yah!
1324208563095556096 2020-11-05 12:34:58 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @WayneDupreeShow I certainly hope so.
1324207817700577285 2020-11-05 12:32:00 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @logosphile1 What a lovely phrase: “He’s in the waiting.” Thank you for sharing that. God wins!
1324174403442192384 2020-11-05 10:19:14 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @VoteThemAVoice Wolves are more important than humans it seems. So telling, and so sad.
1324173956992192512 2020-11-05 10:17:27 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @BWRtrain @Aq0ll0 @KamVTV God is able, but where is our free will if He acts without our consent? He desires that we desire Him, and His ways. When we do our part, He will help, and He will win.
1324172427690127362 2020-11-05 10:11:23 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right In CO perhaps. I still pray and believe for the USA we win. After it goes to SCOTUS.
1324145466158669825 2020-11-05 08:24:15 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milliman Feel like a political prisoner yet?
1324120332328980481 2020-11-05 06:44:22 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty Not fraud, but subtle intimidation by two D poll watchers. I asked them to be quiet. They obliged.
1324118758051454980 2020-11-05 06:38:07 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @RebelRising2020 @MajorPatriot Grand idea.
1324107212604665856 2020-11-05 05:52:14 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @mjd_america Never.

1324015626978004998 2020-11-04 23:48:19 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MajorPatriot Thanks for the encouragement.
1324015342130241536 2020-11-04 23:47:11 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @StopTheCoup2020 I remain encouraged that Trump will continue as POTUS, but looking at the bs that got passed in CO yesterday, it’s probably time to leave.
1323971934317613064 2020-11-04 20:54:42 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @AngelWarrior321 Amen.

1323839693167955969 2020-11-04 12:09:13 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @StopTheCoup2020 @SenCoryGardner I blame the rhino State GOP also. Grass root conservatives have been betrayed by them too many times.

1323771193174990848 2020-11-04 07:37:01 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @TheOnlooker18 Sadly, some are.

1323643158404780034 2020-11-03 23:08:15 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem Both descriptions trouble me. In CO, if one pays a $5 fee, one’s information will not be released. How many know that? What troubles me is the weaponising of public info by nasty folks.

1323268210028806145 2020-11-02 22:18:21 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right My God tells me to not delight in my/His enemies destruction: they are human beings. My hope might be, that if they succeed (&amp; May they NOT), the devastation which will sadly come all, comes quickly: That eyes would be opened, hearts turned, and souls saved before He shoes up.

1322165648349343745 2020-10-30 21:17:09 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem But they feel good about themselves, even though it hurts so many. The left are SO selfish.

1320547327283761152 2020-10-26 10:06:32 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @andreamoede Thank you! And God bless!
1320546915411501058 2020-10-26 10:04:53 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @NoRestrictions So true. The world no longer values wisdom: what to do with knowledge.

1320375332168470529 2020-10-25 22:43:05 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @molmccann Agreed. That’s why are ballots get held until Election Day. Whisk Moët people did the same. Plus, those pesky October surprises...
1320354994164539392 2020-10-25 21:22:16 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right True.

1320110551872212992 2020-10-25 05:10:56 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @78Morpheus I agree. I think it’s God giving a choice between 7 years of tribulation or 3 1/2. I’ll take the lesser. #TrumpAll50
1320109781949046786 2020-10-25 05:07:53 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem @CDPHE @GovofCO And judging from today’s rally, he’ll be POTUS again! #TrumpAll50

1320102537329082388 2020-10-25 04:39:05 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @flynn_neill One can spot the counterfeit quickly when one knows the real thing intimately.
1320008068348940294 2020-10-24 22:23:42 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right @GovtsTheProblem I’ve experienced the same.
1319999227980926977 2020-10-24 21:48:35 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @SeanCordanon Agreed. But when our faith falters, brothers and sisters are there to encourage and uphold, and exhort, and admonish, and...
1319998080318570496 2020-10-24 21:44:01 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty Had one of those yesterday. Thanks to fellow patriQt for being messenger.
1319996718470094849 2020-10-24 21:38:36 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty In good conscious, I could lie about Jews hiding or another situation to preserve life, but I would have to deliver the ballots untampered.

1319958556586770432 2020-10-24 19:06:58 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @TheOnlooker18 It will not stand!

1319796510637412352 2020-10-24 08:23:03 +0800 <ModernMillie2> The battle has many fronts...

1319785843154976775 2020-10-24 07:40:40 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem At this point testing positive is like finding out you have an X chromosome. Get over it people.

1319736329555578880 2020-10-24 04:23:55 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem @Colorado_Right Is this specific to recall? He tried to prevent signatures for Prop 115 also. Nasty man he is!
1319659005288026112 2020-10-23 23:16:39 +0800 <ModernMillie2> We don’t have to follow Torah. We get to. And it is a blessing! No “oral law”, text only, God’s teaching and instruction. I don’t understand all of Abba’s rules, but He alone is good and I trust him! Be blessed!
1319373037796528134 2020-10-23 04:20:19 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem I like! And I agree!
1319364735389913089 2020-10-23 03:47:20 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @mjd_america He’s waiting patiently for his human to go play. People get their priorities turned round some times. 🙃
1319125364082417664 2020-10-22 11:56:09 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Americanlll @Qanon76 Always good advice.
1319115635448795137 2020-10-22 11:17:30 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @DanielMannix10 The atheist asking the rabbi how he (rabbi) got his sons to treat him with such respect while the atheist’s sons disrespect their father: The rabbi replies, “It’s simple. In my world, I am one generation closer to the Creator. In yours, you are one generation closer to an ape.”
1319081594532102145 2020-10-22 09:02:14 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @EmSee36 @realDonaldTrump Happy for you! This is a grand, beautiful, and blessed country. Let’s keep it that way! #TrumpAll50
1319080254275801088 2020-10-22 08:56:54 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @SevenCentillion @GrimblesOc Maybe it’s holy water. Social-distancing baptism?

1319018702684229638 2020-10-22 04:52:19 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right @observe2learn1 They’re also verifying if one has read any article referenced (via twitter link). Big Brother is watching.
1319017080310681607 2020-10-22 04:45:52 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @doqholliday Agreed.

1318970856534609925 2020-10-22 01:42:12 +0800 <ModernMillie2> Grand idea!
1318970646190239746 2020-10-22 01:41:21 +0800 <ModernMillie2> Agreed.
1318970324352978952 2020-10-22 01:40:05 +0800 <ModernMillie2> If one was still questioning: Big Brother is here and watching everything you do.
1318968944376619009 2020-10-22 01:34:36 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @HollywoodInToto Broken indeed. Can we throw them out soon?

1318921865000341506 2020-10-21 22:27:31 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Lights2TheWorld @co_hurricane Big news, good news! I expect Polis will ignore as his minions in the statehouse and county leaders do as they are told. Yes, mein fuhrer!
1318918890227892225 2020-10-21 22:15:42 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem And I’d bet a five spot those bubbles are made in China. Our enemies capitalise on fear.
1318917905355034624 2020-10-21 22:11:47 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @mjd_america Yes. Clean-up’s easy too.

Quercetin, zinc: OTC supplements. I’m “at risk”, and don’t wear a mask 98% of the time. Fear mongering. Color revolution. Get over this! #TrumpAll50

1318543880393052161 2020-10-20 21:25:33 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem The environmental/green religion loves to push their doctrine.

1317664152463282182 2020-10-18 11:09:49 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @StopTheCoup2020 @ACTBrigitte @rickdanna4719 Age, length of residency, primary or sole place of residency-several things to consider. But agreed, our elderly should never be forced out of their homes because they can’t afford the property tax. Especially in a system that uses fiat currency which facilitates inflation.
1317662281900187648 2020-10-18 11:02:23 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @KerithEbel And those matter much more than money.
1317614807202385920 2020-10-18 07:53:44 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty I see beautiful eyes! God bless.

1317248952635412483 2020-10-17 07:39:58 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty Indeed! We are told to encourage and uphold each other.
1317240495576330240 2020-10-17 07:06:21 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @EmSee36 Good for babe, and mom, and education for sibling. God bless!
1317239937499103232 2020-10-17 07:04:08 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @VoteThemAVoice Beautiful!
1317212061286518785 2020-10-17 05:13:22 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milliman @CDPHE @CDCgov Agreed.
1317212005640667141 2020-10-17 05:13:09 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @dutchsheets You are not alone.
1317211766523387905 2020-10-17 05:12:12 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Lights2TheWorld Agreed.
1317211548314718210 2020-10-17 05:11:20 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MapleSyru_p Kind of you! I periodically order from a bakery in the UP of Michigan, so maybe!
1317156727226236928 2020-10-17 01:33:30 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right @GovtsTheProblem If only...
1317153030442278915 2020-10-17 01:18:48 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MapleSyru_p Can I mail order?
1317152398213873666 2020-10-17 01:16:17 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @JohnSpelic That was rough. Still, people need to know. Thank you. Vote YES on 115! #VoteThemAVoice
1317125108234964998 2020-10-16 23:27:51 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem Agreed. Sign the petition people!
1316987720305168384 2020-10-16 14:21:55 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @RedDJalapeno @BardsFM I’ll take purple in Colorado!
1316985332701810688 2020-10-16 14:12:26 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @SomeBitchIKnow Comic relief, yes? I can never reconcile those who benefit from capitalism (Lavender Moon Farm) who then go to such effort to destroy that which was their benefactor-the Republic. Pure hate it is, to the point of suicide. BTW, thank you for your work.
1316974938608312320 2020-10-16 13:31:08 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty I like!
1316966950279536642 2020-10-16 12:59:23 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @andreamoede He is good.
1316966501157605376 2020-10-16 12:57:36 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @vijaya What’s the age of “consent”?
1316959207346888709 2020-10-16 12:28:37 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @EthicalSkeptic Correlation is not causation, but...
1316955176725565440 2020-10-16 12:12:36 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @KellyEvansInPG @joyinliberty Thank you for your efforts.
1316941887778029570 2020-10-16 11:19:48 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @DenverLarry7 @Kotzkercrazy1 @randycorporon Sounds right.
1316886265007165440 2020-10-16 07:38:46 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @HollywoodInToto Sometimes we go through tough places to help other people. Stay strong, fear not, and be healed. Your Maker loves you both.
1316841132282839043 2020-10-16 04:39:26 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty Can’t happen fast enough, but SO many are paralysed by fear! And in the meantime, the Republic and all free nations are at risk!
1316830537013694469 2020-10-16 03:57:20 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @NoRestrictions He cannot stop our thanksgiving!
1316826807862276096 2020-10-16 03:42:31 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem All of the above?
1316821233342853125 2020-10-16 03:20:22 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @VenusStarshine 🙏🙏🙏
1316808907701006336 2020-10-16 02:31:23 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @elenochle Indeed! Documenting details for my grandson to read!
1316808421023322113 2020-10-16 02:29:27 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @TheHonkler4 @joyinliberty In the meantime, we need to clean up our mess (corrupt government, unequal weights/measures-fiat currency, usury, innocent blood shed). If He has to come do it Himself, it will only be harder. Good dad He is. Shalom.
1316807108894117889 2020-10-16 02:24:14 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @TheHonkler4 @joyinliberty I believe God is good &amp; wants His children to succeed. There are some rules He gives me that I don’t understand, but I accept His authority &amp; so obey to the best of my ability. If I mess, up (and we all do) I ask forgiveness and endeavor again. Be blessed.
1316799622157926400 2020-10-16 01:54:29 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @TheHonkler4 @joyinliberty Not all commandments are for all people. God is not a sadist nor is He capricious. Modern observant Judaism has @ 10,000.   I don’t find hell a consequence for not eating Biblically clean, but it may cloud one’s ability to discern.
1316798492522819588 2020-10-16 01:50:00 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Gypsy2020Guitar @elenochle Yes, can still access.
1316795488608362498 2020-10-16 01:38:04 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @TheHonkler4 @joyinliberty Agreed, many religions heap guilt. I believe there is one God-YHVH. Following Torah as illustrated by Y’shua, obeying do’s &amp; don’ts gives us freedom and success in the remaining area. Man is imperfect &amp; seeks to dominate others. In God’s eyes, we’re all a half-shekel. (Ex30:15)
1316782494641987592 2020-10-16 00:46:26 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @mamabridgee Do you think asking this question will help save the Republic or is it a diversion that feeds into more division?
1316778717239300097 2020-10-16 00:31:25 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @jeffhunt I do agree.
1316758984825729024 2020-10-15 23:13:00 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @ThankQ777 Understood and agreed.
1316755351061041154 2020-10-15 22:58:34 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @ThankQ777 Wow, that’s a lot to digest. Sadly, it could be true: enemies within have always been the most dangerous.
1316753488844644353 2020-10-15 22:51:10 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @IAWTP1 Remembering that God laughs too, has helped me remain hopeful on many of these dark days.
1316748670402994189 2020-10-15 22:32:01 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @fluck_gloria @OANN Good question.
1316744510676795393 2020-10-15 22:15:29 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MiguelAliDaddy @KyleClark That’s always been our practice.

1316741128918642689 2020-10-15 22:02:03 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @DanCChamberlain @ljcambria Agreed,but there’s a lot of cleaning up to do.
1316738598255964160 2020-10-15 21:52:00 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem One of the reasons I don’t like early voting.
1316737825489006594 2020-10-15 21:48:56 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @rn__deplorable THE people voted Trump in. We’re blessed to have him put ACB on the the court because he was/is our choice and the vacancy came on his watch. They’re just jealous. And she is SO good. It scares them.
1316730504574574594 2020-10-15 21:19:50 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right Yes! May it help awaken LOTS of people.
1316704696556552194 2020-10-15 19:37:17 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @codeofvets Agreed.
1316684348486283264 2020-10-15 18:16:26 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @TheHonkler4 @joyinliberty I was raised Catholic. I know the gift of guilt that keeps on giving. 😩 Man’s doctrine is what Y’shua taught against (think Jewish), but Christianity has done the same thing. God’s burden is light. Be blessed.
1316597296436576258 2020-10-15 12:30:31 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @TheHonkler4 @joyinliberty Freedom is a gift from God. Yes, there are rules: think 10% do’s, 10% do nots (like the rules of music). Obey these, and the other 80% is yours to be and do what you want, and be blessed in doing it! Because you’ve followed the rules.
1316580701114859526 2020-10-15 11:24:34 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @COStateAction @GovtsTheProblem Agreed and I did.

1316574781890875392 2020-10-15 11:01:03 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @dutchsheets Kind of gruff, maybe true, but I like the point.
1316553204822421505 2020-10-15 09:35:19 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MapleSyru_p @michellemalkin Agreed, and I do.
1316550338527342592 2020-10-15 09:23:55 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty I like quantum theory: not either/or, but both/and. Question “authority”: In the 60’s it meant call into question who/what was giving orders. Decades later, it means question the One who knows (my God). Both are important.
1316545212311908354 2020-10-15 09:03:33 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MaryGraceMedia Agreed.
1316535412626776070 2020-10-15 08:24:37 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Jackiebulthuis @BarbaraBroom2 @robbystarbuck @SouthwestAir You’re an optimist. God bless you.
1316532599397941248 2020-10-15 08:13:26 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MapleSyru_p @michellemalkin Two houses I’m my neighborhood have sold recently and now have cars with CA plates in the driveway. Are they conservatives fleeing, or more idiot infiltrators? After 56 years, maybe I should move. It’s not the same place.
1316529710139138048 2020-10-15 08:01:57 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @RepKenBuck @TheJusticeDept Thank you Rep. Buck!
1316529535681269762 2020-10-15 08:01:15 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @codeofvets 😓 May his spirit now find peace until he wakes again. May the LORD comfort his family and friends, b’shem Y’shua.

1316402055691603971 2020-10-14 23:34:42 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right @GovofCO @realDonaldTrump Yeah!
1316400761786585089 2020-10-14 23:29:33 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem So true.
1316399834904002561 2020-10-14 23:25:52 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @blanarovich @ColleenHuberNMD So good she is! And they can’t argue!
1316398565275693057 2020-10-14 23:20:50 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @tgingher @EpochTimes @WhiteHouse I’m starting to feel like a political prisoner.
1316395395212349440 2020-10-14 23:08:14 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @shekinah1313 Where’s the good Dr. Fauci’s kind advice regarding self-care? Don’t hold your breath.
1316388022691258370 2020-10-14 22:38:56 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @LotusOak2 @dyolltrah Falling on deaf ears sadly, or hard hearts. I’m in a state where the Governor really doesn’t give a damn how much damage is done. God help us.
1316386342553694210 2020-10-14 22:32:15 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @lloomer80 @March_for_Life Pro-choice maybe, but NOT the God of life. I will continue to pray for you and yours
1316361245692440576 2020-10-14 20:52:32 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @lloomer80 @March_for_Life Hit and miss is God’s call. Abortion is game interference-MURDER!
1316284439874473984 2020-10-14 15:47:20 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem Yeah! The training for tracing has to end also: requested a simple service at a place I’ve done business with for years yesterday &amp; was asked for contact info first. NO! And I left.
1316282771057319937 2020-10-14 15:40:42 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @TheOnlooker18 At this point, I think it’s my great-grandchildren’s money.
1316032567108423680 2020-10-13 23:06:29 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty “There are decades when nothing happens, and there are weeks when decades happen.” Vladimir Lenin. Can we experience them simultaneously?
1316031235630616579 2020-10-13 23:01:11 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @HeidiM_67 @March_for_Life Wrong.
1316030292918849536 2020-10-13 22:57:27 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty I don’t know, but it seems very wrong.
1315865040361263104 2020-10-13 12:00:47 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem We need more trade schools and fewer indoctrination camps.
1315854098776940544 2020-10-13 11:17:19 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @codeofvets @SGTreport 🙏🙏🙏🙏
1315831985353392128 2020-10-13 09:49:26 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty Didn’t follow u around that curve. Messiah doesn’t come out of USA. However, Y’shua was: politically incorrect, not a Socialist/Communist. Someone like Y’shua I think would vote for Trump because God is pro-life, pro-freedom of choice, pro-Israel, only asks for 10% of profit...
1315820594294853635 2020-10-13 09:04:11 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty Increase in awareness, yes, and probably increase in support. Sort of like Bush supporting Biden makes some vote for Trump!
1315786554170904576 2020-10-13 06:48:55 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @shekinah1313 Agreed.
1315738489355411456 2020-10-13 03:37:55 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @BenjaminPD23 So grateful for the comic relief.😂😂😂

1315726610746748928 2020-10-13 02:50:43 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @NoRestrictions Yes! And it’s wonderful and it’s one of the reasons for our success. But the Republic needs a moral populous for success to continue. God help us turn around.
1315722381231640576 2020-10-13 02:33:55 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milliman @GovofCO @CDPHE I doubt Polis does.
1315687754756485121 2020-10-13 00:16:19 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @EmSee36 @BillKristol AGREED!
1315684612560084992 2020-10-13 00:03:50 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @KimberlyPatriot @joyinliberty My state’s been mail only for over a decade. 😢 Every week we attend a rally w/pro-USA one side, D’s the other. I’m trying to take different signs w/info to make the D’s ? their own  narrative. Their signs are vitriol and hate. Suggestions?
1315496397857271808 2020-10-12 11:35:56 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @zev_dr @TheOnlooker18 May the effort be blessed!

1315207025291333634 2020-10-11 16:26:04 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @PeriBrova @rsantana721 @CoryGardner Truth is rhinos and democraps BOTH have screwed too many people. That’s why Trump angers both sides. I’ll vote for the one whose policies bring prosperity and FREEDOM back to common folk. #MAGA
1315143666604937217 2020-10-11 12:14:18 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty Amen.
1315067983463682048 2020-10-11 07:13:34 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem So I guess I’m glad my friend didn’t want to go. We attended the weekly rally in home town and watched more pro-Trump flags than any other week prior cruise the street! Lots of signatures for recall Polis too!
1315026363376640001 2020-10-11 04:28:11 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @March_for_Life And from the beginning it beats to a different “drum,” a different rhythm: So obviously not a clump of cells, but a unique individual, a human! Who deserves LIFE!
1314728164720082945 2020-10-10 08:43:15 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @AngelWarrior321 Yes!
1314728059208192003 2020-10-10 08:42:50 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @AngelWarrior321 Listened as able, there is life to take care of. Missed the f___ part!

1314725486803681280 2020-10-10 08:32:37 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Juliusirizarry1 @VincentCrypt46 God hates evil.
1314724851790360576 2020-10-10 08:30:05 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Hickenlooper Lived here since 1963, and I DON’T like it!
1314713184918556674 2020-10-10 07:43:44 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @LoneStarMama4 Amen sister!
1314712863404101633 2020-10-10 07:42:27 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @doqholliday That’s been my assessment.
1314712363833200646 2020-10-10 07:40:28 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right Been doing the same since we got rid of polling in person. And we so enjoyed taking our children to the poll (neighborhood school) and teaching them about the Republic, rights, and RESPONSIBILITIES!
1314710379856105482 2020-10-10 07:32:35 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @TheOnlooker18 Said a prayer for him to sleep peacefully and gave thought to the changes in the game, and the world, that he saw in his blessedly long life.
1314709053180870657 2020-10-10 07:27:19 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @sky_jace @cjtruth I belong to a community of odd ducks: we often muse that we want to be “left behind.” In scripture, it is the tares taken out first. Don’t personally believe in a “rapture” that takes “good folk” out of the chaos. That doesn’t fit the patterns of Scripture.
1314705845075222529 2020-10-10 07:14:34 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @FoxFyreStudio @joyinliberty Blessedly mundane my husband and I would say.
1314683829660114945 2020-10-10 05:47:05 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @applesoup @GovtsTheProblem I’ve a friend w/ a similar circumstance. He got a referral to a different group that did not require pre-test. Sadly a minority though I expect. Virtually all of the PPE for the public is made in China. Spirit of fear keeps all doing business w/ the enemy! 🤮
1314664484074553350 2020-10-10 04:30:12 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem I am shocked by the # of cars at the testing site some days. Are all those people really feeling ill? Or is it rules and regs requiring testing before one can exercise one’s freedom?
1314641162695737345 2020-10-10 02:57:32 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milliman @GovofCO Agreed. May we be successful!
1314620841246756864 2020-10-10 01:36:47 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @CherryP91885339 @March_for_Life He’s smarter than that, and I will.
1314588791710126081 2020-10-09 23:29:26 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @CherryP91885339 @March_for_Life Because you can’t win the argument. God does. And we’ll pray for you.
1314588290159386625 2020-10-09 23:27:26 +0800 <ModernMillie2> Yes, please, ASAP.
1314587098285051905 2020-10-09 23:22:42 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @CherryP91885339 @March_for_Life Wrong. The  right to life is inherent to the human. Execution for capital crimes is justice. Both are required for life to be successful.
1314566935389122560 2020-10-09 22:02:35 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MapleSyru_p @jeffhunt Good answer.
1314561225863331840 2020-10-09 21:39:54 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right Happy to see this.
1314544545678450689 2020-10-09 20:33:37 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem Correct.
1314360474566180864 2020-10-09 08:22:11 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @OURrescue Dogs are so cool.
1314338794020061184 2020-10-09 06:56:02 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Brink_Thinker God bless. He has! And thank you for sharing a grand success to uplift the spirit of many.
1314310689800941568 2020-10-09 05:04:21 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @March_for_Life True!
1314280657221300224 2020-10-09 03:05:01 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem We call him Pharaoh Polis.
1314280133054914561 2020-10-09 03:02:56 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @JohnSpelic May their efforts be as futile as their argument is wrong.
1314246251144245249 2020-10-09 00:48:18 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @CoralineElise Yep. And I married one, too.
1314209785516978178 2020-10-08 22:23:24 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @codeofvets 🙏You are loved, and many are grateful for your service, and respect you. Please let people help. They need you. There is not another you.
1314206644574666753 2020-10-08 22:10:55 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem Pharaoh Polis, singularly and completely.
1314205730459713541 2020-10-08 22:07:17 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty So much a God thing: pure beauty and joy.
1314103764945600513 2020-10-08 15:22:07 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @BardsFM @dbongino May the tumor and every cancerous cell be dead and cast off, never to be seen again, b’shem Y’shua.
1314004425594281984 2020-10-08 08:47:22 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @CalTexMix @cjtruth @texasredright Agreed. He didn’t.
1314003819244724227 2020-10-08 08:44:58 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MaryGraceMedia So happy for them and their families!
1313867765313351680 2020-10-07 23:44:20 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @VoteThemAVoice This is not a “religious” position; it is a human rights position. Do what you want with “your” body, but once another human, especially an innocent and defenceless one, has been brought into the situation, expect good people to stand up in their defense. #Yeson115
1313819216462729221 2020-10-07 20:31:25 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MichaelBrownUSA Makes some bad analogies look good.
1313620662024581120 2020-10-07 07:22:26 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty Politically incorrect He was. Good role model.
1313565357702033409 2020-10-07 03:42:40 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @NoRestrictions Well done.

1313561140862083072 2020-10-07 03:25:55 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right My Trump sign was stole. So I put up a Trump flag. Four times bigger than the sign. 😌
1313532929147105281 2020-10-07 01:33:49 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @RespectLifeDen @YesProp115 Nice!
1313469036207001600 2020-10-06 21:19:55 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @CoralineElise As a child I had recurring dreams, always the same: dark army against the light.
1313468333761720322 2020-10-06 21:17:08 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right Indeed it does.
1313361471859027969 2020-10-06 14:12:30 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @JuliansRum @prayingmedic I find it interesting that this happens during the Hebrew feast of Sukkot, when Jewish lore tells of the King coming out to meet his people in the fields of harvest. That’s 1 of the reasons the Pharisees went nuts as Y’shua rode a donkey into Jerusalem.
1313358162494459909 2020-10-06 13:59:21 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @wokeuppatriot @joyinliberty Thank you. It is impossible to speak so as not to be misunderstood, someone said. Your conclusion and mine are the same then: the cloth masks that most folks wear are worthless.
1313356588019744768 2020-10-06 13:53:06 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @VDarknessF @Laurennn721 I didn’t enjoy those days, but okay.
1313342647793319937 2020-10-06 12:57:42 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Pismo_B An eye for an eye means JUSTICE. One does not literally take out the eye, but there is equity between damage done and retribution. God wants us to pursue justice. If we do not enact it ourselves, He will demand it Himself. That’s even more frightening.
1313330159525781505 2020-10-06 12:08:05 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty @wokeuppatriot Not from from what I see.

1313328572879298560 2020-10-06 12:01:46 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @CoralineElise It’s also the 3rd day of the week (this year). A day in Scripture that is twice-blessed.
1313327588883017730 2020-10-06 11:57:52 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty @CzechBoiirose Been passing this around. It helps. I encourage people to pick 1-3 points that they are passionate about and be armed with facts. Their passion will help them communicate the point with sincerity and legitimacy. My opinion.
1313326316234604546 2020-10-06 11:52:48 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @wokeuppatriot @joyinliberty ALL? I’m sorry. Your tweet’s not making sense to me. It sounds like you’re against makes but then note literature that supports masks which when read says clearly “symptomatic” persons could spread said infection. If I’m not symptomatic, why must I be masked ?
1313222562978111488 2020-10-06 05:00:32 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right I’m excited!
1313169149716242433 2020-10-06 01:28:17 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @BardsFM God provides the victory when we do our part.
1313151490375196674 2020-10-06 00:18:07 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @VoteThemAVoice @YesProp115 Happy to do so!

1312975875516895237 2020-10-05 12:40:17 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @SebGorka @randycorporon May it be so.
1312975672185413633 2020-10-05 12:39:28 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GOPmemefeed It still counts.
1312973906689642496 2020-10-05 12:32:27 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @chapsnbridles @AMERICAN_WARR @realDonaldTrump In an odd way I see it bringing attention to the sad reality of isolation from loved ones during this craziness. Remember: it’s governors who have shown their tyrannical tendencies during this ersatz pandemic, not POTUS.
1312969412765536258 2020-10-05 12:14:36 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @BardsFM We need more of this.
1312965289223639041 2020-10-05 11:58:13 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @jeffreyatucker Duh!
1312965127860350977 2020-10-05 11:57:34 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty Patrick Overton: “there will be something solid for you to stand on, or you will be taught to fly.” Helped me get through a rough time. God bless.
1312960385658556421 2020-10-05 11:38:44 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @RedPillMaC @TheMegan8r Agreed, and please do.
1312960237863940096 2020-10-05 11:38:08 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Roonie_Bear @TheMegan8r Agreed. I find it interesting and helpful to pay attention to social media, investigate alternate sources (not via Google), and then wait to see who uses the information, when, and towards what agenda.
1312958922299445249 2020-10-05 11:32:55 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @OratorBlog @SpeakerPelosi God forbid.

1312949887823212546 2020-10-05 10:57:01 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @DeAnna4Congress It’s not new.
1312949077081022464 2020-10-05 10:53:48 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @randycorporon @69bronco A brave young man, taught right by his parents. May he sleep peacefully till the Resurrection and awaken to Yah’s kingdom and the LORD give his parents shalom. They will see him again.
1312937867790909441 2020-10-05 10:09:15 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @AwakeningCat @joyinliberty Yes.
1312923139958022144 2020-10-05 09:10:44 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MaryGraceMedia Sadly correct.
1312869269726793738 2020-10-05 05:36:40 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @March_for_Life @DavidClosson @FRCdc May the course be towards the LORD!
1312836518969573378 2020-10-05 03:26:32 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @March_for_Life An adult I know with DS: gainfully employed, pays taxes, loves God, always there to help someone, always light-hearted, epitomises so much of what our world needs. Abortion is a loss to our nation and the world.
1312818629969416192 2020-10-05 02:15:27 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @JanetTXBlessed Yes. But it was a childhood staple.
1312815975696400385 2020-10-05 02:04:54 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @jeffhunt Always.
1312815778983563264 2020-10-05 02:04:07 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Truth_4_Freedom Brining him up right! God bless!
1312758168309714946 2020-10-04 22:15:11 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milliman True. And very apparent by the behaviour exhibited by the Left at the rallies I attended yesterday. They hate POTUS. They hate God. He wins.
1312747655165095936 2020-10-04 21:33:25 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem Absurdity seems to sell these days.

1312733539063009280 2020-10-04 20:37:19 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @dutchsheets True. Words matter.
1312733028771409925 2020-10-04 20:35:18 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @March_for_Life Once any human life is determined “morally acceptable “ to exterminate sans a moral decree, it is a steep and slippery path to genocide. Oh, yes, that’s what Margaret Sanger wanted. She would be pleased with the statistics for Black babies. God help us.
1312492762554494976 2020-10-04 04:40:34 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milliman @GovofCO I’ve circulated several petitions this year. The petition for his recall is being received and signed with joy!
1312391370871648256 2020-10-03 21:57:40 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GeorgeBrauchler Happened at my house during the night! They left my Cory Gardner sign, and my YES on 115. We’ll just replace and take them in at night.  #TrumpLandslide2020
1312389019179855874 2020-10-03 21:48:19 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem I have family and friends who are “disabled.” I’ve worked in the “industry.” When working, I was shocked at the militant attitude of some to make society pay for the difficulties encountered: a spirit of bitterness. True community overcomes these difficulties, not lawsuits.
1312370880643817479 2020-10-03 20:36:15 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @cjtruth Lots of good advice in there.

1312241511866732544 2020-10-03 12:02:11 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @StopTheCoup2020 @SenSchumer YES!
1312237181654708228 2020-10-03 11:44:58 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @lloomer80 @March_for_Life It’s not my entitlement alone. Not yours against mine. It’s EVERY human’s entitlement to life, regardless of age or location. You are not willing, perhaps are not capable, of sharing the gift that was given you. Selfish of you. Sad for you. God wins!
1312225912264548352 2020-10-03 11:00:12 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @BitchesDecision @March_for_Life Wrong.
1312225748078522368 2020-10-03 10:59:32 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @lloomer80 @March_for_Life Correct. But we do expect wisdom, and an ability to think of someone other than oneself to come with age.

1312050135057281024 2020-10-02 23:21:43 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @ChadPergram They really have nothing else to work on? Why are they so concerned?
1312032819267469313 2020-10-02 22:12:55 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @StopTheCoup2020 Can we just do one hole, one sink behind locked door and be done with this _______?
1312026999234482176 2020-10-02 21:49:47 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @HollywoodInToto Agreed.

1312001823289548801 2020-10-02 20:09:45 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @BardsFM @bvoice_p It’s sensible method.
1312000848445272065 2020-10-02 20:05:52 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @DFBHarvard @dyolltrah Donate what you can. Pray, and pray more. Be active in your community: be ready, help neighbors, and vote! #Trump2020Landslide
1311997286579425280 2020-10-02 19:51:43 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty Crocheting on the back porch, sewing for the grandchildren, home-making. This diversion is temporary, and God wins!
1311995539362381824 2020-10-02 19:44:46 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @randycorporon Agreed. Th comments under @March_for_Life and @VoteThemAVoice are particularly revealing. Tells me what to pray for! #Trump2020 #MAGA #GodWins

1311780825139208203 2020-10-02 05:31:35 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem Boomerang the fear mongering: unintended consequences. I hope the count day shows drastically reduced numbers.
1311723866780205056 2020-10-02 01:45:15 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @March_for_Life Numbers surpassing documented genocides of history. So sad.
1311405082827657216 2020-10-01 04:38:31 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @barstooldenver @VoteThemAVoice May you be greatly disappointed!
1311379960519692288 2020-10-01 02:58:41 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @March_for_Life And it’s beautiful! Definitely a keeper. 🥰
1311351508068446211 2020-10-01 01:05:37 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @StopTheCoup2020 Comey responding to the Senator from NE refutes the existence of a deep state due to the complexity of the system, etc., etc. To me, that’s the very definition.
1311307114514653185 2020-09-30 22:09:13 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right A beautiful list IMO!
1311285061602480129 2020-09-30 20:41:35 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right Agreed.
1311276666187112448 2020-09-30 20:08:14 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @EmSee36 Too much sense.
1311186605705760771 2020-09-30 14:10:22 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GrimblesOc Good, and technically correct.
1311182203297116160 2020-09-30 13:52:52 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Southrngirl77 @joyinliberty Not true in mine.
1311158984058044421 2020-09-30 12:20:36 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @TheOnlooker18 It is Biblical and it is good. So sad the world doesn’t see the honor of Proverb 31. A match made in heaven reflecting order, beauty, and creativity. Like God.
1311144980703047681 2020-09-30 11:24:57 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty Turned it off.
1311045213721440258 2020-09-30 04:48:31 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem Picked up a petition to circulate today!

1310946768859869187 2020-09-29 22:17:20 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty @parscale Adding him to the list.
1310943985528119300 2020-09-29 22:06:16 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem I like that idea.
1310930046392184835 2020-09-29 21:10:53 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Lisa_in_theUSA @rn__deplorable I know how you feel.
1310924541926010880 2020-09-29 20:49:01 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem And when you “vote early,” you help them with their lists. Take your ballot to the drop-off box yourself on the 3 November!
1310923955289587712 2020-09-29 20:46:41 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right And the many who have gotten rich from the corruption are fighting Trump like the rabid animals they are.
1310890055037321216 2020-09-29 18:31:58 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty True.
1310811529193967616 2020-09-29 13:19:56 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty I had that Disney book as a child. I can never look at it the same way.
1310794684030214146 2020-09-29 12:13:00 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @alwaysGod37 @sky_jace Humbling oneself before God means obeying His teaching b/c He’s the boss. If the whole world followed the 10 commandments, MUCH would be solved. God’s pie is not limited. We need to repent and obey.
1310650401746812930 2020-09-29 02:39:41 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem Sure looks that way. Biden’s contempt for Judge Thomas during the hearings for his appointment to SCOTUS was also very obvious. Birds of a feather...
1310646675917201408 2020-09-29 02:24:52 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @JaniceTXBlessed @TheOnlooker18 Yeah!

1310573923130540033 2020-09-28 21:35:47 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @YesImLeon @joyinliberty Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. We must each do our part, faithfully. The LORD said to Moses,”Why do you cry to me? Tell the people to go forward.” Then He split the seas.

1310337913461317633 2020-09-28 05:57:58 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @VincentCrypt46 When you build your house on rock...
1310335309251518464 2020-09-28 05:47:37 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @TubbsShow Rhetorical question, right?
1310331981104918530 2020-09-28 05:34:23 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @co_hurricane @GovofCO Amen!
1310331262138187780 2020-09-28 05:31:32 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @March_for_Life If it weren’t for women, men would live in caves.                                     If it weren’t for men, women would live in caves.                                       Pro-life, pro-responsibility. That’s EQUALITY!
1310324590892191744 2020-09-28 05:05:01 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @bvoice_p @realDonaldTrump Happy for him!
1310321665637838849 2020-09-28 04:53:24 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty So I have heard.
1310281579466555394 2020-09-28 02:14:07 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right Poll watching myself and looking forward to it .

1310018020249657344 2020-09-27 08:46:49 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @RightSkeptic @KurtSchlichter Agreed. If one is kind to the cruel, one will end up being cruel to the kind. In a moral society, the death penalty should be rare.
1309958210263166978 2020-09-27 04:49:09 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MaryGraceMedia As humans, I must pray for them. As a political party, it’s kind of fun to watch.
1309882924347658241 2020-09-26 23:50:00 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Terrypooch @March_for_Life Do you read dates? This data precedes his election!

1309852690042834945 2020-09-26 21:49:51 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @AudreyJeanne @SeanCordanon @realDonaldTrump Correct. I’ve been keeping a journal for my grandson to read in the future. I wrote in the beginning that I pray he reads it as a FREE man.
1309851940625489920 2020-09-26 21:46:53 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @reallygraceful Agreed.

1309547782768861185 2020-09-26 01:38:16 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @HollywoodInToto Amen. May all who touch her bear Yah’s gift of healing!

1309508980683628545 2020-09-25 23:04:05 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @StopTheCoup2020 @GenFlynn Sanity. That would nice.
1309486623491579905 2020-09-25 21:35:14 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem And in the late 60’s this age group was willing to protest the tyranny of gov’t sending their peers to war in Vietnam. Now, they’re accepting house arrest. What changed?
1309458943555624961 2020-09-25 19:45:15 +0800 <ModernMillie2> Indeed.
1309377263297794048 2020-09-25 14:20:41 +0800 <ModernMillie2> It’s not just the lies we’re told, it’s what we’re not told. We must encourage, uphold, and exhort each other.

1309342044888993793 2020-09-25 12:00:44 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @shekinah1313 Laughter is good medicine. Thank you.
1309265712368750593 2020-09-25 06:57:25 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty Not going to happen.
1309242191030530048 2020-09-25 05:23:57 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @EmSee36 You make complete sense, but logic is beyond these people.
1309209988682915841 2020-09-25 03:15:59 +0800 <ModernMillie2> Yes!

1309137045961551885 2020-09-24 22:26:09 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @RchrdsnMark @ScottAdamsSays Scott’s right. States that are quickly enacting a mail-in system under a spirit of fear are creating the situation where results must be questioned. The left thrives on chaos.
1309130987566174210 2020-09-24 22:02:04 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @IAWTP1 God wins.
1309128234055938050 2020-09-24 21:51:08 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @IAWTP1 Details? No doubt this is un-Constitutional over not wearing a mask. We’re told to not resist arrest for personal safety. Resisting this may be Constitutional, but that doesn’t prevent physical harm.  Seems many folks are in a no-win situation.
1309035644660985856 2020-09-24 15:43:13 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @erose001 @MichaelCoudrey We disagree.
1309035236551012355 2020-09-24 15:41:35 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty Healthful ingredients, undoubtedly baked with love.

1309030021718212611 2020-09-24 15:20:52 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @erose001 @MichaelCoudrey Planning? My dear, the conjugal act comes with potential outcomes known. The time to plan is BEFORE said act. Killing the innocent is not planning, it’s coverup.

1308787179586453506 2020-09-23 23:15:54 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty Praise Yah and thank the doctors! I know that scenario: For my youngest the first was at 3 weeks to buy time for growth, then again at 18 months, and once more at 11 years. Number 2 was a nightmare. Number 3 changed life for the entire family. He’s healthy, well, and now 31.

Dependency makes one a slave. Peace through strength is better than sending pallets of cash to subsidize Iran’s nuclear aspirations. Biden threatened withholding money to Ukraine.

As is adoption if the woman determines she does not want to keep the child. Taking an innocent person’s life to erase one’s own mistake is NEVER okay. Vote TRUMP and protect life!
1308548701737058306 2020-09-23 07:28:16 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @EmSee36 @realDonaldTrump I’ve taken heat at the dog park for my “Women for Trump” shirt. Two guys against a small, gray haired gal. Go figure.

1308483250902511621 2020-09-23 03:08:12 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @ksorbs I’ve witnessed similar event at my community rally - twice!
1308482817786081286 2020-09-23 03:06:28 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @gawakenin1 @michaelbeatty3 @Savingworld88 I know people here who have adopted. The process can be agonizing long. Maybe it’s a faster process if the children come from a different country? If one has a heart for children, it doesn’t matter where they come from. Bless them.

1308432008524242946 2020-09-22 23:44:34 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty Theory is just that until there’s proof. Sadly, we live in an era where the facts are being withheld; therefore, all remains theory, and anyone who believes the theory is maligned.

1307791555391094786 2020-09-21 05:19:39 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @BardsFM Went to buy a new bird feeder as a racoon destroyed the old. All the new ones were made in China. We kept looking and at the neighborhood, family-owned hardware, found one made in USA, and got it for 1/2 price! I felt blessed for NOT doing business with the enemy! 🇺🇸

1307509511595479040 2020-09-20 10:38:54 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @pro_real_life @March_for_Life The invitation to cohabitate was given by default through the conjugal act. Therefore, if one has allowed the guest in, one still does not have to murder them.
1307507989457362944 2020-09-20 10:32:51 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @pro_real_life @March_for_Life The second clause equates the child to a squatter.

Charity is done from person to person,  mostly widows &amp; orphans, and is not co-opted by the gov’t which perverts the effort/system. There’s no taxation labor: one reaps what one sows.

1305894850202611715 2020-09-15 23:42:49 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @pukka__ @denverpost Yes, we are forced/coerced on a daily basis to submit, always for the “greater good.” Many have been doing so for a very long time because Americans are good and kind folk for the most part. But enough is enough!
1305880355774357510 2020-09-15 22:45:13 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @kiwihaley @denverpost Where did you come from?
1305880244054827009 2020-09-15 22:44:46 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @pukka__ @denverpost Yes, forcing someone to wear a mask is wrong. So is destroying small business, constantly moving goalposts/changing rules, forbidding worship.

1305877789673840640 2020-09-15 22:35:01 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right Woohoo! Can I help collect signatures!
1305854836257230849 2020-09-15 21:03:49 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @SandraWeeden @shekinah1313 Yes, lots.
1305853849585020930 2020-09-15 20:59:53 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GeorgeBrauchler There’s a reason people don’t respond to polls.
1305853067900997632 2020-09-15 20:56:47 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @JohnSpelic Agreed.
1305784811269902336 2020-09-15 16:25:33 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @PrussiaThird @milliman More than enough blame to go around to BOTH political parties. If we’re to get out of this bureaucratic nightmare, we need Trump and CONSTITUTIONALISTS: Judge them all by their actions!
1305637247983783936 2020-09-15 06:39:12 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @shekinah1313 Logic doesn’t work with some people.
1305636866004267008 2020-09-15 06:37:41 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @doqholliday Highly encouraging.
1305545469964300288 2020-09-15 00:34:30 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right I’d bet money on that.
1305539341880627202 2020-09-15 00:10:09 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @HollywoodInToto Desperate they are.
1305538486636875776 2020-09-15 00:06:45 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @March_for_Life True and logical. So sad the pro-abortionists are incapable of love and logic.
1305538026844680192 2020-09-15 00:04:55 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right Agreed.
1305527602116001794 2020-09-14 23:23:30 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milliman @9NEWS Valid question. I don’t expect an answer.

1305188764436910084 2020-09-14 00:57:05 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Parisa8675309 I understand.
1305161762065518592 2020-09-13 23:09:47 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @March_for_Life Such a good point. So many of the pro-abortionists seem incapable of any love other than self.
1305160604848713736 2020-09-13 23:05:11 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right And what sort of economic system does more to lift people out of poverty than other? Capitalism. But the D’s and rhinos will offer the FREE stuff rather than promote FREEDOM.
1305142761709096961 2020-09-13 21:54:17 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right @rotter_michael Agreed.

1305133037567565825 2020-09-13 21:15:39 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @co_hurricane Poetic justice?
1305132127269380096 2020-09-13 21:12:01 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right @rotter_michael Agreed. CO, sadly, did away with in-person polling. I believe our system to be fairly secure, but the states RUNNING to establish  a system out of FEAR, invite trouble. That’s part of the plan. Why has the absentee system been abandoned?
1305085290080600065 2020-09-13 18:05:55 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @March_for_Life God bless you all and stay strong.
1305015383083102210 2020-09-13 13:28:07 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right @USPS So mine arrived: IMO it is apolitical. USPS tells voters that rules vary by state and to contact one’s election board to verify details. Too many folks like to muck things up by going to court.
1305011308442587138 2020-09-13 13:11:56 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @AwakenedOutlaw Agreed.
1304477236381331456 2020-09-12 01:49:43 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GeorgeBrauchler My husband was on his way to work (ATC). We still have the NOTAM: DUE TO EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES...ALL TRAFFIC...LAND SHORTLY.  At home, we got on faces and prayed.
1304440368742662144 2020-09-11 23:23:13 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @joyinliberty I like the story. Thank you for sharing it. God bless. God wins.
1304417090661748745 2020-09-11 21:50:43 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @co_hurricane Haven’t been tested, but this falls in the category of being an “educated” client of the health care system and I would encourage folks to ask these questions.
1304354770887598082 2020-09-11 17:43:05 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @dutchsheets Yes, revival. Amen.

1303888643866742786 2020-09-10 10:50:52 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @milliman @GovofCO Can we separate apples from oranges please? COVID can be dangerous, particularly to people at risk (pre-existing conditions, elderly). OVER REACTION by political elite who wouldn’t want to let a crisis go to waste is THE problem! Protect those at risk, and let FREEDOM ring!
1303882304029421568 2020-09-10 10:25:40 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @lloomer80 @March_for_Life The womb was not created for the female. It was created for the child: a sanctuary for LIFE!

1303855091024367616 2020-09-10 08:37:32 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem So we’ll see! It’s either really good, or really bad.
1303854582108389376 2020-09-10 08:35:31 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MaryGraceMedia May  the LORD give her sweet sleep till she awakes at the resurrection to His kingdom. May He give you and yours peace. You’ll see her again!

1303741089271238658 2020-09-10 01:04:32 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @JKUVinnie22 @cjtruth There are different kinds: not all are obvious, but many do involve large muscle contraction. And yes, demons can cause them, but not all seizures are signs of demon activity. Helpful as mud.

1303553308804755456 2020-09-09 12:38:22 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @CobaltAdvocates So doctor, if there is no danger to the mother, it’s okay to kill the baby?
1303461024562065408 2020-09-09 06:31:40 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem @GovofCO Obviously.

1303055429027672064 2020-09-08 03:39:58 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem I have mixed emotions about HL. I was happy when they bucked the system,  considered themselves essential, and stayed open. I shopped to support them. When the mask mandate came, they were the only store to post that they would call police if a customer didn’t comply.
1302998168817238019 2020-09-07 23:52:26 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @maria_crippen @ColleenHuberNMD One does not need to carry a cell phone 24/7/365!

1302974497495175169 2020-09-07 22:18:22 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right Pompeo called out those friendly ones &amp; I had to wonder about Polis. Not surprised to see his name. What’s the number for?
1302965088517853184 2020-09-07 21:40:59 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @March_for_Life That’s loving your neighbor!
1302961355608252416 2020-09-07 21:26:09 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right Agreed, this falls on the shoulders of Polis. Amazing the comments, the people who mix apples with oranges.
1302809695195979776 2020-09-07 11:23:31 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @March_for_Life Rescued. Good word.

1302694353354330112 2020-09-07 03:45:11 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @prageru Correct!
1302686277234548736 2020-09-07 03:13:05 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @prageru And it was being touted in churches 30 years ago already!

1302646553820254214 2020-09-07 00:35:15 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right How about nuclear? I hear France is very successful.

Our local counter-left rally was started by a liberal. Right beside him are the pro-USA, pro-2A, pro-life, MAGA folks. I think the left has conned a lot of libs, and we need to wake them up to our shared values. God help us.

1302419356652122114 2020-09-06 09:32:27 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @March_for_Life You are correct.
1302314801507586057 2020-09-06 02:36:59 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Truth_4_Freedom Correct.
1302248502597169152 2020-09-05 22:13:32 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @drdavidsamadi Paradox: the global connectivity has led to disconnection.
1302133856804442117 2020-09-05 14:37:58 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Hold2LLC Years ago, we pulled ours out to homeschool. NO regret. The elder went on to graduate summa cum laude in engineering. The younger, with DS, is gainfully employed (sans government program). May God bless your efforts. It will be different and it will be good.

He keeps his word: moved the embassy, bringing troops home, supporting life, taking care of troops, defending our Constitution &amp; the rule of law, helping save victims of human trafficking, deregulating so small businesses can compete.

That is repentance &amp; we MUST do it.  We also need a leader. I do not idolise Trump. None of my believing friends or family believe he is our saviour &amp; Y’shua never asked for worship. Shalom.

David ran a protection racket and had a man killed. Samson liked women too much, and Solomon had too many wives. But God used them all to be leaders.
1301986120838807560 2020-09-05 04:50:55 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @real_defender Glad to hear it. I can believe it.

1301887025545707520 2020-09-04 22:17:09 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @ellall5 @PatrickForCO @michellemalkin @randycorporon The Founding Fathers we’re quilts of treason by King George.
1301753650130358273 2020-09-04 13:27:10 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @AmyiCzyk Thanks for the chuckle amid the chaos.
1301752799546535936 2020-09-04 13:23:47 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @SKYRIDER4538 Yes,but... where’s the privacy we once had? Voter ID, in person at the polls: I kinda like the old way. Rights are responsibilities and freedom is more than worth our time.
1301746890900471808 2020-09-04 13:00:18 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @T_McKnight_21 @MarkGriego10 @RealBrysonGray Maybe the rich fertile plains in the middle with coastal access on the Gulf of Mexico?
1301744870340661248 2020-09-04 12:52:16 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @allanasdad @kimrunner Continuing Medical Education: acronyms get stuck in the brain sometimes. 🥴
1301661756792729601 2020-09-04 07:22:01 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @VoteThemAVoice And in Aiden’s brief time on Earth, he knew love and the power of human touch: May the God of all creation bless them. Vote YES on 115!
1301566969636966400 2020-09-04 01:05:22 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @shekinah1313 @NC_Governor We have Pharaoh Polis. God sees them all...
1301544697500971008 2020-09-03 23:36:52 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @cjtruth Making “light” of an evil is often a first step towards having that evil be accepted. It’s a ploy that’s been used for a very long time and obvious in the entertainment industry.
1301539448216326150 2020-09-03 23:16:00 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @HollywoodInToto Be blessed and go forward in FAITH. God heals.
1301519543542648832 2020-09-03 21:56:54 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @EmSee36 Agreed.
1301513592345423877 2020-09-03 21:33:16 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Trump2020YALL @GennyP15097090 @AfArgumentative @Breaking911 District Attorneys have great power. Be careful who you vote for.
1301511429250576388 2020-09-03 21:24:40 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @EmSee36 @dbongino There’s a correlation between money and freedom: give the property taxes back to parents and let them CHOOSE where to send their children. This government subsidised/control method is evil.
1301509504551596033 2020-09-03 21:17:01 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @thebradfordfile Agreed.
1301505955499307009 2020-09-03 21:02:55 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right And if Denver/Colorado has to suffer short term, to fix the corruption long term, do it. We can have an uncomfortable excision or a long, painful death.
1301298769766559744 2020-09-03 07:19:38 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MajorPatriot Agreed.
1301262569856995330 2020-09-03 04:55:47 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MissThye @ArtValley818_ Public figures are open to ridicule, and there is a humorous side to the video. But elder abuse is not funny, and sadly that’s what his family and “friends” seem guilty of at times.
1301259714790068224 2020-09-03 04:44:26 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @real_defender @realDonaldTrump Rightfully so!
1301257953169887233 2020-09-03 04:37:26 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @JohnSpelic Hallelu-Yah!
1301254440314449922 2020-09-03 04:23:29 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @elenochle Shalom,shalom.
1301160207024881665 2020-09-02 22:09:02 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @WayneBroussard8 @ljcambria @EmeraldRobinson Thanks for the chuckle, God laughs too.
1301140598863335425 2020-09-02 20:51:07 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @StopMedTyranny Agree wholeheartedly.
1301139085675966464 2020-09-02 20:45:06 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @shekinah1313 Lots of good Baptist preachers would agree.
1301138187952304131 2020-09-02 20:41:32 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Colorado_Right @TuckerCarlson That’s not their only goal.
1301033756829126656 2020-09-02 13:46:34 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MajorPatriot Self defense and private property, God’s in favour of both. Oh yeah, and FREEDOM!
1301032314164719616 2020-09-02 13:40:50 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem @realDonaldTrump I can believe it. Deepest,darkest Boulder...
1301022126548365313 2020-09-02 13:00:21 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @HyperionHyker @ThePepeDurham Not either/or, both/and.
1300900033756364801 2020-09-02 04:55:12 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem Agreed.
1300899119175696384 2020-09-02 04:51:34 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @MaryGraceMedia Papa bear.
1300897551877578758 2020-09-02 04:45:20 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @mjd_america Good answer! Just like Him!
1300847936071446529 2020-09-02 01:28:11 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @GovtsTheProblem Indeed it is surprising. Spouse &amp; I didn’t donate because they already got our money!
1300811626069753858 2020-09-01 23:03:54 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @Ephesians6__12 @jazminestarr239 @ColleenHuberNMD @tipcast239 Masks may be demonic, but don’t speak such ill into others lives that they would find themselves on a vent. Speak truth, and speak life.
1300607414551674881 2020-09-01 09:32:26 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @tracybeanz @KassandraKitson @danichel60 Valid question. Makes it seem staged, regardless of age.
1300584214031740929 2020-09-01 08:00:14 +0800 <ModernMillie2> @shekinah1313 Today? I’m sorry, absurdity begets absurdity and her words are meaningless.
