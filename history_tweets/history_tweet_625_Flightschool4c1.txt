1306374664973963264 2020-09-17 07:29:26 +0800 <Flightschool4c1> You had your chance with Ron Paul. We will now face the consequences of political and financial actors. Our best hope is a breakup of the USA into regional or individual states. Communism &amp; fascism are both awful but possible alternatives!
1306374214413418498 2020-09-17 07:27:38 +0800 <Flightschool4c1> A resurgence in communism, degeneracy, anti-semitism, inequality, and a likely fiscal and monetary crisis in the near future will put America squarely in our own “Weimar” era. Rather than take a horrible turn down one of 2 awful paths Germany had, I hope our nation will break up.
1306363645773963265 2020-09-17 06:45:38 +0800 <Flightschool4c1> Wignats are so cringe and are usually socialists
1306325043903897602 2020-09-17 04:12:15 +0800 <Flightschool4c1> The Fed fuels the fires of political extremism (ironically for more statism) among discontentful fascists and communists
1306323899316142087 2020-09-17 04:07:42 +0800 <Flightschool4c1> Young conservatives need to realize that fascism isn’t a cure to the problems facing our country and would only create new problems and abuse the liberties and dignity of more people. We need the country to split before extremist politics take hold.
1306253249914208256 2020-09-16 23:26:58 +0800 <Flightschool4c1> Education is the key to avoid repeating the horrors of the past
1306084625522012161 2020-09-16 12:16:55 +0800 <Flightschool4c1> Young right wingers tacitly supporting fascism, MAGA movement ineffective and fizzling out, commies running wild and growing in numbers, debt growing rapidly, degeneracy abounds...  We are truly in the days of Weimar and there’s nobody calling for the obvious move: secede!
1306050007737536513 2020-09-16 09:59:21 +0800 <Flightschool4c1> Nazis and commies are both bad and worship the devil
1305997836694282240 2020-09-16 06:32:03 +0800 <Flightschool4c1> Oil is going to skyrocket as money printing weakens the USD, war in the Middle East begins, and industrial demand recovers
