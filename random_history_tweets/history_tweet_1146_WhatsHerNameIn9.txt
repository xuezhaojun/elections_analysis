THANK GOD that we have a REAL President coming in a month, who takes accountability for his actions, unlike America’s Biggest Loser, Donald Trump.

1339943958055702530 2020-12-18 22:41:49 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> This is frustrating. Pence encouraged super spreaders. He encouraged the hoax theory. He was a horrific leader when it came to Covid.

1333519233372876800 2020-12-01 05:12:15 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @katierosemiller Talk about tone deaf.
1333518781340061705 2020-12-01 05:10:27 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @ChuckGrassley is laughable. Obviously she’ll release them to him, the Biden admin wants to be transparent, I just find it funny that old Chuck is worried about her taxes but not about the guy, who is currently holding the most powerful position in Americas. Weird huh?
1333516709823729669 2020-12-01 05:02:13 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @FLOTUS Too bad you didn’t give a shit the last 3 years 🤷🏽‍♀️ It’s beautiful Melania, truly. But picking and choosing color schemes hardly qualifies as working your ass off. The people who were paid to actually do it, they definitely worked their asses off. Cheers to them. Loser.
1333508633565523970 2020-12-01 04:30:08 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> Maybe @senatemajldr can take his own advice, and put Americans needs above his and friends. Ask yourself why it’s so hard for him to help Americans, but he’s first in line to lay down in a puddle for trump to walk all over him.

1332699436707930112 2020-11-28 22:54:40 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> Pathetic, what a drain on the courts. Trump is such a loser.

1332696481153884160 2020-11-28 22:42:56 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> This guy is in “charge” of things. He clearly hates his constituents. And during a global pandemic he thinks he’s being funny by making fun of someone protecting themselves. What a garbage human.

1332093997658083331 2020-11-27 06:48:52 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> Donald Trump wasn’t capable of looking at a ship named after a dead man, he’s not going to attend the inauguration of the amazing man replacing him. He’s much too small of a man.

1331747180571484162 2020-11-26 07:50:45 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> This is a disgrace. This also shows that Flynn is guilty of the crimes he committed that Trump is pardoning him for... which means Trump is guilty as well.

1316755301165563905 2020-10-15 22:58:22 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @mkraju And he’s absolutely right. The Senate Republicans and House Republicans have lost their credibility over the last 4 years with Americans. You can see in polls &amp; in fundraising America is speaking to just that. Mr. Whitehouse is correct, but GOP doesn’t care about their hypocrisy.
1316754577350426624 2020-10-15 22:55:30 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @4a_of Tuning into NBC to the first minute of Trumps town hall. Then switching immediately to ABC to watch our future president answer questions.
1316754195744206849 2020-10-15 22:53:59 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @mkraju Because Trump thinks Americans will vote for him if he gives them money. He forgets that the average American isn’t him, and can’t be bought. That said, they need to pass something, Americans are well beyond struggling right now.

1316741989396811776 2020-10-15 22:05:28 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> America is speaking. Americans are donating. They are showing you over and over they are DONE with the gop. Fucking listen up.

1316737760821153800 2020-10-15 21:48:40 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> Senate Republicans only care about themselves, not the American people.
1316737310944264192 2020-10-15 21:46:53 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> Facts: Trump is mad, that a natural DISASTER took precedence over him. Remember that #Iowa, he cares more about his ego and self than your entire state, and he doesn’t care about your hardships. #VOTE

You’ve had a few over the years and I’m not sure you’ve been successful at any of them. America doesn’t trust anything you say-and you’ve given them ample reason not to.

Merrick Garland is beyond qualified, but you sat back and allowed Mitch McConnell to squash that. John, just like too many I know with your name, you are a hypocrite, a liar and now, a bad man.
1315651664620195840 2020-10-12 21:52:55 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> No, @JohnCornyn, there’s no religious test. However, there is a morality test, AND the PEOPLE OF AMERICA should have a say in something that AFFECTS THEM. You’re taking that away from AMERICANS.
1315644828034764805 2020-10-12 21:25:45 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> Lindsey Graham is a hypocritical anti-American former politician. He USED to be a politician, but since Trump came into office, he’s become a complicit Russian asset and has aided in destroying our country.

1314979847593177090 2020-10-11 01:23:21 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @LindseyGrahamSC needs to concede. After these remarks it should be beyond obvious that Graham thinks this is 1950, and that he is not fit to serve the people of South Carolina or America. Hate has no home here Lindsey.
1314966427976306688 2020-10-11 00:30:01 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> He’s already conceding, Trump knows he can’t win 🤣
1314898423036903426 2020-10-10 19:59:48 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> Trump knew he was positive before the debate. Pass it on.

1314363692180537344 2020-10-09 08:34:58 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @itsJeffTiedrich Trump would only care if it happened to a Republican. He doesn’t believe any democrat is worthy of their lives. Clearly.

The same way you knew about those boys being harmed. Both situations you sit back and do nothing so YOU can stay comfortable while keeping dangerous men in powerful positions.

1313200392466038786 2020-10-06 03:32:26 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> I would never, ever trust Conley as a doctor after this. He’s proved that he puts his patients ego above their best medical interest. I’m sure his pockets get a nice lining for doing this. What a waste of medical school, no one will ever want him as their doctor.
1313188466386231297 2020-10-06 02:45:02 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> He wants to be able to spread it to as many as possible.
1313186927064084483 2020-10-06 02:38:55 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> Wtf
1313185777367556098 2020-10-06 02:34:21 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @realDonaldTrump Do you not hear how absurd you sound? “I got into a car and risked others lives, so that I could go wave to thirty people who are so brainwashed they follow me everywhere and I needed my ego stroked”. Can’t wait for a REAL president. #BidenHarris2020

They went to a big event. They wore no masks. They spread it. The other stripe, as you put it, wasn’t there. And most of the “other stripes” have sense enough to take precautions, wear a mask and not attend unnecessary events. 🤷🏽‍♀️
1313181034649968641 2020-10-06 02:15:31 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> That’s a threat of assault on all his colleagues. @SenRonJohnson just made it very clear that like his dear leader, he doesn’t care about anyone but himself. Americans will remember Ronnie.

1313128814319472640 2020-10-05 22:48:00 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> Let’s be honest about why though.   @PatToomey knows he could never win after this nonsense he’s encouraged the past 4 years. He’s attempting to bow out early and in his mind gracefully. But we know that he’s only doing it to avoid the embarrassment of a huge loss.
1313125911722590208 2020-10-05 22:36:28 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> Hopefully they stay masked and very distant from literally anyone in that administration.

If he truly has COVID, I can’t figure out how his doctor thought this would be safe or a good idea. Donald Trump only cares about Donald Trump. He’s giving a big 🖕🏽 to his secret service by doing this.
1312875782402908160 2020-10-05 06:02:33 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @realDonaldTrump made this blatantly clear today, on his little patient zero field trip.

The poster pointed out that trump would hate the factual word obese being used about him. If it offended YOU then say that but you don’t speak for every fat person.
1312763586205429763 2020-10-04 22:36:43 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @GillianPlummer You’re not the spokesperson either dear.

1312760885266571266 2020-10-04 22:25:59 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @GillianPlummer @WillieGarson Words do have power. And as an obese person, I didn’t see the harm in this. COVID has a higher morbidity rate in obese people. Americans should be aware of that, and bc Donald Trump is in fact obese, this virus may be more detrimental to him. Fat people know they’re fat.

You can be big mad all you want, but he didn’t follow the basic guidelines set by DOCTORS, he didn’t wear a mask, he was physically close with numerous people, and HE insisted on rallies.

1312002067054170113 2020-10-02 20:10:43 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> Because money is more important to Trump than any single human being. Trump does not care about anyone but his pockets.
1312001433127055360 2020-10-02 20:08:12 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> Tapes came out of Melania not being her best. Trump doesn’t want to debate Joe anymore, because he’s a puss ass bitch.

1311287034334654466 2020-09-30 20:49:26 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @IngrahamAngle Correction-trump was talking over everyone and not letting either get a word in. This was unpresidential, embarrassing, rude, and immature. This is how a narcissistic man child acts. He’s not a good debater, he’s good at yelling over people and ignoring the questions.
1311277519971266560 2020-09-30 20:11:37 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @kylegriffin1 Because they’re a huge chunk of his base, and he doesn’t want to denounce his base. He’d lose at least half his votes.

Fortunately the kid realized he didn’t need to impress anyone and found real friends.

1303804903702364173 2020-09-10 05:18:07 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> Ted is the kid on the playground who’s desperate for others approval. He wants friends and doesn’t care if they use him and treat him like garbage- as long as he can tell people he has friends, that way he doesn’t look like the loser he believes he is.
1303804902242693123 2020-09-10 05:18:06 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> Don’t get it twisted- Trump will NEVER nominate @tedcruz. This is a pacifier to cover his ass after Ted finding out that Trump was behind the Enquirer article, and there’s receipts. And if Ted falls for this, it’s his own fault, but would be terribly unsurprising. 1/2
1303801691922460673 2020-09-10 05:05:21 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @grandmagrit I think it’s pathetic. And it nulls the significance of those who actually earned the nomination.
1303800505890672641 2020-09-10 05:00:38 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @chipfranklin Complicit.
1303800160259104770 2020-09-10 04:59:16 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> The House and Senate Republicans (mostly minus Mitt, he has a little morality) are a bunch of puss ass bitches. People didn’t have to die. Trump knew and did nothing. #HeKnew #TrumpLiedPeopleDied

Didn’t he owe it to Americans to tell the truth WHEN IT COUNTED? Glad truth is FINALLY out there, but wish these sources would be patriotic and call out wrong when it happens.

1303796998336847873 2020-09-10 04:46:42 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> Almost 200,000 lives. #HeKnew #TrumpKnew  TRUMP DOESN’T CARE ABOUT YOU.
1303796409385332737 2020-09-10 04:44:22 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> And this is the problem. “There will be a new one tomorrow” Trump has had SO MANY entanglements that literally everyday it’s something new. You’d think the @GOP(of ALL people) would want the mean girl out of office. Trumps holding the burn book and their secrets are inside.  https://t.co/cvVR8DRBLA
1303795486990774277 2020-09-10 04:40:42 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @TomCottonAR Definitely more like time for you to not be a senator anymore. Please resign and slip quietly out the back door with your tail between your legs. No viagra for you. #WomenAGAINSTTomCotton #TomCottonHATESWomen You’re a pro-birther. Clearly not pro-life.
1303794159850082305 2020-09-10 04:35:25 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> Trump knew. He fucking knew. It’s ON TAPE. And he STILL let almost 200,000 people die. #Trump2020 people-TRUMP DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU OR YOUR FAMILY. It today doesn’t prove that to you, idk what will. Trump is okay with your death. I’m not. #TrumpKnewAndDidNothing
1303474334686752774 2020-09-09 07:24:33 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> Why will no one stop this man? There’s no way Republicans can say “this is America” bc it’s fucking not anymore. It’s trump world and they’re all guilty for helping.

1302934342273036293 2020-09-07 19:38:49 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @DrCraigMalkin @DeanBrowningPA But you made this post. You inferred that. You think the internalized racist is superior and that says all anyone needs to know about you.

But you’re so pathetic you’re trying to troll a fucking actor about their show. You’re so pathetic, Matt. Sad.
1302597094239240192 2020-09-06 21:18:43 +0800 <WhatsHerNameIn9> @GOP Millions of parents don’t want to send their kids. We don’t trust the @gop. It’s leadership has proven that they are more focused on loyalty to Trump than loyalty to America.
