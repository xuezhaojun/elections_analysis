1339640497070088193 2020-12-18 02:35:58 +0800 <LouLiv1> @TheBYBPodcast thanks for this great podcast on #movement and #ExecutiveFunction
1338607439915208707 2020-12-15 06:10:58 +0800 <LouLiv1> thanks for this @lernusUK if we think about education as something that is done by our children rather than to our children then it seems logical that responsibility should take precedence over sanctions - a great #educationalneuroscience project
1337851051777646594 2020-12-13 04:05:21 +0800 <LouLiv1> @KarlaHolmboe interested in this - movement is so under researched and yet it is key in every interaction with the environment
1336224220448231433 2020-12-08 16:20:54 +0800 <LouLiv1> Happy day
1336220127528890372 2020-12-08 16:04:38 +0800 <LouLiv1> Agreed #Iwillgetvaccinated
1335926874208407556 2020-12-07 20:39:21 +0800 <LouLiv1> @mindtheflap @SueReviews couldn't agree more- you are being asked to use it for a reason and its not all about you!
1335879803845693440 2020-12-07 17:32:19 +0800 <LouLiv1> new paper explaining the link between #Montessori and brain development #educationalneuroscience #brainbasededucation  https://t.co/95kigoIpl8
1335878624273117191 2020-12-07 17:27:38 +0800 <LouLiv1> highlighting what we can learn about development by studying atypical developm - thanks @uol_CEN
1335869996128489472 2020-12-07 16:53:20 +0800 <LouLiv1> @mwalibali I don’t think it really can reach teaching whilst our view of teaching remains largely teaching to the test - to cross the bridge we need to look at education as a developmental tool #montessori #educationalneuroscience #brainbasededucation
1335591440047550464 2020-12-06 22:26:28 +0800 <LouLiv1> Great work - thanks everyone
1334928117245284355 2020-12-05 02:30:39 +0800 <LouLiv1> @KarlaHolmboe I am doing longitudinal with 3 plus would have started a bit younger if I felt there were reliable tasks
1334924836104269825 2020-12-05 02:17:37 +0800 <LouLiv1> @KarlaHolmboe this looks really interesting - we need tasks like this for longitudinal study of executive function
1334258938641068035 2020-12-03 06:11:34 +0800 <LouLiv1> #Iwillgetvaccinated
1334054603369934848 2020-12-02 16:39:37 +0800 <LouLiv1> You are right as always @CMO_England
1334053696943124480 2020-12-02 16:36:01 +0800 <LouLiv1> Yes - here’s to science
1331891846994333697 2020-11-26 17:25:36 +0800 <LouLiv1> @GoddardBlythe it is important that this research is being done. Movement is an integral part of the Montessori approach.
1330068092806975492 2020-11-21 16:38:39 +0800 <LouLiv1> I always need to see this #pandalove
1329884756083929093 2020-11-21 04:30:08 +0800 <LouLiv1> @eternalmagpie I love it - I have chosen to do it because I wanted to do it - free choice enhances enjoyment I guess - study part-time but would be happy doing it 24/7
1329884188942675972 2020-11-21 04:27:53 +0800 <LouLiv1> @DrRebeccaGordon You clearly are mad
1329884029479432192 2020-11-21 04:27:15 +0800 <LouLiv1> Evidence that it is worth thinking about how neuroscience can support education #educationalneuroscience #montessori #brainbasededucation
1329883003888283650 2020-11-21 04:23:10 +0800 <LouLiv1> Real work having impact on real people’s lives thank you @MontessoriAMI @MontessoriMMI
1329552186599215106 2020-11-20 06:28:37 +0800 <LouLiv1> @LearnusUK @denismarechal2 too true

1321025052230459393 2020-10-27 17:44:50 +0800 <LouLiv1> @N_R_Livingston some of the best of us started in the south...a stones throw from where you are going and then got dragged north..
1320279277514985474 2020-10-25 16:21:24 +0800 <LouLiv1> @sbaroncohen A must read for me
1319634324380147713 2020-10-23 21:38:35 +0800 <LouLiv1> great opportunity to work with a great team
1319633578477715457 2020-10-23 21:35:37 +0800 <LouLiv1> exciting developments in the south west of England

1313879465957691392 2020-10-08 00:30:50 +0800 <LouLiv1> @MatthewDBentley You look happy :)
1312314116284067842 2020-10-03 16:50:41 +0800 <LouLiv1> @NumCog @NumCog here here - it is easy to underestimate the effort being made - have seen it with our #montessori teachers
1311754945239158784 2020-10-02 03:48:44 +0800 <LouLiv1> Another Livingston on the PhD trail :)
1304059953083224067 2020-09-10 22:11:35 +0800 <LouLiv1> @Lucy_Livingston @BPSDevSection he does not adjust his behaviour for anyone!
1303978790834581504 2020-09-10 16:49:05 +0800 <LouLiv1> So excited and proud to hear @Lucy_Livingston in just under an hour - talk about her the work that won her this award - you can still sign up for the @BPSOfficial talk
1302725647605927936 2020-09-07 05:49:32 +0800 <LouLiv1> @Booky_Lillz This is not an easy read but Montessori the Absorbent Mind is fundamental - and Lise Elliot what’s going on in there?
1302347787301015553 2020-09-06 04:48:03 +0800 <LouLiv1> Thanks ⁦⁦⁦⁦@michaelmorpurgo⁩ as you say testing Is not education A Point of View - Thinking Otherwise - BBC Sounds  https://t.co/HDYWQiDnQh

1302330307132174341 2020-09-06 03:38:36 +0800 <LouLiv1> @mbateman love this #montessori quote #executivefunction
1302320769356177416 2020-09-06 03:00:42 +0800 <LouLiv1> Definitely - I am using this word but it is far from what I mean
1302297871530758144 2020-09-06 01:29:42 +0800 <LouLiv1> Pleased to see that the new development matters document includes the importance of supporting executive function in the early years #montessori #executivefunction
