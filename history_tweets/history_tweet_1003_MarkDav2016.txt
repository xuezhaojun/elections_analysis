1343931810758201347 2020-12-29 22:48:07 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @Rob_Kimbell Why aren't Indians dominating the TV Adverts?
1343931274684215296 2020-12-29 22:45:59 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @ClimateWarrior7 Really? And Remoaners talk of Brexiteers being uneducated.
1343922925745958912 2020-12-29 22:12:49 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @afneil The sums involved are disgusting when this country is so much in debt.

1343858537894703104 2020-12-29 17:56:57 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @DeborahMeaden Still not accepting a democratic vote? Time will tell if Brexit was the right decision. Time for the likes of you accept Democracy and move on.

1343505803110731780 2020-12-28 18:35:19 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @BrexitStewart @RuthLeaEcon @guardian The same can be said about their concern for Financial Services, an industry they despise so much they would tax it out of existence.
1343481351677370368 2020-12-28 16:58:09 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @UnitedStandMUFC Nothing against the lad but he's simply not good enough for United if we want to compete at the highest level.
1343479593538355201 2020-12-28 16:51:10 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Its disgusting whats going on in South Africa. When whites are on the end of hatred,abuse and even death the West looks the other way.

The same people they trash day in and day out and believe should be clobbered even more with taxation. Hypocrites.

1343238668316782594 2020-12-28 00:53:49 +0800 <MarkDav2016> I have spent 20 years watching premiership matches and can't recall abuse being hurled at black players. All supporters in this country idolise black players playing for their clubs. We also have laws in place to deal with any racist chants.

We have properties in this country 100's of years old standing without this mark. Where is this adding value?
1342891581146333184 2020-12-27 01:54:37 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @JoshFeldberg Sorry Sir Im proud to be British and I don't want my nationality to be diluted as just another European. The EU is the deluded one thinking the Germans,Spanish,French and Italians are all singing off the same hymn sheet.
1342890282141032450 2020-12-27 01:49:27 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @LBC @DavidLammy Im not happy where the race debate is going. We have laws regarding equality and equal opportunity and the view that only black lives matter is a kick in teeth to the other races that make up our multiracial society.
1342852310075138048 2020-12-26 23:18:34 +0800 <MarkDav2016> What a toss pot
1342851954956001281 2020-12-26 23:17:09 +0800 <MarkDav2016> They need closing down. A national embarrassment.

In time we can ammend where necessary
1342749665213767680 2020-12-26 16:30:41 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @SarcasticalPaul @DebraSloanO @mikegalsworthy Your missing the point prior to 2011 they were voluntary. Then the EU made it law . Every maker of Trusses has to comply at an unnecessary  cost to their business. The UK is carrying it over but who knows this may be changed in time.
1342623821782786049 2020-12-26 08:10:38 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @JaneRackham2 @divadarlings1 There are winners and losers in A Democratic vote. Unlucky you are just backing the wrong horse.

1342568492336361472 2020-12-26 04:30:46 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @DebraSloanO @mikegalsworthy Time to buy British then. Another win

1342480364024057856 2020-12-25 22:40:35 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @mikegalsworthy Ill tell you one. I supply a company making roof trusses They have to have a CE mark by EU LAW. Its has cost the company about £1000 to buy kit to mark these trusses never to be seen again under roof tiles. Never had a problem before.
1342456771965820933 2020-12-25 21:06:50 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @Lucyjane1004 @johnredwood We live in a Democracy. Britain voted in a Tory Government. Your lack of trust in your own citizens is embarrassing.

1342422772971167746 2020-12-25 18:51:44 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @wmarybeard @BarrySheerman A Global perspective would be better. I travel to Asia most years and have come to realise how backward Europe has become. Stop being a small minded European.
1342421835523256320 2020-12-25 18:48:01 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @BarrySheerman @BBCNews Your'e out of touch and now for the grace of god Out of the EU.
1342421450502844416 2020-12-25 18:46:29 +0800 <MarkDav2016> A Happy Brexmas to all my followers. Its been a rollercoaster ride but I believe we have achieved the best possible outcome all things being considered. A big thanks to Sir Nigel and Boris
1342397807370645504 2020-12-25 17:12:32 +0800 <MarkDav2016> David the Asian market place is where its at right now. Not out of date Europe.
1342397326074245120 2020-12-25 17:10:37 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @Anna_Soubry You couldnt be further from the truth if you tried. Europe is dying on its feet economically whilst Asia is has become the World's fastest growing market place. The UK will become richer so long as we grasp the opportunities before us.
1342386032403226625 2020-12-25 16:25:45 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Glad its all over. Time to move on and make a success of Brexit.
1342383380055404545 2020-12-25 16:15:12 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Great footballer Stan. Your politics are not quite at it right now. The UK will focus Globally now and not the past its sell by date EU.
1342381664127897600 2020-12-25 16:08:23 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @Anna_Soubry For £10billion a year and no control over our laws and borders you can't be serious.
1342380420432801792 2020-12-25 16:03:27 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Not true. This deal gives the UK fishing industry time to modernise and rebuild whilst increasing our catch in return for a UK wide trade deal with the EU. We were never going to have 100% from day one .
1342295633894535169 2020-12-25 10:26:32 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @acgrayling Time to grow a pair. What a pathetic loser

1342201049961082888 2020-12-25 04:10:41 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Boris appears to have delivered. But the detail will be important. Cheers.

Their lack of cooperation in defeating the problem is clearly evident.
1340390447320100864 2020-12-20 04:16:00 +0800 <MarkDav2016> The G8 and G20 meet to discuss world economic matters. Can someone explain why no such meeting has been convened to discuss beating the COVID Virus?
1340389943676444678 2020-12-20 04:14:00 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Worrying times. The Virus is mutating into a more infectious version. The vaccine was seen as the end game. But will it still work with the new strain? We will probably know more in a few weeks time.

1339298506318749696 2020-12-17 03:57:01 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @GraemeKelly1 @SkyNews Its reality. We only have finite resources
1339296509100236800 2020-12-17 03:49:05 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @GraemeKelly1 @SkyNews I would love you Graeme to speak directly to the rough sleepers in Bath and say the poor in Africa are more important than them.

1339281961093914627 2020-12-17 02:51:16 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @MoCap786 @SkyNews There probably isnt a political party in this country that reflects my views. I see rough sleepers in Bath , I deliver water to food banks. Its a national disgrace what is happening in this country. Foreign Aid is fine by me once home issues are dealt with.

1339267436693086212 2020-12-17 01:53:33 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @Leonard_Daniels @SkyNews We have some of the highest tax rates in the free world. If your friends in the EU honoured their commitments to NATO ie 2% of GDP then maybe it wouldnt be as  important to us.

How times have changed. My understanding is that about 60% of a UK vehicle is imported. And yes a no deal brexit will be a short term disaster for  our car industry. However I believe COVID 19 is just as big a threat.

1334420907369132032 2020-12-03 16:55:11 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @DavidLammy Someone has to be first. What's wrong with the UK being first? As were are leaving the EU we chose to go it alone. If we weren't we would probably be in line with the other 27. Don't let facts get in the way of your argument.
1334251567789338624 2020-12-03 05:42:17 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @Bullseye170 Speechless. God Bless

Very little effect on CO2 . The returning containers will have UK exports instead of going back empty. Our exports are pitiful compared to our imports at the moment.

1332599641746124800 2020-11-28 16:18:07 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @Rob_Kimbell But, but,but Corbyn said we don't want to become the Singapore of Europe.

1332597507315163136 2020-11-28 16:09:38 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Anywhere but Europe had growing economies pre COVID.
1332593412042846208 2020-11-28 15:53:22 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @sometimesyouwin @RogerHelmerMEP Its a tiny part of the economy because our membership of the EU has made it this way. Many jobs lost. We used to be a net exporter of fish we now import more than we export. Hopefully we can redress this in the coming years.
1332590965220143105 2020-11-28 15:43:39 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @JDCSense1973 @RogerHelmerMEP I think you will find alot of countries outside the EU like fish too. Loss of the EU market would only be a short term issue.
1332588595094417410 2020-11-28 15:34:14 +0800 <MarkDav2016> We get the COVID death figures on a daily basis. Are any figures available for those dying on Flu at the moment?
1332581397094133761 2020-11-28 15:05:37 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @pimlicat @DavidGHFrost @MichelBarnier Only 10% of British Companies export. Of that 43% is recorded as going to the EU. I think you will find the impact of a No Deal is bring exaggerated. Talking of shared crime information- What are the French doing to stop the illegal trafficking of people across the channel? Zilch
1332205310304509954 2020-11-27 14:11:11 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @DaisyAdeleleo @DamainWard The UK is financially going down the pan and Liberals want to borrow even more to give to charity. It can't be true.

Its a national disgrace. Natural disasters yes but the  rest should be cancelled whilst this country is £2trillion in debt.

1329913499766677504 2020-11-21 06:24:21 +0800 <MarkDav2016> The public sector have hardly been affected by this pandemic when compared to the private sector. A pay freeze seems sensible.
1329912921607057435 2020-11-21 06:22:03 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Im sure at the right price we can sell elsewhere. Their behaviour since the vote seems to justify why we are leaving.

1325921809896771586 2020-11-10 06:02:48 +0800 <MarkDav2016> When the Democrats said the Russians were to blame for Trump winning in 2016 why didn't twitter put a disclaimer like they are doing now over voter fraud? These Corporations are part of the mob.
1325919808521711616 2020-11-10 05:54:51 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @FreezePeach49 Would you see as many white faces on Jamaican TV?
1325918170813755393 2020-11-10 05:48:20 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Trump tells it as it is. He's a nutcase but politics will be boring without the likes of him. The world has been relatively peaceful under his watch with progress with N Korea and the middle east. China are a worry and even more so under the watch of lefty Biden.
1325916748210724864 2020-11-10 05:42:41 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @afneil Trump got about 5 million more votes. Not bad for a so called loser

1325737333421985792 2020-11-09 17:49:45 +0800 <MarkDav2016> The Dems haven't accepted the last vote trying to impeach Trump and thinking the Russians made Americans vote against them but now this vote cant be challenged with suggestions of fraud. Hypocrites the lot of them.

1325381805697064960 2020-11-08 18:17:01 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Not much chance of that after the Democrats have been abusing Trump supporters for the past 4 years.

1324839025858007043 2020-11-07 06:20:12 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @DavidLammy Whilst David Lammy spent years trying to over turn the Brexit Vote. Hypocrisy at its finest.
1324828522838450178 2020-11-07 05:38:28 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @Ricky_K67 The UK has become part of the race to the bottom.
1324826909197377537 2020-11-07 05:32:03 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @piersmorgan This vote has confirmed the US moving towards the standards of a third world country. The streets of Seatle and Portland are coming to a town near you soon.
1324823506832498698 2020-11-07 05:18:32 +0800 <MarkDav2016> The Postal Vote system is open to abuse. Thats why its banned in France. Your mob contested the last election result for 4 years.Brace yourself for the fight back.
1324820825682464769 2020-11-07 05:07:53 +0800 <MarkDav2016> For all the Democrat Voters crowing over the fact than Biden looks likely to be the next President just remember nearly 70 million right of centre voters think you are wrong. # Trump2024.
1324816041759879169 2020-11-07 04:48:52 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Think about it. Lewis Hamilton is so concerned about the well being of the Black Community in the UK that he decides to live an a tax haven and in doing so  contributes nothing to the well being of Black lives in the UK. Hypocrisy at its finest.
1324794992230043654 2020-11-07 03:25:14 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @toryboypierce @realDonaldTrump The postal votes look dodgy

1324597494966353920 2020-11-06 14:20:27 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @primevideouk I loved the early Borat stuff but he has run out of ideas with this movie. Not a good watch.
1324596965376741376 2020-11-06 14:18:21 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @gatewaypundit @simarkuk @realDonaldTrump American Democracy looks broken to me. Very suspicious Postal Voting.
1324207521045880833 2020-11-05 12:30:50 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @ManUtd I think we have all seen enough. A change of manager is now required.
1323933467802013697 2020-11-04 18:21:50 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @bbclaurak I dont know of any voting system around the world where the count stops because of nightfall. Surely another shift should arrive to continue the count. Im sure Trump is concerned of boxes of postal votes by magic turning up days after the vote has finished.
1323902640342925312 2020-11-04 16:19:21 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @piersmorgan Piers I think you have called this wrong. I think Trump is saying the voting has to stop as the polls have closed. He didnt say stop the counting. His concern is that the voters will postal vote today or tomorrow after the polls have closed. Sounds like common sense to me .
1323840846031106048 2020-11-04 12:13:48 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @piersmorgan If Trump wins this it just goes to show the bias of the MSM and how out of touch they are with  the public at large.
1323836643707654144 2020-11-04 11:57:06 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Its always the Left who call the race card.
1323835841920311301 2020-11-04 11:53:55 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @jemelehill The irony is its probably the actions of the BLM that helped Trump win. Mr average doesnt want to live in a country run by the Mob.
1323829282624462848 2020-11-04 11:27:51 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @piersmorgan But the polls Said Biden had a lead of up to 10%.Can't be true.
1323519545961779200 2020-11-03 14:57:04 +0800 <MarkDav2016> So even PHE are now telling us that COVID is the same as the flu
1323514518828441603 2020-11-03 14:37:05 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @BorisJohnson Sorry Boris you havent a clue on this subject.Why is the British tax payer paying millions of pounds each year for security forces to watch people who shouldnt be in the country in the first place?
1323197505472004098 2020-11-02 17:37:23 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @ManUtd Looks like a long hard season ahead. Not sure how long Ole will last.
1322858677741694976 2020-11-01 19:11:00 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @bowyerp @LBC @MaajidNawaz He should know the number of deaths if Lockdown is carried out for other health problems.
1322858246173007878 2020-11-01 19:09:18 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Good interview Maajid. Not one slide was shown yesterday on the economic cost of a second lockdown. Sick people with everyday ailments will also avoid the COVID NHS.
1322844725049778186 2020-11-01 18:15:34 +0800 <MarkDav2016> This is arse about face.
1322797794982322176 2020-11-01 15:09:05 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Don't forget it was health professionals who put elderly patients into care homes without testing last March.
1322796304964165633 2020-11-01 15:03:10 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Not one slide showing the financial consequences of a 2nd Lockdown.
1322634264446382081 2020-11-01 04:19:16 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @piersmorgan The question is why? If half the first wave deaths were caused in carehomes and we have now learnt from that mistake by medical professionals why should the second wave be worse?
1322633753282433026 2020-11-01 04:17:14 +0800 <MarkDav2016> The UK going into a second lockdown is a national disaster. The left wing view of destroying the economy is taking hold. No economic data provided at the PM press conference. No explanation by these so called professionals why the virus is spreading.
1322555676778991618 2020-10-31 23:06:59 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @FromeTownFC 1nil Frome. Rex Mannings. Keep up.
1322547178410332160 2020-10-31 22:33:13 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @d_mos77 @PatWilliams1944 The NHS is always under pressure at this time of year. I would like to know how this October compares with last October. Also can we have the forecast for business failures and the rise in unemployment during another lockdown.The public have the right to know.
1322541671599333383 2020-10-31 22:11:20 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @afneil There is a trade off between health and the economy. The NHS and Welfare State are not paid for by the magic money tree. Will Boris announce today how many busineses will fail and how many jobs will be lost if we lockdown agsin. Don't hold your breath.
1322526871876227072 2020-10-31 21:12:32 +0800 <MarkDav2016> You are spot on David
1322458178974633985 2020-10-31 16:39:34 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @bbclaurak Easy to say but the damage to the economy and livelihoods of millions of people will be devastating.
1322420156417658885 2020-10-31 14:08:29 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Who ever thought Xmas was going to be normal anyway, must be deluded.
1322065006146555905 2020-10-30 14:37:14 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @afneil Its not news anymore and will only get worse over time.
1322063758374686720 2020-10-30 14:32:17 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Im afraid its still candles .No politician in the west is prepared to deal with the problem.
1321917762386743297 2020-10-30 04:52:09 +0800 <MarkDav2016> The west has to rethink their strategy in dealing with this problem. Quite clearly the softly softly approach isn't working. Why should innocent individuals just wait to be killed.
1321888144585859072 2020-10-30 02:54:27 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @KurlyKrissy Whilst the majority of Muslims will quite rightly distance themselves from these barbaric actions, the perpetrators will say they did in the name of Allah. This is the problem facing all western societies.
1321339135462903808 2020-10-28 14:32:53 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @MayorofLondon Fleeing the EU?If things are so bad in Europe just as well we are leaving.

1320031921288679424 2020-10-24 23:58:29 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @FromeTownFC A big result for Ciren even this early in the season.

1319916331697868800 2020-10-24 16:19:10 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @LoyalDefender2K A deliberate ploy by the Labour Party to blame business failure on the Tory Party
1319900034759086082 2020-10-24 15:14:25 +0800 <MarkDav2016> True
1319891701968809985 2020-10-24 14:41:18 +0800 <MarkDav2016> So its the Democrats who are the racists. Who would have thought that.
1319890717255356416 2020-10-24 14:37:24 +0800 <MarkDav2016> We have politicians like that in the UK. Dianne Abbott for one.

Most asian countries are low tax economies.

1317774228704382976 2020-10-18 18:27:13 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @ManUtd Having said that United were probably worth £14.95 for the first time this season.
1317513150485434369 2020-10-18 01:09:47 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @ManUtd @paulpogba Useless. Nothing more to say about a player Fergie decided wasnt up for the fight.

1312469634256310272 2020-10-04 03:08:39 +0800 <MarkDav2016> It would be retaken at a higher level.

1310283673967755264 2020-09-28 02:22:26 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Watching the adverts on Sky you would think only black and white people live in this country. Chinese and Indian communities combined make up a bigger proportion of the population than the black community. What is going on?
1310162000035618816 2020-09-27 18:18:57 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @tesssummers98 I think everyone is anti mask and anti lockdown. Im in business and things are extremely difficult right now. But if key workers need PPE in their day to day activities whilst this Virus lingers then the population at large needs some protection too.Hence the mask.
1310160477020991489 2020-09-27 18:12:53 +0800 <MarkDav2016> To be honest I heard enough of Lewis's politics.
1309796191488618507 2020-09-26 18:05:21 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @DCStubbs1 @SkyNews Sky News are big supporters of BLM thats why
1309795884452982787 2020-09-26 18:04:08 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Cutting our Overseas Aid Bill to start with.
1309775524219301888 2020-09-26 16:43:14 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @ManUtd How times have changed. United no longer have a squad to compete at the top of the PL never mind the Champions League. The non playing players are sucking the club dry.
1309198947106394113 2020-09-25 02:32:07 +0800 <MarkDav2016> There no such thing as left wing utopia. Pulling everyone down to a lower level doesn't put a smile on anyones face.
1308279733591748608 2020-09-22 13:39:29 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @Evra You speak for the many Patrice
1308118813066625025 2020-09-22 03:00:03 +0800 <MarkDav2016> No but do young people respect COVID after 10pm?
1307740971908698114 2020-09-21 01:58:39 +0800 <MarkDav2016> The country is a pc joke.
1307595536636284928 2020-09-20 16:20:44 +0800 <MarkDav2016> No one could say they had a good game apart from VDB.
1307562149410148356 2020-09-20 14:08:04 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @FabrizioRomano I reckon the budget for this transfer window was £50m.Will only get another player in if someone like Smalling goes. United with that defence will struggle for top 6.
1307194545302634496 2020-09-19 13:47:20 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @LBC @clivebull It was known months ago that this would happen again by the end of September. Not the best kept secret.
1307190895066968065 2020-09-19 13:32:50 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @DuffersKRO @BlueTone65 @SkyFootball Equality shouldn't say Black Lives Matter. Its offensive to other races in this multiracial country.
1307190309231656965 2020-09-19 13:30:30 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @SkyFootball This politicising of sport has been going on long enough.I don't feel race relations have been improved as a result. In fact I think the opposite has happened. Time to jog on Sky.
1306975698528206849 2020-09-18 23:17:43 +0800 <MarkDav2016> The Glaziers have screwed the club more than COVID. Nothing will change until they go.
1306703566170730496 2020-09-18 05:16:22 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Even economy class is good Lord Sugar.
1306166352059797504 2020-09-16 17:41:40 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @FoxxysTweets @GaryLineker These guys are over rated and overpaid. The British Taxpayer has been well and truly shafted.
1305379398292512769 2020-09-14 13:34:35 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Whilst members of your Party support the rent a mob BLM movement I don't think the public at large will believe you.
1305253654140719104 2020-09-14 05:14:56 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @politicalite Totally misjudged public opinion. Politics and entertainment is a no no.
1305252477453901835 2020-09-14 05:10:15 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @CarolineFeraday @AvonandsomerRob There is one law for all of us. Calling out one colour is racist.
1305049807334051840 2020-09-13 15:44:55 +0800 <MarkDav2016> Magical
1303580323469549569 2020-09-09 14:25:43 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @StevieDee710 It's now Black privilege and the Chinese, Indian and Filipinos and other races can step back in line. This racist division has to stop.
1303579304559861760 2020-09-09 14:21:40 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @ManUtd United targeting the African market.😂😂😂
1303565189724463104 2020-09-09 13:25:34 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @dbongino ANTIFA are the fascists.
1303564784051408897 2020-09-09 13:23:58 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @_Bervin @BernardKerik If looting, violence and thuggery are the good guys who are the bad guys?
1303562900418764800 2020-09-09 13:16:29 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @SCOTTCAUS @LadBonnie Just imagine if it was the other way round. The left would be marching in Parliament Square.
1303557538735165440 2020-09-09 12:55:10 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @FabrizioRomano @DiMarzio I suspect the Decision makers at OT are questioning if €120m could be better spent elsewhere than on Sancho. His last 2 England appearances have been poor to say the least
1303055428457246721 2020-09-08 03:39:58 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @politicalite The TV companies are taking us all for a ride. I  want to be entertained not politicised on a Saturday/ Sunday night.
1302199363154980864 2020-09-05 18:58:16 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @YTFC @FromeTownFC Hardly surprising after a recent 3-0 drubbing by Stratford Town.
1302090425856126976 2020-09-05 11:45:23 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @BethRigby If you have issues with him then he's probably the right man for the job.
1302089435174109185 2020-09-05 11:41:27 +0800 <MarkDav2016> My thoughts entirely. It's a national disgrace
1300885937833082886 2020-09-02 03:59:11 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @stclairashley Embarrassing
1300884766175244288 2020-09-02 03:54:32 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @SteveLaws19 Welcome to Treasure island.
1300882190239227904 2020-09-02 03:44:18 +0800 <MarkDav2016> @minxyminx1952 As our population grows the quality of life becomes a race to the bottom. It is what it is.
