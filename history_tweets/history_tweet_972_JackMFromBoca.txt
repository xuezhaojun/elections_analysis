1343600854952247302 2020-12-29 00:53:01 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @thehill @TheHillOpinion GOP should do more to make inroads with minority communities. Ron DeSantis was able to win 18% of Black women in his 2018 election because he made issues important to them (I believe school choice was the big one) a central part of his campaign.

1343039230742847494 2020-12-27 11:41:19 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @MorganMMcIntyre One of the women I know is a semi-resister on twitter, she tweets about Biden &amp; Pete buttigieg (her original pick) a lot but had a huge sign for her Republican state rep. in her store front window lmao. so i guess not "blue no matter who"
1343038582345388033 2020-12-27 11:38:45 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @MorganMMcIntyre yeah it's more suburban which is where all the Resist Tweeters come from lmao
1343038225946988545 2020-12-27 11:37:20 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @7th_ET i think there's at least one Jeff Davis county somewhere in the south

1343037142465974272 2020-12-27 11:33:01 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @TadeuszMrozek2 The last time my county went red was 1988. although it did swing right this election a bit. I don't expect it to flip though
1343036246076108802 2020-12-27 11:29:28 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @MorganMMcIntyre It's an unfair stereotype because I definitely lean more conservative and I also like Starbucks haha
1343035752045809665 2020-12-27 11:27:30 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @MorganMMcIntyre Liberal, I guess similar to the generic "Resist twitter" member. That might be due to the Starbucks drink lol.

1342935720135176192 2020-12-27 04:50:00 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @maxtmcc it's usually people on maga twitter seeing one ET liberal/leftist and writing off all of ET as liberals/leftists not realizing that there are also Republicans on here lmao

1342913139021647873 2020-12-27 03:20:17 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @OrgEaglePatriot ok I made a new one and got rid of the dummymandered 4 and 11
1342912962579857409 2020-12-27 03:19:35 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> NEW AND IMPROVED, and probably final, North Carolina "Fair" Map. Democrats now only won Districts 3 and 7 in every race available on DRA, except for Obama in 2008, where he won the eastern 1st district.  https://t.co/DtgMnvHPh9
1342909891938152449 2020-12-27 03:07:22 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @OrgEaglePatriot yeah roy cooper won that one in 2016.

1342854909507624960 2020-12-26 23:28:54 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @LoefflerFan Has Nikki Haley's daughter ever posted about a patient's death on Twitter? No? Then it isn't about her.
1342853712641990656 2020-12-26 23:24:08 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @LoefflerFan The meme had literally nothing to do with Nikki Haley or her daughter
1342849235365015554 2020-12-26 23:06:21 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @LoefflerFan I don't. I never said I did.
1342849120231428096 2020-12-26 23:05:53 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 I wouldn't be okay with an actual accusation. I don't really see a problem with a person liking a meme that has literally nothing to do with Nikki Haley and does not mention her or her daughter in any way, shape, or form.
1342848801774723074 2020-12-26 23:04:37 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @LoefflerFan No. One. Is. Accusing. Nikki. Haley's. Daughter. Of. Murder.
1342711921313787906 2020-12-26 14:00:43 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @LoefflerFan I highly doubt this meme changes anyone's belief regarding whether or not nurses, as a whole, are murderers.
1342711329212280832 2020-12-26 13:58:21 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @LoefflerFan Okay. My neighbor is a nurse. I don't see the cops taking her away for questioning of a suspected murder.   Is there any possibility that you're taking that meme too seriously?
1342710948994363392 2020-12-26 13:56:51 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @LoefflerFan ...they aren't. Have they mentioned her by name?
1342710615849259008 2020-12-26 13:55:31 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @LoefflerFan Lighten up, please. It is a meme.
1342709489108217856 2020-12-26 13:51:03 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @LoefflerFan you might want to do some more research on what a meme actually is and what its intentions usually are. accusing a politician's daughter of murder simply because of her occupation is not a common intention for a meme, especially one that doesn't mention the politician.
1342708931559370752 2020-12-26 13:48:50 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @LoefflerFan memes are not typically meant to be taken seriously
1342708654399762433 2020-12-26 13:47:44 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @LoefflerFan liking a meme = accusing someone of murder
1342707910120509440 2020-12-26 13:44:46 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @LoefflerFan oh my gosh. IT'S A MEME.
1342707389628379136 2020-12-26 13:42:42 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @LoefflerFan I am sure that @LoefflerFan does not genuinely believe that nurses are murderers.

1338631016307679239 2020-12-15 07:44:39 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @BritishConserv3 @BenHks Pence, Rubio, Haley, maybe Scott (T. or R.). Desantis has some crossover appeal (he did surprisingly well with black women) but he's a bit too Trumpy imo.  Crenshaw is okay but nothing special. Cruz would lose. (Hey that rhymes!) Cotton would lose also. Hawley is WAY too populist
1338630471241097221 2020-12-15 07:42:29 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @breaking_et Thank you so much! I'm glad you agree with some of my takes - I agree with some of yours as well! - but it's not very surprising because I don't consider myself a diehard Trumpie or a partisan hack. I consider myself a compassionate Bush-era conservative.  Thank you again!!!
1338629541602975744 2020-12-15 07:38:47 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @BenHks @BritishConserv3 McConnell will make push to throw him out come Jan 20. It's clear he hates Trump. Many senate GOPers will follow. If the Republican party can keep Trump's gains with Latinos and find a new leader that won't piss off suburbanites, they'll be unstoppable.
1338628718114316290 2020-12-15 07:35:31 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @BritishConserv3 It's likely, if we can get a good, non-Trumpy candidate.

1337254634013020160 2020-12-11 12:35:24 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @bottoms4seavey I mean... a pledge of allegiance to a nation would be considered inherently nationalistic, right?   The debate is whether or not nationalism and patriotism are good things.

1337251713326215168 2020-12-11 12:23:48 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @DilwrAli Definitely should not have been executed. Definitely should not be lifted up as some hero.

1337244435608907777 2020-12-11 11:54:52 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NCSwasfarleft Not bad. Pretty similar to the current map. I'd try to combine 8 and 9 so they average out (8 looks a bit too competitive for my liking, but that's coming from a gop perspective)
1337239115859959809 2020-12-11 11:33:44 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @ianstevensc Indeed.
1337238410122194948 2020-12-11 11:30:56 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @BrockMeers Correct. The death penalty is not based.

I believe the reason she hasn‚Äôt denounced the fraud claims yet is because she doesn‚Äôt want to piss off republicans. We saw how quickly trump tore Kemp apart.

1335626841693032449 2020-12-07 00:47:08 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @bluearrowMaps @BrockMeers I would rather go that route as well. But Trump excites a lot of the gop base so the party is milking it before throwing him out come January 20th
1335626592673013766 2020-12-07 00:46:09 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @DelCalebVA I feel like rape and incest-related abortions would be handled within the first 12 weeks. Again this is all hypothetical and unlikely to pass as I know there are few who still believe in the fundamental and inalienable right to life.
1335626070708645888 2020-12-07 00:44:04 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @DelCalebVA Of course in a perfect world there would be no abortions ever, but I know that‚Äôs not possible
1335625803955101697 2020-12-07 00:43:01 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @DelCalebVA My ideal ‚Äúcompromise legislation‚Äù would be a ban after 12 weeks, unless the mother‚Äôs life is in danger or the baby has a condition so severe that it would not survive.
1335625410168713216 2020-12-07 00:41:27 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @BrockMeers We will see more and more accept as time goes on. GOP doesn‚Äôt want to upset their base before the January 5 runoffs so I think some are holding out until then
1335625091418370048 2020-12-07 00:40:11 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @DelCalebVA I understand your perspective. I disagree with the idea that a baby‚Äôs body is ‚Äúyour body‚Äù but I see where you‚Äôre coming from

1335284924631445509 2020-12-06 02:08:29 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @ianstevensc Yes but that‚Äôs a low bar
1335284583680643073 2020-12-06 02:07:07 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @HunterPolitic @ianstevensc @mxwiIson It depends on the other nominees

1335256293188247552 2020-12-06 00:14:42 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @ianstevensc @mxwiIson We can certainly do better than this

1334873626160603136 2020-12-04 22:54:07 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @Kam_Baker4 @NRCC Look at the last sentence of her tweet. that should explain.
1334873186740162560 2020-12-04 22:52:23 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 I would love to see a Haley / L. Cheney ticket. Loeffler is better in the Senate.
1334870974307643399 2020-12-04 22:43:35 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @SusanCollinsFan @NikkiHaleyfan93 @LoefflerFan 8. Haley is great but we can do better than Loeffler for VP.
1334705265422295041 2020-12-04 11:45:07 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @hjessy_ Yes regardless of ideology.
1334704976573194240 2020-12-04 11:43:58 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @IsThisMalarkey Yes
1334703812444086272 2020-12-04 11:39:21 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @carsonp619 So, so many. Maxine Waters probably tops the list
1334685567527882754 2020-12-04 10:26:51 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> Read the comments on this for a laugh.

1334684564858556423 2020-12-04 10:22:52 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @Politics_Polls It's fun to read all the comments on this tweet made by complacent Dems months ago.
1334683180901814273 2020-12-04 10:17:22 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @AmIObessive @OrgEaglePatriot Yeah lol
1334682874323361794 2020-12-04 10:16:09 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @AmIObessive @OrgEaglePatriot That could work. Based on trends minorities are shifting a bit to the right so it would make sense for the GOP to capitalize on these shifting groups to get more potential new voters.
1334672886473355264 2020-12-04 09:36:27 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @OrgEaglePatriot For the GOP to win they need a massive realignment. Similar to that of Bill Clinton in 1992
1334658012120756225 2020-12-04 08:37:21 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @BenAybar I live in one
1334653593866145794 2020-12-04 08:19:48 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @AmyTheSnowWoman Today I have been called  - a Nikki Haley hater - an Assad supporter - a socialist - an alt-right supporter  Interesting insults. A bit contradictory.
1334653334708498434 2020-12-04 08:18:46 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @AmyTheSnowWoman Interestingly I don't think I have used that against him. I *try* to have an open discussion but he always throws out some bs accusations and (after I debunk said accusations) creates a circular conversation.
1334652158436904960 2020-12-04 08:14:05 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> Looks like the Haley Hater Police caught me! I retweeted something Tulsi Gabbard said, which had literally nothing to do with Nikki Haley and indicated no endorsement of Tulsi Gabbard, so I must be a hater! (Disregard the profile picture &amp; the "Haley 2024" in my bio, of course.)
1334651604147056647 2020-12-04 08:11:53 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @mxwiIson I don't support the alt right. I support first amendment rights for all, including those I disagree with.
1334651438644031488 2020-12-04 08:11:14 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @mxwiIson Then Romney and I have something in common.
1334650530849812481 2020-12-04 08:07:37 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @mxwiIson Hey, remember when you said Nikki Haley was terrible and became MittRomneyFan? Less than a month ago, I believe.
1334649673022402561 2020-12-04 08:04:13 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @mxwiIson Keep telling yourself that.

1334648226058801152 2020-12-04 07:58:28 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @mxwiIson I don't agree with what they say but I will defend their right to say it.
1334648036207824896 2020-12-04 07:57:43 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @mxwiIson Oh definitely. Because my picture is Tulsi and my bio says "Tulsi 2024"
1334647791616929792 2020-12-04 07:56:44 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @mxwiIson Being against the modern-day book burners (big tech) doesn't make me a socialist.
1334647342214025223 2020-12-04 07:54:57 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @mxwiIson I am anti-tech censorship as it is my belief that large tech companies can use censorship to mislead the public and push their own agenda. But I believe Biden won and this election was not stolen.
1334646512836628481 2020-12-04 07:51:39 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @mxwiIson I disagree with your stance on section 230. And again, my shared opinion with Tulsi Gabbard regarding 230 does not indicate my endorsement of her.
1334645938418278401 2020-12-04 07:49:22 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @mxwiIson No. I never gave an endorsement of Tulsi. I just liked what she said about one particular issue, Section 230.
1334645600017674243 2020-12-04 07:48:02 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @mxwiIson I liked what she said regarding Section 230
1334645356349583363 2020-12-04 07:47:04 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @mxwiIson Yeah, and to me it doesn't. It's explicitly stated in my bio.
1334644999816945665 2020-12-04 07:45:39 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @mxwiIson Yes. Because follows don't equal endorsements.
1334643843401211904 2020-12-04 07:41:03 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @mxwiIson The original tweet had nothing to do with Nikki Haley.
1334643337878441985 2020-12-04 07:39:02 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @JD15690112 @bjones306 @ComteMLad @ObaXVII @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Florida's doing better than most of the nation, actually. We had our peak in June.  It's the north and midwest that are spiking now.
1334643002489376769 2020-12-04 07:37:42 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @mxwiIson Do I agree with him? No.  But I disagree with a lot of people I follow on a multitude of issues. Personally I like having a diverse set of opinions on my feed.
1334642485818249217 2020-12-04 07:35:39 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 @mxwiIson Because follows don't equal endorsements.

1333970470098571264 2020-12-02 11:05:18 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @Ashebutler_ @johnrose_VA True. That's a good thing. Biden needs checks and balances in Congress.

1332157112999424001 2020-11-27 10:59:40 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @cinyc9 @TadeuszMrozek2 Oh, I see. Yeah that would make sense. I know there's a lot of confusion in Dade county as to which cities/neighborhoods are part of Miami and which are separate cities.
1332156048824819714 2020-11-27 10:55:26 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @cinyc9 @TadeuszMrozek2 I could see why you think it would be in Dade, since the city has a Spanish name. Interestingly it does not have a high Latino population (only 11.9% as of the 2010 census).
1332154433959043072 2020-11-27 10:49:01 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @cinyc9 @TadeuszMrozek2 It's actually the southernmost city in Palm Beach County!   But I go to school in Broward, so I'll give you partial credit. :)

1331962361654206465 2020-11-26 22:05:48 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> My Ranking (@aj_corelli did one first): Haley Rubio Abbott T. Scott Hogan Baker Pence R. Scott Crenshaw Pompeo Sasse Cruz Cotton D. Trump Jr. E. Trump
1331960960815407106 2020-11-26 22:00:14 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @Radar_Horizon @PopulismUpdates DeSantis said he isn't running. Same with Tucker.
1331960366067314693 2020-11-26 21:57:52 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @aj_corelli Mostly agree. Rubio should be above Abbott imo but that's probably my Floridian bias kicking in.
1331959838000226317 2020-11-26 21:55:46 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @TheHidingGhost I like Rubio/Haley or Haley/Rubio. Good combo doesn't really matter to me who's on the top of the ticket

1329966705892847616 2020-11-21 09:55:46 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NathanIWinston1 Alrighty. Yeah he's the favorite but it's not a guarantee  He's certainly my first choice! And most likely he will be the first person I will ever vote for, in my first election (which is August primary 2022)
1329964668245389315 2020-11-21 09:47:41 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NathanIWinston1 True, but Rubio is very well-liked here, not only in Latino and white working-class areas but in the suburban areas as well.
1329963811357552641 2020-11-21 09:44:16 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NathanIWinston1 Rubio won't lose renomination lol

1329954277847162880 2020-11-21 09:06:23 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @TheDemocrats @JoeBiden The election was not a landslide. 2016 was not a landslide. I don‚Äôt even consider 2012 a landslide.

1327328313715662848 2020-11-14 03:11:45 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> I would be completely fine with switching the electoral college with a 1-vote-per-county system. (No splitting or merging of counties.)

1325194321570766848 2020-11-08 05:52:01 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @Roark1Jacob Ticket splitting, but the other way. People change their minds a lot, and vote certain ways on different races.
1325189990134009857 2020-11-08 05:34:49 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @bottoms4ossoff I‚Äôm a bit concerned for Oklahoma

1325140041493082112 2020-11-08 02:16:20 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @ianstevensc Time for GOP to rebrand, and fast. Pick a new and non-divisive leader. We can take back the house.
1325130761373175808 2020-11-08 01:39:27 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan93 Ron DeSantis

1324728044171440130 2020-11-06 22:59:12 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @bottoms4ossoff Oh well, you can‚Äôt win ‚Äòem all.   I‚Äôm still ecstatic about Dade County and the Florida Legislature
1324727776059019269 2020-11-06 22:58:08 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> I am thoroughly impressed with the @FloridaGOP ‚Äòs marketing and GOTV efforts. We need EVERY other state Republican Party to replicate this, and we will win BIG in 2022/2024!!!
1324584781112291328 2020-11-06 13:29:56 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @TadeuszMrozek2 Susan Collins deserves the world!
1324583012609232898 2020-11-06 13:22:54 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> So...does "what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas" apply to votes too? is that why they're taking so long to report results???

1324008471457599490 2020-11-04 23:19:53 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> Florida is proof that high turnout does not equal a Democratic landslide.

1323992551821553666 2020-11-04 22:16:37 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> Biden will likely win at this point but GOP will most likely hold the senate (thank goodness)  Also I am very impressed with the @FloridaGOP 's showing down-ballot.

1323831342191255552 2020-11-04 11:36:02 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @thehill Nah it's close. But trump seems to have the edge as of now

Only 4 counties became more Democratic, and by small amounts - Sarasota (0.59% more DEM), Osceola (3.74% more DEM), Orange (4.69% more DEM), and Seminole (5.92% more DEM).  The rest shifted Republican.  https://t.co/A5nJOItEXO

1317553602077118464 2020-10-18 03:50:32 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @umichvoter99 Then how do they calculate which party is leading in the early vote?

1317532098832535554 2020-10-18 02:25:05 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @nytimes It's not getting overturned. Quit the fearmongering.  In the past 47 years (when Roe became law), the Court has had a conservative majority for 46 of those years. At one point it had 8 conservative justices.
1317531536120549377 2020-10-18 02:22:51 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @bottoms4ossoff I'd say that checks out

1316600219317014528 2020-10-15 12:42:08 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @RealJimyCarter This is the poll I saw  https://t.co/i6comNR8Xs
1316599816391188481 2020-10-15 12:40:32 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @RealJimyCarter Yes that should be fine. I'd be available probably anytime after 8pm EST, but we can figure out logistics tomorrow.
1316599560182038528 2020-10-15 12:39:31 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @RealJimyCarter I know for sure he was the most popular senator according to Morning Consult
1316599306602917888 2020-10-15 12:38:30 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @RealJimyCarter I'd be happy to debate you.
1316599209169215490 2020-10-15 12:38:07 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @RealJimyCarter You could understand one's confusion if you say you live in one place but actually live in another, right?
1316599047218753536 2020-10-15 12:37:28 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @RealJimyCarter Haley was the most popular politician in America according to polls from 2018, with high approval from both parties, so I'm sure she's doing something right.
1316597993173327872 2020-10-15 12:33:17 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @RealJimyCarter Then why does your Twitter location say Edinburgh, Scotland? Wouldn't it make sense to put your actual country of residence then?
1316597557938868229 2020-10-15 12:31:33 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @ChaseMit LOL
1316597080987766784 2020-10-15 12:29:39 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @RealJimyCarter So do you live in the US or Scotland?
1316596972950827010 2020-10-15 12:29:14 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @RealJimyCarter But...you do live 12 hours away by plane? That's how long it takes to fly from Edinburgh to Miami.  And you are making assumptions again. I am not a "magatard," I am a conservative. I am supporting Nikki Haley in 2024 because I believe she is a qualified conservative candidate.
1316595406843899906 2020-10-15 12:23:00 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @RealJimyCarter Great, still waiting on that endorsement from the entire youth and Latino vote!
1316595224915914752 2020-10-15 12:22:17 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @RealJimyCarter I am not trying to justify anything, Mr. Carter. I am not a spokesman for the incumbent President. You are the one who mentioned the President first.
1316594928978362368 2020-10-15 12:21:06 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @RealJimyCarter I have yet to see a statement from the entire Latino population or youth population saying they endorse you. I also haven't seen anything from an official ET Democratic Party account.  Don't reach so far that you hurt your arm, Sen. Carter.
1316594424974118913 2020-10-15 12:19:06 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @RealJimyCarter Don't try and dismiss me as some Trumpie. I went back through my twitter feed and I could not find any mention of the President in the past 12 days.   The most recent thing I could find was a retweet saying that people who are wishing death upon the President are disgraceful.
1316593826342088704 2020-10-15 12:16:43 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @RealJimyCarter Bernard/"Jimy",  Best of luck! With The Onion on your side, you will be unstoppable! Bless your heart.  (@SouthernConsDem, I bet you know what "Bless your heart" means. Lol)

1312599143064494080 2020-10-04 11:43:17 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @sugar_moose_ of course! Anytime.
1312599089184493568 2020-10-04 11:43:04 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @BenAybar or if you say you support something for logical reasons that you're "heartless"  both parties are so guilty of this, and it makes me angry
1312598982577848320 2020-10-04 11:42:39 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @BenAybar Of course. I don't like the idea that you can only be one or the other. But unfortunately both political parties make it seem that way, like if you support a cause for emotional/moral reasons people will say you're "anti science", (1/2)
1312598297832558592 2020-10-04 11:39:55 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @BenAybar You can't say you're both the emotional/empathetic party and the analytical/logical party at the same time (this applies to both political parties lmao)

1312587427840757760 2020-10-04 10:56:44 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> Could Ileana Ros-Lehtinen win this District 29 I made? Composite is 59.29-40.71. 2016 Senate is 54.95-45.05. 58% Hispanic, 28% White, 11% Black.  https://t.co/72deicjmEC

I would not be opposed to making that sitcom happen. @FOXTV @FreeformTV @tvland @cbstv @ABCTV

1312582354960093184 2020-10-04 10:36:34 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @OrgEaglePatriot @Libnex2 nice
1312581340794163202 2020-10-04 10:32:32 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @OrgEaglePatriot @Libnex2 I probably should have linked it. LOL!  https://t.co/n5qhAW49n0
1312581282925367296 2020-10-04 10:32:19 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @OrgEaglePatriot @Libnex2 if you want to see something cool, take a look at this Florida redraw I did. It has some pretty ugly gerrymanders (see Orlando and south FL) but also some that are more subtle (more in the Tallahassee and Jacksonville area)
1312580546967543808 2020-10-04 10:29:23 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @OrgEaglePatriot @Libnex2 yeah ik what you mean. The 2022 districts are gonna look so weird to everyone on ET since we're all used to the 2010-20 districts
1312579391252201472 2020-10-04 10:24:48 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @OrgEaglePatriot @Libnex2 absolutely
1312578225416089600 2020-10-04 10:20:10 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @Libnex2 Some of these districts are so ugly, way too much gerrymandering, lol
1312576599691341830 2020-10-04 10:13:42 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @FernandoARuiz @HWLavelleMaps Ik what you mean, but I think the main takeaway is that GOP senators can definitely win over the undecideds. And Gideon is polling below 50%
1312064599248834563 2020-10-03 00:19:12 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @HWLavelleMaps This shows that Republicans who run ahead of the presidential nominee can definitely win on election night, even if polls show otherwise *cough* Maine *cough*
1311855938308014080 2020-10-02 10:30:03 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> To the media: attacking the First Lady doesn't help your case against Trump.
1311855781927583746 2020-10-02 10:29:26 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> This is the most important part of the #Melaniatapes, which I'm sure will be overlooked.

1311455735461687297 2020-10-01 07:59:47 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @bottoms4savage It‚Äôs probably someone who you knew that passed, whether it‚Äôs a friend, relative, maybe it‚Äôs a pet.
1311345576907284486 2020-10-01 00:42:03 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan @ianstevensc Ah ok. Yeah that was a good decision on her part for sure
1311345317800030208 2020-10-01 00:41:02 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan @ianstevensc Like I don‚Äôt think she would support any legislation that is racially motivated
1311345219179286530 2020-10-01 00:40:38 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan @ianstevensc Voter ID isn‚Äôt racist. I think Nikki Haley made her position on race relations known when she called for the removal of the confederate flag from courthouses or govt buildings (I can‚Äôt remember what exactly)

1311329506230239232 2020-09-30 23:38:12 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @bottoms4savage Read the Snopes article. Trump may be a lot of things but he's not a white supremacist

1310306355417436161 2020-09-28 03:52:34 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @ianstevensc We saw the same Dem talking points when Kavanaugh was being confirmed (‚Äúroe is getting taken away, lgbt rights are at stake‚Äù...) and yet LGBT rights have only expanded since Kavanaugh was put on the court and you can still kill an unborn baby in all 50 states.
1310305376332546049 2020-09-28 03:48:40 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @ohheckerman As a Palm Beach County resident, I love it
1310304040815865857 2020-09-28 03:43:22 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> Don‚Äôt buy into the fearmongering that LGBT rights or Roe are at risk because of ACB. They said that when Kavanaugh was being nominated, yet you can still kill a baby in all 50 states, and LGBT rights have EXPANDED since Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation.

1309620957200474112 2020-09-26 06:29:02 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem I tweeted screenshots of me defending Haley on multiple occasions like a week ago. It was in a reply to one of your comments accusing me of being a hater.
1309620536104935424 2020-09-26 06:27:22 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @breaking_et It's interesting, I really started looking at it during the 2016 elections
1309620303698554881 2020-09-26 06:26:26 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem If the conversation is about Nikki Haley, I'll defend her. If the tweet or the conversation is completely unrelated to Nikki Haley, there is no reason for me to defend her [as she is not being attacked].
1309619549688471558 2020-09-26 06:23:26 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem You are following nearly 3,000 people. If any of them do not worship the ground Nikki Haley walks on, or if any don't attack other Nikki Haley supporters online, then, by your logic, *you* are a Nikki Haley hater for even associating with them.
1309619144795529216 2020-09-26 06:21:50 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem No.
1309618877521854465 2020-09-26 06:20:46 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem Because I'm mature enough to respect dissenting viewpoints and can have civil conversations with others, even if we do not like the same candidates.
1309615523597033473 2020-09-26 06:07:26 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem Considering you're in the Netherlands and I'm in the US, there's a much greater chance of me voting for Haley than you.  And if she is the nominee in 2024, I most definitely plan to vote for her.
1309614627127463938 2020-09-26 06:03:53 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @NikkiHaleyfan @SouthernConsDem You've got to be kidding me. This again?
1309614463440629761 2020-09-26 06:03:14 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @jackmurphylive GOP needs to show strong support for school choice, it will help them win black voters. Nearly 20% of black women voted for DeSantis in 2018 because he supported school choice (DeSantis did better with black voters than Scott)

1309613213500219393 2020-09-26 05:58:16 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @BrockMeers Of course we do. The senate will be easy to win back, depending on Biden's approvals. A conservative majority on the court would take decades to flip, and it will be difficult to get moderate Dems on board with court packing.

Not to mention Maine still has a GOP senator and had a GOP governor as well.

1305268269985792001 2020-09-14 06:13:00 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @craig_schwerin @ianstevensc Best path for the GOP is to have Haley Republicans run in more conservative areas and Baker Republicans run in more Dem-leaning or liberal areas.
1305268027685040135 2020-09-14 06:12:03 +0800 <JackMFromBoca> @ianstevensc Yes! Nikki Haley 2024!
