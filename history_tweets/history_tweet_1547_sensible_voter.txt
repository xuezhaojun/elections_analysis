Latinos oppose #Prop16 for similar reasons as Asians since they share many common traits, especially their emphasis on family values and hard work. https://t.co/KZClVwrsMX
1320433039030194177 2020-10-26 02:32:23 +0800 <sensible_voter> Most Latinos in fact value hard work as any other race, which is why Latino students admitted to UC have quadrupled since 1999 and the number of degrees awarded to Latinos tripled.

1320427645754957824 2020-10-26 02:10:57 +0800 <sensible_voter> PPIC surveys show more people oppose #Prop16 than support it. Major media wonders why is “affirmative action” measure behind. Simple! #Prop16 is racial preference, NOT affirmative action, which is already implemented in California WITHOUT considering race. California voters rock.

1320268369367449600 2020-10-25 15:38:03 +0800 <sensible_voter> Existing state and city anti-discrimination law in government contracts are already in place. Current policies can already give preference to small, local, disadvantaged businesses. #Prop16 only favors businesses, who do not qualify as “disadvantaged” now? They don’t need help.
1320268368599863299 2020-10-25 15:38:03 +0800 <sensible_voter> #Prop16 only benefits the upper/middle class who do not need any help, since any disadvantaged people already get preferential treatment TODAY under colorblind policies.
1320268367832305664 2020-10-25 15:38:02 +0800 <sensible_voter> #Prop16 intends to divide people based on race when we are such an integral society with pretty large percentage of mixed race. #Prop16 divides people, rather lifts anyone up.
1320268367056416768 2020-10-25 15:38:02 +0800 <sensible_voter> #Prop16 doesn’t open opportunities for people of color, since it will create stigma against people of color. Even when people of color fully quality for a position, they will have to carry the stigma that they only get a position because of racial preference. #Prop16 demeans POC.
1320268366280454144 2020-10-25 15:38:02 +0800 <sensible_voter> #Prop16 does not level the playing field for women since the women already are outperforming men in many areas. #Prop16 will permit discrimination AGAINST women in fields that women outperform, such as teaching, nursing, lawyering, marketing.
1320268365206728704 2020-10-25 15:38:02 +0800 <sensible_voter> #Prop16 doesn’t fix wage discrimination since federal equal pay and much stronger California equal pay act already requires “equal pay for equal work”. #Prop16 will permit higher pay for some based on their race. #Prop16 permits wage discrimination in reality.

1309313715246780416 2020-09-25 10:08:10 +0800 <sensible_voter> Alison just found out she is not only Chinese and European as she learned from her parents. She is also 6.6% African. Now, with racial preference under #Prop16, she should qualify for preference in education, employment and contacting. @stevenmilleroc  https://t.co/g96jz4tM9a  https://t.co/kp1gvAzn1V
1309311113842970624 2020-09-25 09:57:50 +0800 <sensible_voter> This guy Jason just learned that he is 12.7%, in addition to 80.5% European. Plus 4.7% Native American. With racial preference by Prop 16, he and his children will get the same preferential treatment as Blacks or even Native Americans. @stevemilleroc  https://t.co/zPb67wbgOj
1304649293345693696 2020-09-12 13:13:25 +0800 <sensible_voter> @mzinshteyn Mister, it seems you either misread the article or mis-wrote your summary. The article says Ward opposes Prop 16 (racial discrimination/preference), AB3132 (reparation), AB979 (quota still Corp board), AB331 (ethnic studies in high school, which teaches hatred towards capitalism)
1304437622635286528 2020-09-11 23:12:19 +0800 <sensible_voter> Fortunately, someone saved these deleted videos on a site, where many other videos censored by YouTube or other sites now live. Watch this @johnstossel video to find out where they are hosted now.
1304436513149599745 2020-09-11 23:07:54 +0800 <sensible_voter> Thousands of educational videos were removed because the universities cannot afford to provide closed captions for these videos. Since the hard-of-hearing people cannot access them, these videos cannot be made available for ANYONE to provide EQUAL ACCESS.  https://t.co/Imn1zxmfEd
1302319492354072576 2020-09-06 02:55:37 +0800 <sensible_voter> @ZhangTaisu Some people have the freedom to condemn others. Some other people cannot even use any word in its normal context. The USC admin is to blame. They are nurturing such injustice on their campus. I won’t send my kids to USC since such admin without principles are not qualified.
1302317647946637312 2020-09-06 02:48:17 +0800 <sensible_voter> USC Professor got #CANCELLED after explaining Chinese word “the” /nei-ge/, which sounds like a forbidden racial slur, in the context of the language. Students reported the professor to admin.  https://t.co/cGh5MB9rfN
1302027479889059840 2020-09-05 07:35:16 +0800 <sensible_voter> @lhfang Is there any reason why brilliant black intellectuals are consistently shut off by the mainstream media? Perhaps you could help investigate this part of media bias? Some of these intellectuals acted with the same principles, but the mainstream has shifted.  https://t.co/khXiO5YTdl

1301470637542658048 2020-09-03 18:42:34 +0800 <sensible_voter> @TheseusGhostsec @lhfang California has been implementing colorblind affirmative action to give preference based on socioeconomic status. #Prop16 only benefits the rich in certain races who wish to get a leg up over the poor in other races. No wonder #Prop16 gets millions from the rich.
1301379262356701185 2020-09-03 12:39:29 +0800 <sensible_voter> The presentation will help bring important clarity on what #AffirmativeAction entails, and shed some light on baffling questions such as why staunch supporters of Affirmative Action may or may not support #Prop16.

1301378806180012034 2020-09-03 12:37:40 +0800 <sensible_voter> Some people say Proposition 16 will “restore” Affirmative Action, while others disagree as California already implements colorblind, socioeconomic status-based Affirmative Action successfully to help the disadvantaged and to improve diversity.

1301376023120863233 2020-09-03 12:26:36 +0800 <sensible_voter> @techleadhd Reparation? California legislators pushed to remove the ban on discrimination based on race during the height of the pandemic when California went into deep debt. Guess what's their ultimate goal? To provide reparation to give payout to certain races.    https://t.co/lAgjvPB0cU
1301264275936215040 2020-09-03 05:02:34 +0800 <sensible_voter> More public dollars going to lawsuits due to Prop. 16 meaning less dollars for education or teachers. @WeAreCTA
1301263160435863552 2020-09-03 04:58:08 +0800 <sensible_voter> @rodrigo_peligro @lhfang Guess who pays for all these costly lawsuits due to Prop. 16? The public.  First, we use public fund to favor certain races. Then, we use public fund to defend such policies to favor these races when victims of these policies sue.  Still cool with it? @HooverInst @ManhattanInst
1301262025079676928 2020-09-03 04:53:37 +0800 <sensible_voter> @rodrigo_peligro @lhfang There are only case laws resulting from costly lawsuits.  What Prop. 16 will bring:  1. Any public agency at every level could adopt policies to use race to determine who gets favored using public dollars. 2. Those not favored will sue the agency all the way to Supreme Court.
