1340881771211051008 2020-12-21 12:48:21 +0800 <msjames61> @BenJackd1 Good to know that all conservatives will be sending their stimulus money back!
1338946075554549761 2020-12-16 04:36:35 +0800 <msjames61> @Stmichealsword @MarkParalovos Ugh!  Please!  The only information passed in bars and churches is bullshit...
1338882173105893379 2020-12-16 00:22:39 +0800 <msjames61> @SenTedCruz Poor Ted!  You had plenty of people stacking the deck every other which way they possibly could.   Time to take your ball and go home.
1337170996902514696 2020-12-11 07:03:03 +0800 <msjames61> @karinkirk_mt @ChadVOlson @AGTimFox Tried to call today.  Cowards will not answer the phone.  Email it is.
1336889552774971393 2020-12-10 12:24:42 +0800 <msjames61> @AGTimFox Shame, shame to involve yourself in this lawsuit.  Horrible precedent to set, making this election seem illegal.  Like the rest of Montana State, and these other Republican states, you seem to have no backbone against a would be dictator. Easier to punch a reporter in the mouth.
1336775256820727809 2020-12-10 04:50:31 +0800 <msjames61> It‚Äôs obvious,  @GregForMontana, that Montanans will not protect their fellow citizens. We need a Mask Mandate!
1335628087275388928 2020-12-07 00:52:05 +0800 <msjames61> @rjcrock2003 Goldens are the best...so very sorry for your loss....it‚Äôs been 4 years for us.
1332040485976719362 2020-11-27 03:16:14 +0800 <msjames61> @Angry_Staffer Thank you so much for accompanying us on this nightmare!  You were the calm voice in the storm!

1329114286875049984 2020-11-19 01:28:34 +0800 <msjames61> @JasonOverstreet @ewarren Best news I‚Äôve heard all day!
1328806458641641472 2020-11-18 05:05:22 +0800 <msjames61> @Perduesenate @KLoeffler Quit using scare tactics, and try running on your pitiful record.
1328576538363768832 2020-11-17 13:51:45 +0800 <msjames61> @EricGreitens @RealAmVoice @bennyjohnson @PlutoTV It‚Äôs amazing you can show your face in public, and expect people to take you seriously.  Nothing but a hypocrite, that should have went to jail.

1326006033022513153 2020-11-10 11:37:28 +0800 <msjames61> @BOOKofJ0SHUA @CindyLouHoo65 Apples and Oranges.  How does a person you don‚Äôt even know, making a personal decision, affect your life? People refusing to wear masks are potentially spreading disease that affects their life. Your right to not wear a mask does not supersede my right to not  be infected.

1325240466888040448 2020-11-08 08:55:23 +0800 <msjames61> @AngrierWHStaff Love it!

1323868630019289089 2020-11-04 14:04:12 +0800 <msjames61> @MattMurph24 Absolutely! I dread being governed by this trash!

1323813222722367488 2020-11-04 10:24:02 +0800 <msjames61> @thor_benson @CheriJacobus I doubt mine in Montana will help Joe either.
1323780906083995648 2020-11-04 08:15:37 +0800 <msjames61> @BetsyBG @AngrierWHStaff Exactly!
1323780844968906753 2020-11-04 08:15:22 +0800 <msjames61> @AngrierWHStaff I agree!
1323434503503667202 2020-11-03 09:19:08 +0800 <msjames61> @MandaDawnK @SpiroAgnewGhost I had to get off Facebook, and increase anxiety meds.  Maybe I can decrease them when this nightmare is over. It‚Äôs been a bad 4 years.

1320901629349167105 2020-10-27 09:34:24 +0800 <msjames61> @NatePickowicz So using the Supreme Court as a way to get what YOU want is okay.  Disgusting.

1319329878441742336 2020-10-23 01:28:49 +0800 <msjames61> @CNN Maybe the airlines should have been pressuring the White House to take the coronavirus seriously, and not ruin their business.  Instead, waiting for more handouts.
1317510964866994177 2020-10-18 01:01:06 +0800 <msjames61> @HSRetoucher @realDonaldTrump JFK Jr as a Vice Presidential candidate to Trump is as delusional as it gets.  His beliefs were the opposite of Trump‚Äôs.  He would not be up on the stage with trash.
1316942433117233152 2020-10-16 11:21:58 +0800 <msjames61> Thanks to Flathead County Health for making it even more possible for people to get #COVID19.  My son,  who is an essential worker,  has had numerous cases at his work.  There are  people there that will not mask, and believe it‚Äôs nothing.  Thanks for your useless leadership!
