1343932215940567041 2020-12-29 22:49:43 +0800 <suelynch02> Yet another failure from Boris and his government.

1340687217505779713 2020-12-20 23:55:16 +0800 <suelynch02> What exactly is Bale doing? Just jogging around, no interest in challenging for the ball. If I was a Spurs fan I would be seriously ticked off.
1340682098789773314 2020-12-20 23:34:55 +0800 <suelynch02> Belgium and Holland have now banned flights and trains from the UK. Germany, Italy and France seem likely to follow suit.  Johnson's complete mismanagement of the situation is why we are at this point. I wonder how, or if people who have already booked travel will be compensated.

1339314282534752256 2020-12-17 04:59:42 +0800 <suelynch02> So it isn't just Johnson's strategy, Trump's minions were using herd immunity as well.

1339285568895774720 2020-12-17 03:05:37 +0800 <suelynch02> The way Arteta is prowling round his technical area, I would have loved to be a fly on the wall in the Arsenal dressing room at half time.

1339278808755691521 2020-12-17 02:38:45 +0800 <suelynch02> @BevEvan78566632 The way he just ignored the question though, had me wanting to throw a brick through my tv screen.
1339278118775873539 2020-12-17 02:36:00 +0800 <suelynch02> @LFCBen66 @LFCcarnage Your numbers don't lie pal. Someone follows you,  follow them back and you wouldn't have a problem.
1339276649288896518 2020-12-17 02:30:10 +0800 <suelynch02> @Kerrycaitjayx @castawayinlondo I've lived in Liverpool my entire life and I have never heard that before. You learn something new every day.
1339274886309613573 2020-12-17 02:23:10 +0800 <suelynch02> The odds on Arteta getting the sack will shorten considerably if the scoreline stays the same.
1339234994275889152 2020-12-16 23:44:39 +0800 <suelynch02> New York didn't want him, now Mar-A-Lago residents are telling him to take a hike.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

1339205048413380609 2020-12-16 21:45:39 +0800 <suelynch02> @JustRodge It's no wonder so many businesses are closing down. Absolute complete and utter shambles.
1339204581864198146 2020-12-16 21:43:48 +0800 <suelynch02> @ladyjacq66 @BorisJohnson I am sitting watching, screaming at the screen "Answer the f*cking question moron"
1339203365503442946 2020-12-16 21:38:58 +0800 <suelynch02> @__FalseNine You've done the right thing. It does get tough on here sometimes, but blocking them seems to be the way to go. Hope you are OK, take care of yourself.
1339202398766632961 2020-12-16 21:35:07 +0800 <suelynch02> @__FalseNine Some people have nothing better to do with their time. I just try to ignore them, not always easy I know.
1339202113512099841 2020-12-16 21:33:59 +0800 <suelynch02> Johnson's statement about celebrating at Christmas perfectly sums up just how inadequate he has been as a PM.  Never taking decisive action nor any responsibility for when things inevitably go wrong.
1339201226785873920 2020-12-16 21:30:28 +0800 <suelynch02> @xLeeJones They haven't gone for Allardyce, have they? Seriously, WTF!
1339201015556476929 2020-12-16 21:29:37 +0800 <suelynch02> Boris Johnson is a moron. Just thought I'd get that off my chest.🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
1339200570926751757 2020-12-16 21:27:51 +0800 <suelynch02> Slaven Bilic has been sacked; this is what you get when people with a ton of money and no footballing knowledge take over your club. Ridiculous decision.
1339200068503662593 2020-12-16 21:25:52 +0800 <suelynch02> @TinyEgyptian I don't think "liking" comes into it; do I wear a mask because it's the right thing to do? You bet your life I do.

1338567144666181632 2020-12-15 03:30:51 +0800 <suelynch02> Apparently Sami Khedira has "had contact with" Ancelotti; some may think this is a prelude to him signing in January. Personally, I think he just sent him a Christmas card.

1338510909606653952 2020-12-14 23:47:23 +0800 <suelynch02> If I had had a very disrepectful op-ed written about me, my response would have been a very sweary rant about misogny. Dr Jill Biden, on the other hand, replies with grace, eloquence and intelligence.
1338505550192136197 2020-12-14 23:26:06 +0800 <suelynch02> So London now going into tier 3 after infections have risen dramatically; a bit like closing the barndoor after the horse has bolted.  How many people have to become ill and die, before this situation is put under control? Utter f*cking shambles.

1338484397499158531 2020-12-14 22:02:02 +0800 <suelynch02> Just heard Gerard Houllier has passed away. There are many differing opinions on his time at L.F.C. but he did bring us some success. R.I.P. Gerard, YNWA.

1338116355191676928 2020-12-13 21:39:34 +0800 <suelynch02> @ridcorruption I think a lot of people that don't respond are unsure of what to say to help you in your particular situation. It's not lack of care, it's lack of knowledge on how best to give you encouragement and/or sympathy.
1338114871083347969 2020-12-13 21:33:40 +0800 <suelynch02> @HuffmanForNC Happy birthday Wyleigh.  https://t.co/nir5pn9Rsg

1337872541881405447 2020-12-13 05:30:45 +0800 <suelynch02> Just when you think this pair couldn't possibly be more loathsome; they hit a new low.
1337872043140902918 2020-12-13 05:28:46 +0800 <suelynch02> @TCripes He'll probably blame it on covid though, since he was sick in November.
1337871449072291841 2020-12-13 05:26:24 +0800 <suelynch02> That's how quickly V.A.R. should used. None of the fannying about of the L.F.C. game the other night.

1336796909638479876 2020-12-10 06:16:34 +0800 <suelynch02> Timing of this is tad suspicious, or am I being a bit paranoid?
1336795693512581120 2020-12-10 06:11:44 +0800 <suelynch02> Has it only been a year since Johnson won the election? It feels like a decade.😱😱😱

1335317272869691395 2020-12-06 04:17:01 +0800 <suelynch02> The way Bielsa perches on tip toes looks so uncomfortable; I think I would end up with a dead leg if I tried that for any length of time.
1335287731585511424 2020-12-06 02:19:38 +0800 <suelynch02> @dougiebrimson Isn't it obvious? For their blatant racism, which should have no place in a football ground or in society at large.
1335275430409023488 2020-12-06 01:30:45 +0800 <suelynch02> All the "fans" booing at Millwall should be easy to point out given how the tickets were distributed. That being the case, it should be easy to ban them from ever attending again; whether that will be done, is another matter entirely.

I better get my skates on, a trip to Debenhams at Liverpool 1 is on the cards for me. It is really sad though, I always loved shopping there.

1333439134862626816 2020-11-30 23:53:58 +0800 <suelynch02> So it turns out that Luis Suarez' international team mate Cavani is a racist too. Who'd have thunk? What a surprise; wonder if he will get the same punishment for using the same racist term? We'll have to wait and see.

1331311748213780486 2020-11-25 03:00:30 +0800 <suelynch02> So, in the U.K., 3 households can become a "Christmas bubble" from 23.12.20 to 27.12.20. Will anyone actually stick to this? How will it be policed? I think that it's a recipe for disaster, but time will tell.

1330869086348316676 2020-11-23 21:41:31 +0800 <suelynch02> They are willing to show their contempt for the President in private, but heaven forbid they should go public. Sickening.
1330867779013124104 2020-11-23 21:36:19 +0800 <suelynch02> Swale in Kent is now the number 1 hotspot for Covid 19 in England, with an infection rate of 631.7 cases per 100,000. I wonder how many tweets on the irresponsibility of residents in the area there will be? As many as there were about Liverpool? I don't think so, somehow.

1326570771964178433 2020-11-12 01:01:33 +0800 <suelynch02> Trump sinks to a new low. On the day when most are remembering the fallen, he accuses the military of voter fraud.
1326563629303537664 2020-11-12 00:33:10 +0800 <suelynch02> This just shows how utterly ludicrous it is to be playing international friendlies at the moment.

1325588655289872389 2020-11-09 07:58:58 +0800 <suelynch02> So since the big orange one will soon consigned to the dustbin of history, I needed a nickname for our own less than beloved leader. And now, thanks to former Obama press aide Tommy Vietor, I've got one #shapeshiftingcreep. I have to say, it really does suite him.
1325586268894466048 2020-11-09 07:49:29 +0800 <suelynch02> @BBC re: the Oscar Pistorius programme. What in God's name were you thinking? Trying to justify the unjustifiable. Shame on you.

1325583843781435392 2020-11-09 07:39:51 +0800 <suelynch02> Joe Gomez has made a very pertinent comment about VAR, the ref should watch replays in real time and not in slow motion. I made the same observation when VAR first came in.  The game isn't played in slow motion, so why should decisions be made after viewing slow-mo?
1325507841323634688 2020-11-09 02:37:50 +0800 <suelynch02> I think this is worth a punt.

1325118459416612867 2020-11-08 00:50:34 +0800 <suelynch02> According to a study by Professor Pat Thane into childhood deprivation, there is a definite connection to the devastation raught by the blitz in World War 2. Cities that were the worst hit are still suffering the consequences some 80 years later.  That is horrifying.

1324826292085280769 2020-11-07 05:29:36 +0800 <suelynch02> @chldishfabinho France vs West Germany Wold Cup 1982. The German goalie Schumacher nearly crippled Battiston; knocking him unconscious with an horrific high "tackle" that nearly took his head off.  And to add insult to injury, the ref didn't blow the whistle for a foul, never mind a card.

1324483808306089987 2020-11-06 06:48:42 +0800 <suelynch02> @jed_dyson Congratulations, that's great news.
1324452667972898826 2020-11-06 04:44:57 +0800 <suelynch02> I cannot abide Katie Price, but for a grown man to wear blackface in a skit about her disabled son must be heartbraking. Absolutely disgraceful behaviour.

1324412986111500290 2020-11-06 02:07:16 +0800 <suelynch02> @CJTowers2 I think that's a given; not just for football either, every major sport will follow suit.
1324412443314003968 2020-11-06 02:05:07 +0800 <suelynch02> I concur.

1324411503164968960 2020-11-06 02:01:23 +0800 <suelynch02> @Benjaminknorr79 I think that they think it will cheer people up, to have something to look forward. I can't stand it myself; I'm definitely in the "leave Christmas in December" camp.
1324410697300795394 2020-11-06 01:58:11 +0800 <suelynch02> According the BBC website Joe Biden is at 253 to Trump's 214. Just 17 more to go 🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞
1324408648588791809 2020-11-06 01:50:02 +0800 <suelynch02> @CJTowers2 That was my thought as well, but the money grubbing tv companies will probably think differently. We'll have to wait and see. Maybe they'll think again in terms of their own PR?
1324406626988810241 2020-11-06 01:42:00 +0800 <suelynch02> @JoeBiden I hope you are right, can't wait to call you Mr President.
1324406346419154944 2020-11-06 01:40:53 +0800 <suelynch02> The pay per view "experiment" for football looks to be scrapped after the international break; would anyone consider paying to watch games if they reduced the price? How about £5.00 per game? Or should they all be on tv for free. Discounting monthly subscriptions.🤷🤷🤷
1324398799142428675 2020-11-06 01:10:54 +0800 <suelynch02> @iamtomskinner Congratulations.

1324145153033097216 2020-11-05 08:23:00 +0800 <suelynch02> @Swallowyerpride @QuancyClayborne I was about to say the same thing about fires; it's a really   major fire hazard.
1324144685133238279 2020-11-05 08:21:09 +0800 <suelynch02> @PrissyBritchez I think it should be an extension of this campaign. Just keep the momentum going.

1324129116338163716 2020-11-05 07:19:17 +0800 <suelynch02> According to the BBC, despite there being the highest turnout of voters in 100 years, approximately 30 % of the population still didn't vote. That is bizarre; the only reason I can think of is that these people  are either in prison or have been disbarred for some reason.
1324127140925886464 2020-11-05 07:11:26 +0800 <suelynch02> @asgoulson I think it's going to be a long and difficult road to travel. There aren't any easy answers, unfortunately.

1323973859159298050 2020-11-04 21:02:20 +0800 <suelynch02> 2/2 His catastrophic response to the pandemic has caused nearly 1/4 of a million deaths, and people are STILL voting for him. That basket of deplorables must be absolutely f*cking HUGE.
1323973468774387713 2020-11-04 21:00:47 +0800 <suelynch02> 1/2 WTF is going on America?  How is it possible for Trump to have so many votes?  He is a racist misogynistic thug, who mocked the disabled, tear gassed protesters just to get a photo op outside an empty church with a bible.

1322929772348002304 2020-11-01 23:53:31 +0800 <suelynch02> @HollywoodnorthJ It is precisely because he has died  and people are fawning over him that this tweet is very well timed.
1322928891988770825 2020-11-01 23:50:01 +0800 <suelynch02> Connery was a misogynistic thug, and yet everyone is reacting to his death like he was some sort of national treasure. Makes me want to vomit.

1322641189812711425 2020-11-01 04:46:47 +0800 <suelynch02> So the UK has now had more than 1 million Covid 19 cases, and still Johnson and his government haven't got a handle on it. They seem to be stumbling blindly from crisis to the next. It's a complete shambles.

1320407889178169347 2020-10-26 00:52:27 +0800 <suelynch02> @asgoulson Some people have been commenting that they can't be nuns because they are wearing wedding rings. This is incorrect some nuns do wear rings and some don't. Still looks suspicious as hell, though.

Adding to them just doesn't make sense.They might be thinking of altering the leagues right across Europe so there are fewer games, which in it's self makes even less sense.

1310267565139210242 2020-09-28 01:18:25 +0800 <suelynch02> Is this the 1st time any Guardiola team has had 5 goals against them, home or away? I can't remember it happening before.

1310265902034759681 2020-09-28 01:11:49 +0800 <suelynch02> He probably go on and score now.

He might be investigated for "fraud" for cheating on his Italian test and Barcelona don't want him going to another Spanish team, so the proposed move to Atletico Madrid might not happen either.

1305258405972582413 2020-09-14 05:33:49 +0800 <suelynch02> @cocoabean717 Sending you very best wishes for a speedy recovery.

1304919558894096384 2020-09-13 07:07:21 +0800 <suelynch02> @finnchick3 Sadly I think you're right. As bad as our cases get here, we'd still have a way to go to reach your numbers.
1304850047369183232 2020-09-13 02:31:08 +0800 <suelynch02> @paul_steele Congratulations.
1304849853487480832 2020-09-13 02:30:22 +0800 <suelynch02> @decayingcactus I was thinking the same thing.  The winning because we score more goals way of playing does my nerves no good at all. I'd be a wreck by the end of the season.
1304849095018807297 2020-09-13 02:27:21 +0800 <suelynch02> So before the game,  I tweeted 1-0 clean sheet, no dramas and no injures would do me. Errrm, that went to plan then; didn't it?
1304822194321711106 2020-09-13 00:40:28 +0800 <suelynch02> @CarrieRDean @hwinkler4real I am so very sorry for your loss. May his memory be a blessing to you.
1304821822752464898 2020-09-13 00:38:59 +0800 <suelynch02> For the 4th season in a row in the opening game Mo Salah scores.
1304812716402540544 2020-09-13 00:02:48 +0800 <suelynch02> @_keepachris_ 1-0 a clean sheet,  a decent performance and no drama or injuries would be enough for me.
1304799388036980736 2020-09-12 23:09:50 +0800 <suelynch02> Brits warned against party weekend as UK 'on edge of losing control' of Covid-19. Things could be as bad as they were in March or even worse! Johnson and the tories have made such a cock-up of the situation. Sometimes I despair, I really do.  https://t.co/wZyzG6oQ74

1304506910964617218 2020-09-12 03:47:38 +0800 <suelynch02> @leftcoastbabe That's it exactly; God forgive me, but if the virus just killed them I wouldn't care. But it doesn't, it's so frustrating to think of the sheer numbers of others they go onto infect.
1304504182569926660 2020-09-12 03:36:48 +0800 <suelynch02> @finnchick3 Not so you'd notice, no.😉😉😉
1304502970504052738 2020-09-12 03:31:59 +0800 <suelynch02> @zakwilliams May his memory continue to be a blessing to you.
1304502751334932481 2020-09-12 03:31:07 +0800 <suelynch02> On the continuing theme of how weird 2020 is; I find myself retweeting from Alistair Campbell's account.  Not something I've ever considered doing before. There's always a first time.
1304500886673162248 2020-09-12 03:23:42 +0800 <suelynch02> @jpierni @marylferris1 Let the politians take it first; if they aren't dead by Christmas, I'll think about it.
1304494019901378560 2020-09-12 02:56:25 +0800 <suelynch02> If this is true, Trump reached a new low. Even for him, this is outrageous.
1304493577985290245 2020-09-12 02:54:39 +0800 <suelynch02> @johnpavlovitz @SimmonsGmarlins John, it beggars belief; doesn't it?
1304491076590481408 2020-09-12 02:44:43 +0800 <suelynch02> All news outlets and social media platforms should do this as a matter of course. They should, but they won't.
1304490482047897603 2020-09-12 02:42:21 +0800 <suelynch02> @finnchick3 It's that long since I've seen a photo of him, I don't know.
1304449065577570304 2020-09-11 23:57:47 +0800 <suelynch02> Why in God's name should U.S. Army Generals give a flying f*ck about trade deals?
1304446529038675969 2020-09-11 23:47:42 +0800 <suelynch02> So according to that fount of all knowledge Chris Waddle, Manchester United will be the new seasons champions.🤦🤦🤦

1304163187336585218 2020-09-11 05:01:48 +0800 <suelynch02> @LFC_Champ19ns I don't remember a time when I wasn't a fan; first big game I remember was the 1971 F.A. Cup final. I was 4.
1304161524173414402 2020-09-11 04:55:12 +0800 <suelynch02> @andycorneys Look after yourself Andy. I'm sure you'll be back fighting fit, sooner rather than later.
