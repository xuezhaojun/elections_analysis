1343724740050116608 2020-12-29 09:05:17 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @AskMeAboutQ @trucker_mfc @JennaEllisEsq Yes this is the kind of crazy that Trump endorses and encourages. He loves killing innocent people without actually pulling the trigger. Trumps fragile ego doesn't care how many people die as long as his cult followers continue to idolize him.
1343722844845469701 2020-12-29 08:57:46 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @JennaEllisEsq Yeah.. I mean why would he do the right thing now? He has put this country through absolute hell from day 1 in office. It doesn't make any sense for him to suddenly behave honest &amp; responsible  at this point of the charade does it?
1343355248816095233 2020-12-28 08:37:04 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @SenatorLoeffler So can I, Christ strengthens me to help Warnoff win!

1343332051454455808 2020-12-28 07:04:53 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @marlonw @darylsturgis Exactly!
1343331549685678082 2020-12-28 07:02:53 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @darylsturgis No. I live in Florida I am surrounded by people that voted for him both times. I have noticed these people lack compassion &amp; are generally selfish racist hateful people deep down. Not making excuses for anyone that voted for this monster. They know what he is like.
1343323490821222405 2020-12-28 06:30:52 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @HelaoSouse Not sure but I have known two people that said they didn't want to live beyond a certain age &amp; both died right before. I believe we decide this sometimes. My mom was one. She had a life insurance policy that expired. I would hock everything I own to have her here with me now. :(
1343309418830684165 2020-12-28 05:34:57 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> He can' t leave soon enough. Wish him all the karma he so richly deserves and a uncomfortable orange suit in his padded cell for the rest of his life.
1343190655300939778 2020-12-27 21:43:02 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @MissLynneNYC üíîGosh, I am so sorry. This is truly heartbreaking.
1343019921995927552 2020-12-27 10:24:36 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @KaraCalavera forgot to add mom had several cats as well. Before the night ended one of those cats was sleeping in the same bed with this dog. I think I walked that dog for about 2 hours before the intro, I was super hyper cautious &amp; aware that this could be dangerous for the other animals.
1343018737906147329 2020-12-27 10:19:53 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @KaraCalavera If it is possible take the dog out for a long brisk walk. I did this when my mom rescued a giant aggressive dog before we brought her home to the other rescues.  That first encounter was an amazing/good start all the high frustrated energy had been exhausted + we were calm too.
1342882441858600965 2020-12-27 01:18:18 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @Denis_Buchholz Besides being an icky total pos toward his icky lover.. I notice he too is trying to kiss up more to the military in hopes they will back his daddy in a coup. They all make me sick to my stomach.

They were not like this as street cops, they both were in situations where they reported someone that was. Dangerous, left them vulnerable. Which is part of the problem.

Suggest they do self love meditations, lack of confidence/self worth is why they are too scared to leave. We all get gut feelings about people but don't realize our value. Being desperate for luv in 1st place can kill ya.
1341894023955554304 2020-12-24 07:50:41 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @KFILE Sending love too.  Imaging her thriving, healed and happy. &lt;3

1341634492495257605 2020-12-23 14:39:24 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @UprightSiddy Yes. I have seen people transform before my eyes, It is why I do not like to drink. Not saying that some people wouldn't commit crimes anyway. But I think it can make a decent person insane with rage etc. One friend is so sweet but if she drinks - cold blooded evil! It is so sad.

1341065326084153346 2020-12-22 00:57:44 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @DWUhlfelderLaw This was so traumatic to watch. I am so hopeful she wins BIG TIME and that DeSantis pays dearly for this. He is a thug mafia dictator worshiper and wanna be.  Another one with blood on his hands. And like Trumpy he is a vindictive miserable pos.

Also, try to write or think of 3 things or more that you are grateful for. Hugs! All this despair is temporary.

If Michelle or anyone in Obama's or Biden's family dressed &amp; acted like this freak the  GOP cult would be screaming blasphemy with pitchforks in hand.  https://t.co/EojQGRnZnP

I am üíØcertain Gore would have had dealt w/Global warming, health care, education, Jobs, the economy. Why is the GOP so hell bent on destroying this planet &amp; all life. It is literally a war against good &amp; Evil. It is surreal.

People that say shit about vegans are defensive or in deep denial &amp; it takes some longer than others to get the connection. I am patient but have my limits. Adds another nail to my baseball bat.

RARE for sure, but compassionate, intelligent, &amp; decent. AND best of all they have always been progressive liberals &amp; despise the GOP. LOL, If I was single I wouldn't settle either.

I listen to science not entitled selfish Trumpy supporters." Btw, more than 3,500 deaths from covid in the USA was reported Wednesday and there were more than 240,000 newly reported coronavirus cases.

I do care that refuse to do one simple unselfish act - wear a mask to protect others from this airborne virus that is killing over 300 thousand in our country alone and that is unforgivable.

You feel mask don't work/this virus is a hoax? Fine. NP! But endanger the lives of others then I have every right to call you a f'ing asshole.

NOTHING you can say will condone the reason for your actions. I listen to science not entitled selfish Trumpy supporters. If you get Covid please feel free to deny medical care too.

If at this point they don't get it maybe they need to have someone scream and threaten to fire them for threatening the lives and livelihood of everyone around them.
1339069210073370625 2020-12-16 12:45:53 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @SoNeat11 @TOTater @briantylercohen Totally agree.. they had their chance to do the right thing and they allowed a petty dictator wanna-be to put our country in jeopardy in every way. He cost 100's of thousands of lives. DONE with all of them. Enough already.

I don't always condone aggressive tatics but at this point and time if they don't get it then apparently they need someone to scream at them. Covid is so contagious and deadly and they are putting people's lives in danger. Enough!

1339067008135147521 2020-12-16 12:37:08 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @RexChapman Actually admire him. Why is this so hard to understand,  he gives a f*&amp;K about the people struggling to feed their families, losing their homes, etc., everyone in every industry would be so much better off if they would take this more seriously, I am angry too.
1339064246286553090 2020-12-16 12:26:09 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @DollyParton LOL this was amazing. But no one compares to you! You are beautiful inside and out, and your voice.. omgah! &lt;3

I want starving babies to be fed and housed and loved. I want rehab not death and I want education and health care. I wish you spoke out for the living as much as you do for the unborn.

From BLM to Covid he has failed in the most criminal epic way. You could offer support on her advice to Christians and do what Jesus would do? Or maybe you support voilence &amp; Trump too much to go there?

You call people names because you have zero to say. You blame others for your bad choices. You gonna have to deal with a lot of mental help later if you don't learn to think.

You have to take responsibility for jumping in head first into a shallow pool. If we don't get this it is like we have learned nothing in our life. Doesn't mean she deserved this. No one does ever. Pls take care.

It is a serious decision and so easy to say later who knew? When to most it was predictable.
1337976927127293958 2020-12-13 12:25:32 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @smithxweasley @mess_yy @kandi_badd @FKAtwigs I agree, not trying to blame. No one deserves this abuse, but we all have to really own &amp; know our value &amp; power, ignoring signs, rushing into relationships, the price is too high. She is lucky to be alive.

But trust in yourself &amp; own your power so you recognize people like this &amp; question why you would ever go for someone unstable that can't value themselves much less than you.
1337886852846587907 2020-12-13 06:27:37 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @mess_yy @kandi_badd @FKAtwigs I don't know either. But there is a good possibility. Value in yourself helps you see the unstable side of people and proceed with caution or not at all. Healing that before you get involved is self love.

My sister in law was married &amp; abused 3 times to 3 men. Victims can become habitual victims. No one wants to see anyone we care about or love go thru hell repeatedly or die like this.

1313619403746037760 2020-10-07 07:17:26 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump We may never know but that one woman was struggling to talk, out of breath &amp; sounds like her throat hurt. Scary she didn't wear a mask/blathering like a nut case in a cult. This is how it is done by the best covid spreaders/aka fools.

1313362247742349312 2020-10-06 14:15:35 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @shimesimmons Agreed he is very dangerous and compromised, always has been but this is like literally insanity on steriods now.

The one time it would actually be beneficial for him to hide he contamidates everyone around him with COVID. Seriously? Get some help. I mean NOW!

He is reckless and selfish. And btw...didn't you get the memo? Trump has no use for Latinos or people of color. Maybe get your own self together?

1312718492311969792 2020-10-04 19:37:32 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @OttoTopci @gnuseibeh @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden I will never understand how his supporters could condone this or kids in cages, his refusal to denounce kkk/proud boys.. the list goes on. Atm I don't give anyone I know that supports Trump any respect and I make sure they know why.
1312578210987741186 2020-10-04 10:20:06 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @irishrygirl I love how straight up and sincere he is. It is refreshing yes!

1312417410318729217 2020-10-03 23:41:08 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @dcpetterson LOL this was great. Makes me dance with glee. I don't want him to die. Maybe be crippled for life. Lose a kidney.  Whatever it takes for his supporters to get a clue &amp; have him removed, maybe being in  coma on ventilators for months would do it.

What about kids in cages, and "it is what it is" his response to people dying of covid, calling it a hoax then admitted he knew all along how dangerous it was? Masks etc. I could go on. You are what is wrong with USA. Empathy for the monster in chief, you got it!
1311897047138816001 2020-10-02 13:13:24 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @hill_charlotte @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Omg this was my first thought as well. He is going to magical disappear.

But if someone else suggests it right back to him then it is immoral hate from a lunatic? You and Trumpy need to look in the damn mirror!
1311894135880798208 2020-10-02 13:01:50 +0800 <ButterflyJenyne> @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Playing the worlds tiniest violin for you, while asking if you are going to have the Klorox injected enema, or drink it straight up? No one should suffer or die a terrible death from this horrible virus, not even someone as evil as you.
