1307415598972850176 2020-09-20 04:25:44 +0800 <LavAgarwal95> @Vintage_Utd I cannot understand how players can join only 4 days before the game!! There is a structural change needed within the club signings won't fix s*it!!
1307384592005955584 2020-09-20 02:22:31 +0800 <LavAgarwal95> @Vintage_Utd Time to find the tw*ts that said Lindelof is a beast

1307256377660768256 2020-09-19 17:53:02 +0800 <LavAgarwal95> @steve_forro @MarcusAl08 @UnitedStandMUFC I agree to this completely! You are playing with the emotions of fans
1307250989678735360 2020-09-19 17:31:38 +0800 <LavAgarwal95> @MarcusAl08 @UnitedStandMUFC Correct but you cannot buy world class players in every position sometimes you buy a good player that suits the system and make him better. Eg-Martial (not bought by OGS but you get the point.
1307225617130086401 2020-09-19 15:50:48 +0800 <LavAgarwal95> @MarcusAl08 @UnitedStandMUFC There has to be alternatives which might work as well as Sancho look at Leipzig the squad they have assembled how many 30+ million players have they bought?? NONE!! That's how you run a club. So I agree stop with this  it's okay  as long as there's a viable alternative.
