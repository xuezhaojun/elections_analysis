1342053752824504322 2020-12-24 18:25:23 +0800 <cometaj2> @cliftonaduncan @VG_donkeykong The conversation isn’t about diversity, it’s about a specific form of thinking that overwhelmingly promotes minority groups at everybody else’s expense.  Again, this breaks its teeth on the ultimate minority, the minority of one; the sovereign individual.
1342051697200254976 2020-12-24 18:17:13 +0800 <cometaj2> @cliftonaduncan @VG_donkeykong It also appears to be because the current dialogue about diversity isn’t about diversity at all but rather about the power struggle of extreme minorities under postmodern thinking.  The semantics on diversity are being smudged to make the extremely minor be the most prominent.
1342050236802322433 2020-12-24 18:11:25 +0800 <cometaj2> @cliftonaduncan Yup, this is because the sovereign individual matters more than group indentitarianism.  The character of a sovereign individual always matters more to substance than some arbitrary group identity.  Racism breaks its teeth against individual sovereignty.

1340105528245059584 2020-12-19 09:23:50 +0800 <cometaj2> @FrancisRoyCA @realchrisrufo It is in the poorman’s proxy semantics smudging when one intends to talk about some arbitrary group identity.  It’s a way of tangling a taboo overlay (guilt) into group identities for the purpose of applying pressure to gain power.  It’s pure Postmodernism.

1339699514790166529 2020-12-18 06:30:29 +0800 <cometaj2> @PsyopPatriot Enacted religious rituals are specifically helpful in keeping away or redirecting crushing psychological weigh.
1339698513043582976 2020-12-18 06:26:30 +0800 <cometaj2> @PsyopPatriot It appears to be completely accurate psychologically.  The sacrifices to the tree of liberty are to keep away getting destroyed by our own primitive psychology.  This is also what moral law protects us from and which I don’t hear being talked about.  We’re our own greatest enemy.

This is a redux on the 2009 H1N1 casedemic. The problem goes away when we stop hysterically tracking useless metrics.
1339648467598147584 2020-12-18 03:07:38 +0800 <cometaj2> @LifeformBri @takemitsuronin @LeonydusJohnson Cases that don’t correlate to an increase in ICU admission or death are strictly irrelevant; it’s otherwise equivalent to tracking the flu when it doesn’t otherwise threaten life.   Nobody should care this much about reported cases that it ends up crippling life and livelihood.

Non-essential livelihood is a non sequitur used to justify wealth transfer, power grabs, and the attempted shuttering of unalianable sovereign individual rights.

1338934420066029568 2020-12-16 03:50:16 +0800 <cometaj2> @Cernovich It’s not equality, it’s equity. It’s the bringing down of every individual in an attempt to give a leg up to arbitrary minority group identities.  Collectivization always destroys individual sovereignty, freedom, wealth, and increases global suffering.

It’s an absolute wonder this is considered in any fashion in this day and age given the many historical precedents which showcase its profound inadequacy.
1338708901798113282 2020-12-15 12:54:08 +0800 <cometaj2> @SSCougFan @chickiej1 @GovInslee The square root of a population does half the work. Price’s law and the Matthew principle happen as a byproduct of work and compensated value. There is no known solution to common wealth generation other than letting this run its natural course. this is known to elevate everybody
1338706444938461187 2020-12-15 12:44:23 +0800 <cometaj2> @SSCougFan @GovInslee Bullseye.
1338703906969329664 2020-12-15 12:34:17 +0800 <cometaj2> @GovInslee Disgusting and shameful. Immorality begins by valuing group identities above sovereign and equal individuals. The Washington State Constitution specifically prohibits this; Section 12 SPECIAL PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES PROHIBITED.

1337170606941343757 2020-12-11 07:01:30 +0800 <cometaj2> @justin_hart Similarly, what is the death count in the US (all cause mortality) for 2020? This should be easy to compare to previous years to help determine, using a significant metric, the real impact of COVID.  The answer is that the impact was insignificant.
1337153963259392000 2020-12-11 05:55:22 +0800 <cometaj2> @3ideRaven @JeromePoowell @Fxhedgers Correct; In monetary sovereignties like the US, vertical money is controlled by the Government and regulates inflation/deflation but does not generate wealth. Insolvency is backed by war.  Horizontal money is a measure of generated and traded wealth. Insolvency is possible.
1337151843944697856 2020-12-11 05:46:57 +0800 <cometaj2> @moon_unchained @JeromePoowell @Fxhedgers Correct; you’re subsidizing yourself. If you don’t generate enough wealth to offset getting something for nothing, the hole gets deeper and can eventually overwhelm the entire system to a crash.
1337127329856831488 2020-12-11 04:09:32 +0800 <cometaj2> @JeromePoowell @Fxhedgers You can’t either, you just don’t know it yet; getting something for nothing is unsustainable and yields a reinforcement of Government subsidizing that ends in the State owning everything.  It’s the destruction of the production of national wealth/value.

1336829117170241537 2020-12-10 08:24:33 +0800 <cometaj2> @DownunderDickee @realDonaldTrump ‘Assault weapon’ is meaningless. A weapon isn’t one that isn’t used as such and the law primarily leans in the use of force, not in the object used to effect its application.  In any case those rights are those of sovereign individuals, not the State’s.
1336825104005677056 2020-12-10 08:08:36 +0800 <cometaj2> @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Shows what you know. This is a Union matter. If a State doesn’t have itself together and ends up crapping itself in a way that impacts other States, then it’s not hard to see how this would matter.
1336823930275786753 2020-12-10 08:03:56 +0800 <cometaj2> @DownunderDickee @realDonaldTrump States are also part of the union and have to play ball. States not having their shit together on union bound matters negatively impacts all the other States.

Compare that to previous years and  plot a projected trend for 2020, using prior years.  The numbers will be critically unremarkable.
1334980066648813568 2020-12-05 05:57:05 +0800 <cometaj2> @JustinGrayWSB Not with losing face at stake after having foisted a counter narrative through; no, it would not be in your best interest. You would likely get ostracized by your own network and by the vitriol spewed by the radical left. You’re reputation and career would likely come under fire.

They can’t be reversed and have very low collision probability.  E.g. SHA-512(DOB + SSN + ? + agreed upon random string + shared registered secret)  Whatever system is designed has to be approached with a zero trust mindset.

This is also why we Constitutionally favor equality of opportunity over equality of outcome.
1334643432833208321 2020-12-04 07:39:25 +0800 <cometaj2> @RossFairchild @no_silenced Well it’s not hard to see that favoritism of this sort could have been paid for in exchange for other aspects of influence over policy orientation in the United States (e.g. favoring of democratic leanings favorable to immigration policies or other foreign agenda).
1334532953758568448 2020-12-04 00:20:25 +0800 <cometaj2> @ItCentrist Correct, DIE is not about diversity and inclusion, it’s about a specific viewpoint about diversity and inclusion; if you don’t share that viewpoint you get the stick.  It’s playing on equity, which is equality of outcome rather than equality of opportunity. It destroys wealth.

1334352398966382596 2020-12-03 12:22:57 +0800 <cometaj2> @stillgray It’s an attack on a targeted group to deny them the ability to gain any footing against arbitrarily fashioned ‘oppressed’ minority groups.

1330961014028783616 2020-11-24 03:46:48 +0800 <cometaj2> @sirhottest In any case I think that the idea of white supremacy is being used as a taboo wrap around the whole of Western civilization values; it’s about applying pressure against values; race appears to have nothing to do with this other than it being used as a lever to elicit guilt.
1330960214057648128 2020-11-24 03:43:37 +0800 <cometaj2> @sirhottest Exactly; the very notion of race being used in any way shape or form as a filter for viewing the world invites the very thing the most radically vocal advocates portend to fight against.  It’s a self generating problem that attacks itself in others.  Projection.

However I think that the zeitgeist fostered the general disintegration of the perception of the value of teleological framing and of the development of tools that might help us better orient ourselves.
1330560694161346561 2020-11-23 01:16:04 +0800 <cometaj2> @PaulRoundy1 @DurinnM What to do is better expressed narratively, which religions, stories and myths capture better.
1330560030186172422 2020-11-23 01:13:26 +0800 <cometaj2> @PaulRoundy1 @DurinnM Raw data doesn’t tell us what to do with the data and our tools for understanding what to do are lacking in potency.
1330559510189023238 2020-11-23 01:11:22 +0800 <cometaj2> @PaulRoundy1 @DurinnM Sure, food for thought. It’s helpfulness stops there, and we are left ill equipped in ways of thinking that allow is to properly weigh all that food. Scientific thinking inherently tends to want to dismiss teleological thinking, because it can’t be accounted for causally.
1330556903751962624 2020-11-23 01:01:01 +0800 <cometaj2> @PaulRoundy1 @DurinnM Yes, Science uses causally anchored framing. My contention is that Science IS the wrong tool when we cross over into questions that entangle into Will. Teleological framing appears to work better in that context. Teleological and causal framing are abhorent to one another.
1330552460558036993 2020-11-23 00:43:21 +0800 <cometaj2> @PaulRoundy1 @DurinnM We appear to be absolutely ill equipped to understand the implications of moral valuation.   Science shines in it’s limited context but waddles awkwardly when buttressed against moral questions.  It appears to be the wrong tool.
1330550403730186241 2020-11-23 00:35:11 +0800 <cometaj2> @PaulRoundy1 @DurinnM Because it’s a personal choice; and meaning that you derive for its benefit per you perceptual structure may amount to a terrible meaning for another for reasons that can’t be accounted for Scientifically through a material realist stance.

1323423662913982464 2020-11-03 08:36:03 +0800 <cometaj2> @PaulRoundy1 @ZubyMusic Yes; I’m merely pointing out that like any other system, it sits on foundational assumptions, beliefs, which orient it’s unfolding; a specific ethical lens through which phenomena are experienced.
1323415878524833792 2020-11-03 08:05:07 +0800 <cometaj2> @PaulRoundy1 @ZubyMusic “It seems that the fatal error of every Weltanschauung so far has been that it claims to be an objective valid truth, and ultimately a kind of scientific evidence of this truth.” - Carl Jung
1323414670460416000 2020-11-03 08:00:19 +0800 <cometaj2> @PaulRoundy1 @ZubyMusic Ah but there’s a critical assumption underlying this; it’s the belief in the proposition that Science, with its very specific ethic leads to “the right” understanding. The foundational assumption orients and conditions that entire edifice of understanding.
1323403969595498499 2020-11-03 07:17:48 +0800 <cometaj2> @PaulRoundy1 @ZubyMusic Agreed, but I think the zeitgeist has us subdue the overruling authority of moral judgement in favor of mechanistic/causal views of the world that diminish our ability to properly think about morality and its importance.  We seem to have become shadows of our former selves.

1321263562208075777 2020-10-28 09:32:35 +0800 <cometaj2> @DracoBarbatus @LeonydusJohnson If somebody is coming at you with non lethal force (a beating and you’re of equal size and strength), you can’t meet them with lethal force legally.

1321261721416204289 2020-10-28 09:25:16 +0800 <cometaj2> @DracoBarbatus @LeonydusJohnson Lethal force is that degree of force which a reasonable person would consider capable of causing death or grave bodily harm (crippling injury).  Cut ligaments or muscles; a punctured liver, broken bones.
1321261536212512769 2020-10-28 09:24:32 +0800 <cometaj2> @DracoBarbatus @LeonydusJohnson It still falls under equal force; if somebody is coming at you with lethal force you meet them in kind.

We are individually ill equiped to deal with the reality that manifests if left to our own devices; this condemns the child to a life of torment and uncertainty.

1321235854321332230 2020-10-28 07:42:29 +0800 <cometaj2> @LeonydusJohnson LEOs operates under the standard or ‘necessary force’ to fulfill their responsibilities whereas civilians operate under the standard or ‘equal force’.  Stripping LEO of ‘necessary force also strips them of their ability to fulfill their responsibilities.

I think that sensation can be regulated by choice but I don’t think that we can say we choose how raw sensations feel.  I strongly prefer the flavor of bread but I chose not to eat it.

Holding faith against an individual is unconstitutional; it goes against the American ideal and favors, or disfavors, classes of individuals.

Otherwise, the discovery is that the price we pay for transgressing moral law is psychological.  The self inflicts psychological suffering, regardless of whether you get away with it or not (e.g. Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment)
1314001383159341057 2020-10-08 08:35:17 +0800 <cometaj2> @FrancisRoyCA Hmm, I’m not sure that’s accurate either, the central myth of Abrahamic religions is specifically the idea of free will (the knowledge of good and evil). It can’t be taken away; it’s inherent to the human condition. It’s our burden.
1314000738675171330 2020-10-08 08:32:43 +0800 <cometaj2> @FrancisRoyCA There’s a psychological cost to lying. Eventually the lies unravel.

This is what I have to say to treating people differently because of skin color 🖕.  The individual MUST always be valued more than some arbitrary group identity.

Antifa has much more in common with fascism than we would otherwise think by virtue of how radicalism yields enantiodromia.
1309233294215532544 2020-09-25 04:48:36 +0800 <cometaj2> @asbjornu @EyesOnQ Here’s a way to conceptualize this; extremism wraps back upon itself at the opposite end of centrism.   Radicalized leftism and rightism cross into one another and into extremism of anarchy and totalitarianism.  The human psyche plays on what could be characterized as a sphere.

This is also why the prospect is unpalatable to conscious awareness, which wants to disambiguate to properly function.  Both sides help us understand ourselves and consciousness and our human reality seems to emerge from the collision between the opposites.

It’s a deep problem. The mysterium iniquitatis.  It’s our burden as part of the foundational structure of the psyche.

Moreover, it can’t be suppressed because it’s foundational to the automatic parsing that occurs before phenomena reaches conscious awareness

It outlines a limit in our ability to perceive and apprehend phenomena. Even it it were true, it doesn’t appear to be assertable without contradiction. It appears to be strictly unverifiable.
