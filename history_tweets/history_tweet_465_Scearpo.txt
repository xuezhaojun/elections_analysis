1343260432690241536 2020-12-28 02:20:18 +0800 <Scearpo> @jevynglick @NgoloTesla @ev_hud I think philosophers can argue endlessly about whether beliefs are anything more than amalgamations of other people's ideas. I believe unique ideas come from an otherworldly place. Either way, this has been a pleasant exchange.

In this upcoming shift, it will end with the death of billions. The cursed nature of modern existence can be scrutinized and attributed to the "modern" part of it. (2)

1343259079800725505 2020-12-28 02:14:55 +0800 <Scearpo> @jevynglick @ev_hud @NgoloTesla I'm referencing doing hallucinogens recreationally or for personal insight when you aren't a tribal shaman.
1343258569974706177 2020-12-28 02:12:54 +0800 <Scearpo> @jevynglick @ev_hud @NgoloTesla I think it's a significant gamble. The Aztecs and the Mayans became subjects of something predominantly harmful. Furthermore I believe major societal exponential progress that occurs abruptly, ie Neolithic revolution, is the result of these practices and hasn't been a good thing
1343258275614253058 2020-12-28 02:11:44 +0800 <Scearpo> @jevynglick @NgoloTesla @ev_hud I've gone over the edge multiple times in my life in different ways. Deep deep down I don't see it as a significant personal journey, rather just foolhardiness borne of boredom. I think if we lived in a better society we would have the urges to do things like this, it's an escape
1343257899511017472 2020-12-28 02:10:14 +0800 <Scearpo> @ev_hud @jevynglick @NgoloTesla Furthermore, I believe there is a consistent pattern amongst many hallucinogen imbibing tribes and societies where the practice is only allowed to significant individuals, shamans and priests. Furthermore, the process is abstained until you're much much older.
1343257543762710530 2020-12-28 02:08:49 +0800 <Scearpo> @ev_hud @jevynglick @NgoloTesla As for the Eleusinian rites, the hallucinogen used called the Kykeon was made of a fermented barley that produced ergot. This proto LSD far differs from Ayahuasca, the proto DMT. I think there's a substantial difference. Furthermore, the Eleusinian Mysteries wasn't society wide.
1343257242146140165 2020-12-28 02:07:37 +0800 <Scearpo> @ev_hud @jevynglick @NgoloTesla I would say look at the civilizations that preceded them, that built the foundations of their society on hallucinogenic practice and led to massive amounts of violence, human sacrifice, and mutilation rituals. Hundreds of thousands of people eviscerated and decapitated for it.
1343255695140020224 2020-12-28 02:01:28 +0800 <Scearpo> @jevynglick @NgoloTesla @ev_hud This is a subject of great personal subjectivity but I feel that the risks far outweigh the perceived benefits of DMT. You can achieve the same breakthroughs through years of meditation and hard work, and trying to take shortcuts leads to very sinister outcomes for soul imho.

1343225916143579140 2020-12-28 00:03:08 +0800 <Scearpo> To me,  the pomegranate is the greatest fruit of all time.

Every time you eat a pomegranate, its consumption demands respect.  https://t.co/1HKQmpxBDA

1342915924526039040 2020-12-27 03:31:21 +0800 <Scearpo> Anyway that's all I got for you. Remember to work out and be the person you would want to be with. Try doing something interesting, and never care about anything ever and if you do, hide it from anyone you want to attract. Also commit crime sometimes and BEE UR SELF! :^)  https://t.co/8PMj6Lc3dC
1342915131978747910 2020-12-27 03:28:12 +0800 <Scearpo> If you fancy a girl who works a diner, especially a late night one, try pretending to be Ryan Gosling in Drive and go alone constantly and order something autistic like black coffee and nothing else. Be real quiet and serious and wait 5 seconds before answering any question.  https://t.co/q1XVTgPg3a
1342915126513565696 2020-12-27 03:28:10 +0800 <Scearpo> However, if your dick is ACTUALLY really really tiny, not to worry. You should exclusively seek out women that are librarians and museum directors because they have an appreciation for classical Greek statuesque proportions and they'll go crazy for you.  https://t.co/KfJI5wNF82
1342915121639776263 2020-12-27 03:28:09 +0800 <Scearpo> On penis size: I won't sugarcoat it fellas, women like a decently sized dick but it's not as big a deal as you're making it out to be. They have varying preferences, and even if you think you have a small dick, it's literally probably just fine as long as you're not insecure.  https://t.co/eTIVydAoB2
1342915117067939840 2020-12-27 03:28:08 +0800 <Scearpo> The best way to tease their inhibitions but maintain your attractive masculinity is to portion out your vulnerability in limited emotional breakdowns. For 90% of the time you should have no emotions whatsoever, but for 20 minutes a week, start crying and screaming profusely.  https://t.co/7uFfirZ1dk
1342915112479428610 2020-12-27 03:28:07 +0800 <Scearpo> Women love a sensitive man because it makes them feel special and powerful when they break down a man's emotional wall and get a front row seat to his vulnerability. But they hate too much of it because it makes you look weak and they'll leave you for it eventually.  https://t.co/M2vetT8auO
1342915107530092546 2020-12-27 03:28:06 +0800 <Scearpo> This is a fantastic way to get your forearms to look huge. I also recommend trying not to use your biceps or triceps to keep them small looking, so you can accentuate the size of your swollen forearms. Also buy hand grippers and use them constantly to maximize Popeye aesthetics.  https://t.co/FM9bGRsIG3
1342915102115299331 2020-12-27 03:28:05 +0800 <Scearpo> Physical fitness and big muscles gets girls, but only because bodybuilders and weightlifters have big forearms. Every other muscle actually doesn't matter, just forearms. I recommend getting a wooden board with some screws and using a screwdriver on it for 30 minutes a day.  https://t.co/Pzx4oB5Nf4
1342915098105540608 2020-12-27 03:28:04 +0800 <Scearpo> This isn't a brief enjoyable moment though, carrying your woman should increase exponentially over time throughout a relationship. Eventually you should reach a Master-Blaster type arrangement where she perpetually sits on a harness mounted on your shoulders and points to places.  https://t.co/aBReJBnrL9
1342915096448741378 2020-12-27 03:28:03 +0800 <Scearpo> Women like being picked up and carried because it makes them feel really tiny and safe in your arms. It also reminds them of being carried as a child, and awakens blood memories of them being stolen off for marriage by neighboring tribes. You should be able to carry most women.  https://t.co/vaOCABxSVB
1342915091650514944 2020-12-27 03:28:02 +0800 <Scearpo> Women don't like thinking about serious or shitty things, so any time you ever feel like you need to talk to a woman seriously, or about something important, just don't. As your problems and concerns pile up over time in a relationship, just start doing drugs to deal with them.  https://t.co/SKKXBg1Ger
1342915086424416258 2020-12-27 03:28:01 +0800 <Scearpo> Women love the PKP Pecheneg light machine gun because it fires belt fed 7.62x54mm rounds at approximately 650 rounds per minute. It can sustain fire far longer than its predecessors with accuracy because it has a force-air cooled barrel with radial cooling ribs.  https://t.co/xPpDz3INm9
1342915077788348421 2020-12-27 03:27:59 +0800 <Scearpo> If you're obese, you can actually get away with not working out if your frame is powerful enough. Wear flashy costumes that cut off at the stomach and draw funny designs around your navel. Slap your belly and make big rumbling laughs like a fighting game character. Women love it.  https://t.co/bLeBuXoJok
1342915064043630592 2020-12-27 03:27:56 +0800 <Scearpo> Most women are attracted to men that remind them of their dads. I don't recommend focusing on a particular woman too hard because ultimately it's not really up to you how your love life turns out, but if you're pining for a particular girl, try stalking her dad and mimicking him.  https://t.co/T4glpoOcZT
1342915057248825351 2020-12-27 03:27:54 +0800 <Scearpo> If fashion is a problem for you, just wear something simple like exercise pants and a tanktop. Then buy a lot of textiles and silk ornate fabrics and pile them around yourself like you're a flaming Indian prince or you own an art gallery. Get yourself a pair of eskimo sunglasses.  https://t.co/C3l0fYbiYw
1342915051263553537 2020-12-27 03:27:53 +0800 <Scearpo> Women like it when you're tall, obviously. This is a point of great despair for many short kings. Not to worry though. If you're below 5'8, you now have unlocked the ability to date extremely tall women who fetishize height differences, which is almost every super tall woman.  https://t.co/8y9keNkBdY
1342915045085372424 2020-12-27 03:27:51 +0800 <Scearpo> Women sometimes hate themselves and love being degraded by filthy losers. This is actually a blood memory of Diogenes the Cynic. If you can't afford the previous methods, living in squalor is free, the stinkier you are the better. If you fail, you can just jerk off in public now.  https://t.co/p2Fe7lY3Nr
1342915037934059522 2020-12-27 03:27:49 +0800 <Scearpo> Women like soft little baby animals, like puppies or kittens. One is plenty to get a crowd of women around you in public, but for maximum results I recommend a jumpsuit with multiple pouches. About a dozen or so puppies strapped to your arms, legs, and chest should do the trick.  https://t.co/uSIfikS8uM
1342915032145948672 2020-12-27 03:27:48 +0800 <Scearpo> Women get turned out when you commit acts of unspeakable violence in front of them. If you're a big pussy or don't wanna go to jail though, you can always pay a homeless guy $40 to pretend to mug you and let you kick his ass while you're walking out on the streets.  https://t.co/TV8Yal12zJ
1342915025741242382 2020-12-27 03:27:46 +0800 <Scearpo> You can also drop $120 on a bootleg Rolex or Omega. When she points out that you have a nice watch, take it off and throw it out of the window while you're driving. Look at her and say "I don't give a FUCK about it" and watch her gasp as you pull another out of your pocket.  https://t.co/IYDHpAFJMt
1342915020661936128 2020-12-27 03:27:45 +0800 <Scearpo> Women love it when men wear extremely expensive watches, but hate it when men even notice or care about them. You're probably not rich but a good bootleg Vacheron Constantin or Patek Phillipe only costs like $400 dollars and you can scratch it all day without freaking out.  https://t.co/zrQpEYccmE
1342915015934926854 2020-12-27 03:27:44 +0800 <Scearpo> If you suck at giving her "dad driving you around" vibe, you can always play the Travis Bickle confident autist and just ramble about how people aren't real anymore and you wanna be a part of society. Make sure you twitch a lot and smirk, and maintain eye contact way too long.  https://t.co/RvXfQ8aK2i
1342915010687885313 2020-12-27 03:27:43 +0800 <Scearpo> However you can basically play The Doors in the car when you drive her around and be real smooth and she'll basically associate you with Jim Morrison. Speaking of driving, make her sit in the back seat. Your only eye contact should be through the rear view mirror.  https://t.co/xAi8x1In0x
1342915006015414273 2020-12-27 03:27:42 +0800 <Scearpo> If a woman is cool, she loves The Doors because Jim Morrison is handsome, slings around a big dick, and whispers poetry into your ears. His Navy admiral dad also fed him satanic MKULTRA propaganda which makes him a bad boy, and women always love bad boys. You aren't Jim Morrison.  https://t.co/SHD9peCFqx
1342914999442923521 2020-12-27 03:27:40 +0800 <Scearpo> Women are different and they ultimately aren't going to match up all their interests across the entire sex. And furthermore their interests can change with age. But there are a few things that almost all women can agree that they want in a man, and it begins with The Doors.  https://t.co/EThWE6mcsy
1342914989481467905 2020-12-27 03:27:38 +0800 <Scearpo> A lot of people that I made up have been asking me "Scorch, how do I get girls to like me?" Women have been historically and eternally an enigma to the male mind. Infinitely complicated, yet deceptively simple.

1341987619450855425 2020-12-24 14:02:36 +0800 <Scearpo> Imagine if your clothes, your car, your home, your food, your possessions, the movies you watched, the music listened to, the games you play, all came from one company. The same company you work for, that your doctor works for, that your children's schoolteachers work for.  https://t.co/ka2bLJOopU
1341987613708849154 2020-12-24 14:02:34 +0800 <Scearpo> Corporations will either be destroyed and absorbed, or willfully band together into mergers. Cyber espionage and physical combat will be fought for brand not for country. A brand will encompass all parts of your individual life, not many but one single brand for everything  https://t.co/TCwwlLt6JF
1341987609225125889 2020-12-24 14:02:33 +0800 <Scearpo> As the world grows more technologically absorbed, steadily towards future horrors wrought upon our psychology by 24/7 augmented virtual reality, social media indunation, content consumer culture etc, the need for variety will disappear with the illusion of choice. Thus begins WAR  https://t.co/9hH3yqu5em
1341987605160853505 2020-12-24 14:02:32 +0800 <Scearpo> Companies have been merging and converging for decades into super companies that paint each of their tentacles a different brand to imply some degree of competition and variety. And they have been hampered by various laws and monopoly restrictions from expanding monolithically.  https://t.co/atwv1knlGS
1341987597762048000 2020-12-24 14:02:30 +0800 <Scearpo> Soon the Fast Food Wars mentioned as a joke in the movie Demolition Man will become a sobering reality, just like most of that movie. But it won't stop at fast food. Corporations will start to shed the murky ambivalence of mergers, deals, and familiar territory. They will expand.  https://t.co/AdKVXW6X7D
1341987593395855360 2020-12-24 14:02:29 +0800 <Scearpo> Sony and Microsoft will respond in a counter infiltration. They will open up physical franchises to sell fast food and coordinate their products accordingly. Would an Xbox store sell Dorito Nacho dusted french fries? Would Sony open Chipotle-style sushi burrito joins nationwide?  https://t.co/jPg5Xwd4YS
1341987589230895104 2020-12-24 14:02:28 +0800 <Scearpo> As they step forward recklessly into bold new territory, followed by sister companies Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and Wingstreet creating strange fusion products. Soon competitors will start flinging shit at the wall McDonalds phones Burger King cars Wendy's insurance DQ aquariums  https://t.co/DriJJsKJyM
1341987584818479105 2020-12-24 14:02:27 +0800 <Scearpo> Assuming the KFC console isn't an unstable horrifying grease fire hazard melted graphics card abortion, a boost in sales may turn into a worrying fusion of industries as KFC, a subsidiary of the Yum! Brand Corporation, starts to break into home kitchen appliances and gaming.  https://t.co/yIh7jaLUSk
1341987579802103809 2020-12-24 14:02:26 +0800 <Scearpo> Microsoft, Sony, and even Nintendo have sold out their consoles and created a high demand. Thousands of consumers sit gameless and unable to virtue signal their new toys to the world. What started as a silly idea, with probable limited production has the potential to blow up.  https://t.co/cpXKJxjizw
1341987574110416896 2020-12-24 14:02:25 +0800 <Scearpo> The problem is, where does it end? Will they employ QR coded chicken buckets with skins and gamerpoints? Will there be KFC console exclusives? Will it detect if you're cooking chicken and give you freebies? Let's toss aside the sticky greasy implications of the tech and go deeper  https://t.co/1NUgM9pBqq
1341987567303086080 2020-12-24 14:02:23 +0800 <Scearpo> Brushed off as a joke ad for marketing, this console has now become an unsettling reality as full ads, articles, and specs seem to imply this is a very real console going into production, with an approximate $2000 dollar's worth of computer equipment and a functional food oven.  https://t.co/IwbyEH2mXR
1341987562857099266 2020-12-24 14:02:22 +0800 <Scearpo> Sometime in June of 2020, KFC announces a gaming console to rival the PS5 and Xbox Series X. A device that allows you to play video games through an internal graphics card and process, and houses a small oven that keeps your fried chicken warm for you while you play video games.  https://t.co/9KYscZGv2R
1341987558050377728 2020-12-24 14:02:21 +0800 <Scearpo> Emboldened by a boosted Chinese market and full blast high on absurdist ads and corporate crack, KFC cranks out strange products from collaborating with other companies. KFCxCrocs for chicken shoes. KFCxPsyop for a KFC dating game. KFCxEnvirolog for a chicken scented firewood  https://t.co/JBafBUxseH
1341987551687675905 2020-12-24 14:02:19 +0800 <Scearpo> KFC took a hot fat dick when Popeyes unveiled a sandwich people stabbed each other to get and their company was losing traction for a while. In a desperate attempt to revitalize their brand, boardroom executives placed their trust into the indecipherable mind of zoomer marketers.  https://t.co/8N8uQoYFhq
1341987546142793729 2020-12-24 14:02:18 +0800 <Scearpo> The KFC console is more than an advertising campaign, it is the precarious little tuft of snow that will roll itself into an avalanche of a corporate franchise war as more and more megacompanies start to cross into industries they had no business being in. Here's the blueprint:  https://t.co/1Liu8OL4Fe

1341551205630271488 2020-12-23 09:08:26 +0800 <Scearpo> The Car People are a turbulent folk, built only for speed. They forever feel the constant relative inertia to the stillness of the Earth below them. Theirs is a high speed low drag lifestyle, constantly transient, never attached to anyone or anything for too long. Always moving.  https://t.co/xfVtd6ELNE
1341551114240602113 2020-12-23 09:08:05 +0800 <Scearpo> They operate in this gender segregated society, inseminating and adopting from a hivelike queen structure filled with the opposite sex, subsisting off simple farming and goods from the male tribe. Not seeing each other for months. Disputes occur when tribal rotation turns overlap  https://t.co/u9013iqlMv
1341550995692789761 2020-12-23 09:07:36 +0800 <Scearpo> The rest are a warrior culture mechanic climber spider people, constantly shifting, constantly moving, constantly fight.

1341550919280943104 2020-12-23 09:07:18 +0800 <Scearpo> Except for a few matriarchal sedentary prostitution based aristocracies that dwell in the centers of the superplatforms, several stories high. They provide pleasure and relief for the wasteoid trucker speed nomadic males, giving away boys after a certain age to join other tribes  https://t.co/ulHPqcsDMU
1341550758035124224 2020-12-23 09:06:40 +0800 <Scearpo> The cars are absolute neutral self driving terminators, shifting and dancing around each other. The AI is left to its own devices for the greater platforms, but the miles in between are a wasteland of manually driven combat collision gun fire DMZ interactions, extreme violence.  https://t.co/jJ0Be35nVo
1341550583849906177 2020-12-23 09:05:58 +0800 <Scearpo> These poor spasming screaming bastards are generally run over and turned to fine paste within minutes on the hotscatching pavement of superhighway, cracked and potholes, littered with debris, towered by two shadowy structure walls filled with scurrying dwellers, littering garbage  https://t.co/0Mc5v7U1TD
1341550492699287556 2020-12-23 09:05:36 +0800 <Scearpo> The few instances of a nomad falling off the edge of the outskirts of a vehicular superstructure and living, beyond the pain of broken bone is a worse feeling. Being absolutely still, not moving constantly at windy high speed, the stillness sets in a convulsing madness in them  https://t.co/AFK5MPSPqe
1341550410180554754 2020-12-23 09:05:17 +0800 <Scearpo> The car people tribalize intricately and get into territorial disputes often. They all move around from superplatform to superplatform in accordance with their astronomical observations, the night sky in a cut off band with the stars shifting far faster than normal.  https://t.co/IBpv4dFB5E
1341550316383334400 2020-12-23 09:04:54 +0800 <Scearpo> Their blood memory addled fumbling fingers, blistered with the instinctual movements of a car mechanic's, all seem to instinctively be able to pick apart and put back together things. When they can scavenge enough plastic and metal, they can build new machines and cars to expand  https://t.co/IvmbEleZjr
1341550230165139463 2020-12-23 09:04:34 +0800 <Scearpo> The car people are half savage, gaping their mouths towards the eternal Western wind to hopefully catch stray bugs they can chew and subsist on. They scavenge garbage with nets, shoot down birds of all manner with harpoons, have gardens of edible shrubs, and collect the rain  https://t.co/6Xc6VXyA3S
1341550122992320512 2020-12-23 09:04:08 +0800 <Scearpo> Along the edges of the highway are several dozen stories of favela style shantytowns interspersed with militant black plastic towers, around them a pile of laundry and sandaled fishermen that fiddle with electronics in their fingers as they scour the pickings of overboard cargo  https://t.co/5Nor1lnHZV
1341550023755132931 2020-12-23 09:03:45 +0800 <Scearpo> The people will be wirey, hardy, and leathery sons of bitches that leap from car to car, migrate in an anthive pattern as a whole population constantly rotates through different spots on the highway, navigating a series of global obstacles, broken patches of highway, stones, etc  https://t.co/0NEBO9KiYD
1341549912824147971 2020-12-23 09:03:18 +0800 <Scearpo> People are born, live, and die on these platforms like feudal nomadic city states with the exceptionally large several mile wide interlinked carpiles being treated as mercantile independent supercities. Thousands of windswept tan squinting men hop from one to another like monkeys  https://t.co/1L13o2mjiF
1341549534476972035 2020-12-23 09:01:48 +0800 <Scearpo> A 200 mile wide equatorial superhighway that is suspended by city sized concrete pillars towering hundreds of feet into the air.

1341549531104731150 2020-12-23 09:01:47 +0800 <Scearpo> In the future, industry will be so high tech that solar powered vehicles can nanomolecularly self repair and sustain their structural integrity indefinitely, and drive constantly through the day.

1340701774332760070 2020-12-21 00:53:06 +0800 <Scearpo> Good memories are a dry ration you pick crumbs off to survive every waking moment of boredom, work, sickness, sadness, and loneliness.   A wonderful moment is the product of saving money and scraping together some time and it lasts you through thousands of dull or painful moments  https://t.co/ZWqJdpY8yb

1339710556966711296 2020-12-18 07:14:22 +0800 <Scearpo> Welcome to The Program. You have 5 minutes to leave your house right now, having just read this. You will not take anything with you except your car keys and whatever you're wearing right now. If you don't have a car, immediately lie down to sleep and ignore any noises you hear.  https://t.co/eX2Sw9V35r
1339710552688488455 2020-12-18 07:14:21 +0800 <Scearpo> You are not going to leave before your time is due, because some jobs are going to involve punishing the people who did. They're going to try to tell you some things while you saran wrap their bodies to a metal chair. You're better off ignoring what they say, for your own good.  https://t.co/bh9HA7YLRN
1339710547365867523 2020-12-18 07:14:19 +0800 <Scearpo> You will learn to destroy any sense of self that you have. All morality will become a childish memory, all curiosity will be a foolish regret of the past. You will become an instrument of discipline, following the black and white orders made of pixelated light in your hand.  https://t.co/rVj11qJLXt
1339710544098541569 2020-12-18 07:14:18 +0800 <Scearpo> Eventually you're going to learn the know-how and the fortitude to hide inside freshly drywalled hollowed space in between two walls for 24 hours, pissing yourself and shitting in a diaper with utmost silence, until you get a text to break through and kill whoever's in the room.  https://t.co/2CD0GyAjcU
1339710540466315264 2020-12-18 07:14:18 +0800 <Scearpo> Get yourself arrested and processed, then shit out condom wrapped chapstick tube filled with three large pills and a microSD card.

1339710535382798337 2020-12-18 07:14:16 +0800 <Scearpo> Sneak into a police station and stick a tiny thumb drive into the back of a computer. Go up to a BMW in a parking garage and slash its tires. Climb a movie producer's fence and get past the maintenance men to deliver a message. Cut the power to a fashion gala. Start a forest fire  https://t.co/QfBPVKQqf1

1339710513165512718 2020-12-18 07:14:11 +0800 <Scearpo> Hookers, booze, blow, nicer clothes, better home setups. Maybe two off days in a row, eventually your own ride. The better your work, the better your life. You give us five good years of your best work and we give you a retirement. Or you can continue working for us if you want.  https://t.co/KF5rGPJwsG
1339710506563727362 2020-12-18 07:14:10 +0800 <Scearpo> It's gonna be a year or two before we let you go out on your own during your rest days. In the beginning, your downtime is going to be a lot of studying, research, training, and preparation. Eventually once we know you're competent, you'll get bonuses for a job well done.  https://t.co/wWiCsWQTzq
1339710500343574540 2020-12-18 07:14:08 +0800 <Scearpo> You will soon be able to put on a latex glove very quickly. You'll become intimately familiar with hydrochloric acid. You're going to be doing a lot of driving. Your newest closest friend is the notification on the phone we're going to give you. Every single order is mandatory.  https://t.co/sjIKS7ROw1
1339710495906013186 2020-12-18 07:14:07 +0800 <Scearpo> Four days a week, you're gonna be working at nights. You'll either be wearing high end cocktail bar clothes or mechanic jumpsuits. Half of your main job is psychological persuasion, the other half is physical. The rest is errands, trips, deliveries, and recoveries.  https://t.co/LTiw7gYkfz
1339710488716963841 2020-12-18 07:14:05 +0800 <Scearpo> Your cars will be either be unreturned rentals or stolen right off the street. The only people you can socialize with will be wearing balaclavas and explaining to you various skills you'll need to learn, like how to pick locks or suppress a handgun with a rolled up rug.  https://t.co/QYnzA47U6e
1339710484405055489 2020-12-18 07:14:04 +0800 <Scearpo> Empty your pockets into the receptacle next to the TV in your room. This motel is your home for the next 24 hours. Motels are your home for the rest of your life. You will never stay in the same place for more than a week. You will never have the same name twice.  https://t.co/G91OUusyfm
1339710479506280449 2020-12-18 07:14:03 +0800 <Scearpo> Your family will be paid off and notified you're okay. They'll grieve because they'll never get to see you again. You'll have plenty of time to think about them during the few hours in the afternoons when you aren't asleep. Your new clothes are in your closet. Half are uniforms.  https://t.co/a989U8FguS
1339710473273524225 2020-12-18 07:14:02 +0800 <Scearpo> It's time you left. No more job, no more house, no more car, no more friends. You're getting replacements. Under your chair there's a motel key with the directions written on the tape. When you get there, burn your clothes and leave your car keys on top of your left front tire.  https://t.co/zbLoPC8bR9

Before we were pigs, cattle,  and chicken. But there is some small dignity in it,  despite being farm fed grain animals. Some benefit to meat still. Now we will truly become bugmen, a hivemine species

1339341698141392898 2020-12-17 06:48:39 +0800 <Scearpo> You feel pain when you die. But pain on the brink of death is an old friend you know all too well. You look at pain fondly because pain no longer will follow you past the ethereal gate. As you pass on, you will feel the loss of a friendship grieve, because pain dies with you too  https://t.co/wTu1l07oAW

1339341686745538562 2020-12-17 06:48:36 +0800 <Scearpo> Pain is the almost sympathetic tearstorm of crushing emptiness that follows the death of someone you love.

1339341682387644417 2020-12-17 06:48:35 +0800 <Scearpo> Pain is the all surrounding Dyson sphere of hateful pinprick needle burns in a scraped elbow.

1339341670970773508 2020-12-17 06:48:32 +0800 <Scearpo> Pain is every moment of disappointment, trampled gesture, unrepaid friendship, wasted gratitude, hurt pride, complete disloyalty, quiet anger, and unforgivable betrayal that turns you into a cautious predator that shields itself from open arms and wide hearts, malevolent or not.  https://t.co/QciskPH0Ie

1339341658681380867 2020-12-17 06:48:29 +0800 <Scearpo> Pain is the day by day drop of a grain of sand in the hourglass within which you sit.

1339341645939142659 2020-12-17 06:48:26 +0800 <Scearpo> Pain splits the world in half and invites exclusive parts of your consciousness into itself.

1339341632169259009 2020-12-17 06:48:23 +0800 <Scearpo> Pain is the servant of death, a constant reminder of mortality that haunts every king, peasant, priest, and freak that was ever born. Pain sobers up the most indulgent egotistical naive joys into sharpened serious reflex. Pain uplifts long weary despondence into alarmed readiness  https://t.co/2ClgCTy6dW
1339341627844857867 2020-12-17 06:48:22 +0800 <Scearpo> Pain is the constant burn that hardens you like a sharpened stick in an open flame, purifying you, singing away and melting off every little bit of you that is incapable of withstanding more pain. Making you more resilient to further pain, with higher intensity in the future.  https://t.co/HDeJj1ukJq
1339341624657260544 2020-12-17 06:48:21 +0800 <Scearpo> Pain is good. Pain is great. Pain is actually the best feeling in the world because it is the most honest. Pain is not lying to you. Pain is not pretending to be anything. Pain has no pretensions, no complications, no layers, no traps. The only aftereffect of pain is more pain.  https://t.co/SlTmYHyjNR

1337818004881625093 2020-12-13 01:54:02 +0800 <Scearpo> @praxisbaby02 @sunwounds Closure is an illusory concept. The cheapening of the past in exchange for the comfort of the present.
1337814966393577474 2020-12-13 01:41:58 +0800 <Scearpo> @718Tv Harry Potter is a feminine fanbase because the woman author basically wrote the ultimate female power fantasy: Becoming rich and famous instantly and being good at everything without effort.
1337808653336850440 2020-12-13 01:16:52 +0800 <Scearpo> @Leve_raged This man is your friend, he fights for kino
1337808309944979456 2020-12-13 01:15:31 +0800 <Scearpo> @laelemlos @lporiginalg Fun fact, at the Korova Milk Bar in the beginning of the movie, the milk is spiked with various hard drugs. Three different flavors. The milk the boys were drinking was called Drenkrom which was a reference to Adrenochrome, which made them bloodthirsty and ready for ultraviolence  https://t.co/PJS760j0yt
1337804780220145670 2020-12-13 01:01:29 +0800 <Scearpo> @NgoloTesla @apis_GOD @youngfinessr @Grimhood Yes there's a lot of historical examples of the sky and sea being referred to as green because a lot of natural blue didn't exist in nature
1337799418985246720 2020-12-13 00:40:11 +0800 <Scearpo> @youngfinessr @NgoloTesla @Grimhood Quite possibly different colors each time.  Maybe not even just "your red is my blue" but even incomprehensible unique colors,  completely alien to others and special to each individual
1337796085146849280 2020-12-13 00:26:56 +0800 <Scearpo> @youngfinessr @NgoloTesla @Grimhood The "appearance" of colors is indeterminate between each person, but color blindness can be determined because they see less colors than the noncolorblind.
1337598150354276353 2020-12-12 11:20:25 +0800 <Scearpo> When there is absolutely nothing left to take away from you, if you are still standing you will become an entity, more natural disaster than man. The most dangerous person on earth is someone who has nothing left to lose. Completely unconcerned about living, refusing to die.  https://t.co/EeN6jeG5pr
1337598144520085505 2020-12-12 11:20:23 +0800 <Scearpo> You are an extremophile. A Tardigrade built to withstand extreme temperature, pressure, vacuum, and hostility.

1337598139243622400 2020-12-12 11:20:22 +0800 <Scearpo> You, the thought criminal You, the racist You, the conspiracy theorist You, the homophobe You, the bigot You, the bot You, the chud You, the problematic You, the ever present ghastly shock inducing example of every opinion that goes against science, logic, and reason, you sinner.  https://t.co/kXN7ouoJtU
1337598135254867969 2020-12-12 11:20:21 +0800 <Scearpo> Much like a real insurgent, you most likely didn't even choose to be this way. You were probably radicalized by the collateral effects of Their Actions. All because you dared to have an opinion that didn't go along with what THEY say is right. And now look at what you've become.  https://t.co/r07ykyd5tq
1337598131219931137 2020-12-12 11:20:20 +0800 <Scearpo> When one person falls, five more take his place. Every of you can be an army of accounts. Every time new and draconian measures are taken against you, you adapt. The few that fall initially are used to map out the minefield of "trigger posts" and banned content to avoid.  https://t.co/8SPbdR4gdH
1337598124299345920 2020-12-12 11:20:18 +0800 <Scearpo> Perhaps not even knowingly, you engage in common tactics that are used by real life insurgents. Every group chat is like a terror cell that limits and vets its individuals, interconnected with other GC's. There is no "leader" for online insurgency, merely figureheads.  https://t.co/eYstaf7exg
1337598118821584899 2020-12-12 11:20:17 +0800 <Scearpo> The collective idea of what is true and what is not is a valuable territory for Those That Wish You Harm.

1337373442669228037 2020-12-11 20:27:30 +0800 <Scearpo> These noncorporeal ophanim are midnight shift security guards that spend trillions of years being assigned to our backwater existence to interfere if we fuck with the cycle.  A sun is born and dies. A Guardian does the God- equivalent of playing Candy Crush and napping.  https://t.co/wie08nGmbT
1337372274178002944 2020-12-11 20:22:51 +0800 <Scearpo> As this dull glowing wall absorbs buildings, trees,  people,  it takes a perfectly 2-Dimemsional slice snapshot of the contents within and rearranges them like a 3D printer or a computer image rendering in slow motion  The Flood is an emergency protocol enacted by cosmic janitors  https://t.co/eVSPyn4tiA
1337371722857787396 2020-12-11 20:20:40 +0800 <Scearpo> The "flood" was not actually one of water,  that is just metaphorical tribal interpolation. Rather,  it is a line by line particle dismantling of reality in a horizontal flat wave. Imagine a wall made of dull light,  infinitely tall and wide,  moving slowly across the world.  https://t.co/s7ussE39pJ
1337370598557757441 2020-12-11 20:16:12 +0800 <Scearpo> Speaking of continents, their shifts are not the product of million year increment tectonic shifts but rather a rapid 1 week process of shuffling around during the first stages of transition. Various minor laws of physics are temporarily shut down during this process.  https://t.co/oPidKyxkSd
1337370490957131789 2020-12-11 20:15:46 +0800 <Scearpo> This particular instance was the impetus of the Great Flood mythos that several isolated ancient societies each corresponded with antedeluvian religious and cultural lore, despite never having come into contact with one another over the span of continents.  https://t.co/rlytS5SO6x
1337370331581968385 2020-12-11 20:15:08 +0800 <Scearpo> When it comes time for a transition, traditional the transfer of power is ceremonial and peaceful.  However if an age of man has seen unprecedented population explosion in a race to co-opt the whole cycle,  reality itself dismantles society and the new chosen must rebuild.  https://t.co/lZWnHtPVIH
1337370022390468608 2020-12-11 20:13:55 +0800 <Scearpo> There are a chosen ~500 people who are given rightful precedence over global affairs every new age.  Some call this the Yugas, some call this the Precession of the Equinoxes.  Astrological positioning decides who's turn it is.

1337369867897491459 2020-12-11 20:13:18 +0800 <Scearpo> If they did not make these deliberate decisions, very quickly reality would unfold into a DMT baby vision kaleidoscope zero gravity fuckfest as every individual chose their own perception We learned the prerogatives from our ancestors who created them from messages we sent back.  https://t.co/zCDqhDGtyW
1337369695062777858 2020-12-11 20:12:37 +0800 <Scearpo> The secret societies that are assigned control over global politics for each new age of humanity make these changes purely out of aesthetic preference. They mold the world and the way they want us to experience it like new home owners doing renovations and buying new furniture.  https://t.co/QmK5LMqzHB
1337369175677865984 2020-12-11 20:10:33 +0800 <Scearpo> Each age of civilization has the capacity to fully alter the physical features of existence itself.  Colors,  sounds,  senses,  and logical physics all operate differently between each age of humanity,  all through constant reinforcement and societal reprogramming.  https://t.co/xwOKKdPhjL
1337369011487707136 2020-12-11 20:09:54 +0800 <Scearpo> The phrase TAPPED IN  is a word magic revelation to the process of eavesdropping on secret knowledge exchanged between past and future secret agencies, like tapping a phone call.  You only get the next one and the previous one so it's a global inter-epoch game of telephone.  https://t.co/Z57fQ2Hwy8
1337368849461686272 2020-12-11 20:09:15 +0800 <Scearpo> Correspondences are quite common between the CIA and bronze age equivalents of three letter agencies. Sumerian astrology wizards would trade ancient secrets for future knowledge via sealed cave dropbox tablet inscriptions and future to past Astral Projection Possessions.  https://t.co/2MXVCQ9Aec
1337368565469556743 2020-12-11 20:08:07 +0800 <Scearpo> The Emperor's New Clothes is not a metaphorical folktale but rather a very real pre-Iron Age psyops program that was written about in a 1335 Spanish storybook and reinterpreted by a Danish  writer named Hans Christian Andersen, who accidentally received temporal impulse signals.  https://t.co/GZgZmCneVk
1337368134681042944 2020-12-11 20:06:25 +0800 <Scearpo> Such major alterations are actually quite common in history. Separate fiefdoms in medieval Europe had their own psyops programs where the local king or duke would flog people until they physically could not see certain objects or places through sheer desperate willpower.  https://t.co/XCFINlVh36
1337367965667364864 2020-12-11 20:05:44 +0800 <Scearpo> The population very quickly adapted to perceive colors as the TV and movies looked. Outliers and incompatibles were funneled out of society through optometrist secret society punishments and mental asylum imprisonment.  14 historical colors would be forgotten and 3 new invented  https://t.co/Gv6SKUKT05
1337367737878896642 2020-12-11 20:04:50 +0800 <Scearpo> Black and white television becoming the prominent captivation of western society was a color reprogramming psyop. Once up to 85% of the population was having dreams in black in white,  they introduced Technicolor with props and set being done in the wrong color.  https://t.co/1eMIF1FNVM
1337367561676222464 2020-12-11 20:04:08 +0800 <Scearpo> The worlds greatest psyop was a global suborbital jet cropdust in 1983. Thousands of planes streaked across the sky with blue dye that would permanently float in the upper atmosphere. Global house arrest, major alterations to historical text and film.

1335862659544178688 2020-12-07 16:24:11 +0800 <Scearpo> The materialist consumer still obeys the eternal concept of UP and DOWN to seek out his God. Every positive rating is the occult marking of something he feels is higher than himself, every negative one is the personal projection of inferiority downward.

1335860991167488002 2020-12-07 16:17:34 +0800 <Scearpo> When you take in an idea into your mind, you SUBMIT yourself to it. When you create an IDEA that others take in, you DOMINATE their internal being on a small level. This is why it is derisive to be a CONSUMER because you aren't balancing out what you take in with creative output.  https://t.co/Yub07zRUE1
1335860260683309057 2020-12-07 16:14:39 +0800 <Scearpo> The natural default state of masculine and feminine energy is that of dominance and submission. A man penetrates a woman during sex as a dominant metaphor. He fills her with himself, imprinting himself into her. Yet both parties are changed by this sacred process.  https://t.co/fMGzJmB9cH
1335859446107533312 2020-12-07 16:11:25 +0800 <Scearpo> When you put something inside your body, it will become you and you will become it. This is why grace is said before every meal. Communion is a spiritual exchange, an intimate conjunction of 2 into 1. This alchemical exchange exists for metaphorical consumption as well.  https://t.co/H3iky7vUbI
1335857151445700610 2020-12-07 16:02:18 +0800 <Scearpo> When you SUBMIT something on a forum, website, app, you place yourself in a position below it, you give admittance to inferiority before it. When you LOOK UP something, you are literally giving the authority of deference to a search engine. DOWNLOADING is harvesting from hell.  https://t.co/eG4idn5EGk
1335855130122579968 2020-12-07 15:54:16 +0800 <Scearpo> The hierarchy of UP and DOWN in the spirit of man is made obvious by a series of natural metaphors. A child grows into a man, his decline to elderly age is met with physical pain and loss of capability.

1335852842389790725 2020-12-07 15:45:11 +0800 <Scearpo> The modern world which allows for all this to exist is the constant harvesting of METALS from below the Earth and the siphoning of energy sources such as OIL and COAL.

1335851544873480193 2020-12-07 15:40:01 +0800 <Scearpo> The replacement and rejection of God which hides itself as enlightenment is Materialism. A Materialist sees nothing more than the physical reality around him, unable or unwilling to see past the veil. Anything bigger than himself is Heresy.

1335843006511976448 2020-12-07 15:06:06 +0800 <Scearpo> Everything HIGHER than you is internal processed as a greater authority than you. You LOOK UP to something that has wisdom and guidance for you. The holy mountain and the sacred tree has been replaced by the TOWER and the SCREEN.

1335841858845597699 2020-12-07 15:01:32 +0800 <Scearpo> To orbit the Earth is to commit eternal ritual sacrifice in penance to the material world. A horde of cameras constantly zoomed into the surface of the Earth, prostrating themselves to the matters of man, blind to the sky. The SKY is where God lives and we've turned our backs.  https://t.co/tkIb97kO2P
1335840934546825216 2020-12-07 14:57:52 +0800 <Scearpo> The root of all great mystical change is done through SACRIFICE. When you sacrifice something in exchange for a lesser result than what you sacrifice, you are accidentally (or purposefully) creating an occult ritual. This is why ORBITING girls has negative connotation.  https://t.co/0xBkAHl7Xy
1335839513566973952 2020-12-07 14:52:13 +0800 <Scearpo> An object in ORBIT encircles the Earth. To encircle something is to venerate it. When you rotate around something ritually,  you deliberately deny yourself the momentum of moving forward and progressing to pay tribute to the focused subject.  This is a Temporal Sacrifice.  https://t.co/L0HrWaiUfJ

1335836759129776128 2020-12-07 14:41:16 +0800 <Scearpo> The sensation of falling is demonic,  an ever present startle reflex that seeks to pull you towards a state of null existence.  Gravity is merely the ever reaching tendrils of FALLEN angels. People RISE to heaven.  Orbit is eternal falling,  the ISS is the Locutus of the Damned  https://t.co/hQkLagQyev

1333942639335514113 2020-12-02 09:14:43 +0800 <Scearpo> Have you created an imaginary person that was in your form? Your little 5 inch tall Diorama Doppelganger to copy everything you said and did in the way you did it? Do you think you're 100% accurate or perhaps altering yourself based on self image? What if you changed your You?  https://t.co/mL0pdrEDqi
1333942411790348291 2020-12-02 09:13:49 +0800 <Scearpo> Many children understood this concept long ago. Many people walk around with with these long neglected friends hiding in the closets of their minds. Like dusty old computers that stutter on after years of disuse If you brought back your imaginary friends would they recognize you?  https://t.co/P0HvgrfGpS
1333942112732241922 2020-12-02 09:12:37 +0800 <Scearpo> Suddenly you're talking to yourself now. You've created an imaginary friend, a golem, a tulpa. Your imaginary man speaks to you through the filter you provided for him and suddenly you're having a conversation with yourself. But it's no longer really yourself now is it?  https://t.co/iaak8lRgFX
1333941715758100484 2020-12-02 09:11:03 +0800 <Scearpo> You wonder which of these two scenarios are more cosmically unerving and if you let your imagination run a little longer, your imagine man speaks up. He presents you one of your own thoughts in the unique voice inflection you gave him, you answer back in your own voice by reflex.  https://t.co/IXJBvQ0WTO
1333941087875043329 2020-12-02 09:08:33 +0800 <Scearpo> Or is every ant, every bacteria, every atom, every grain of sand, every planet, every patch of sky, every single moment of boredom, every fart, every breath, every blink, with all the worlds people throughout history contemplating their own internal universes, all just a thought?  https://t.co/4ephRXCiy2
1333940868370272256 2020-12-02 09:07:41 +0800 <Scearpo> You think about where it ends. The Russian Nesting Doll of dreams within dreams, thoughts upon thoughts An uncomfortable conundrum presents itself: Is your whole lifes perceptions a series of smoke and mirrors, lied backstories to make this thought world you live in seem complex?  https://t.co/byr1Wrrcv1
1333940641378791427 2020-12-02 09:06:46 +0800 <Scearpo> Then you ask yourself questions like what if your whole lifes experiences are merely the imagination of some Godhead. How could such complication and intricacy, such size and age of everything be the mere two minute daydream of some Pandimensional Superbeing? Your mind races  https://t.co/3R8ROkdSBX
1333940513448325126 2020-12-02 09:06:16 +0800 <Scearpo> Yet you can't help but wonder what would happen if you went further to expand the perspective of the mind. What if it wasn't a person in an Earth you built but something alien? A creature of constantly shifting physics, built on slime and plasma, color like bacterian fever dreams  https://t.co/QSQsYkQb9s
1333940332392800256 2020-12-02 09:05:33 +0800 <Scearpo> Keep in mind everything you do to this imagined man is what you do to yourself. Yet none of it has full effect on your psyche. Each piece of your mind you rip away from its whole to animate into being will eventually melt back into gray play dough to return to its clumpy legion  https://t.co/ueaxG4kE7w
1333940196379856901 2020-12-02 09:05:00 +0800 <Scearpo> Will you be cruel and torture him out of morbid curiosity? Will you absent mindedly pry apart his limbs and juggle them telekinetically as you collapse the sky and scenery into flat plane folding open like an undone cardboard box? Will you make him exist through millenia of void?  https://t.co/2OPwa4ky6h
1333939958214692865 2020-12-02 09:04:04 +0800 <Scearpo> Will you warp and weave the world around your imagined man, lifting up the chunk of ground he stands on and rocketing him around a cavalcade of increasingly cartoonish warping realities? Will you show him geometrically impossible landscape, a field of rainbows, galactic sights?  https://t.co/kSnvyyNjSV
1333939746486235136 2020-12-02 09:03:13 +0800 <Scearpo> Every possible reaction is mere mimicry now, you choosing to puppet his revulsive panic attack at the knowledge that he isn't real. Perhaps you instead choose to make him comically indifferent. Or will he be sagely acceptance? Maybe derisively smug, in a "I already knew" scoff?  https://t.co/X3UdQCEdai
1333939435176648707 2020-12-02 09:01:59 +0800 <Scearpo> The man in your imagination is freely given a full blast of cosmic apotheosis. You have given him the full context of knowledge, what the world you live in is, who you are, and how he has come to be, an entity of your thoughts He concludes as you conclude that he has no free will  https://t.co/dhSPUSyBGs
1333939223485947906 2020-12-02 09:01:08 +0800 <Scearpo> When you are made aware of the little game of God you play every time your imagination runs wild, you suddenly start wondering the implications of what you're doing and where it is going to go. There is a very good chance that you will choose to make your Imagined Man self aware.  https://t.co/qFwwLver3T
1333938939518980096 2020-12-02 09:00:01 +0800 <Scearpo> Most of the universes you build in your mind will resemble the one you live in, and most of the beings in your day dreams will resemble the human form because it is what you know and what you are familiar with. Most people usually don't deviate from our God given templates.  https://t.co/X68QGav3wT
1333938643585495040 2020-12-02 08:58:50 +0800 <Scearpo> Every time you picture a scenario in your head, you build an entire universe inside of your mind, an instant rendering of space and time that comes equipped with a full implied system of physical mechanics, countless millenia of context, and sensible functional upkeep  https://t.co/SfU1r637yI
1333938491928031234 2020-12-02 08:58:14 +0800 <Scearpo> Now that you have two creations in your mind, make them speak. Who the second? Male, female? Lover, friend, enemy, stranger? Are they in a park, sidewalk, office? Day, night, winter, summer? The entire span of time this story plays out in your head is the length of a universe.  https://t.co/WONdlsSBnj
1333938247421063172 2020-12-02 08:57:16 +0800 <Scearpo> Think about a man in your head, someone who isn't real. A complete creation. Instantly (if you're imaginative) he will have a face, a body shape, an age. Certain clothes, certain hair. He will have an environment, a personality, and soon he will have at least one other around him  https://t.co/CdwQsINJjD
1333937893316898821 2020-12-02 08:55:51 +0800 <Scearpo> Every time you imagine something, you are pulling from a cloud of abstraction and molding it into little moving figures, shoebox stages, cardboard screens with a hole, letting in sunlight like a spotlight. Every Hypothesis is a Genesis, and you are the puppeteer.  https://t.co/5fXtMZu2Ns
1333752234719535105 2020-12-01 20:38:07 +0800 <Scearpo> @NgoloTesla Probably doing lawn mower reviews on youtube with cargo shorts and running shoes on, secretly going through a divorce and getting hit on by their 16 year old daughter's friends.

1333608669544583171 2020-12-01 11:07:38 +0800 <Scearpo> I hope you remember the Before of when man was misguided and lost. Now he is found in the cradling arms of the Five, the Progenitors. We want not, fear not, breathe not, have not, know not or care not. You will join us. If not, your children will. We will always be ready for you.  https://t.co/CI5JjuRojj

1333608153586417664 2020-12-01 11:05:35 +0800 <Scearpo> Each creepily uncanny *hoot* or flatulence *huuuurk* that echoes out of a cacophony of shrill request belches and echolocation whistles that is now the Five major languages afforded to humanity by the Progenitors. An average of 4,000 words each exclusively requesting to Purchase  https://t.co/Lj9gZBKvpc
1333607930919342080 2020-12-01 11:04:42 +0800 <Scearpo> Each of this cavalcade of horrors decked with a plastic suit of electronic armor made of pure LED light.

1333607178784137216 2020-12-01 11:01:43 +0800 <Scearpo> The human race speciefies itself into 5 separate grotesque animal caricatures of itself. Runtlike twelve shoed caterpillar monkey furred shrewmen scurry between the long spindly legs of giraffe height lanky three headed dromadery-peoples. Contuberous buffaloctopus men, fly people  https://t.co/EMWqm2cxaz
1333607002422046720 2020-12-01 11:01:01 +0800 <Scearpo> Many die off through raw collision or accident, survivors being pumped and bred three times over Many driven into the sickening fate of choosing between losing between their Products and their sanity when intentional uncomfortable design has railroaded them into a life of torment  https://t.co/sN5nxWDoN5

1333606491815890944 2020-12-01 10:58:59 +0800 <Scearpo> Over time User Interface, Haptic Feedback, Ergonomic Design, and Safety Features began going against the grain of human biology. With so many people reproducing in the HyperFavelas, collateral damage becomes a tiny percentile. A hidden eugenics program on incompatible consumers  https://t.co/zTrl1dJtWL
1333606064621826048 2020-12-01 10:57:17 +0800 <Scearpo> The Five Fused had completely dominated their respective Brands into something unique. For too long they had catered to the whims of their Consumers and their bodies, their skin, their bone structure, their faces, and their minds. Now these Five would direct biological evolution  https://t.co/7niJ7PeqI1

A tender touch on your wife's thigh while flying in coach or a moment of contemplation in the car that your great grandmother tries to catch up to but is never fast enough😔

Their ability to somehow master space travel is explained by them having psychic powers where their " equipment" works if they believe in it, even if it's scrap taped together

1333251886678470657 2020-11-30 11:29:55 +0800 <Scearpo> Today I saw a man dressed from head to toe in black. His name was Death. Today I saw a man cloaked in gray. His name was Time. Today I saw all of these men in the faces of every man I've ever known, including the one in the mirror. You've seen all these men before, you will again  https://t.co/GVYOrNVvMh
1333251076955508738 2020-11-30 11:26:42 +0800 <Scearpo> Today I saw these two men sitting, separated by a table carved from the worlds oldest tree. This table was far too short to fulfill any reasonable intention for its purpose, yet it was the longest table I, or anyone could ever know. The word "life" was carved into its surface.  https://t.co/qyVoUGCwaU
1333250967169536000 2020-11-30 11:26:15 +0800 <Scearpo> Today I saw the older man, a scar covered white haired tan leather skinned cauldron of silent brutality with milky gray eyes. His face was one of absolute still unfurled calm, his eyes sunk into his face like bottomless pits, his gnarled hands lay flat, hesitant tools of violence  https://t.co/DLuFNfdRGo
1333250817374171137 2020-11-30 11:25:40 +0800 <Scearpo> Today I saw the younger man, a lean chiseled viscous specimen of brutality enshrined in red light with dark shadows, pectorals rising and falling as he breathed deeply through his flaring nostrils, eyes sharply squinting and focused forward at his opposite, clenching the table.  https://t.co/xbfd7eD5Xr
1333250629582680065 2020-11-30 11:24:55 +0800 <Scearpo> Today I saw two men sitting across from each other at a table. Both of them stared each other in the eyes with absolute stillness. The two were entirely different yet were the same person. An old man was on the left, the younger man was on the right.  https://t.co/yT70B2WKrR
1333249984339308545 2020-11-30 11:22:21 +0800 <Scearpo> Today I saw a man who spent his whole life in gnawing discomfort while everyone around him relaxed and enjoyed the stability of their lives. For one brief moment, a minute of the hour of a life, everything went to hell and everyone panicked. Except him.  Today that man woke up.  https://t.co/iyIObByDUj
1333249716369428485 2020-11-30 11:21:17 +0800 <Scearpo> Today I saw a man kneeling in the center of a flat concrete square, surrounded by filth but the concrete was clean.

1333249378757308416 2020-11-30 11:19:57 +0800 <Scearpo> Today I saw a man walk towards a busy highway, staring down towards incoming traffic in calculated grim deliberance.

1333249215867330563 2020-11-30 11:19:18 +0800 <Scearpo> Today I saw a man look in two directions before slamming the trunk of his car shut.

1333249149496647680 2020-11-30 11:19:02 +0800 <Scearpo> Today I saw a man smoking a long drag out of a cigarette,  his smoke played with dusk sunlight briefly making a demon image in the air.  Today I saw a man in a small crowd in the freezing cold,  everyone breathing a warm fog out of their lips,  except for him.  https://t.co/qN9KKHg4HY
1333248852745392129 2020-11-30 11:17:51 +0800 <Scearpo> Today I saw a man sprinting, hands like knives through the air, entire body morphing into an animalistic blur. Today I saw a man alone in a bar, gripping a glass so hard it cracked in his hands.  Today I saw a man climbing the side of a building with a backpack and a mask.  https://t.co/2QkAgTPA0W
1333248644363988994 2020-11-30 11:17:02 +0800 <Scearpo> Today I saw a man walking down the sidewalk holding a cinder bock in one hand,  staring forward,  unblinking. Today I saw a man standing in front of an open flame,  burnt paper scattering around in the wind,  a single heart drawn in purple ink next to a signature on a scrap  https://t.co/tltdgDhkAX
1333248325135589378 2020-11-30 11:15:45 +0800 <Scearpo> Today I saw a man with absolute certainty in his eyes, certainty hiding behind a dull yellow age and drug riddled hazy blur. Today I saw a man with blisters on his palms and knuckles. Today I saw a man walk into an ocean standing straight, impacted by waves, unfaltered  https://t.co/GpKMUFfpd6

Your objects over time gain physical manifestations of the way you use them and treat them. If you aren't careful, they'll change you too.  https://t.co/5w13yRy6Gn
1332569675096608769 2020-11-28 14:19:03 +0800 <Scearpo> The spirit of an object is something animators understand because it is their job to mimic life through something inanimate Their mind is reoriented and focused through mystical lens This is why you see so many cartoons of living objects, it is their sentience manifesting in mind  https://t.co/4ikZmY2ALm
1332568411268911105 2020-11-28 14:14:01 +0800 <Scearpo> Have you ever been followed by a coin before? The same incessantly bright new penny, sitting before you on the floor of your job, never willing to bend down and pick it up? Then the same day you see one in the parking lot of a store Your driveway Your room's carpet Your pocket  https://t.co/93ZilsZ2Ci
1332567405063712769 2020-11-28 14:10:01 +0800 <Scearpo> Now, objects exist in a superposition each time you are not within reasonable presence. The larger an object, the less likely it can defy logical physical laws of existence and is cursed to remain in place. The smaller and more subject to movement, the more likely to disappear.  https://t.co/ayEUMLndxc
1332566221624107008 2020-11-28 14:05:19 +0800 <Scearpo> If all of these objects were made in Sacred Precision with ritual spell imprinted upon their essence, they would move freely and perform commands at will. Little golems made of plastic, wood, and metal. Yet now they can only shift in and out of existence in rare opportunity.  https://t.co/aMupdtqrg4
1332565040269037568 2020-11-28 14:00:38 +0800 <Scearpo> Cell phones, as all computers, are golems. Once even fed commands directly through paper inserted into a mouth, now instead their commands which give them life and without them becoming a useless husk of mineral, is inscripted upon silicon in a binary language.  https://t.co/QE9n6Ve5Tj
1332563625664450560 2020-11-28 13:55:00 +0800 <Scearpo> This imprint can even be concentrated and redirected. An object paired with symbolism, such as books, fortune cookie paper, or logos can have more direct internal impact. When you add in the sensation of movement and control with the spectacle of light, you reach the cell phone  https://t.co/0gfsM3owNp
1332562211940814848 2020-11-28 13:49:23 +0800 <Scearpo> Objects can even be imbued with sheer negative energy radiating from their core, purposefully or by accident. They can be imbued with pleasurable experience and become lighthouses of good energy for the familiar and the initiated. All through the experiences with and through them  https://t.co/7ZE82APcjk
1332560737936531458 2020-11-28 13:43:32 +0800 <Scearpo> Gears, springs, coils, rods, pistons, levers, wheels, engines etc are the many mechanisms which bring this movement to an object. A good example of an object that contains the philosophy of aesthetic, the excessive power of historical use, and the intricacy of movement is the gun  https://t.co/nFECzM25FF
1332559638848483329 2020-11-28 13:39:10 +0800 <Scearpo> Motion is mimicry of life, more vibrant and personified than stillness. Even if mechanical through design, this motion still gives life. The more complicated and intricate, the more captivating and important to the user. This is why watches become obsessions for fashionable men.  https://t.co/GpuJtuEaOA
1332558627601838080 2020-11-28 13:35:09 +0800 <Scearpo> Within brief periods of great velocity mixed with a blurry lack of observation, an object can trigger a primordial reptile reflex and open a little wormhole in midair as it's dropped or thrown If it defies sight within this time, it can enter this wormhole to other dimensions  https://t.co/WRSUeyCHEo
1332557263320584193 2020-11-28 13:29:43 +0800 <Scearpo> An object with just the right frequency, a vast range of frequency, a dim light compared to the laserlike precise bandwidth needed for animate properties. Yet enough to imbue crooked transportation. Completely notional, only without observation.  Small objects move around unseen.  https://t.co/jmombp3qIi
1332555964722130944 2020-11-28 13:24:34 +0800 <Scearpo> Objects can have personalities from just applied thoughts alone. A perfectly spherical metal ball can have absolute zero monolithic signature, a complete void of association beyond abstract shape. Yet it becomes a constant miasma of dread when you use to bludgeon someone to death  https://t.co/mNEYC4Y5fy
1332554759891513345 2020-11-28 13:19:47 +0800 <Scearpo> Objects have personalities from just appearance alone. Every car manufacturer knows this. The personification of an every day object, resembling a face or a body, is the subliminal golemancy taught on accident to design students and artists.  https://t.co/5HvniJoPxE
1332553615492440064 2020-11-28 13:15:14 +0800 <Scearpo> However when you fidget with one in your hand, you bend it to your liking. Once office presentable manicured even utilitarian folds now become  a lengthy crooked piercing object of malevolent use, improper, unintended. A criminal's lockpick, or phallic needle for scraping grime.  https://t.co/qTbtUJcINY
1332552254071599105 2020-11-28 13:09:49 +0800 <Scearpo> The emotional and psychological aspects imbued onto every day objects is imbued by shape, context of use, and the psychic energy of the creator, possessor, and user of any object. A paperclip is a shrewd lanky spindly tool of sycophantic bureaucratic assistance.  https://t.co/0Ks2jhw4bE
1332551490360254464 2020-11-28 13:06:47 +0800 <Scearpo> However these objects are still sentient, merely immobile and incapable of free will under the presence of observation. Instinct can be inferred into the personification for this mutant defect golemancy accidentally performed by every tinkerer, inventor, and assembler in history.  https://t.co/2TdnKC1rqA
1332550727252717569 2020-11-28 13:03:45 +0800 <Scearpo> Inanimate objects are sentient creatures forever paralyzed because they lack the precise Sacred Geometry of their proportions to give them capability. If a Sharpie, a remote control, a book, your cellphone, or a crumpled up piece of paper was designed ritually, it would be alive.  https://t.co/KtpuzNu8xl

An artistic display of surreal brutality and ultraviolence juxtaposed against a psychedelic desert aesthetic, hot sweat Americana  https://t.co/gt6Q0DB9Bn
1332529164944084992 2020-11-28 11:38:04 +0800 <Scearpo> @handle_anonymus Excessive bloating, sweat, hyperdense acid shits, coke nasal drip, red eyes, needing to piss more often, nausea, coughing, foul aftertaste, puking, comedown, hangover, I could go on.
1332177997395275782 2020-11-27 12:22:39 +0800 <Scearpo> @CastLocust I'll bump it up higher on the list than it was before ty
1332177050803826688 2020-11-27 12:18:54 +0800 <Scearpo> @CastLocust That would've happened if they weren't preoccupied with making more "people" to babysit.
1332175292773883904 2020-11-27 12:11:55 +0800 <Scearpo> @TheWhiteThorne Love you lots 😘😘😘
1332175036074110976 2020-11-27 12:10:53 +0800 <Scearpo> Thousands of years later, a space faring advanced civilization arrives to see this solar system sized mesh of machinery and faint trillions of fist sized heat signatures surrounding a neutered star. They vaporize it entirely in pity. They've seen far too many species end this way  https://t.co/XrvTtwMqHC
1332174849989636096 2020-11-27 12:10:09 +0800 <Scearpo> Eventually the entire solar system is harvested into a Dyson sphere powered web of interconnected space vessels, constantly converting resources into more machines, more pods, and breeding more organ coated pea brains to be High™ for 200 to 1000 years at a time  https://t.co/INqVDVsgps
1332174662483259393 2020-11-27 12:09:24 +0800 <Scearpo> Predicting a loss of space and resources, the machines delegated a small chunk of land for R&amp;D, creating a series of space shuttles to begin colonizing and occupying the moon and nearby planets. Terraforming unnecessary since the pod protects from outside elements and vacuum  https://t.co/WlaX8DPwLo
1332174520891928577 2020-11-27 12:08:51 +0800 <Scearpo> Soon humanity becomes a series of small organs around a softball sized brain, floating freely in tanks. A vague feral understanding of sensation and the only change is that every moment is increasingly more intense than the last. Eventually the planet is coated in pods of this  https://t.co/lgLxI1dueW
1332174392776912896 2020-11-27 12:08:20 +0800 <Scearpo> Further still the machines found that most functional brain capacity what unnecessary. The five senses become irrelevant when submerged in preservative embryo fluid in complete darkness. All that is necessary is the sense of Self and the sense of High™, relative pleasure change  https://t.co/GlOB40rTdf
1332174182654898178 2020-11-27 12:07:30 +0800 <Scearpo> To fit as many people as possible on Earth and reduce the need for resources, the machines that run this global coma induced opium den resorted to manipulating and selectively breeding human beings towards a lack of extremities. Any unnecessary muscles, bones, and organs now gone  https://t.co/NEntCak6a2
1332173861383757825 2020-11-27 12:06:13 +0800 <Scearpo> The quasi religious movements that precipitated humanity's new state of being sought to spread the Gospel of High™ to as many new humans as possible. No halt in reproduction, no discarded viable babies, no thought or care for sustainability. Make more people and make more High™  https://t.co/PzzoVwwqXa
1332173419094355971 2020-11-27 12:04:28 +0800 <Scearpo> The most important directive is to grow as much human life as possible and to cull as little as possible. The machine mind realizes that above all else, the most important directive is to maintain maximum High™ for the entire lifespan of a person. They find creative solutions  https://t.co/S07IU8PpDP
1332173083180929025 2020-11-27 12:03:08 +0800 <Scearpo> Without guidance or ambition, these cold machines run by one dutiful Invisible Hand CPU hivemind forsee an eventual terminal capacity for space and resources on Earth. Motivated only by the hastily programmed directives of urgent junkies on withdrawal, it seeks to spread humanity  https://t.co/U8yUhNLSrG
1332172856235585538 2020-11-27 12:02:14 +0800 <Scearpo> The manipulator of mankind is now a cold machine, a lobotomized algorithm running a full network of flesh sacs in polymer titanium chitinous life pods, pumping in water and a nutritious paste grown from moss farms. Pumping out shit, piss, blood, cum, and gestated ovaries  https://t.co/1Mxy3QJ9W5
1332172619437780995 2020-11-27 12:01:17 +0800 <Scearpo> From that moment on until the average life expectancy of 120, the baby grows from toddler, to child, to adolescent, to youth, to adult, to elderly. Every waking millisecond is constant bug eyed spasming as the furthest reaches of human pleasure is constantly broken exponentially  https://t.co/loIxxW6fzo
1332172254097121282 2020-11-27 11:59:50 +0800 <Scearpo> A baby is hatched from a bioplastic coated capsule filled with embryonic fluid. Gentle latex pincers inject a dozen hairthin chips into its skull, powered by proximate body heat and stolen electromagnetic activity. The infant ceases its wails as it is instantly baptized by Orgasm  https://t.co/vkJzfNclKt
1332172071078682626 2020-11-27 11:59:06 +0800 <Scearpo> Sleep is just what it appears on the inside. In reality, all human beings are now gestating in pods as shriveled emaciated seizure victims, constantly tweaking out on full octane chemblast muscular atrophied 24/7 TurboHigh™ from birth to death, pierced and vivisected by tubes.  https://t.co/olLc246pnr
1332171729825914882 2020-11-27 11:57:45 +0800 <Scearpo> Eventually the goal is within grasp. Autofactories with self repair sentries, drones and self driving vehicles to accumulate resources. Completely artificial insemination, gestation, and birth. The last waking man does a final check on a handful of his peers before going to sleep  https://t.co/4GoIvoRXFq
1332171565254004737 2020-11-27 11:57:06 +0800 <Scearpo> The Luddites, the Skeptics, the Abstinent, the Ascetic, and the Productive will be forced to accept the implant or die alone far away in the wilderness. All communities will be broken up and assimilated. Those who give in will be baited constantly with free High™ until they bite  https://t.co/mgIWu9IVG5
1332171202790617090 2020-11-27 11:55:39 +0800 <Scearpo> Whatever discourse is left on sparsely used social media is a complete cultural shift towards a new religion Any existing theocratic objection is quickly sidestepped and justified towards the end state of humanity being constantly High™ Holy text and canon is interpreted as such  https://t.co/nMqQD7bbXj
1332170945000247299 2020-11-27 11:54:38 +0800 <Scearpo> The Machivellian mechanics of society break down as the world's leaders, both public figures and Secret Societies, completely work towards this unified goal of constant High™. Scientists and engineers are tormented with sobriety to hurry up and develop technology to make this be  https://t.co/CpicCxjZqt
1332170754486657025 2020-11-27 11:53:53 +0800 <Scearpo> Humanity quickly races now towards the technological potential for full autonomy. Scientists quickly start a eugenics program to weed out those who are genetically incapable of accepting an implant at birth. Incompatible babies are incinerated out of pity right after birth.  https://t.co/SCgM3Oep4b
1332170578573336577 2020-11-27 11:53:11 +0800 <Scearpo> The flavorful minute differences between each effect of once chemical drugs, (the smelly carpet rainbow chill of weed, the melt into the floor of xanax, the heightened superpotential hunter-killer-fucker of cocaine) all now dissipates and homogenizes into one vague dopamine blast  https://t.co/52M3d4z8fe
1332170272393269248 2020-11-27 11:51:58 +0800 <Scearpo> All meticulous millenia long planning swirls down the drain as the last plutocrat Alterer of Nations installs an implant in his mind. Those below him who refused due to fear or good sensibility have either been converted or culled. All of Man is now the purveyor of High™  https://t.co/pfyViMFn0j
1332169930595315712 2020-11-27 11:50:36 +0800 <Scearpo> But as the technology improves and full control is gained, the shadowy elites which have refused to allow themselves or their children to use this technology will eventually die despite their best efforts not to. With each generation more and more of their heirs give in to High™  https://t.co/7bulwOp5li
1332169590307254274 2020-11-27 11:49:15 +0800 <Scearpo> This Huxleyesque hedonightmare will at first start as a ploy for population control. Clumsily steering people with addiction and withdrawal like a carrot and a stick will prove far more simpler and economically viable than mastering digital control of a human mind.  https://t.co/mvzmq41fgv
1332169410006704128 2020-11-27 11:48:32 +0800 <Scearpo> All pleasures of life, culinary, aesthetic, and social, will break down as all anyone will ever want to do is buy High™ until they pass out. You can blast off with immediacy for 15 minute intervals at a time, extra physical sensations locked behind a paywall  https://t.co/ezQPyWT88a
1332169054514188288 2020-11-27 11:47:07 +0800 <Scearpo> The implants have no chemical addiction, but will obviously psychologically addict the user. However, they will curb this feeling for several hours a day just so the user can be productive. As soon as they clock out of work, their cravings become furious and insatiable  https://t.co/8eJ4N33sMT
1332168831226286082 2020-11-27 11:46:14 +0800 <Scearpo> In the future neural implants will mimic the effects of heavy narcotics without side effects, except multiplied by a thousand. Superheroin that gets you borderline comatose, ultracocaine that turns you into the most powerful man in the world, hypermolly to become happiness itself  https://t.co/WEGtl2mEbe

1331506001875492867 2020-11-25 15:52:23 +0800 <Scearpo> So we reach our climax.

1331505427549401093 2020-11-25 15:50:06 +0800 <Scearpo> Through it all, this symphony of chaos and despair wrapped up into a lozenge coated in sugarlike mythos, and swallowed by the antedeliviuan fetus like grain killswitch Trojan Horse for nomads, it grew as the needs of man grew beyond the Garden of Eden, toiling instead hunting.  https://t.co/cYVSs7SolK
1331504587480715266 2020-11-25 15:46:46 +0800 <Scearpo> The Firstman hums a guttural tone and syncs up his vibrations with the intemperate rhythm of the physical universe, tapping out oscillators of tippy tappy punctuation. Raindrops on a flat room like a snare drum, thunderous cracks like a rare pedal drum, the hum of sky like tablas  https://t.co/miLQqBUD8h
1331503587483131904 2020-11-25 15:42:48 +0800 <Scearpo> The caveman finds a stoney cliff, harshly firm without dust to absorb Soundwave. He shouts "hallo" in bastard savage tongue and creates echo, the inherent cloneification of himself, one man into an army of Shadow Titans, voluminous Goliath booming out internal defference  https://t.co/yBbiRVyh51
1331501824755593217 2020-11-25 15:35:47 +0800 <Scearpo> To Speak is to Live and make oneself known. To become silent with intent is to court with death, the closer oneself brings to it, the further they envelope themselves with crisp strength and deliberance. Yet one minor slip and they dive headfirst into an oily liquid wall of alone  https://t.co/yZRuJHRjS5
1331500813806604290 2020-11-25 15:31:46 +0800 <Scearpo> To court with sound is to court with the phantom highways in God's bloodstream The Deaf are Daywalkers, burnt into an Achilles oven made of sight and sight alone Music is just cursive speaking Vibration is the constant baptism of physicality, a sacrifice made to realize concepts  https://t.co/1U96DB0bjv
1331499826589151232 2020-11-25 15:27:51 +0800 <Scearpo> To mispronounced, misuse, and misconstrue a word is Pioneer Alchemy, the total experimental wanderlust mksnavigations that can often lead to flaccid loss of momentum in the psychospiritual dance of verbal conversation.  But if you're lucky they lead to some new powerful spell.  https://t.co/38tQzFEU7y
1331499044443746304 2020-11-25 15:24:44 +0800 <Scearpo> The incessant codification, specialization, hyperpronunciation, and extra localization of the component of a word is the constant inexorable sharpening of pincers, little metal beaks to move about atoms across a field, arranging them ever so slightly for massive nuclear changes.  https://t.co/pQQ2efvF4l
1331497820902346753 2020-11-25 15:19:53 +0800 <Scearpo> Over time these primordial sounds complicate and combine, creating lesser elements of great quantity and diversity. Thrown together fractures of verbal palantirs, eggs made of light and laid by God, broken into pieces and thrown about the world like little crystal drops of rain  https://t.co/tG6FB0KtQC
1331496758615142402 2020-11-25 15:15:39 +0800 <Scearpo> The way a word sounds is more important than its meaning. The meaning of a word is derived from a combination of primordial sounds.

1331067516177813507 2020-11-24 10:50:00 +0800 <Scearpo> This has been a humble presentation of my day to day life. I hope you are delighted and educated by the experience. Please allow my suicide servants to escort you off the property now.  (This message has been dictated to and interpreted by doctored linguists held at gunpoint)  https://t.co/McHdfBHQPR
1331067338729410561 2020-11-24 10:49:18 +0800 <Scearpo> I was given one of the worlds most common names at birth. Through a series of painstaking global psyops and Mandela redactions made when I was 7 years old, now nobody on Earth knows the name at all, it's even been stricken from the Bible and buried in scrolls under the Vatican.  https://t.co/dzsLii2hRB
1331066721604612096 2020-11-24 10:46:51 +0800 <Scearpo> I communicate via an alternating series of exaggerated baby screams and saying the numbers 1 and 0 randomly over and over in a robot voice. A team of psychologists and interpreters is charged with accurately ascertaining what I'm saying at any given time.  https://t.co/ufGDTs1ElO
1331066389709402112 2020-11-24 10:45:31 +0800 <Scearpo> During one of my quarterly hyperREM sleep sessions, electrodes are placed on my scalp and hooked into satellite dishes so that I can invade and coopt peoples dreams and leave cryptic meaningless messages for fun. I can do 500,000 people at a time, you've probably met me.  https://t.co/6xEWFtFmEg
1331066233253486593 2020-11-24 10:44:54 +0800 <Scearpo> I travel by a series of complicated logistical arrangements that are handled by my staff to move me at great distances in complete silence with no sense of inertial movement while I close my eyes. A team of hypnotists is on hand to actively convince me I teleport everywhere.  https://t.co/mVYUFUd2K9
1331066025824186369 2020-11-24 10:44:05 +0800 <Scearpo> My daily hydration consists of Galapagos tortoise blood and Rothschild child tears. I only smoke cigarettes scavenged from Vietnam War Era C-Ration packages. My heart rate is intentionally kept at 40 BPM and my limbs are moved, Weekend at Bernies style, to prevent elevating it.  https://t.co/6SmQzpuO0f
1331065764909080577 2020-11-24 10:43:03 +0800 <Scearpo> Because I refuse to have my skin pierced by any foreign body, I have never had any cosmetic or corrective surgery. Instead I hold sway over health and fashion companies to mold subconscious standards of beauty in society to match my exact physical appearance.  https://t.co/XLaTGK7rV0
1331065585921380352 2020-11-24 10:42:20 +0800 <Scearpo> Every time a new world leader is introduced to me they are instructed and trained by advisors to make a verbal offer to suck my penis. I never accept of course, but if I detect the slightest hint of insincerity in their eyes, I have 100 square miles of Amazon rainforest napalmed.  https://t.co/8eb4K7skNE
1331065368685785093 2020-11-24 10:41:28 +0800 <Scearpo> Whenever I have sex to reproduce, not for pleasure, I exclusively impregnate French and Ukrainian supermodels inside the copilot seats of F18 fight jets reverse cowgirl style, with a 3g force barrel roll on climax to shoot the semen directly into her uterus. Strictly for breeding  https://t.co/oQmD0H9WZc
1331065210770051074 2020-11-24 10:40:50 +0800 <Scearpo> I exclusively have pleasurable sex with octogenarians that reluctantly accept millions to receive massive amounts of plastic surgery and treatments to look 20, often at great expense to their physical and mental health. Their families are also paid to watch.  https://t.co/ml83ci5Q80
1331065035158851586 2020-11-24 10:40:09 +0800 <Scearpo> My clothes are immediately burned after disrobement. The ashes are given a full funeral and burial, encased in faberge built mechanical hearts that go into autonomous colossus platinum statues built by Swiss watchmakers, left on indigenous Pacific islands to be worshipped as gods  https://t.co/I6z3hq9FIX
1331064735039676416 2020-11-24 10:38:57 +0800 <Scearpo> My two main staples of clothing alternate between a hot pink latex body suit that covers every inch of my body except for the genitals, for urban wear. At home I wear a biomechanized suit of armor completely made out of platinum with gold trimmings and crimson silk padding.  https://t.co/OEPGw5piKE
1331064494290841603 2020-11-24 10:38:00 +0800 <Scearpo> Every once in a while when I get bored I'll pay a migrant worker exorbitant amounts of money to their family in exchange for them to put an authentic 1526 Giovanni Antonio Gavacciolo engraved walnut stock loaded flintlock pistol in their mouth and pull the trigger in front of me  https://t.co/A4aYVA9veV
1331064311419187202 2020-11-24 10:37:16 +0800 <Scearpo> Thanks to my fabulous wealth I have orchestrated for a series of former DELTA and SAD/SOG operators to plan out contingencies for every possible sporadic decision I make and subsequently have cirque du solei acrobats shield my vision from ugly sights via a series of curtains  https://t.co/Lwr2ss0cQy
1331064020946841601 2020-11-24 10:36:07 +0800 <Scearpo> I like to unwind by having schizophrenic homeless people monitored via flying tiny drones shaped like birds and insects. Their ramblings are pieced through audio editing programs and remixed into spoken word poetry and orated by ventilators hooked up to severed human larynxes.  https://t.co/pOTcV4yrAs
1331063524886523904 2020-11-24 10:34:08 +0800 <Scearpo> I have a team of Japanese sushi chefs and mathematicians that construct my daily diet of fruit, uncooked vegetables, and raw meats into 1 inch perfect cubes, arranged in a grid on plastic trays, melted and molded in shape from children's favorite toys stolen from their homes.  https://t.co/jstBEzFZCL
1331063025328152578 2020-11-24 10:32:09 +0800 <Scearpo> The entire sculpture is suspended on a football stadium sized gyroscope stabilizer that rotates based on real time monitoring of my movements within the Escher staircase topsy turvy layout. The interior is lit by electromagnetically suspended pure plasma floating in midair.  https://t.co/n9hqJkBcGE
1331062478265065474 2020-11-24 10:29:59 +0800 <Scearpo> My fourth major residence is a series of giant selenite cave crystals, mined and fused together, with a series of spiral staircases and living quarters carved into the entire framework by grandmaster sculptors in a true to life proportion MC Escher Relativity lithographic homage  https://t.co/f90HytaTbj
1331061720467562503 2020-11-24 10:26:58 +0800 <Scearpo> I have a series of rockets on launch pads on standby in every major metropolitan city fully staffed and ready for improptu launches A nuclear warhead is built into the space station, set to detonate unless an ELO 2000 chess game is played every 5 minutes between two staff members  https://t.co/LM8Y14UGz9
1331061522328662017 2020-11-24 10:26:11 +0800 <Scearpo> My third home is a suborbital soviet built tubular pod system that has been painstakingly decorated in neo-Gothic interior style, complete with magnetically suspended furniture, books, and accoutrements. A team of former cosmonauts turned butlers maintain it, traveling 20,000 mph  https://t.co/ksfO1oYyoO
1331061321039810560 2020-11-24 10:25:23 +0800 <Scearpo> The inside of my cube is decorated in microscopic cuneiform scratches, patched with jade. A 400 year old Welwitschia desert plant is suspended from the ceiling via a rope made from archeological Pharoah hair samples from Egyptian pyramid tombs. Absolutely zero light is allowed in  https://t.co/xKhlJAokbE
1331061139875262470 2020-11-24 10:24:40 +0800 <Scearpo> My second home is a decommissioned gulag 4x4 concrete cell turned artsy tiny space that has been airlifted and dropped onto 5 blocks of prime downtown Tokyo real estate, leveled and cleared. Tresspassers on the empty property within several meters of my cube are shot on sight.  https://t.co/x4ngzfn327
1331060959524352001 2020-11-24 10:23:57 +0800 <Scearpo> This man-made shallow lake is traversed via a series of carbon fiber wind rafts, captained by the finest androgynous male models Italy has to offer. The entire basin is acoustically conducted by trained marimba playing child slaves beating palladium pipes in rhythmic fashion.  https://t.co/PEZiMNOgld
1331060771661484038 2020-11-24 10:23:12 +0800 <Scearpo> My living quarters oscillate between the following residences:  First Home: 25 acres of flat polished concrete and flooded with 2 feet of water,  a combination of Acqua di Cristallo Tributo a Modigliani luxury water and a single drop of genetically reconstructed dinosaur blood.  https://t.co/cVMEQNZLqm
1331060517235003392 2020-11-24 10:22:11 +0800 <Scearpo> A Berlin DJ and a symphony orchestra that I pay to live on standby serenades me awake every morning, combining Antonio Vilvadi's Cantata with a synthesizer that exclusively plays whale farts. I sleep in 3 hour increments 4 times a day at equidistant intervals.  https://t.co/nD0BcgRG73
1331060018670657537 2020-11-24 10:20:13 +0800 <Scearpo> I am a freelance artist that makes popsicle stick sculptures for inner city classroom decorations on commission.

1330762637664276481 2020-11-23 14:38:31 +0800 <Scearpo> But they must pretend because life goes on and so does humanity. Their children will be sincere in their values, and carry them onward. But it must start somewhere. There will be only one transitional generation, the Pretenders. The last of an old world, and ways that go with it.  https://t.co/2Sv2lz1ebF
1330761705627000833 2020-11-23 14:34:49 +0800 <Scearpo> They both know that they are lucky to be alive. That they are the pinnacle of a broken time for humanity. Their desires, their past, their secrets. They hold each other both in quiet contempt, pretending to be better than the people that were killed for doing the same things.  https://t.co/upiFJcURnp
1330761314084528130 2020-11-23 14:33:16 +0800 <Scearpo> These two parents watch their children run around in a field at sunset. They give each other a knowing look, of shame, of uncertainty. They reluctantly hold hands. These are the heralds of a new and powerful generation, the heralds of a new age of humanity.  https://t.co/tSzj0IcJWy
1330760674285416449 2020-11-23 14:30:43 +0800 <Scearpo> A young daughter asks her mother about the nature of love and boys. The mother receives mental bombardments of Tinder swipes, midnight blowjobs, and college hookups. She blinks and tells her daughter about the value of marriage, something which will carry down for generations.  https://t.co/YEtA8z63kF
1330760157769424896 2020-11-23 14:28:40 +0800 <Scearpo> But the parents keep many secrets. A son asks his father the value of labor when he wants to play. The father flashes back to a thousand memories of wasting his life playing video games and jerking off. He looks down and gives a response that will one day be carved onto stone.  https://t.co/3VchrGVreu
1330759717849870338 2020-11-23 14:26:55 +0800 <Scearpo> The children are wildly curious. They speak and act far differently than the parents could understand. Slower, more thoughtful. Better equipped for labor, happier in nature than the parents could ever be. They see their mother and father as mysterious members of a lost race.  https://t.co/UexVupq1Au
1330758841957539847 2020-11-23 14:23:26 +0800 <Scearpo> The same children, now adolescent. Helping rear a swathe of young siblings and babies. The mother has crows feet around her eyes and is on her 7th child. The fathers hair begins to gray. A 13 year old daughter is being taught what is okay and is not okay by her parents alone.  https://t.co/llJ2oxgOmr
1330758220131033088 2020-11-23 14:20:58 +0800 <Scearpo> As time passes by, villages crop up and a new way of life heralds the coming of a decent age for humanity again. No more cell phones. No more duck lips. No more ass implants. No more granulated sugar. The pioneers of an age of ration and reason, but who will raise them?  https://t.co/jy3ohsQJft
1330757619544371200 2020-11-23 14:18:35 +0800 <Scearpo> Two parents watch their children play in a vegetable patch that was once a Starbucks. They wear clothes made out of leather and wool. Their hands are weathered and blistered. They kneel down to hug their kids, wearing little homemade sacks and covered in dirt, wide toothed smiles  https://t.co/rMFHgG17IO
1330756795321737217 2020-11-23 14:15:18 +0800 <Scearpo> Modern society falls apart in a tidal wave of blood and destruction. Ruinous ash coats the landscape and a new generation of wildly different children is born. But who will raise them? Pretenders, people LARPing as the pillars of decency and chaste lifestyle for the sake of kids.  https://t.co/1AB5rDwmE9

1329863692708614144 2020-11-21 03:06:26 +0800 <Scearpo> How many times has this happened already? There's no way of knowing. One week ago you were a teenage girl working a grocery register Another day a dying old man The next, a 27 year old male nurse Then a 48 year old business man Then a stripper Then a car salesman It goes on...  https://t.co/RSGYl7Sdh5
1329863517269340161 2020-11-21 03:05:44 +0800 <Scearpo> Throughout your life, you occasionally run the risk of switching your consciousness with a moment of mutual eye contact with a stranger in a brief flickering window of opportunity. Gaining their memories and forgetting yours like a dream you woke up from Becoming them unknowingly  https://t.co/yTZLhJuM4s
1329863078578708481 2020-11-21 03:04:00 +0800 <Scearpo> You continue to cross the street,  fondling the EBT card and bus pass against each other in your sweatpants pocket as you make your way to a 7-11. Your cracked screen Huawei prepaid is vibrating constantly.  Your name is Travis,  you've always been Travis. Nothing changed.  https://t.co/EdGn5S71Zt
1329862794762743811 2020-11-21 03:02:52 +0800 <Scearpo> In a brief flash of cosmic trepidation you shake your head and forget what you were thinking about. You brush off that vision of a 9-5 commute air conditioned life as an overactive imagination. The person in the Mazda blinks and shakes their head.  What's their fuckin problem?  https://t.co/JdJkhDxeVk
1329862620602638340 2020-11-21 03:02:11 +0800 <Scearpo> Suddenly within that millisecond of mutual reflection and ponderance, you suddenly perceive his entire life's memories and he does yours. You blink and can visualize yourself standing on painted asphalt crosswalk lines, staring at yourself sitting in your Mazda. You see wide eyes  https://t.co/Ai0Ztjmg8t
1329862088907501574 2020-11-21 03:00:04 +0800 <Scearpo> He thinks the same about you. He thinks about gripping that polyester steering wheel and truly getting to decide where to go. He thinks about having to get up at 6 am every Monday through Friday and having bowls of fruit in a house. He puts himself in your shoes as you do for him  https://t.co/AYBDWyTYtk
1329861946343104513 2020-11-21 02:59:30 +0800 <Scearpo> In an instanteous moment of tangential lucidity, you think about his life. You put yourself in his shoes, thinking about walking out in the hot sun, thinking about the taste of Four Loko and cigarettes on your tongue. Thinking about bloodshot eyes and Yelling-Based communication.  https://t.co/fLhHr79dK5
1329861787831984128 2020-11-21 02:58:52 +0800 <Scearpo> Picture being stuck in your car at a redlight, a derelict homeless man steadily walks across as your eyes follow him from one side to the other. He shambles forward, clothes worn and greasy, hair in clumpy streaks, skin weathered, scraggly beard. He turns and locks eyes with you.  https://t.co/LIDiN1cvfe
1329861637441007619 2020-11-21 02:58:16 +0800 <Scearpo> There are pristinely quiet moments of mundane reflection that you encounter on your day to day errands when you are alone with your thoughts. An individual can cross your path during those moments, and if they too are in that same transient headspace, something eerie can happen.  https://t.co/F81fqFDskN

1329511905095004160 2020-11-20 03:48:33 +0800 <Scearpo> @LionBots I feel that fiction can help put people in a state of mind to reflect on real concepts. I'm glad you enjoyed some of this at least.
1329508593205469185 2020-11-20 03:35:24 +0800 <Scearpo> @interpolstan Today you have been a poet
1329504600706134022 2020-11-20 03:19:32 +0800 <Scearpo> This is a fraction of what has been hidden from you, a nebula of secrets compressed and displayed before you, the unknowing, unaware, and uninitiated. I could teach you to truly Open your Eyes but you would never dare desire it if you knew what it meant to truly See.  https://t.co/lXYphAPiQc
1329504288490606592 2020-11-20 03:18:18 +0800 <Scearpo> Every stray itch, or prickly feeling on the back of your neck is a gentle tickle from these Colossals, a trace sensation from a millisecond of them piercing through your skin and seeping in microscopic Cold Plasma. They are the Architects of every chill down your spine you've had  https://t.co/OpJdNJbu2o
1329504096139825155 2020-11-20 03:17:32 +0800 <Scearpo> Creatures of tremendous proportion float around in the Unrendered that you will never lay eyes upon. They are gargantuan, the size of stars. They shoot out tendrils from millions of miles away, tentacular ropes bespeckled by fractal eyes, stretching into hair width toward you.  https://t.co/km8wqWwLef
1329503916875276288 2020-11-20 03:16:49 +0800 <Scearpo> Further still is the fact that everything you are not looking at disappears out of existence, reappearing instanteously with the turn of your head, the shift of your peripherals. A cone of nothing constantly behind you, following you everywhere you go. Holding strange beings.  https://t.co/sNNjHq7rXP
1329503779343962112 2020-11-20 03:16:16 +0800 <Scearpo> These galaxy long beams of transient matter constantly shift and mesh, holding perfect direct perspective towards you to hide their true nature. You hug your friend, a hole is made just to fit your arm. You enclose a marble in your hand, its extension bends between your fingers.  https://t.co/gCxK4uZHDT
1329503619801116675 2020-11-20 03:15:38 +0800 <Scearpo> Suddenly you realize that everything within your field of view is actually a 42 million mile long object, a stretched out pole of gray matter, cyllindrically shaped as whatever you're looking at. You merely see the painted, textured end of it, its length hidden perfectly behind.  https://t.co/5zNadXFkyr
1329503413546196992 2020-11-20 03:14:49 +0800 <Scearpo> Soon you start to realize that distant objects on the horizon, mountainsides, skyscrapers, bridges, forests, all of it is completely two dimensional imagery Infinitesimally thin flat continent wide planes, optical illusions that materialize inch by inch seamlessly as you approach  https://t.co/G751pxokTt
1329503240573104139 2020-11-20 03:14:08 +0800 <Scearpo> If enough of these filters get ripped out of your head, you'll start to notice alternate entities that crawl around this world, ghosting through material objects, passing through the ground tangentially, ignoring gravity and context. Like a visual radio station between channels.  https://t.co/TAU7qcPCLq
1329503137787490305 2020-11-20 03:13:43 +0800 <Scearpo> Your brain is nice enough to do this for other dimensions beyond time. Raw vibrant aetherial energy pulses around you. It vibrates and throbs in patterns. Certain drugs lift this veil at great cost to your spirit, soulless AI programs built to interpret images can mirror it.  https://t.co/GOmOUVEdWg
1329502743141224454 2020-11-20 03:12:09 +0800 <Scearpo> Piecing together a series of rapid fire still images bit by bit. Immediately look at an analogue watch, at the second hand. Why does it seem to stay still for longer than a second as soon as you look at it? This is called Chronostasis, your mind processing the 4th dimension  https://t.co/SWWe8mjO0g
1329502605790371841 2020-11-20 03:11:36 +0800 <Scearpo> Further still is the psychospiritual imprint of everything. Several planes of existence and dimensions of reality overlayed upon our own,  like animation cells. Your eyes actually do pick these up but your mind chooses to edit this in post production in order to maintain sanity.  https://t.co/Qvhr7iXKOp
1329502371320369156 2020-11-20 03:10:40 +0800 <Scearpo> Such raw constant detail would give you an aneurysm sensory overload,  but if you could withstand and adapt to the information bombarding you, you would be able to gather the entire history of the universe just by looking at the patterns of any object you chose.  https://t.co/5KUJxmO1mO
1329502211018285056 2020-11-20 03:10:02 +0800 <Scearpo> Beyond the full scope of color on the electromagnetic spectrum, there are properties to the quality and refinement of our senses, dulled by lack of true necessity. Imagine being able to focus your eyes to distant galaxies or to the individual mites on the dead skin of your arm  https://t.co/PN0rZbgf1K
1329501989479342081 2020-11-20 03:09:09 +0800 <Scearpo> Color and light is a mere fraction of the full electromagnetic spectrum. So many cones of vision exist beyond the three that the human eye has alloted, tetrachromat reptiles, psychedelic kaliedescope mollusks, landing patterns on flowers for bees, magnetic fields visible to frogs  https://t.co/BBNZtf7PuI
1329501680963039235 2020-11-20 03:07:56 +0800 <Scearpo> There is an unseen massive world imprinted thousands of times exponentially over the layers of reality that God has granted you a mere smidgen of permission to view, a crack through a doorway. If you could truly, TRULY see all of reality it would astound and terrify you  https://t.co/pgbJEfbzFE

1329263557863673863 2020-11-19 11:21:43 +0800 <Scearpo> According to the interview, various global governments were competing in drilling further into the Earth or exploring deep sea trenches to find pathways and methods to traverse the ethereal plane in search of other possible Hollow Worlds. Possibly others have found us too.  https://t.co/g2Tl0mWFWd
1329263399692357632 2020-11-19 11:21:05 +0800 <Scearpo> Underground (outside of this hollow sphere) has no surface. It is an endless transition between dirt and stone into an ethereal plane that increases in hostile property until the laws of physics essentially break down. The trespassers were trying to attach explosives to a drill.  https://t.co/W8RTDOTkkL
1329263217290391565 2020-11-19 11:20:22 +0800 <Scearpo> The sun and moon are approximately the size of Australia, various planets varying between the size of Rhode Island and India. As you go "past" the solar system you reach microscopic levels very quickly, eventually down to nanometers beyond (within) the Milky Way.  https://t.co/9NG4hxGzcK
1329263068023566339 2020-11-19 11:19:46 +0800 <Scearpo> Space travel is quite real according to this theory,  not faked but rather misleading in perspective. The relative size of objects remains the same on the  "surface" but begins to decrease as objects pass beyond 1500 miles above sea level, decreasing in size exponentially.  https://t.co/BCGLGVsGid
1329262920891510785 2020-11-19 11:19:11 +0800 <Scearpo> It begins with accounting for the location of the heavenly bodies, rotating in conjuction with day and night cycles inside of this hollow sphere. This field of cosmos is contained within a Fisheye Accuity Field which bends our visual perspective to hide the other side from us.  https://t.co/qog7TzpW0z
1329262776292962305 2020-11-19 11:18:37 +0800 <Scearpo> The two subjects in question spoke of an alternate Earth conspiracy which outlined that the shape of the Earth was spherical. However the continents and oceans were on the inside of a hollow sphere, with the entire cosmos centered within. I present you to the Inverse Earth Model  https://t.co/OIsOtLPYyL
1329262582197334016 2020-11-19 11:17:50 +0800 <Scearpo> The following is a pieced together summary of a document accounting for a clandestine interview conducted by the United States Geological Survey in conjuction with local police of an unnamed County.

1329081776711471108 2020-11-18 23:19:23 +0800 <Scearpo> Instincts will make future humans to seek out mates that display particular gestures for no discernable reason. Females will seek to make their lips look huge or stick out their tongues. They, oddly, will not seek to stand out from competition but to display alongside their peers  https://t.co/KZNOfBYX2Q
1329080043767693328 2020-11-18 23:12:30 +0800 <Scearpo> In caves or dens, the future human will gather glowing algae or mold from plants and smear tiny dots on walls to glow at night. Without these little dots and blocks of light, it would be completely dark and they could not sleep as well.  https://t.co/8ErBQoAvSM
1329078794380996609 2020-11-18 23:07:32 +0800 <Scearpo> To ward off large groups of competitive packs without having to risk injury, displays of power will be signified by banging certain types of rock together to make a large CRACK sound, which reminds the human animal of a weapon which once was.  https://t.co/4TQqOqDbbC
1329078009790271488 2020-11-18 23:04:25 +0800 <Scearpo> The manimal vocabulary will be primal howls and grunts, but there will be detections of once prominent speech patterns, subtly nestled in the soundwaves of each utterance. Valley girl vocal fry tone in the cawing of a female in heat, the masculine BRUH of a male amongst males.  https://t.co/GYRDkp2lAO
1329076271549071363 2020-11-18 22:57:30 +0800 <Scearpo> The future man is conditioned to high levels of EMF and feels great discomfort without it. Packs of them gather around areas with high metallic deposits in the ground, magnetic valleys to make their nests. They feel safe in these places, familiar, comforted by them.  https://t.co/PhPSYnZQqM
1329075431723520010 2020-11-18 22:54:10 +0800 <Scearpo> Fruits and berries, descended from Designer Monsanto Plants, could evolve to fit the tastes of the future ascended man. Within their vines and stems. Stray chimpmen pick at apple like alien pods that taste of nacho cheese and pizza zest, or berries that taste of pure sugar.  https://t.co/1D8oeTmv1E
1329073065020387331 2020-11-18 22:44:46 +0800 <Scearpo> Hordes of these semisocietal males sort through piles of river stones, looking for the right rectangular shape. They bash them against boulders to thin them out and try to get the best symmetrical angular hand sized shape. These are totems, used to attract females through status  https://t.co/KxRpUze7gU
1329072217783615496 2020-11-18 22:41:24 +0800 <Scearpo> In some humid brush that was once a tundra, a gathering of bipedal future men hobble around a clearing to howl and point towards a strange double arch made of two bent trunks, perhaps fallen naturally or by lightning. The shape is oddly captivating and triggers a fierce deja vu.  https://t.co/DGjqOBaTXZ
1329071712315457539 2020-11-18 22:39:23 +0800 <Scearpo> Will our primal descendants create nests or dens? Will they furnish them through instinct, adding aesthetic motifs that lay trapped in our mind from years of furniture and decor? Were these aesthetic tastes once a product of some civilization or species before us?  https://t.co/XlTt6TD6tz
1329070985211899904 2020-11-18 22:36:30 +0800 <Scearpo> Consider predatory plants that seek to feed on future humanimals, seeking to bait them towards treacherous hydropneumatic pincers or chlorophyll tinted resin pool to drown and digest them, making high pitched whistling dings that resemble prehistoric cell phone notifications.  https://t.co/KYpvV29yDE
1329070193843134467 2020-11-18 22:33:21 +0800 <Scearpo> Imagine a shrew like creature with natural vibrant bioluminescence, flashing bright red and blue lights at omnivorous ape like predators and creating a siren like wail with its larynx. This combination of sight and sound triggers a deep ancient reflex of shock and flight.  https://t.co/Q6kbM8QrI5
1329069737347665928 2020-11-18 22:31:32 +0800 <Scearpo> Millions of years in the future, man will have devolved into a primal mammalian creature built for raw survival, with little to no trace of civilization. The Pavlovian reflexes built into our psyche by millennia long age of technology will become blood memories in our descendants  https://t.co/DbX6tCbJBB

1328783899829395457 2020-11-18 03:35:43 +0800 <Scearpo> @LangosMishima Sinister kidnapping programs that put young children in fake cities where they had to charm paid bimbos by giving them things. For example, the one dressed as a librarian you had to work 8 hours a day to afford to buy 75 copies of the same book to give her in exchange for a kiss
1328780419945394179 2020-11-18 03:21:54 +0800 <Scearpo> @tavsdrougs Buddy I don't even remember writing this

1328709115070255104 2020-11-17 22:38:33 +0800 <Scearpo> The common motif is intense levels of violence in enclosed spaces with gray backgrounds. These were produced independently in average by young males from adolescence to early 20s, most likely resulting from exposure to these tests. At the time, the internet wasn't as monitored  https://t.co/W3You1cAKK
1328708546045894656 2020-11-17 22:36:18 +0800 <Scearpo> The intent of the project was to develop an audio visual therapy for soldiers and law enforcement dealing with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after committing or being exposed to killing in the line of duty. The resonant effects of these tests leaked out on unmoderated platforms  https://t.co/p2efOjGVLc
1328707728630484993 2020-11-17 22:33:03 +0800 <Scearpo> The memories of this occurring were shuttled away through psyops conditioning techniques once the testing concluded.  The project was scrapped for unknown reasons. Many of you may have been subject to some of these tests. Many creations from that generation reveal trace instincts  https://t.co/K83TcjVPXg
1328707197556183043 2020-11-17 22:30:56 +0800 <Scearpo> They were subjected to brutal displays of violence. It's unclear by what means,  electronic footage,  performance actors with FX and make up,  animal slaughter,  or perhaps even live execution.  But once told to observe, they were immediately bombarded with a series of videos.  https://t.co/Sy5R3Ho1Ef
1328706771909812224 2020-11-17 22:29:15 +0800 <Scearpo> Under the subtext of field trips,  testing,  gifted programs,  and other means, children of age ranging from 7 to 12 were brought to black site facilities in testing rooms, usually metallic gray aesthetics,  tiled floor and walls,  drains in the floor,  labcoats.  https://t.co/BpL2x0VirU
1328706339540000769 2020-11-17 22:27:32 +0800 <Scearpo> A series of particular flash games from the early 2000s reveal a series of Youth Conditioning Projects that were carried out from 1989 to 1997 as part of a pentagon issued R&amp;D program for the psychology of violence.

1327494643622305792 2020-11-14 14:12:41 +0800 <Scearpo> The brain makes you SCARED because it's LOGICAL to avoid danger. The brain makes you NERVOUS because it's SENSIBLE to avoid conflict with others. The brain makes you MEDIOCRE because it's SAFE not to try. The brain makes you MASTURBATE because nothing except feeling GOOD matters.  https://t.co/AKf8xg981C
1327494526349553664 2020-11-14 14:12:13 +0800 <Scearpo> You are being held HOSTAGE by a JUNKIE that has the ability to CREATE more DRUGS at any time it chooses to. The brain on a surface level only understands physical sensation. The brain makes you fat because sugars and carbs taste good. The brain makes you lazy because work is pain  https://t.co/EBbrHJxAoS
1327494424151068672 2020-11-14 14:11:49 +0800 <Scearpo> There are intricate traps created by men that were really created by brains. Sinister pitfalls of systemization, categorization, encyclopedic indexes of factoid skullfuckery that drive you to insanity trying to grasp all of it, trying to master it, trying to make more and MORE.  https://t.co/Te8mufgpvo
1327494256978784257 2020-11-14 14:11:09 +0800 <Scearpo> Every time you THINK you are not really truly doing it from the pit of your soul, the raw consciousness of what makes you, You.    You are in fact being strapped into flesh goggles, letting something slimy and self serving take your body down the path of least resistance.  https://t.co/ebnhMjma85
1327494025365032961 2020-11-14 14:10:13 +0800 <Scearpo> Whatever the case may be, it's important to understand that the contradictory suffering you may feel from time to time comes from that duality of you, the idea that your physical form is sometimes at odds with your spirit.  This is because of a little parasite in your skull  https://t.co/ZhV6cJtf3T
1327493894632742913 2020-11-14 14:09:42 +0800 <Scearpo> You are not completely shut off from your Alternate Self. There is a part of you that is intrinsically connected to your body, a separate mechanism that thinks without the Brain, lives without your body, and communicates beyond your senses. Some would call it the soul.  https://t.co/3PLtqsxXU8
1327493773677441026 2020-11-14 14:09:13 +0800 <Scearpo> Ancient societies that were remnants of far more ancient hypersocieties had an inkling of understanding regarding the brain's role in human development. Egyptians would throw brains away to be picked at by birds while enshrining the heart and organs in sacred sarcophagi.  https://t.co/Nno7OFRg0O
1327493683353161728 2020-11-14 14:08:52 +0800 <Scearpo> This lead to a hostage situation where the brain, now in complete control over the bodily functions of the human, will immediately end the organ processes which regulate bloodflow, movement, digestion, sensory input, etc. Essentially the brain has a killswitch for you if it dies.  https://t.co/SrCsrbExDN
1327493575916064768 2020-11-14 14:08:26 +0800 <Scearpo> Over time the brains grew to infect more people and trap their form into corporeal state for as long as they could last. They spread out tendrils into all musculature and organs, soon taking over the processes for life and planting their seed in sperm and egg to reproduce with us  https://t.co/GlfakpznLP
1327493335792160773 2020-11-14 14:07:29 +0800 <Scearpo> The idea that someone could hurt, alter, manipulate, heal, or destroy another with ideas alone was a concept so alien to the proto-human it was unfathomable. A dark magic. The brain made this a grotesque possibility, through the use of language and symbols.  https://t.co/bPEcFNloch
1327493201788358657 2020-11-14 14:06:57 +0800 <Scearpo> When a symbol becomes manipulated, it manipulates the thought or idea that it is assigned to. Because of this imperfect malleable form of communication, no longer was the purity and consistency of thought maintained. Soon, brains found ways they could alter or attack each other.  https://t.co/IfMId6aHRt
1327493095123021824 2020-11-14 14:06:32 +0800 <Scearpo> The brains could never fully grasp the levels of connection that true humans could understand innately. More and more words had to be created to piece together ideas into more complex ideas. Furthermore, because symbols represented these thoughts, the symbols could be manipulated  https://t.co/5tx8BkvWwd
1327492937589141505 2020-11-14 14:05:54 +0800 <Scearpo> As the sounds began to grow more complex into spoken language, eventually the brains learned how to assign physical symbols through a visual medium. Thus the alphabet was born and with it the ability to save ideas and redistribute them. Yet all of this was imperfect communication  https://t.co/GvytmaGzcP
1327492853250084864 2020-11-14 14:05:34 +0800 <Scearpo> The brains within their flesh shells, trapping the human and taking control of their 3rd dimension vessel, would communicate with one another by creating symbols using different sensory mechanisms. They created a system of face muscle movement and posture at first, then sounds.  https://t.co/P5D589BkpB
1327492682529329153 2020-11-14 14:04:53 +0800 <Scearpo> Humans before the great Infection would communicate seamlessly through telepathy. A Thought or Feeling was perfectly transmitted to another, with the recipient experiencing it with 100% accuracy as their own. Brains did not have this, they had to use 3rd dimension tools instead.  https://t.co/61sSm2P1sA
1327492428727771136 2020-11-14 14:03:53 +0800 <Scearpo> Sensory perception was a curious past time of the beings that our species descended from. The parasitic organism generally chose the spot that was in closest proximity to the  most input/output points of sensory perception, in order to facilitate their use and communicate.  https://t.co/PFIUJNOBGO
1327492314441412609 2020-11-14 14:03:26 +0800 <Scearpo> They would find some orifice, usually the nose or ears, and bore pathways into where the current day skull center is now. Before this process, the human corporeal form was largely different in a way that would look grotesque to you now, a form chosen for recreational purposes.  https://t.co/skRkYtWuVY
1327492189404925957 2020-11-14 14:02:56 +0800 <Scearpo> Rogue brains which gestated small tadpole like creatures would latch onto proto-human forms while they were temporarily visiting 3rd dimension False Reality places on Earth. These tadpoles administered electromagnetic pulses which held this corporeal form long enough to infect.  https://t.co/w5K5h3USNN
1327492099114217474 2020-11-14 14:02:34 +0800 <Scearpo> Through some unforeseen conjunction with distant places in the 3rd dimension, a parasite which was almost completely based in physical reality. This known as the Brain. Human beings then were largely a structurally unstable creature that would oscillate between many forms.  https://t.co/MrNWS9rT6m
1327491981069737985 2020-11-14 14:02:06 +0800 <Scearpo> First we must begin with the brain. Long long ago, human beings were less corporeal and could vividly grasp the mechanisms of the False Reality we are now imprisoned by our senses to, and the Secret Reality that creates the mechanisms for things we would call magic now.  https://t.co/feZiMq10al
1327491912719327233 2020-11-14 14:01:50 +0800 <Scearpo> An incredibly sinister biological conspiracy has rendered you a simpering waiflike reed floating in the wind, trembling at every bit of new horrible "truth" that seeks to undo your very constitution and drive you mad. I'm talking of course about Thinking and why it's harmful.  https://t.co/NNPWF1FPRn

1327474414338895872 2020-11-14 12:52:18 +0800 <Scearpo> @ARIOSOPHY There is a distinct difference between a portly man who can sit with you and eat an entire pot of boiled eggs in one sitting like some village champion, devouring two meals in every restaurant, VS some flabby little grub who just eats Doritos and plays video games a lot.

1327460087531786241 2020-11-14 11:55:22 +0800 <Scearpo> A being of indiscriminate power comes before you and says you will be immediately rendered Indestructible and Immortal to the end of the universe and beyond. This being says you may choose to die right now. If you refuse, you'll get a 50/50 chance for death in 10,000 years.

1327015660476641280 2020-11-13 06:29:22 +0800 <Scearpo> @czartube Thank you!
1327012629844537346 2020-11-13 06:17:20 +0800 <Scearpo> You walk towards this pile of sand. Embedded within it is a small lump. Cautiously you paw as it and find a sprout. A legume of indeterminate species the size of your whole fist. A sapling grows from its broken shell. You look up at the full sun, moon drifting. You feel raindrops  https://t.co/AMu2osIqbe
1327011888719425536 2020-11-13 06:14:23 +0800 <Scearpo> Cracks appear as the hot sun grows, cursing away the dark oil and drying out the clay monster. It creaks and freezes in place, and then topples to its size, collapsing its whole form into crumbling filthy dirt. The sun soon comes out and cooks it back into sand.  https://t.co/c8vQPn0a5Y
1327010857470062594 2020-11-13 06:10:17 +0800 <Scearpo> It lumbers towards you, shaking the very earth with every powerful step, but the eclipse begins to wane. A sliver of sunlight blankets the world in its glow. As it crosses oceans to meet you, its light touches the goliath made of Nothing by beings from Nowhere. It starts to dry.  https://t.co/ZZWDcVw3Cs
1327009249432662022 2020-11-13 06:03:54 +0800 <Scearpo> As it stumbles forward in the complete midday night from its self imposed crater, the earthy contents of which now make up its ghastly constituency, it climbs out from the edge of the crater. On level land it towers over you, a faceless dark mountain built from nothing.  https://t.co/jBgBNNOL0F
1327009127097360386 2020-11-13 06:03:25 +0800 <Scearpo> In the dark purple light from the last sliver of sun left, you see that every shadow figure has been absorbed into this colossus. A dark sheen of liquid with chemical rainbow reflection is its skin, shining like an oil spill over a faceless titan. The golem takes a step.  https://t.co/ApFkZlTpVF
1327006687019077634 2020-11-13 05:53:43 +0800 <Scearpo> As the mass of oily shadow clay grows larger than a hill, it starts to pull in the figures uncontrollably like a tornado, sand along with it. This galestorm suction shakes the foundation of where you stand, but you fall on one knee and push fist to earth, resisting.  https://t.co/0zLLK57zDr
1327006175897001985 2020-11-13 05:51:41 +0800 <Scearpo> As these creatures pull towards this legion mass hive of collective sludge, they gutturally resonate as one, creating a powerful eardrum shattering hum that creates shaking vibrations in the sand and replaces the sound of the wind with a high pitched painful ringing in your ears.  https://t.co/jHsaq4N0q9
1327005745058111488 2020-11-13 05:49:58 +0800 <Scearpo> These figures pile all of the clay towards the center into a throbbing mass. They throw it on as it wetly smacks into an engorged blob, pulsing as they stick their oily hands in to mix it and homogenize it. Some slip right in and crawl to another size, boring orifices into it.  https://t.co/1yViIn4OuW
1327005096824156160 2020-11-13 05:47:24 +0800 <Scearpo> Some make little toy men out of the clay and give them life, having them scatter and fight one another. Some emerge victorious, some are slain. Sooner or later all of the clay falls and bleeds the oil. The shadow figures take all the clay and walk it towards a center.  https://t.co/xPQiEcJ1G5
1327004764937314311 2020-11-13 05:46:05 +0800 <Scearpo> They play with rocks, sand, clay, refuse, tumbleweed, bones. Whatever they can get their hands on, they rip apart into a thousand tiny pieces and crush into a fine powder, infusing it with a murky oil seeping off of their skin. They turn it all into clay, and shape that clay.  https://t.co/qfO8UGSKis
1327004421838999552 2020-11-13 05:44:43 +0800 <Scearpo> They entire desert is dotted with shadow beings rising out of the ground, often in large lumbering figures, sometimes sickly lanky figures 12 feet tall with tendrils, sometimes a horde of apple sized creatures scurrying in waves, sometimes snakelike. All shadows. All grotesque.  https://t.co/RMkQvBorWl
1327003821462216709 2020-11-13 05:42:20 +0800 <Scearpo> You stand, watching the sky grow dim as this giant moon shuts the eye of the sun, little by little the creatures climb from their cretaceous slumber, knowing wind and sky like a distant painful memory. They gather and seep foul oil into the sand and shape it as a grimy clay.  https://t.co/DCbi5NUEDv
1327003115565051911 2020-11-13 05:39:31 +0800 <Scearpo> These creatures are complete shadow, colorless as they live in a world without sight, completely silent as they live in a world without sound. Deep from within the bowels of the dead earth, from a no longer molten core that long since frozen over and become gray and lifeless.  https://t.co/D2SRwFiDIX
1327002770281476096 2020-11-13 05:38:09 +0800 <Scearpo> As the shadows come out and cease the burning light that turns the sandy floor of this dead world into steaming hot stove to burn all that walks bare soled, you see all manner of creatures and beings crawl out of the earth. Lumps in the sand rise up like grave walkers.  https://t.co/hVhM2t52qb
1327002323500081152 2020-11-13 05:36:23 +0800 <Scearpo> The world is a sunbleached sandpit, bare of green. You stand in an endless desert as a giant sun, far bigger than it should be, is eclipsed by gargantuan moon. Shadow crosses over continents at rapid speed. It is an eclipse of complete totality, darkening the sky itself.  https://t.co/Fw7V9164On

You're gonna be doing this by hand now.  https://t.co/yUg8p7QxX2
1325947652547219459 2020-11-10 07:45:29 +0800 <Scearpo> The entire car starts shaking as you pull  back a hand crank, propelling your vehicle forward with a jolt. Metal shutters shoot up, turning everything pitch black for just a moment until the screens pull up infrared light up displays where the windows used to be. Time to drive.  https://t.co/9554YoknrI
1325947481755181062 2020-11-10 07:44:49 +0800 <Scearpo> Merge lanes look like giant dog medical cones in a HUD VR display screwed into your skull every time you turn on your vehicle  They are the slope incline death ritual buildup that separates normal traffic from highway speed. You fly off from the masses of soccer moms and old folk  https://t.co/JFhuvM4F2d
1325947283188420609 2020-11-10 07:44:01 +0800 <Scearpo> These floating highways are about 200 meters in diameter about 5000 feet in the sky. Intercontinental, filled with cars going so fast they just look like pulsing tubes, laser beams. Sound dampeners keep the population from going deaf from the constant howling. Time to merge in.  https://t.co/7njquLQC9S
1325947203760820224 2020-11-10 07:43:42 +0800 <Scearpo> Cars can fly now. Highways are endless  tubes of supersonic streamlined turbulent cages spewing fire out the tail end, with tiny little people inside. Teeny tiny people in giant furious rattling machines built to shit on gravity. Blasting through the atmosphere ripping hot air.  https://t.co/enXFT9ijuD
1325800329502461953 2020-11-09 22:00:05 +0800 <Scearpo> @NgoloTesla There's no way a fervently pro gun constituent like Zardoz would vote Biden. Kinda sus tbh  https://t.co/P7nJYmQ5Sv
1325686783464660992 2020-11-09 14:28:53 +0800 <Scearpo> Hey do me a favor and take this package. In the backyard there's a tunnel that goes into this bunker.  Pretty cool right? Anyway there's some people down there right now,  can you take this to them?  You can do that right?   https://t.co/3tkj03c4Rb  https://t.co/c8rNmI740p
1325686223906742273 2020-11-09 14:26:40 +0800 <Scearpo> As you're almost at the bottom you see the men with dead eyes from before all staring up at you. You stop, one of them starts to climb up the ladder  You start scrambling up. You make it to the heavy manhole cover and start banging and screaming. It won't budge  He approaches  https://t.co/sZ9YG8RDmw
1325686066154774529 2020-11-09 14:26:02 +0800 <Scearpo> Very quickly you try and find your way back to the ladder. Through sheer miracle you discover a familiar set of halls and reach it. You climb your way up and just as you're within 5 feet, a large manhole cover slides over with a heavy clicking mechanism sound.   You climb down  https://t.co/Kn167yNOVO
1325685377072590848 2020-11-09 14:23:18 +0800 <Scearpo> They don't seem to be writing anything.  Just... scraping the pens back and forth like seismographs  You clear your throat, they all drop their hands to their sides and look at you. You become actually aware none of them have irises or pupils  You hand them the package I sent  https://t.co/xZg5GUM320
1325684614766194689 2020-11-09 14:20:16 +0800 <Scearpo> The men watch this abomination, strapped to a flat metal table, wriggling, waving around its stumps and head in circular motions like it's trying to swim. Its... "mouth" makes gurgling and hissing noises  The men are holding clipboards and haphazardly scribbling rapidly with pens  https://t.co/Z8SlFEdhoF
1325684377389568000 2020-11-09 14:19:20 +0800 <Scearpo> You come across a group of men watching a subject through a pane of thick glass. He has no arms, no legs, no face. Skin where his eyes should be, two holes where his nose should be, an anus like probuscis where his mouth should be. No ears, two swollen ear drums on his head.  https://t.co/TxTDrgMjt4
1325683806184083456 2020-11-09 14:17:04 +0800 <Scearpo> A labyrinth of corridors has ensconced you to alleyway dark spaces and UV light test cells with grotesque deformed men in black scrubs chained to walls by their ankles, eating some sort of slop out of bowls with their hands, if they have fingers that is.   Their eyes follow you.  https://t.co/VvDw8Y2ELB
1325683205488467968 2020-11-09 14:14:40 +0800 <Scearpo> Down in the Below is where the lights are fewer, and dimmer. The bright red is now a deep crimson, like coagulated blood. The angles of peoples faces make shadows, giving them a shape-shifting effect.  They do studies down here. Studies I hired them to do. They don't sleep much.  https://t.co/w0IAHAtni9
1325682993160196097 2020-11-09 14:13:50 +0800 <Scearpo> Eventually you get to the Ladder. A semi circle vertical round space with rusty metal bars sticking out. It seems to look endless, I promise it goes somewhere.  You look up as you descend, watching two heads peering down at you in a circle of light, smaller &amp; smaller as you climb  https://t.co/uCvMdRPf6r
1325682866852945921 2020-11-09 14:13:20 +0800 <Scearpo> If the people I hired let you in, they'll take you to get dressed. Everyone wears gray jumpsuits. Like mechanics.  Everything is about space. Mornings are wheat meal. Lunch is canned vegetables. Evening is "meat"  They're doing studies down there. Studies for me.  https://t.co/c8A04bYT8W
1325682617769975808 2020-11-09 14:12:20 +0800 <Scearpo> When you go down these metal steps in between constricting walls, about 14 to 25 feet down below, you eventually reach a large concrete tunnel.  Little lights welded into the ceiling, all red like the inside of a submarine. Two sealed doors, with a space in between for vetting.  https://t.co/PNgYI3K1Gs
1325682482306494464 2020-11-09 14:11:48 +0800 <Scearpo> When you go in, the front of the school bus is submerged by dirt. Windows replaced by welded metal, seats ripped out  The steering wheel and drivers seat has been gutted  The normal doors up at the front are removed, instead there's a lil staircase that leads down concrete halls  https://t.co/0aRFoXaqXq
1325682317428449283 2020-11-09 14:11:09 +0800 <Scearpo> There is a long mound in my backyard. About 3 feet high, 8 feet wide, and 20 feet long.  There is a hole at the end of the mound.  The back of a school bus with some steps to its door.  Did you know school busses are better for tunnels than shipping containers? Better reinforced.  https://t.co/qwnyjOE9JB

1325519326980476928 2020-11-09 03:23:29 +0800 <Scearpo> Without these chains I would bare all for the world to see, unhinged, unbroken, unstoppable. I am refracted into a bare slice of spectrum acceptable to man and building surrounding me. Sprinting, thrashing, screaming, undoing, unyielding.
1325519018619514907 2020-11-09 03:22:15 +0800 <Scearpo> Blessed be my clothes for they are my armor. Blessed be my hair for it is my herald.  Blessed be my shoes for they shield sole from Earth. Blessed be my watch, encapsulator and imprisoner of time. Blessed be my chain, shackler and protector from evil with pure silver and cross.
1325484611300958212 2020-11-09 01:05:32 +0800 <Scearpo> @kurabbu I refuse to believe anyone has real fun at barcades. Everyone that goes to one has real video games at home that absolutely rape your dopamine compared to whatever 80s shit is there. You're telling me you're THAT EXCITED to pay 8 dollars for some microswill while playing DigDug??

1325309397623562240 2020-11-08 13:29:18 +0800 <Scearpo> @Doonvorcannon It will become your new favorite. The Book of Five Rings is first and foremost a swordsman manual with philosophy fused in. If it were a bone with bits of cooked meat to suckle and pick at, the Hagakure is a juicy steak.
1325308592816332801 2020-11-08 13:26:06 +0800 <Scearpo> @Doonvorcannon If you want to get a hankering for Japanese samurai philosophy, I highly recommend the Hagakure by an 18th century samurai. It contains a powerfully cogent outline of the true samurai mentality and several stories such as a man being skinned and boiled alive in soy sauce.  https://t.co/DZsMrgOxJg

Ideas are bullets, this twitter is a strobe light MKULTRA audio torture room experience encapsulated into a pamphlet distributed by a sexy flight attendant with a smile.
1325105913590652929 2020-11-08 00:00:43 +0800 <Scearpo> Discovery and learning is actually life altering creation, the hand of God retconning physical reality in real time to adjust for endless human curiosity    https://t.co/qyVShWBe36  https://t.co/5HxMHjkZGh
1324827065900765186 2020-11-07 05:32:41 +0800 <Scearpo> Finally the cold overstays its welcome. You look forward to a day when air conditioning matters again. You resolve yourself to be more of a human being and carve out your future. Yet like some tragic Flowers for Algernon, the sun soon turns you into a fiend again. Maybe next year  https://t.co/5b5JHzj2Ky
1324826402785550337 2020-11-07 05:30:03 +0800 <Scearpo> This period of reflection brings back a swirl of memories from every fall and winter past, quaint moments spent outside with people you once cared about.  Transient as you are,  gone now,  or worse,  fat and disheveled. The past is bittersweet, the future is poetic.  https://t.co/ZT4z9FVOYF
1324825819978604544 2020-11-07 05:27:44 +0800 <Scearpo> Autumn lasts for three days while your tan fades and the first cold front freezes your tits off while some goober from Wichita brags about how it's not even cold as if you gave a fuck. You're happy you're not bloated and sweaty from a sun that spends 300 days a year hating you.  https://t.co/t2IAXgc2JA
1324824965762457600 2020-11-07 05:24:20 +0800 <Scearpo> All of it comes back to haunt you when you're shivering at Publix parking lot buying two for one smokehouse almonds and the sky suddenly got way too dark way too quickly.  You spend your nights blasting sad jazz and looking at turtlenecks on Amazon while on the highway for hours.  https://t.co/U2x6iqBZMA
1324823904322494464 2020-11-07 05:20:07 +0800 <Scearpo> You'd think you could get away with it. The drinking, the drugs, the neon sprinting, the 3am highway drifts on your Toyota Tercel. A complete and total abrupt shift from spitting in a prostitutes mouth to crying into her arms while she checks her Snapchat and runs down the clock.  https://t.co/b566SnJmhs
1324822993764274176 2020-11-07 05:16:30 +0800 <Scearpo> There is a strange conjunction that occurs in the mind of a Floridian when the weather turns cool. Insidious humidity has wrought havoc and turned him to a high velocity animal, built for impulse, untethered. For a brief time he is now human, filled with melancholy reflection.  https://t.co/AXocjw94FU

1324387927808479236 2020-11-06 00:27:42 +0800 <Scearpo> If civilization lost its infrastructure and became fucked beyond all repair, very soon the mystical elements of life would creep back into the world. As every source of electrical light dimmed and flickered out, the stars would return. And with them, the way things used to be.  https://t.co/Ndqy7gZuSx
1324387793544581124 2020-11-06 00:27:10 +0800 <Scearpo> Interconnecting the world with computers, cars, phone calls, planes, ships, all of this standardizes the mechanics of existence for everyone who is interacting with this system in some way. Yet it is all built on a fragile foundation of fuel and transportation.  https://t.co/qdVa9Pmvrc
1324387634106556421 2020-11-06 00:26:32 +0800 <Scearpo> This process is an infinite hamster wheel trap for the inquisitive and the Faustian. There will never be a complete answer for the nature of life &amp; the universe. As soon as you peer into that last missing puzzle piece hole, a thousand more puzzles hide within, recursive, endless  https://t.co/vAGTJPXp2w
1324387453730521088 2020-11-06 00:25:49 +0800 <Scearpo> This effect works for places too.

1324386998128381953 2020-11-06 00:24:00 +0800 <Scearpo> Vikings would grind bones into a dust they poured into molten iron to give their swords and axes the strength of the spirit of the animal. Contemporary science reveals this was a primitive form of steel due to carbon in bone dust. However, the former was true...  until it wasn't.  https://t.co/oPyBBeuPl3
1324386825885175808 2020-11-06 00:23:19 +0800 <Scearpo> Every time someone defies cultural norms in the pursuit of science, explores places nobody has discovered, invents a technology that allows us to dig deeper, see farther, look closer, and comb finer, new locations, energies, forms of matter, and entities are INSTANTLY created.  https://t.co/2CGGo2T2uO
1324386532501970947 2020-11-06 00:22:09 +0800 <Scearpo> There is a superposition for the mechanics of reality.

Things that have been hiding in dark places, kept away by light and companions. Things that don't like returning once they're here.  https://t.co/kgMq3x3eoo

But most of the time you instantly get the emergency reset button pressed when you're detected, immediately funneling all localized reality into a dream and waking up in a feverish sweat. What you have to worry about is the ones that slip through the cracks and stay
1322063104277172225 2020-10-30 14:29:41 +0800 <Scearpo> @helioslogos (10) I wrote the dream down immediately as soon as I woke up. Within several months, personal events transpired that aligned with what happened in my dream. Many years later, I discovered an album by the Blue Oyster Cult which bears striking resemblance to the Taker's robes.  https://t.co/eqFDysuLBa
1322062541695164416 2020-10-30 14:27:27 +0800 <Scearpo> @helioslogos (9) As I approached the walkway to the parking lot, the girl who's hand I held while running had yanked me back. I turned around and saw her holding a Taker's hand and walked off towards the water. I let go and started sprinting, exit in sight. Dream ended abruptly there.
1322062145446678529 2020-10-30 14:25:52 +0800 <Scearpo> @helioslogos (8) I saw Takers grab onto people's arms or shoulders. As soon as someone was touched, they immediately stopped and followed the Taker's off into some unknown place. Sometimes led by an arm on their back, sometimes holding their hands. From panicked to hypnotically docile.
1322061776482193408 2020-10-30 14:24:24 +0800 <Scearpo> @helioslogos (7) We watched them reach the shore and looked down to see dozens, hundreds slowly approach the sandshelf. Suddenly screams and panicked people running. Hundreds of the Takers were on our level of the beach on the higher sands. I grabbed the girls hand and started running.
1322061351229992960 2020-10-30 14:22:43 +0800 <Scearpo> @helioslogos (6) As I watched these rafts approach the shore, I noticed they all had the same stacks of suitcases, old books, tapestries, decorative rolled up rugs. The Takers all wore hooded robes, either in a muted green, dark navy blue, or deep crimson. With intricate patterns all over.
1322060827596304384 2020-10-30 14:20:38 +0800 <Scearpo> @helioslogos (5) Whatever it was, it pawed and reached up fruitlessly. I stood over the edge and peered down into its hood. No face, no head. Nothing. Just empty void. I looked out onto the horizon and there were thousands of dots of light piercing the fog. Slowly getting bigger.
1322060473186066432 2020-10-30 14:19:14 +0800 <Scearpo> @helioslogos (4) An older bald man with a beard interrupted hushed chatter and conjecture. "That's a Taker. They take you far away. If you see them, just run. You can't fight them, as soon as they touch you, you're done." Soon this hooded Taker made shore and walked up to the sand shelf.
1322060017634299905 2020-10-30 14:17:25 +0800 <Scearpo> @helioslogos (3) Out in the distance in the fog was a little ball of light. As it grew closer my perspective zoomed in (dream cinematography) &amp; observed a man in strange green ornate hooded robes on a raft filled with luggage, rolled up carpets, antiquities. Long pole with a lantern. No face
1322059497444179968 2020-10-30 14:15:21 +0800 <Scearpo> @helioslogos (2) My companion was a girl who was a constantly shifting amalgamation of every woman I had ever loved. We danced and she kissed me briefly. Soon the fire subsided and the crowd of jury duty tier samples of people all walked to the edge of this great sand shelf to stare out.
1322059135777689601 2020-10-30 14:13:55 +0800 <Scearpo> @helioslogos (1) At 17 or so, was at a late night beach bonfire with a strange crowd of diverse people, all races, ages. The sky had a full moon and the sand shelf (normally a product of tides that's about 1 foot high) was 12 feet high. Thick layer of fog out on the horizon to the sea.

1321337746666016768 2020-10-28 14:27:22 +0800 <Scearpo> @MacarthurMax Logic is a self contained system defined by people. Things like numbers and mathematics are a human invention, merely applied to the physical world around us with consistency.

1321320174679674880 2020-10-28 13:17:33 +0800 <Scearpo> @MacarthurMax If a being outside of our universe created our universe and all of the physical laws within it that govern the very fabric of logic, attempting to use logic to explain such a being or existence outside of our universe would be silly.  That's my take on it anyway.

1321314785225515009 2020-10-28 12:56:08 +0800 <Scearpo> It can be treacherously addicting to look at these and compare to real life examples, touting as proof were "LIVING IN A SIMULATION AAAAAHHH" but this postulation is unproveable and cannot be disproven. These concepts can be just as elucidating as to how we program to mimic life.  https://t.co/T44ygI2NIu
1321314312099631106 2020-10-28 12:54:15 +0800 <Scearpo> And if life were in fact a multiplayer video game, it would be implied that one day the player count would dwindle to nothing, leaving an empty world filled with nothing but programs and painted backdrops. One day shut off completely due to lack of activity.  https://t.co/bsifLuCFYx
1321313842773839872 2020-10-28 12:52:23 +0800 <Scearpo> If life were a video game, it would probably be multi-player (Rene Descartes might have you questioning otherwise) but the NPC meme betrays a human instinctual feeling that some people aren't "playing" the game, merely existing and going with a programmed flow.

1321312858215456768 2020-10-28 12:48:28 +0800 <Scearpo> If life were a video game, certain minor percentages of people would go out of their way to cause rampant chaotic destruction and disturb the natural functions and rules of the game over time, griefing as a natural compulsion, something for no reason at all beyond boredom itself.  https://t.co/3TeTPTmzsV
1321310868957790211 2020-10-28 12:40:34 +0800 <Scearpo> If we were in a video game, there would be some way to transcend the curtain of reality and input raw information somewhere to gain near omnipotent reality bending powers through a console command or cheat code.

1321310047562092544 2020-10-28 12:37:18 +0800 <Scearpo> If the universe were simulated, there would be a theoretical edge to how far humans could travel before being stopped. It would be a waste of space to generate actual matter beyond this point, anything past this barrier would be illusory. A mirage on a wall.  https://t.co/8LXtduH07Q
1321309355573215235 2020-10-28 12:34:33 +0800 <Scearpo> If the universe was simulated, environments would be a fragile shell of sensation, hiding a cold backdrop that runs the mechanics of interaction.

1321307904440414213 2020-10-28 12:28:47 +0800 <Scearpo> If life were a video game, the laws of physics would operate on a physics engine.

1321307465921765379 2020-10-28 12:27:03 +0800 <Scearpo> Human beings treat life as a game. Sometimes it's not fun to play, sometimes you're really doing badly, and sometimes it doesn't feel like it. But  we are playing a game with many ways to win or lose.  Now that we've established this, let's look at life as one of our video games.  https://t.co/qSdoYQNxxM
1321306729800499202 2020-10-28 12:24:07 +0800 <Scearpo> First we must take the immediate idea of a simulation being run off of some greater realm of existence, implying there is limitation.

1321142140479655938 2020-10-28 01:30:06 +0800 <Scearpo> Many believe that masks are necessary to stop disease and save lives.  Many believe this is theatrical symbolic control, a muzzle.  No matter your beliefs you must admit the transitive and otherworldly change you feel when all the world wears a mask. This much is evident.  https://t.co/mGqdAJDyGZ
1321141276775976964 2020-10-28 01:26:40 +0800 <Scearpo> Theater relies heavily on the properties of masks. The entire purpose of an actor is to assume the identity of another and gain their influence and innate symbolic powers for the purposes of good entertainment. Of course this carries heavy implications if used for purpose.  https://t.co/4ccUgQKYll
1321140594190798853 2020-10-28 01:23:57 +0800 <Scearpo> The hedonistic, the degenerate, the subversive wear masks too. When you engage in pleasurable or sexual activity, you are hardwired to fine-tune your senses and observe every detail of your partner. To wear a mask during such a time is to commit ultimate forbidden chemical ritual  https://t.co/X2izxRFZdX
1321139781989027841 2020-10-28 01:20:44 +0800 <Scearpo> Then there is the transmutation property of industrial or military masks. Mass produced for functional purpose, their identical appearances leads to a dehumanization automaton appearance, strange and powerful. You turn into a creature moreso than a person, built to work or fight  https://t.co/Na8OiCKuIa
1321139242400161797 2020-10-28 01:18:35 +0800 <Scearpo> Masks signify allegiance. There is a sinister quality to a mask worn to conceal identity. Especially for criminal pursuits. The mask hides not only identity, but intent. When you can be anything, you feel free to do anything. The sheer chance of violent outcome projected outward.  https://t.co/ZCUoKQ2awb
1321138632804225024 2020-10-28 01:16:10 +0800 <Scearpo> When you wear a mask you assume the identity of the subject. Sometimes you wear human masks to assume the form of another person, possibly famous or abstract, possibly beautiful. Possibly grotesque.  Animal masks imbue the properties of the animal onto your soul to aid your power  https://t.co/4zfxiQIo08
1321138180884701186 2020-10-28 01:14:22 +0800 <Scearpo> The simplest and most ancient mask is paint. Anywhere from smearing mud on yourself like a filthy animal to intricate powders and pastes with sophisticated designs.

1321137773563305985 2020-10-28 01:12:45 +0800 <Scearpo> A man shows his nature of the surface of his face.

1320177630130352130 2020-10-25 09:37:29 +0800 <Scearpo> @LandsharkRides Zoomer memes are inherently absurd because they are a byproduct of zoomers misinterpreting jokes but laughing out of social anxiety. As a result they develop a humor built around jokes that don't make sense. Ie, "me and my wife's son" cuck jokes turned into "me and my son" etc

1320093276058406914 2020-10-25 04:02:17 +0800 <Scearpo> @TenoryK Could take it one step further and livestream a game, inviting audience input when a Random Eldritch Event occurs. Any suggestion, no matter how absurd or facetious, can be applied and will have to be navigated by the player's contextual linguistic skill. Even the gay sex jokes
1320091474084663298 2020-10-25 03:55:08 +0800 <Scearpo> @TenoryK This sounds like the furthest extension of the implications of playing a normal tabletop game. The character's transdimensional soul (the player) can communicate with God (the dm) and if charismatic enough can open opportunities manipulating the reality of the universe (the game)

Imagine starting out and one mistake incinerates a 20 mile radius in a firestorm, and you must learn techniques to work up to making tiny sparks in your hand. This is the Alteration school, and the side effects include Soul Rot.
1320089740142673920 2020-10-25 03:48:14 +0800 <Scearpo> @TenoryK In Elder Scrolls lore, the magic school of Alteration has a peculiar and dangerous learning process. Initially, a pupil begins with the hard to control ability to completely rip apart reality itself, and must learn to work their way down to fine tune it to make small changes-

1319810737276112896 2020-10-24 09:19:35 +0800 <Scearpo> As his body sits broken and bruised, he cries. He silently sobs, bleeding on the concrete as Kanye forever leaves him. In a refraction of a teardrop he sees a face on a news story about JRE. In it, the tormenter. The face of who replaced him, the man who ruined his life.  https://t.co/jhdlvBvpkq
1319808442001989633 2020-10-24 09:10:28 +0800 <Scearpo> In complete Shakespearean dread, Jamie becomes homeless. He sits on the street covered in filth. By sheer chance Kanye walks through a small Texas town and passes in front of him. Jamie screams, "KANYE! IT'S ME!" Kanye flinches in disgust, his bodyguards beat Jamie mercilessly.  https://t.co/pbpXuj187N
1319808013428031488 2020-10-24 09:08:45 +0800 <Scearpo> Jamie recovers. Joe lets him know his services will no longer be needed.  "W-what?, W-whos go-"  "Gonna run the podcast? Kanye referred me to this new guy. I think it's best for both of us. Haha, maybe you can get into the shoe business or something"  It's... okay. Just a joke...  https://t.co/7smg4SbMf0
1319807173661249538 2020-10-24 09:05:25 +0800 <Scearpo> Jamie sits, Texas sky thundering.   Raindrops crashing against his window.   Listening to Kanye and Joe laugh with each other.   He coughs.  They banter with Jamie's replacement.  Joe makes a joke about Jamie being a "Kanye stalker"  Kanye jests it's probably better he's sick.  https://t.co/UaNRB5iurJ
1319806651554291713 2020-10-24 09:03:21 +0800 <Scearpo> Happy that his good friend Joe Rogan wouldn't do the podcast without his good ole buddy Jamie, his loyal helper Jamie. He sits back and checks instagram.... and is floored.  Joe is still going to do the interview with Kanye.   "We can't reschedule this bud, sorry 😕" From Joe.  https://t.co/Jp1sOw2XHH
1319806202398859264 2020-10-24 09:01:34 +0800 <Scearpo> Approaching the big day, Jamie gets a sniffle... a sick feeling down the back of his throat. He starts coughing. He starts hacking. No no no it can't be. It can't.. he orders a test.   It's covid. Jamie is bedridden. He texts Joe. Joe pauses the podcast. Jamie smiles. What a pal  https://t.co/LzU5OaW4yK
1319805372127916035 2020-10-24 08:58:16 +0800 <Scearpo> Soon Jamie hears of exciting news! Kanye, Jamie's hero, is doing an interview with Joe Rogan! KANYE WEST, gadzooks gee willikers! This'll be the best moment of Jamie's life! He prepares for it ritually, anticipating a great interview and chance to sit with Kanye for three hours.  https://t.co/2DpcoxTqhB
1319804686577356802 2020-10-24 08:55:32 +0800 <Scearpo> One day Joe partners with Spotify and wants to move to Texas. All of Jamies friends are in California. Everyone he knows, everywhere he loves going. His home, his life he built the past several years. But JRE is his life! He decides he must go move to Texas, leaving it all behind  https://t.co/ukClsuOtfB
1319803995595177985 2020-10-24 08:52:47 +0800 <Scearpo> Over time Jamie knows he has grown to be a good friend to Joe. They talk briefly after the show. One day Joe may even take up Jamie's offer for drinks! Sometimes Joe gets really mean, but that's okay! It's okay.... Jamie just needs to know his place  https://t.co/Z8SOYuktqi
1319803489225183233 2020-10-24 08:50:47 +0800 <Scearpo> Jamie has a minor voice on the show, an exciting prospect! He has the power to have his voice be heard by millions. His opinions don't quite line up with the audience or Joe's guests. And sometimes they poke fun at him, but it's okay, they're just jokes.  https://t.co/M8eCNYH9dK
1319802802164686850 2020-10-24 08:48:03 +0800 <Scearpo> As any good listener would know Jamie loves few things more than Kanye West. He listens to his music, he goes to his shows, he buys his expensive exclusive t-shirts, wears his expensive exclusive shoes. An obsession lightly poked at by Joe. But Jamie doesn't mind, it's just jokes  https://t.co/uIXzRu4fZg
1319802373234216960 2020-10-24 08:46:21 +0800 <Scearpo> As a man in his mid 30s, Jamie is nicknamed Young Jamie by his employer, publicly for thousands to hear every week, creating a childlike visage Yet he does not mind. He loves his jobs, he loves Joe, and he loves the money he makes. Everything is fine, this is just a playful joke.
1319801583429951494 2020-10-24 08:43:12 +0800 <Scearpo> I present to you a tale of complete and total tragedy on behalf of one Young Jamie Vernon. Usurper to Brian Redban, Jamie is the ever silent professional to Joe Rogan: a media legend and defining voice of the 2010s, Jamie sits forever in Joe Rogans shadow, laboring for the show.  https://t.co/A1d3s2bRaN

1318702329240190981 2020-10-21 07:55:10 +0800 <Scearpo> You fire the cannon at the visualized image of her; 17 miles away your wife's eyes start rolling into the back of her head and she collapses onto the floor crying blood as her body activates an ancient forgotten function and self-liquifies its organs.

1318701924397481985 2020-10-21 07:53:33 +0800 <Scearpo> In order to prevent User Error or intentional sabotage, the operator would have to be heavily vegetabilized and brainwashed through intense chemical hypnotherapy shock treatments to control their targeting by committee.

1315101081240821760 2020-10-11 09:25:05 +0800 <Scearpo> @helioslogos Yes.  The World is one big game of Calvinball to you and you're just blowing the fuck out of every Suzie Derkins who tries to impose themselves on you.
1315099570041434112 2020-10-11 09:19:05 +0800 <Scearpo> @helioslogos You suddenly make much more sense

1315067633943932928 2020-10-11 07:12:11 +0800 <Scearpo> Planet Weimar: Public schools distributing  iPhone augmented reality contact lenses to kindergarteners on their first day. Fast forward two weeks and your 5 year old daughter (formerly son) is twerking on OnlyFans as an extracurricular credit in between African Holocaust classes.  https://t.co/PYC7IfZwFt
1314992325303640074 2020-10-11 02:12:56 +0800 <Scearpo> @Boreal_Gael Men Who Stare At Goats
1314808461503401984 2020-10-10 14:02:19 +0800 <Scearpo> I am. I dream. Illusory dreamlike entities I create, dimensions spring forth. I string together space and time, and all within. Each and all, a specter of myself. Everything you ever knew to be, is me, and I am you. You will die and meet me, returning. I am cheesed to meet you.  https://t.co/KgPLXTtfFl
1314751164882341888 2020-10-10 10:14:39 +0800 <Scearpo> @sellyourcloaka1 The question of plate carriers depends entirely on whether you intend to maintain in an urban environment or if you choose to retreat into wilderness, where travel weight and concealment takes precedence.
1314750774346428417 2020-10-10 10:13:06 +0800 <Scearpo> @NOIDWARE Whenever the universal vibrations which tilt the fortunes of man send ill events or transpirations down your path, you can dispel malevolence out with a simple verbal chant: SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEET
1314749009370718209 2020-10-10 10:06:05 +0800 <Scearpo> @SUNSETYELLO @LandsharkRides Imagine the highs and lows, complete fearful despair, absolute relentless survival, profound marvels, glorious violent conquering, and grand completion that a fly feels. Juxtaposed between familiar nature and eldritch unfamiliar human architecture, in the entire day of its life.
1314546375040864258 2020-10-09 20:40:53 +0800 <Scearpo> @DarkerCarpet Thank you, I was mistaken.
1314414665666093058 2020-10-09 11:57:31 +0800 <Scearpo> I use movies as an example because I am most familiar with them and they arguably have the largest effect on the population. But all media you consume does this. The music you listen to, the books you read, the games you play, even paintings you like. Be aware of what you consume  https://t.co/sU9GT3pe0A
1314414541124644865 2020-10-09 11:57:01 +0800 <Scearpo> Someone materialist or close minded may reflexively cringe at the idea of "magic" but keep in mind that a magician is primarily an illusionist, someone presenting to you a carefully crafted lie to trick you into believe something which is not. This is the crux of creation.  https://t.co/U7DMgxs0hP
1314414421289115650 2020-10-09 11:56:33 +0800 <Scearpo> Movies time and time again have "predicted" events or trends coming true over time. Yet when you have a nation that essentially worships entertainment, you have an entire country of people unwittingly participating in magic rituals which creators have sway over the direction in.  https://t.co/fQHFCPDjSm
1314414277231628288 2020-10-09 11:55:58 +0800 <Scearpo> However there is a twin effect of manifesting reality through imitation of it. Many of you may understand the power of positive visualization. Now imagine if you had a specific outcome of events you wanted to come true, but you had hundreds of millions of people to visualize it.  https://t.co/K4BTKwBgCu
1314414148961398784 2020-10-09 11:55:28 +0800 <Scearpo> The most prominent example is Preventative Theater, practiced by the Native American Iroquois Huron and Seneca tribes in the northeastern United States. They would wear masks and imitate their dreams in order to satiate them, lest they be struck by disease or misfortune.  https://t.co/XgcreE725k
1314414050487480321 2020-10-09 11:55:04 +0800 <Scearpo> Imitation of an event in a particular manner can prevent an event from occurring. Imitation of an event can also ensure this event WILL happen. The differing outcomes involve a ritual magic symbolism unknown to the average person. But examples of this magic are present in history  https://t.co/FJrkLdAhIX
1314413946997215238 2020-10-09 11:54:40 +0800 <Scearpo> This serves the purpose of acclimating the population to the preposterous nature of some escalation in their society or tragic event, lessening their eventual reaction to a familiar malaise, rather than a natural human unpredictable backlash. But there is also a magic purpose...  https://t.co/rmEhsLwc6W
1314413764444409857 2020-10-09 11:53:56 +0800 <Scearpo> The secret purpose involves a degree of mysticism but it is the Sacrifice of Revelation. Sometimes a work of art will eerily predict a major event or trend occurring years or decades later, long after the media is forgotten from public consciousness.  https://t.co/5IIlggGfAm
1314413624379822090 2020-10-09 11:53:23 +0800 <Scearpo> The final manipulation may even be accidental but it serves a valuable purpose for media manipulation: Acclimation to Mediocrity. By movies, books, music, and video games becoming shittier over time, younger audiences adapt a taste for mediocrity, making media easy to produce.  https://t.co/Q5fWOGDWNv
1314413483430219777 2020-10-09 11:52:49 +0800 <Scearpo> Furthermore, you will see characters who are painted as antagonistic, but because they are played too well, written too well, or simply the truth of what is trying to be villainized shines through the manipulation, they become fan favorites and are accidentally emulated sometimes  https://t.co/WMoJoWbunT
1314413359215804420 2020-10-09 11:52:20 +0800 <Scearpo> This manipulation has become brazen and unsubtle, due to mediocrity from nepotism in writer's rooms in Hollywood and elsewhere. But it was always there. Whenever a character is given aesthetic imagery, calm demeanor, and good tone while doing horrible things, that is programming.  https://t.co/PCo68OpXR0
1314413234095521798 2020-10-09 11:51:50 +0800 <Scearpo> The extent of propaganda in entertainment is as old as entertainment itself, especially film. Hidden messages in movies serve an open purpose and a secret purpose, spoken in different languages on screen. The open purpose is manipulation of the public consciousness.  https://t.co/khcrmyJrye
1314413137966362624 2020-10-09 11:51:27 +0800 <Scearpo> Mass manipulation has given way to a less theatrical but more reliable form of idea propogation: Repetition. While not as impressive as the theater screen, your TV’s, laptops, and phones enjoy a relentless barrage of content from Digital Streaming Services.  https://t.co/TjPQggWFeq
1314413017635983361 2020-10-09 11:50:58 +0800 <Scearpo> Edward Bernays, brother of Sigmund Freud, and considered the pioneer of propaganda, once wrote that the relative size of an image on a screen correlates to the viewer's impression and influence. This is why movies in theaters will always seem better than on a TV or your phone.  https://t.co/NTukTZwgOx
1314412876698972162 2020-10-09 11:50:25 +0800 <Scearpo> Through the process of imitating something, you mantle its essence and temporarily possess the authority and image of whatever you imitate. The talent of the imitator, guided with sensory manipulation (special effects) can create a living god on a screen.  https://t.co/wVmO2Hh0Yl
1314412749158600705 2020-10-09 11:49:54 +0800 <Scearpo> Ancient Romans understood the dangerous power of imitators. They would praise actors on stage yet when they walked the streets, they would spit on them and throw rotten produce at them because they possessed the means to overthrow social order. A powerful and correct assertion.  https://t.co/XOYg4vJs2X
1314412645165006848 2020-10-09 11:49:29 +0800 <Scearpo> Now that one has established the necessity of an altered state to reach the aether of creativity from which one must pull an idea, now we reach the implications of imitation and its consequences on the audience. We will begin with theater.  https://t.co/OcXW3mNpV1
1314412523018506241 2020-10-09 11:49:00 +0800 <Scearpo> The fundamental process for creating something great need not include drugs whatsoever. Stanley Kubrick was adamantly against doing drugs. Roger Waters never once took drugs while the leadman for Pink Floyd, entirely because of watching Syd Barrett fall apart on narcotics.  https://t.co/mWAq9kVWr1
1314412182604570625 2020-10-09 11:47:39 +0800 <Scearpo> Philip K Dick wrote A Scanner Darkly as a true story about how he depersonalized addicted to amphetamines. The best albums from the Beatles are thanks to doing LSD. Hemingway was a drunk. Scorsese was a coke addict. Drugs are NOT the only way to reach this state however.  https://t.co/MMlNiMh155
1314412035246108672 2020-10-09 11:47:04 +0800 <Scearpo> Stephen King’s best books were written when he was a cough syrup abusing drunk. Apocalypse Now was filmed in a nightmarish jungle cocaine haze. Michael Kirkbride went missing and was found in a trailer naked with a bottle of whiskey and cigarettes high on peyote writing Morrowind  https://t.co/eYePLwPGAE
1314411887472279557 2020-10-09 11:46:29 +0800 <Scearpo> Drugs are not a magical secret to becoming talented. Mediocre people become even more insufferable and mediocre when they are high or drunk. But the exceptionally talented, with chemical assistance, have produced some of the greatest works of art you yourself may have enjoyed.  https://t.co/bOrXFGcAVE
1314411755641221122 2020-10-09 11:45:57 +0800 <Scearpo> Mileage may vary, each creator that has excelled at this has had personal issues stemming from the consistent altered state they put themselves in, sometimes leading to their death, or worse, their loss of an ability to create something exceptional.  https://t.co/Q9IKloWq7p
1314411478280216577 2020-10-09 11:44:51 +0800 <Scearpo> And thus we reach the Soul Imprint. Any creator of an idea must translate the raw abstract energy from the idea he has borrowed from this aether and translate it into something comprehensible to many. Through sacrifice, he rips a piece of himself away to bring it into being.  https://t.co/O3tb9hbqBq
1314411379210752006 2020-10-09 11:44:28 +0800 <Scearpo> Some of the greatest artists, musicians, and writers have an innate ability to tap into this zone and pull out ideas. These ideas are NOT an internal creation, rather a telepathic communication to a vast aether of ideas which humans can barely comprehend in such a state. A muse.  https://t.co/USDCNXoseh
1314411211295985664 2020-10-09 11:43:48 +0800 <Scearpo> Athletes have their own version of this mindset (in the zone) but for a creator, there are many ways to achieve it. The most common "easy path" is through the consumption of narcotics, alcohol, hallucinogens. The "hard path" is a very personal process nobody can explain for you.  https://t.co/Kv5kxJqzb9
1314410494980128768 2020-10-09 11:40:57 +0800 <Scearpo> Sacrifice is the pendulum which swings the fate of outcome for all mankind. Every single beneficial thing that has ever happened to you is because of some sacrifice, whether it be literal or minor and banal. The Sacrifice of an Artist is rooted in an altered meditative mindset.  https://t.co/660fbKVrKB
1314410348133351430 2020-10-09 11:40:22 +0800 <Scearpo> In order to do this purposefully in a direct manner, you must first have some degree of talent in what you are doing, then you must be experienced through much hard work and repetition until you've mastered your craft. Then comes the hidden esoteric magic of creation: Sacrifice.  https://t.co/bdwMRcN9ho
1314410184698101760 2020-10-09 11:39:43 +0800 <Scearpo> Creators of ideas to be consumed, say you draw pictures or have a SoundCloud. Perhaps you make YouTube videos or write fanfics. If so you may be wondering how you can excel at creating something that leaves a permanent mental, spiritual, and physical change to your audience.  https://t.co/VOyLdoUg1T
1314410022256947200 2020-10-09 11:39:04 +0800 <Scearpo> This transmogrification is a known and obvious symptom of actual physical consumption (you are what you eat) but not as well known or documented in regards to how the things you watch, read, listen to, play, and enjoy all alter you in serious ways over time.  https://t.co/Cng3keqI7n
1314409906196316161 2020-10-09 11:38:36 +0800 <Scearpo> The same applies to fans of any particular band or movie. Why do we attribute common stereotypes to Jimmy Buffet loving boomers or call Marvel fans soyboys? Their distinctive features come from imprint through consumption. These internal changes lead to secondary physical ones.  https://t.co/s5f47WT2sP
1314409775967465472 2020-10-09 11:38:05 +0800 <Scearpo> Especially talented creators will sacrifice a piece of themselves towards their creation. If they align themselves with their work especially well, you will notice a distinct personality change in yourself when consuming the medium and in others. Think about who listens to TOOL.  https://t.co/fuTkVQcTXH
1314409660514959361 2020-10-09 11:37:38 +0800 <Scearpo> Today we will be looking at several mediums of art and entertainment, namely movies, books, and music. All art, information, and entertainment is propaganda. Even if it is aimless and unintentional, all art and media has at least a trace of imprint from its creator.  https://t.co/TlFwva9iyT
1314409555363803137 2020-10-09 11:37:13 +0800 <Scearpo> Through cooperation, each person aligned with a particular idea set in motion is a force multiplier, adding exponential potential towards altering reality in line with the idea. The most efficient way to distribute an idea usually attacks two senses, sight and sound. Thus media.  https://t.co/WFyvppFH2M
1314409405920743424 2020-10-09 11:36:37 +0800 <Scearpo> Ideas do not directly influence reality. Your hands do. Your actions shape the physical world around you. However, an idea, communicated with a proper utilization of the senses can alter your mind and heart, the driving force behind your hands.  https://t.co/MSCGO7aSPQ
1314409153683771392 2020-10-09 11:35:37 +0800 <Scearpo> Art is a fundamental tool and weapon to the minds of its audience. Through altering the senses and imitating reality, one can manipulate reality itself. This is a powerful alchemy which has consequences to both the consumer and the creator. We will begin with perception:  https://t.co/5o9BVckmx1
1314361373875408896 2020-10-09 08:25:45 +0800 <Scearpo> @martymoogle @lunch_enjoyer Imagine the fundamentally harmful disheartening message this provides to people who so far have utilized the placebo affect to curtail minor mental illness symptoms. Psychologists want you constantly in a state of repair, neutered and crippled, begging for drugs.
1313587181999607809 2020-10-07 05:09:24 +0800 <Scearpo> The world's most powerful military is a Bluetooth mechazoid missile launching platform powered by African transvestites fed exclusively on freeze dried lunchables and candy  https://t.co/5zPBfhYJoG
1313465269248053250 2020-10-06 21:04:57 +0800 <Scearpo> @LandsharkRides Problem is when you get too good at it. Your descendants get acclimated to a 12,000 daily calorie diet and need 900 grams of sugar a day for their kidneys to function properly. Soon as society collapses and we're living off yams again, their eyes start bleeding and they're feral
1313295926837096449 2020-10-06 09:52:03 +0800 <Scearpo> @naturalhooch The Tavor is a tremendous little touch. If you ever go on /r/guns, basically a shallow cesspit of dork men making bing bing wahoo gamer keyboard rainbow light colored cabinets that open very slowly to reveal a "wall" of the only 5 guns they own, Tavor at the foremost.
1313184605080608768 2020-10-06 02:29:42 +0800 <Scearpo> Ancient hypercivilizations stored several planets worth of their physical belongings in personal pocket dimensions. This material cloud storage will accidentally be rediscovered by us, subsequently leading to the Earth imploding when we accidentally withdraw everything at once.  https://t.co/txi7ac5Cjw

1312987704838283265 2020-10-05 13:27:17 +0800 <Scearpo> Somewhere dingy and humid, a gristled day drinking fiend focuses his bloodshot eyes on a ceiling fan flacidly spinning in a cheap motel.   It is 2pm and he has finally shed his last connection to humanity.  He stands naked from his bed, a silhouette shadow facing the sun.  https://t.co/h0wTul1Mbf

1312650849605300225 2020-10-04 15:08:45 +0800 <Scearpo> However, categorizing each of these common intuitive experiences as part of one grand unseen system is something suppressed and derided. Yet the truth of the nature of it cannot be fully concealed and reveals itself in the words we choose to describe this phenomenon.  https://t.co/QIMRsNn70J
1312649830653714433 2020-10-04 15:04:42 +0800 <Scearpo> These are ideas readily accepted by literally everyone as separate concepts. The idea that there are underlying vibrational frequencies to everyone, which are manifested and manipulated on an emotional level, and through perception, all of it, is something everyone has accepted  https://t.co/YrQq54K1i1
1312649279639613441 2020-10-04 15:02:30 +0800 <Scearpo> You already knew all of this.   Full moon tonight, people are crazy This guys got bad vibes That place gives me the creeps I always feel so cozy at grandmas house Open campfire hypnotism 2pm lethargy Rainstorm relaxation Dried up relationships Time flies when you're having fun  https://t.co/cx4ix8YBTp
1312648254585221121 2020-10-04 14:58:26 +0800 <Scearpo> Physical objects with residual buildup, usually through multiple sources over time, can provided a more focused source, but they have a high possibility of being destroyed or tainted without precautions from outside factors ie being destroyed or tainted by powerful emotion events  https://t.co/UiBJJlhdZN
1312647663582695426 2020-10-04 14:56:05 +0800 <Scearpo> Sources of energy can be given residual imprints over time, strengthening their output like an overcharged battery. Objects less subject to alteration, with longer historical repetitive association with others tend to be more powerful, the most potent being celestial bodies.  https://t.co/jGs7whl3g4
1312647139214884864 2020-10-04 14:54:00 +0800 <Scearpo> Especially magnetic relationships can result in an unstable feedback loop which could result to changing incompatible frequencies at high velocity. Generally slightly less powerful energy is considered more stable but also less fulfilling.  https://t.co/EbFSGWjI02
1312645978885967872 2020-10-04 14:49:23 +0800 <Scearpo> Emotions are a both a symptom and cause of altering energy sources to alternate frequencies. Like two ripples in a pond intersecting and altering one another. Sexual interaction is one of the most powerful change in frequency and source or desiccant of energy output.  https://t.co/0d7R9YvRCS
1312644974240989184 2020-10-04 14:45:24 +0800 <Scearpo> Personal energy given off by people is part of an interconnected economy of energy, neutral sources, powerful suppliers, and unintentional leeches. There is also tainted energy from insidious sources of people. Usually the face reveals emotional frequency, but it can be hidden.  https://t.co/TnkPr2pSNx
1312643233911107586 2020-10-04 14:38:29 +0800 <Scearpo> Powerful experiences can alter and taint sources of energy,  particularly large ones such as locations. Sensory experiences can be employed to purify energy sources.  If a source cannot be altered from a negative frequency, its destruction will cease the energy altogether.  https://t.co/NJiaIvdVQe
1312641279361253376 2020-10-04 14:30:43 +0800 <Scearpo> Energy sources can be revitalized over time, with breaks.  They can also be altered and revitalized through change.  Physical change to the source itself, or personal change.  Rearranging personal perception through willpower can change your "bandwidth" to get different energy  https://t.co/JUhuxK3uhn
1312640547622924289 2020-10-04 14:27:48 +0800 <Scearpo> This source of energy,  whether it be a new hangout spot,  a fresh relationship,  a recent gift,  is used up in the process of speeding up your time. When the energy is drained,  time will begin to slow. Personal emotional value feedback trickles to a drip.  https://t.co/YIThvGEp07
1312639598879805440 2020-10-04 14:24:02 +0800 <Scearpo> Every object, person,  and location has a specific radio bandwidth of energy coded for you and only you.  The fresh curious sensation you feel when something is new to you is hitting a fresh ore of this energy.  Familiarity and boredom is you having drained rid energy source.  https://t.co/OjmNPtmdMA

1312471430726995968 2020-10-04 03:15:48 +0800 <Scearpo> Everyone knows that who you personally kill in life becomes your slave in the afterlife.

1312263449502720003 2020-10-03 13:29:21 +0800 <Scearpo> @EntrepreneurVyl Don't forget the mystical Kykeon, a concoction made of moldy barley (ergot Proto-LSD) at the culmination of a ritual fast which was part of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Drinking it would produce potent hallucinations and bond you to the other ritual participants for life.

1311801712739602434 2020-10-02 06:54:35 +0800 <Scearpo> Beware of the little pocket wormholes that hide in your carpet. These slipgates operate in clandestine fashion, only taking small objects. They require split second events, as they are activated by motion and lack of observation. If you've ever dropped something and it's gone....  https://t.co/eCKL5mQBoE
1311150740904251398 2020-09-30 11:47:51 +0800 <Scearpo> All five stages are mandatory in the scope of determining the superior of two men. A society built on a foundation of this competition will lead to a race of super human psychic warriors, with architecture made of hard light and time wizards who sing in mathematical poetry.  https://t.co/DrwhsUvbTe
1311149592315035648 2020-09-30 11:43:17 +0800 <Scearpo> Stage Five Lovemaking: Two identical twins with similar sexual history will provide the most baseline comparison for each opponent to make love to and compete in the art of pleasuring another with skill. Finally after 3 sessions each, the opponents will make love to one another.  https://t.co/LI810ohZeZ
1311149110431559682 2020-09-30 11:41:22 +0800 <Scearpo> Stage Four Cagefighting: Violence is the supreme authority from which all authority is derived. It nullifies even the greatest speech in the soul of a man's core. Engaging in physical combat and succeeding at it is the single most important factor in the validty of ones existence  https://t.co/e8Xdl39Yhu
1311148641772601344 2020-09-30 11:39:30 +0800 <Scearpo> Stage Three Rap Battle: Having knowledge is little use if you cannot apply it swiftly and effectively when the situation demands it. Two opponents must rap battle roast each other to display their creativity, ease in the face of mockery, their tempo, and their rhythm.  https://t.co/LbtSF6Lwkm
1311148168223096832 2020-09-30 11:37:37 +0800 <Scearpo> Stage Two Socratic Debate: This is already in place, a foray into the cogent nature of one's argument, the validity of his beliefs, and the capability for him to present evidence to support his position. We already do this, it's just not enough. But it's still necessary.  https://t.co/aKjGLasBug
1311147781357273099 2020-09-30 11:36:05 +0800 <Scearpo> Stage One Staring Contest: The composure and mettle of a man's will can be determined by the focus of his gaze in the eyes of his enemy. The samurai did it, Mike Tyson did it, now we'll too be unblinking in the precipice of battle. The two opponents must stare without blinking.  https://t.co/zqcGuKIhW3
1311147222264885248 2020-09-30 11:33:52 +0800 <Scearpo> The modern debate is an incomplete tool for gauging the righteous victor in battle of wills between two men. I present to you a duel for the future, a Five-Stage Tournament for two opponents: 1: Staring Contest 2: Socratic Debate 3: Rap Battle 4: Cagefight 5: Lovemaking  https://t.co/6cUl8US3O4

1310453509939171328 2020-09-28 13:37:18 +0800 <Scearpo> The priests wander to this day, spreading their gospel of doom. Their members are adopted deformed orphans, sent away from villages. Their grotesque form serves as a warning to prevent future wanders from cursing their own children.  If you see a spiked field, stay far away.  https://t.co/iP7oXXY5lm
1310451268532539395 2020-09-28 13:28:24 +0800 <Scearpo> These same sorcerors knew man's infinite curiosity could overpower even the strongest fortresses so they also created the priesthood to help keep this warning alive, lest any man should dig into the cursed earth and unleash the virulent death, killing crop and man alike.  https://t.co/sd8Wp8UUtc
1310449988175101952 2020-09-28 13:23:18 +0800 <Scearpo> The Great Ancestors learned of cursed stones this demon left behind in his wrath. They sought the advice from a council of sorcerors. These sorcerors sealed the cursed gifts and buried them in magical tombs to shield their descendants from the demons anger and vengeance.  https://t.co/xnv5Mdnoxd
1310449166766800896 2020-09-28 13:20:02 +0800 <Scearpo> The tribesman asks the monk for an explanation. He tells of how the Great Ancestors found a great demon that wrought flame and wind unto the earth, leaving behind a poisonous curse. This demon was called "nuh klee urr" and man in his arrogance tried to tame it for his own use.  https://t.co/M26w0gEmdH
1310448200424321026 2020-09-28 13:16:12 +0800 <Scearpo> Soon after, a monk from a distant monastery proclaims himself to be an "Aht-ahm-ik priest." They speak of a demonic substance buried by ancient ancestors. They live in solitude, taking mission trips to find these cursed lands and create monasteries nearby to ward off passerbys.  https://t.co/PnXE0GlRe3
1310446962899116032 2020-09-28 13:11:17 +0800 <Scearpo> He reads the incantation carefully and repeats it in their common tongue:  "This place is not a place of honor.   No highly esteemed dead is commemorated here.  Nothing valued is here.  What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us.   This message is a warning about danger."  https://t.co/aF8HrXMAEo
1310446185484890112 2020-09-28 13:08:12 +0800 <Scearpo> Nothing grows well surrounding this plain. A shaman is brought to the obelisk to read the many strange languages carved on it. He tells of a scholar in one of the larger towns nearby the tribe who may know one of the languages carved into the black stone. They summon him.  https://t.co/aSHiJgkAZK
1310445627852099585 2020-09-28 13:05:59 +0800 <Scearpo> This hostile architecture is made of a stone black as night, drawing in sunlight and making the surrounding air very hot and unpleasant. No useful cart or structure can fit in between the tight spaces. The same symbol seems to be everywhere, a circle with three arcs around it.  https://t.co/umjEAkdkKM
1310444848286240768 2020-09-28 13:02:53 +0800 <Scearpo> A desert tribesman comes across a barren waste, 12 foot tall dark cubes spaced apart so that barely one man can fit between their corridors. On the sides and surface, a field of ominous pillaring spikes. Markings on a monument in some ancient language warning of a curse. A symbol  https://t.co/Az4UhKMkqL
1310301115595067399 2020-09-28 03:31:44 +0800 <Scearpo> One can only imagine the horrors that befell the ancient French whose bones cover every nook and cranny of the Paris catacombs? What foul sorcery demanded their remains to be turned into a terrifying sepulcher? I'll tell you.  To learn the secrets of milk alchemy and meat paste  https://t.co/suozOaGpor
1310204153163988992 2020-09-27 21:06:27 +0800 <Scearpo> @johndavidebert Sounds like you've already written half the book by the looks of your feed
1310092737933389825 2020-09-27 13:43:43 +0800 <Scearpo> Bulletproof Gut Health: Step 1: Stop eating corn syrup, sugar, and vegetables Step 2: Flush your system. Enemas work but a more natural solution is to eat an entire box of plain cheerios Step 3: HEAVY DIARRHEA Step 4: Introduce proper gut bacteria by drinking local sewer water  https://t.co/NHncsvNB4W
1309926076383203328 2020-09-27 02:41:28 +0800 <Scearpo> @JDBtracker Lifestyle and mentality isn't conducive to open societies. They'll either get dragged into one of the two tribes or become neutral party psychonaut druids growing mushrooms out of their own poo deep in the woods and sacrificing animals and drifters to appease alt-dimensional gods
1309856689781387266 2020-09-26 22:05:45 +0800 <Scearpo> @John_Conquest_ This will be the result of a cataclysmic post AI society that has automated drones flying out to population clusters distributing welfare narcotics per request. Large pharma factories run by computer systems, neglecting basic needs but easily providing pills and plastic junk.
1309836583814737920 2020-09-26 20:45:51 +0800 <Scearpo> @jackhinoff1 Thats just a setup for a sequel. The plucky young girl who assisted you on your journey gets a sequel starring her all grown up, finishing what you started. It's nowhere near as epic or popular.
1309836183363612674 2020-09-26 20:44:16 +0800 <Scearpo> @infamousruby Then you are a daywalker, scorned by both, living on the outskirts in caves,  subsisting on scavenged half drunk bottles of Steel Reserve and eating the cheese off of discarded empty cardboard pizza boxes
1309747088570355714 2020-09-26 14:50:14 +0800 <Scearpo> @jackhinoff1 A group of vagabond tweakers has shattered and smoked the soul crystal. 9 men each possessed by a shard of the methcromancer, have become Nazgul death warriors, each holding a fortress of boxes in a major alleyway kingdom.  You,  a renegade addict, must slay them all and free us.
1309741873653833728 2020-09-26 14:29:31 +0800 <Scearpo> @helioslogos Cocaine Paladin versus Xanax Druid. Hallucinogens and Deliriants fall under a third neutral summoner class
1309741154024513536 2020-09-26 14:26:39 +0800 <Scearpo> Humanity will split into two subspecies of "downers" versus "uppers" people. Drugs will splinter the human genome into high intensity vs low intensity activity. An unsteady trade of skillsets will occur between tribes of half zombified xanheads and roaming crackhead nomads.  https://t.co/ujsmY8E2Jh
1309691664588570624 2020-09-26 11:10:00 +0800 <Scearpo> Dumping out unbroken foot long turds are an internal prophecy for having a great rest of your day.
1309164708411461633 2020-09-25 00:16:04 +0800 <Scearpo> @AryanCowboy Anyone who's experienced in physical fitness, weight lifting, MMA, etc knows that doctors give horseshit advice in regards to working out. They always emphasize how any kind of actual work will "hurt you" and you need to stick to limpdick calisthenics with no volume or intensity
1309013141888667656 2020-09-24 14:13:47 +0800 <Scearpo> @form_break Someone got high and started shitposting on /x/ again didn't they
1309010589004464130 2020-09-24 14:03:39 +0800 <Scearpo> 36 hours since you slonked down a fistful of datura seeds and a diet coke. You've been having poignant conversations with your dead grandparents while their eyes won't stop bleeding. In reality you've ripped your dick off and are chewing it in front of your screaming roomates.  https://t.co/pGpdCnUzuu
1308445936973209602 2020-09-23 00:39:55 +0800 <Scearpo> As your mind renders into insanity visions, creating worlds of sensory experience to cope with the raw empty that is your all, you fade into existence. You wake up, in your own bed sweating into a pillow. A card next to you reads: We hope you enjoyed The Inferno, come again soon.  https://t.co/eHIsOguWcS
1308445371241320449 2020-09-23 00:37:40 +0800 <Scearpo> The flames extinguish, leaving you in complete darkness. The smooth floor you've been walking and sitting on disappears as you get sucked into the water. The panic and drowning quickly subsides as the water matches your temperature. You no longer feel, see, hear anymore. Nothing.  https://t.co/1nvDygxZfg
1308445232539881472 2020-09-23 00:37:07 +0800 <Scearpo> As you sit in the grotto, my inner circle, you are locked into the environment. This is your world, an endless constant escalation to nothing, as it has always been mine. The circle closes behind you, there is nowhere else to go. Everyone except you sinks into the water, gone now  https://t.co/c4AfGCyRGi
1308444697162117122 2020-09-23 00:35:00 +0800 <Scearpo> There's a small gathering of my peers with me, beckoning you. Bottles of booze float to the top of the water, cigars, pills, coke, smokes, whatever you want sitting on the rock shelf. There's a few extra girls beckoning you to come join. My grin is inviting, my eyes reek of death  https://t.co/4bMqMdBOe2
1308444286963388417 2020-09-23 00:33:22 +0800 <Scearpo> You turn around, solid wall replacing where there was once an entrance. You find a half circle opening, lit by candles. I sit on the wall, half submerged. Arms stretched out on a rock shelf behind me. Two naked girls, slick back wet hair, sharp eyes, on each side. Both smirk.  https://t.co/kFKmY1frRn
1308443275716710402 2020-09-23 00:29:21 +0800 <Scearpo> Level Eight: Your illusory drunken outside simulation shoots out of you into full sober realization. You're waist deep in warm water with rock ceiling a foot above your head. Cavern walls have carved bowls holding open flame. Your clothes have disappeared. Welcome to the Grotto.  https://t.co/bJc3XgBT2w
1308443001379794948 2020-09-23 00:28:15 +0800 <Scearpo> After the worlds longest greatest piss, you see the number 8 scratched into the interior of a piss stained public restroom door. Opening it takes you to a different place from where you entered. A deep metallic droning sound leaks out from the ajar door. Dim orange flickers wait.  https://t.co/ReSTZznETq
1308442301690241024 2020-09-23 00:25:29 +0800 <Scearpo> Level Zero? You find a brightly lit clinically dull diner. A frumpy waitress garbles at you in a muffled language you barely comprehend. You double deathgrip your battery acid coffee, lost in a world of streetlights and stray gas stations, stumbling through a filthy bathroom door  https://t.co/PltsS2VqWz
1308442015370285058 2020-09-23 00:24:20 +0800 <Scearpo> Level ???: You wander into the dark, seemingly endlessly leaving the light and noise behind you as it disappears into a dot. Muscled hands grab you as your vision turns to a drowning sensation. You're thrown into an alleyway of alien city, light years from home. You are Beyond.  https://t.co/1djnG56twW
1308441452163235843 2020-09-23 00:22:06 +0800 <Scearpo> Level Five: The Point Of No Return. Completely choking darkness interspersed with strobe light visions of raw sexual violence, people thrashing, flailing, fighting, fucking on a concrete floor. Aggressive industrial house in a crowded tiny hellspace. You are in the Black Room.  https://t.co/zbTnHE5gl5
1308441119500402691 2020-09-23 00:20:47 +0800 <Scearpo> Level Four: High intensity music pulsates into a crowd, more a mass of vibrating liquid than a collection of people. A layer of smoke conceals the concrete floor. Red light everywhere has you in an animalistic state, losing control. This is the dance floor. This is the Red Room.  https://t.co/eKq7nEs2M3
1308440921806180352 2020-09-23 00:20:00 +0800 <Scearpo> Level Three: This is where the night club begins. Everything is neon green and the air is sweat. A 6'4 model with a buzz cut has electric tape on her nipples, wearing nothing but heels &amp; a thong, snorting coke off a mirror table. Everything is mirrors. You are in the Green Room.  https://t.co/oFabc90tkp
1308440671066427392 2020-09-23 00:19:00 +0800 <Scearpo> Level Two: Blue lighting permeates your descent down into a pulsating lo-fi house beat. The air is rich with hookah as beautiful women stretch themselves out on sofas, groups gather on circular tables and engage in relaxed conversation. This is the smooth buzz of the Blue Room.  https://t.co/ycqkGraUb7
1308440206442405888 2020-09-23 00:17:09 +0800 <Scearpo> Level One: As you descend between weathered concrete walls holding ornate double doors beneath a neon sign, you find yourself in warm lighting, smooth wood, and warm brandy poured in snifters. Crossed legs, flirtatious giggles, smooth conversation. Welcome to The Lounge.  https://t.co/LsqVCmcJ7w
1308439961159565312 2020-09-23 00:16:11 +0800 <Scearpo> Deep in my world, miles in the wilderness, built into an abandoned missile silo: A nightclub exists for the most exclusive patrons. A descent into ethereal raw velocity. Each level more depraved than the last. I present to you my creation: The Inferno.  https://t.co/KrlCmRpoRo

1305593976582537216 2020-09-15 03:47:15 +0800 <Scearpo> @latimes @KnightLAT The biggest tragedy in all this is that a Jackson Pollock painting is being exchanged for money, rather than being thrown into a trash compactor where it belongs.
1305593044356472832 2020-09-15 03:43:33 +0800 <Scearpo> @MorlockP I remember reading that garbage book.

1305584350617051136 2020-09-15 03:09:00 +0800 <Scearpo> @wheatfamine A local hobo who refuses anything less than a firm handshake painted trash today.

1305305535298916352 2020-09-14 08:41:05 +0800 <Scearpo> In the final future, end-state lifeforms will be kept alive by Dyson Rings powered by black hole tidal forces.

1303901058717102081 2020-09-10 11:40:12 +0800 <Scearpo> Back to sleeping alone. No more longing smiles, no more relief at that good night text. No more warmth inside you, no more helpless dread. He looks at his work and walks out, waiting outside your door next time you secretly beg for him. It's back to square one now, isn't it  https://t.co/sqLtn67KQI
1303900367307108352 2020-09-10 11:37:27 +0800 <Scearpo> The palpitations before you do it. The yelling. The tears. The emptiness inside you afterward. Your old friend operating your limbs for you while you're numb. Half of you filled with absolute despondence and sadness. The other half overwhelmingly relieved and feeling finally free  https://t.co/sYGQ38RWxy
1303899816410247171 2020-09-10 11:35:16 +0800 <Scearpo> He is a smokey shadow, formless, thoughtless, heartless. A mechanical beast that represents every sense of instinctual hyperviolent dread that operates the engine deep in your void. He waves his little fingers of chaos and destruction over your relationship. You look on helpless.  https://t.co/4ndntfvDTh
1303899053374267393 2020-09-10 11:32:14 +0800 <Scearpo> Long after the dinners with parents, the incessant trips to the mall, the whinging protestations of "No we can do what you want I'm just giving out suggestions." Long after every little peck on your cheek and half hearted ass slap while you brush your teeth. He has returned.  https://t.co/b6rQOEHkmv
1303898337347805187 2020-09-10 11:29:23 +0800 <Scearpo> Eventually this foul sense of bloated sticky sucked into a tentacled wall of mediocrity premonition of dread stains itself with everything you do with her. You long for solitude, you crave the freedom of treating some whore like disposable garbage. You want to be unhinged now.  https://t.co/YNGlJ0ikTu
1303897592183623680 2020-09-10 11:26:25 +0800 <Scearpo> You feel like you're somehow killing off some integral part of yourself as you go through the motions of little arguments and little make up kisses. Every delicious meal she cooks, every dessert you share, every popcorn bowl movie on the couch cuddle, all have an aftertaste.  https://t.co/nmH3nIN554
1303897171406860288 2020-09-10 11:24:45 +0800 <Scearpo> Time passes by and you find yourself starting to melt into the shape of her familiarities. The passionate excitement and mystery has replaced itself with a strange uncharacteristic contentment and sense of future. But as the high velocities mellow out, in comes something strange.  https://t.co/Nks4rqantj
1303896535286116352 2020-09-10 11:22:13 +0800 <Scearpo> Eventually the two of you shed the shelter of ambivalence and call yourselves a couple. Your days begin with a Good Morning text and end with a Good Night message. Sooner or later, one of you says I love you and then other returns the gesture. You get a place together eventually.  https://t.co/9Yw59vLYhk
1303896085467979776 2020-09-10 11:20:26 +0800 <Scearpo> Soon coffee turns to dinners. Drinks, movies, long walks down streets lit at night. Kissing. Touching. Caressing. Holding. Groping. Grinding. Nibbling. Grabbing. Fucking. You're sleeping next to her at night. Holding her, listening to her breathe. Smelling her hair as she sleeps.  https://t.co/9RsQ8Y88aw
1303895570612977664 2020-09-10 11:18:23 +0800 <Scearpo> You're very quickly texting her every day, sometimes for hours. You find yourself saying and doing things you normally wouldn't for some random woman. The things she says actually sorta matter to you. She doesn't seem like she'll fuck the first time but you're okay with that.  https://t.co/i9rE7USKdz
1303895192781623296 2020-09-10 11:16:53 +0800 <Scearpo> It all begins with an innocent little smile. A lingering look that lasts a little too long.

1303856500604129281 2020-09-10 08:43:08 +0800 <Scearpo> @wheatfamine The project was too obscenely bloated. Too many big names, too many crazy ideas for the set. They were going to make Baron Harkonnens space palace a mountain sized statue of his face where spaceships flew out of his mouth. The projects corpse was harvested for the Lynch movie.
1303806581855879168 2020-09-10 05:24:47 +0800 <Scearpo> You jest, but Alejandro Jodorowsky was going to create a hyperpsychedelic superproduction of Dune, including Salavador Dali and Orson Welles. Jodorowsky was going to cast his own son Brontis to play Paul and put him through grueling martial arts training sessions for years for it  https://t.co/5aMMK8GtnD
1303804217778417667 2020-09-10 05:15:23 +0800 <Scearpo> Lore has it that they're splitting the Dune movie into two films, Paul's journey pre and post desert life. And that for the sequel they're going to make Timothee Chalamet do a heavy bulk with an HGH and Trenbolone steroid cycle, so that Paul is freakishly ripped for the sequel.  https://t.co/MFKkTqFiB2

1303577069285146624 2020-09-09 14:12:47 +0800 <Scearpo> As your body starts to slip into the ether, you close your eyes and consider your life as you start to fade away. You're thankful for all the video games you got to play and all the cool snacks you got to try. Your final dying regret is, "God I really wish I had purchased more!"  https://t.co/VVftjyX0Md
1303576393972932611 2020-09-09 14:10:06 +0800 <Scearpo> But you triumphantly hold onto that suicide button like a brave little boy at the dentist. All those doctors and nurses would feel very sad that you wasted their time and chickened out of this at the last second. You've spent your whole life subservient to others, why stop now?  https://t.co/sp2ax6ROZl
1303575722007695360 2020-09-09 14:07:26 +0800 <Scearpo> One tiny little squeak of fear and regret makes you want to let go of the button and break through, clinging to that sweet delicious beautiful life you're about to deposit into a corporate DVD rental return slot. Your lifeless carcass soon packaged like a hotpocket and disposed.  https://t.co/lPj0NVCk6Y
1303575079201263617 2020-09-09 14:04:52 +0800 <Scearpo> You start to feel light headed, the final comforting voice of death being sung to the tune of that one Radiohead song you lost your virginity to in high school. Your pea brain consumer mind voice struggles to piece together some poignant thought to your very impending death.  https://t.co/uv5ydD7rOn
1303574545949954048 2020-09-09 14:02:45 +0800 <Scearpo> There you sit,  T-minus 300 seconds from your last carbon monoxide filled breath, deathgripping that suicide handle with a flatscreen TV 3 inches from your face showing off a touching montage 3rd worlders smiling at sunsets right before your corpse gets vacuum seal shrink wrapped  https://t.co/B8LL3ptRbR

1303451234100228098 2020-09-09 05:52:45 +0800 <Scearpo> One final interesting tidbit is the likely prevalence of biological attacks that terrorists may be resorting to in the future. This was 2015. The common method of dispersal is through aerosol spray. I'll leave you with this for some disturbing implications  https://t.co/7lllctXr0g
1303450570167128070 2020-09-09 05:50:07 +0800 <Scearpo> The nature of any emergency suggests that we can only plan for things we've experienced before. Any new turbulent experience we can ATTEMPT to predict proper course of action, but it will inevitably be a cluster fuck. No amount of studying protocol trains you for emergencies.  https://t.co/OJ08we8Ot4
1303449547767713793 2020-09-09 05:46:03 +0800 <Scearpo> The big secret redpill is that this NIMS framework which was created to ensure that we'd have better disaster and attack response for all first responders in conjunction with federal agencies is basically a series of PDFs most government employees skim through every 2 years.  https://t.co/0wurwE6b2f
1303448955917869056 2020-09-09 05:43:42 +0800 <Scearpo> Amongst antiterrorism classes was a whole load of boring assignments that mostly went over the basic emergency response systems put in place for a post 9/11 and post Katrina society. A lot of cross agency standardization and training for the National Incident Management System  https://t.co/vQLjhvpvjh
1303447451056181249 2020-09-09 05:37:43 +0800 <Scearpo> A big issue with any government organization is that progress cannot be reasonably tracked for an entity whose purpose is preventative. How can you justify your budget if you do too good a job and nothing ever happens? Simple, you make things almost happen and stop them.  https://t.co/jY8oey4TyA
1303447069831704576 2020-09-09 05:36:12 +0800 <Scearpo> Many of you are probably familiar with the idea of "fedposting" and are wary of overtly racist or violent accounts in fear of being arrested for having improper beliefs. This stems from a hard reality that the demand for radical extremists outweighs the supply.  https://t.co/k27XwRUIm3
1303446379323371520 2020-09-09 05:33:28 +0800 <Scearpo> Then of course there's well known documentation that shows how first world militaries send out advisors to teach third world populations on the basics of insurgency tactics, basic explosive manufacturing, and supplying them with weaponry, supplies, and logistical information.  https://t.co/lZHRblmZMQ
1303445815084691456 2020-09-09 05:31:13 +0800 <Scearpo> There are several documented cases of FBI plants in high risk for radicalization environments that have encouraged ordinary citizens to take decisive actions towards the physical preparation of committing a terrorist act.

1303445325546508288 2020-09-09 05:29:17 +0800 <Scearpo> Obviously this class assignment was tinted with the tone that we must prevent terrorism by finding troubled individuals and using resources to open the doors along the hallway and alleviate the source of their turmoil. But the actual lesson is in between the lines.  https://t.co/pZMK2NCDFb
1303444871970205697 2020-09-09 05:27:28 +0800 <Scearpo> The entire premise of terrorism and how an individual reaches the point of terrorism is that every door until the last is locked. Whether these doors are actually unopenable due to circumstance, or if an outside individual makes you perceive them to be locked.  https://t.co/Yb6tMRd0HB
1303444456440553473 2020-09-09 05:25:49 +0800 <Scearpo> What propels you further and further down this hallway is an issue that is affecting your life in a negative way. Each door down the hallway represents a solution to your issues. The further down the hallway you go, the more drastic the solution becomes.  https://t.co/k6oHSSqsbu
1303444147781742598 2020-09-09 05:24:36 +0800 <Scearpo> The process of radicalization from how an ordinary citizen becomes a violent terrorist was described to me as the Hallway Metaphor. Imagine you are an ordinary citizen at the beginning of a long hallway of doors. The door at the very end is committing a terrorist act.  https://t.co/vSocPTyQN2
1303443859725258752 2020-09-09 05:23:27 +0800 <Scearpo> Back when I attended that pee pee poo poo retard shithouse playground casino fuckfest Chuck E Cheese money vacuum whore factory known as college, I earned a necessary Homeland Security certificate for my degree.

1303346625184751616 2020-09-08 22:57:05 +0800 <Scearpo> @VEDIC_CYBERGOD Right and wrong is a relative term based on a balance of values regarding how you treat others in a society that you live in. Abusing a child makes it more likely that the child will abuse their children and cause turmoil to those around them in society.
1303204864747606017 2020-09-08 13:33:46 +0800 <Scearpo> There's too much to say and none of it matters anyway. The only permeating thought is a constant I FUCKED UP mantra. All five senses are muted to reality. You cannot hear, see, taste, touch, or smell anything anymore, you're in sensory deprived mindscape now. Was it worth it?  https://t.co/gyP2Mxa0NY
1303203863131049984 2020-09-08 13:29:47 +0800 <Scearpo> Time itself has become a crippling delusion. Youve mastered sensations beyond any language that could describe so much complication and so much simplicity the very concept of how 10,000 years feels identical to 10 seconds. All the while you're haunted by a metallic taste.  https://t.co/1LolwfNbVY
1303202958977499136 2020-09-08 13:26:12 +0800 <Scearpo> Sometimes this teases you. All five senses are removed except for a tiny stamp sized screen floating in front of you showing you POV footage of your girlfriend from your original life, pre ingestion, crying and screaming and calling 911 as you stare at the ceiling. Old news now.  https://t.co/xnSl0VL4To
1303202381841289216 2020-09-08 13:23:54 +0800 <Scearpo> Sometimes you wake up in another life. You have a wife, husband, kids, pets, job, responsibilities, homeless drug addict, teacher, rapist, construction worker, opera singer. You forget all of this and live a life for 20 years just to one day come back and lose it all again.  https://t.co/HDrivvCYUL
1303201259827101697 2020-09-08 13:19:27 +0800 <Scearpo> The only time you can't escape a moment is when that Man is behind you. You can't look at him ever, the thought of it fills you with nonEuclidian discomfort. He will always be a featureless blur in your peripheral vision. You can feel him linger behind you until he chooses to go.  https://t.co/YneD0e4DYk
1303200871715614722 2020-09-08 13:17:54 +0800 <Scearpo> Whenever you're in a situation or place you don't particularly care for, now all you have to do is shut your eyes really tight and when you open them you'll be elsewhere. The only problem is, you have to keep your eyes open to hold onto moments you enjoy, until you can't anymore  https://t.co/zxoa1PN8P2
1303200310874210304 2020-09-08 13:15:41 +0800 <Scearpo> There's plus sides to this state of existence you find yourself in. Nothing seems to bother you anymore. Situations which would normally bring you fear simply fill you with a heavy unease, not unlike the natural anxious state you find yourself in constantly now anyway.  https://t.co/AeoyqHv23u
1303199857964974082 2020-09-08 13:13:53 +0800 <Scearpo> The sky outside is a sickly purple.  Not a single living soul is there to betray this sensation of complete solitude that creeps into your skull. Oddly enough there's not a car in sight. Every window is boarded up. You face the west and the entire horizon is a looming cloud wall.  https://t.co/DFvZCwzZM9
1303198111049842688 2020-09-08 13:06:56 +0800 <Scearpo> It's alternated between 4am, to 7am, to 5am, to 3am, to 8am, back to 4 am every time you've woken up.  You've called off work sick four times now and each time you ask your manager if you've called already, they say no this is the first.  Sometimes you're in the wrong bed.  https://t.co/o1s7Vc1OIS
1303197368469393408 2020-09-08 13:03:59 +0800 <Scearpo> One hour and forty five minutes since you drank that artificial water you stole from that government office. You've been stuck in a fever dream state and the only think you can hear is a ceaseless droning sound.  You're not sure if it's a complete silence or excruciating noise.  https://t.co/4fWMvmihFp
1303082400554123273 2020-09-08 05:27:09 +0800 <Scearpo> @ranger_borealis No, aesthetic. Every part of this person's life is completely dedicated towards being dirty inside and out, his appearance, his scent, his touch, the way he sounds, and presumably his taste are all disgusting. His entire lifestyle is built around it. This creates a storylike aura
1302979700587888640 2020-09-07 22:39:03 +0800 <Scearpo> @Boreal_Gael @VEDIC_CYBERGOD Every sailor knows that in the history of sailing all the way to the Phoenicians, there is a sacred sea god who transforms the will of men, and the proper way to honor him is in the ancient tradition of crawling on your knees to eat M&amp;Ms out of a mayo filled fat guys belly button  https://t.co/wMeUpcbyXX
1302847974255611904 2020-09-07 13:55:37 +0800 <Scearpo> The Filthlord is all that is left beyond your death, far beyond the death of your descendants. He was entombed by the great nebular shit spilled forth by an uncaring elder God. He witnessed the Earths birth. He will watch the sun die.  https://t.co/20ZQ4Bq1ZM
1302847251216240640 2020-09-07 13:52:45 +0800 <Scearpo> You shatter through the ground into some subspace of existence, returning to corporeal form. The Filthlord goes back to his perpetual gaze, entranced by the sun itself in some vague blinding captivation. You are forever changed by this experience as you continue your journey.  https://t.co/aL34ASuL4l
1302846475425189888 2020-09-07 13:49:40 +0800 <Scearpo> You proceed into some crevice that has split open reality itself to antipurify. You become one with the complete negative void of cleanliness, becoming filth itself in some inescapable mesh that transcends you. You cannot clean yourself from this experience, it mantles you.  https://t.co/YEk1MqLqfv
1302845573532389378 2020-09-07 13:46:05 +0800 <Scearpo> As your palms fill with earth to smear yourself until no skin bares itself to the sun, he immediately turns his head, like noticing a ghosts whisper in the periphery of one's ear. He speaks in a grimey whisper, his smell is unbearable. He tells you to enter the Filth Hole.  https://t.co/vZSawSks0Y
1302844893308518402 2020-09-07 13:43:22 +0800 <Scearpo> The Filthlord squints towards the setting sun, hobbling methodically like some hydraulically driven mantis that understands nothing but pain.  Your presence does not even register to his riddled brain scorned by the harsh reality of the outside world. His attention demands ritual  https://t.co/lB0uV9EXJm
1302843922713112576 2020-09-07 13:39:31 +0800 <Scearpo> The Filthlord is Amou Haji. He is an Iranian vagabond who has not bathed in 60 years. His favorite activity is smoking animal shit out of a pipe he built from PVC refuse. His crispy windswept skin and hair is coated in a powerful dark crust hardened by time,  more skin than stain  https://t.co/9vBYJ9frSl
1302842779731726336 2020-09-07 13:34:58 +0800 <Scearpo> In rare pockets of the Earth you will find humans beyond human, singular beings dedicated entirely to an aesthetic with tunnel focus. These are lone Ozymandian crumbled pillars stand against wastescapes, ready to deliver quests to wayward men.  I present to you: The Filthlord  https://t.co/Tb6V1VD4xi
1302650949626982400 2020-09-07 00:52:43 +0800 <Scearpo> @mike_betas It's an incredibly clean tasting vodka but the bottle won't really flush well if you're stacking it amongst your other liquors. Personally, I think premium vodkas are sorta a meme because they're inherently tasteless. Plus Akroyd sold the company so it'll probably go downhill.  https://t.co/oJzREWag2u
1302620831747637248 2020-09-06 22:53:02 +0800 <Scearpo> @Enkidu4You It's a well known fact that when he CHIM altered the geographical state of Cyrodiil from a jungle to a sparse temperate forest, he also disappeared every one of his critical political opponents out of existence.
1302616678883373057 2020-09-06 22:36:32 +0800 <Scearpo> @Enkidu4You Tiber Septim used federal tax money to power the Mantella to activate the Numidium, Nerevars death was an inside job.
1302474890155626496 2020-09-06 13:13:07 +0800 <Scearpo> Ultimately this discovery will railroad human development towards a specific set end state. The paths to get there will be dynamic as signals constantly manipulate the past, perceived by populations similar to a Mandela Effect. But they all converge to the same end state.  https://t.co/Xet6yqocee
1302473039850938368 2020-09-06 13:05:46 +0800 <Scearpo> Technology itself will change rapidly to adjust for revelations that future information will bring. Many electronics will be globally banned and dismantled. Regulation of psychedelics will be heavily increased and commonplace use will be outright banned for the population.  https://t.co/LZsdEtCU8X
1302472030542065664 2020-09-06 13:01:45 +0800 <Scearpo> A very specific structure of training must be put in place for anyone involved with this technology in order to deal with the psychological ramifications of manipulating reality and time. They will be trained to handle the perception of multiple possible realities that could be.  https://t.co/UWF2gQ3JxI
1302470874809937924 2020-09-06 12:57:09 +0800 <Scearpo> An entire field of study will be constructed to interpret messages from future transmissions and infer intent to prevent attacks from future nations. Towers will be erected in population dense areas to intercept and scramble signals, and trace their origin location and time.  https://t.co/n8pUOSHj34
1302469957662498816 2020-09-06 12:53:31 +0800 <Scearpo> In order to prevent retaliation, attacks must contain the utmost subtlety. A common strategy is to promote softer consonants and more vowels in an enemy nations developing language to reduce the masculine tone of their ancestors. This can be done in several stages over centuries.  https://t.co/uhtxmulzfJ
1302468709320216576 2020-09-06 12:48:33 +0800 <Scearpo> The most ancient messages will be general guidance on the use of controlled substances such as psychedelic mushrooms in order to set a foundation for being able to receive messages later on in the future. Many nations will share joint operations on messages such as these.  https://t.co/IAMNeZSqXL
1302467846249877505 2020-09-06 12:45:07 +0800 <Scearpo> The most valued points of contact will be key moments in history where signal strength is highest and the stakes involve major possible outcomes, such as decisive battles in war or transfers of powers in governments. Agencies will send tempopsychonauts to find these moments.  https://t.co/yTHZQ7bdKP
1302466165642493952 2020-09-06 12:38:27 +0800 <Scearpo> A precarious silent war will be ongoing between nations as they try to bolster their own historical societies while denigrating that of their enemies. The further in the past they send out signals,  the more of a complicated neutral tone they develop due to shared histories.  https://t.co/8iaGlNqEJI
1302464740699103235 2020-09-06 12:32:47 +0800 <Scearpo> There will be two main forms of influence that this communications system can deliver: vague instincts spread over large amounts of a population in the past and specific instructions to info susceptible genetically gifted individuals, such as shamans, soothsayers, psychics,  etc.  https://t.co/wU7Bgn4zUi
1302463316799954952 2020-09-06 12:27:07 +0800 <Scearpo> As the technology inevitably leaks to other countries,  a Mutually Assured Destruction stalemate will occur where each nation possessing the technology will have the ability to sabotage or dismantle an enemy nation's ancestral society with misleading or harmful information.  https://t.co/C1qPjmNd61
1302462481416228864 2020-09-06 12:23:48 +0800 <Scearpo> In 2043, DARPA research will lead to the creation of a device that can send impulses and ideas back in time to be picked up by tribal shamans throughout history with the use of pschedelic influence. Very quickly this technology will be co-opted and weaponized by federal agencies.  https://t.co/Xz8ZzTA4e1
1302328982088699904 2020-09-06 03:33:20 +0800 <Scearpo> @LandsharkRides Hunter S. Thompsons always sounded like bullshit to me. Mark Wahlberg is definitely lying too  https://t.co/qKg3cFQI5w
1302322073075945478 2020-09-06 03:05:52 +0800 <Scearpo> @ww1_luigi @il0vechrist You're like one of those Africans who's riddled with super AIDS but your body is so laden down with diseases that you're functionally alive. But anyone who comes in contact with you dies almost immediately

1302284181259669505 2020-09-06 00:35:18 +0800 <Scearpo> @VEDIC_CYBERGOD My biggest problem with gnosticism summed up right here.  "You need to escape material reality and end existence." Why? "Because life is suffering, what you believe is God is actually an evil entity and true God wants you to escape." Says who? "Jewish numerology" Oh okay lmfao
1302266845110710272 2020-09-05 23:26:25 +0800 <Scearpo> @Jameslee101 @stillgray Is it centered around race or something else?

1302072015843717120 2020-09-05 10:32:14 +0800 <Scearpo> @anteruina When I was 17 years old I spent 4 hours at my job doing Macho Man Randy Savage impressions. It permanently deepened my voice and increased my muscle mass for years to come.  I now speed everywhere I drive and use creatine to cut my cocaine.  https://t.co/kziruqMo1p
1302065227803090951 2020-09-05 10:05:16 +0800 <Scearpo> Ancient monks would utilize esoteric knowledge to not only retain semen but use special movements to suck up liquids with their penis in an effort to steal women's vital essence. They would teach this to kings who would suck up saucers full of mercury to gain fabulous powers.  https://t.co/6DceHLHUeI
1302062264024010756 2020-09-05 09:53:29 +0800 <Scearpo> @RepentantVile That's actually the minimum penis length required to fuck your own ass effectively.  I see you know your Judo well
1302060989509238784 2020-09-05 09:48:25 +0800 <Scearpo> @RepentantVile You ever thought about turning Repentant Viles boipussy (or bussy if you will) inside out, using all 4 inches of throbbing man ham you got packing, in some poppers riddled fuck fest pre murdersuicide pact 15 minutes from now?
1302052892145221632 2020-09-05 09:16:15 +0800 <Scearpo> Mutual jerk off session bro (strictly hetero) found "songs to smoke meth to" in my Bing search history and now he thinks he's my fuckin rehab doctor,  this Friday is gayfucked to death who's got ice cream  https://t.co/Dfhv2Ab8e9
1302032901400416259 2020-09-05 07:56:48 +0800 <Scearpo> The daily minor suffering that is present in all things is a toll. A delicate balance. If you neglect to suffer, you'll simply pay your tab. Too much pleasure leads to long term pain. Food turns to fat, narcotics to addiction, hedonism to emptiness, lust to loneliness.  https://t.co/npppuipbby
1302032386201448449 2020-09-05 07:54:46 +0800 <Scearpo> Much like controlled burns can prevent forest fires down the road, a society must sometimes suffer through a poor economy or government. And much like  antibiotics can create super diseases, sweeping your problems under the rug can blow up in your relationships and workplaces.  https://t.co/xbVQUscQc2
1302031835417935872 2020-09-05 07:52:34 +0800 <Scearpo> There is a natural reservoir of turmoil that builds up in any system. When it's prevented repeatedly in favor of perpetual prosperity, the turmoil will overload and cause disaster. This is true for relationships, economies, governments, natural ecosystems, and civilizations.  https://t.co/atJFJDUIp9

1301912402255060993 2020-09-04 23:57:59 +0800 <Scearpo> This is real I shit you not. Directly after the 9/11 attacks, Marlon Brando, Liz Taylor, and Michael Jackson packed into a rental car to drive cross country since all flights were grounded. They only made it to Ohio from NY since Brando wanted to stop for every KFC along the way  https://t.co/DXL2t8QxWQ
1301909783574913030 2020-09-04 23:47:35 +0800 <Scearpo> Towards the end of his life, Marlon Brando would spend a lot of time online anonymously going into chatrooms to start arguments and flame wars. Most likely if he lived long enough, he would've frequented 4chan like William Shatner does on /tv/. I figure Brando would frequent /ck/  https://t.co/oLTqG0G9t4
1301908274682507267 2020-09-04 23:41:35 +0800 <Scearpo> Brando often insisted on taking control of production away from directors and forcing very stupid ideas for costumes and character direction. In Superman, he wanted Jor El to be a floating green bagel, or a talking briefcase. In the Island of Dr Moreau, he dressed himself as this  https://t.co/ysHrbRx1oX
1301907633599848448 2020-09-04 23:39:02 +0800 <Scearpo> For the part of Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, Francis Ford Coppola had two requirements for Brando: Lose weight and read The Heart of Darkness to learn the role. Brando showed up even fatter and did not read the book, necessitating shadowy scenes to hide his fat body.  https://t.co/1kgFD8QHBP
1301906573682446340 2020-09-04 23:34:50 +0800 <Scearpo> On the set of Guys and Dolls, Brando shot a scene with an ill tempered Frank Sinatra, involving Sinatra taking a bite of cheesecake, a dessert Frank despised. Brando would intentionally fuck up his lines to force Sinatra to keep eating cheesecake, to the point of a temper tantrum  https://t.co/K0g5H9lzuR
1301905237318475777 2020-09-04 23:29:31 +0800 <Scearpo> One of Marlon Brando's favorite snacks was to stuff an entire pound of bacon into a loaf of bread and eat it like a sandwich. He also loved melting copious amounts of chocolate into coconuts and eating the combination with a spoon. He called it "real life Mounds bars"  https://t.co/h8YZgRbtzm
1301904163857723392 2020-09-04 23:25:15 +0800 <Scearpo> Marlon Brando was so voraciously riddled with hunger that one time on the set of Missouri Breaks, he pulled a live frog out of a stream and took an entire bite out of it before throwing it back in the water. An act he lamented as he was a self proclaimed animal rights champion  https://t.co/Qhev4Q8tVO
1301903487912083456 2020-09-04 23:22:34 +0800 <Scearpo> Marlon Brando ate so much that he ripped 52 pairs of pants on the set of Mutiny on the Bounty. At one point he stranded himself in the middle of a lake on a canoe with a 5 gallon tub of ice cream and refused to paddle back until he finished it off.  https://t.co/qoYQHGRRyI
1301902424093995008 2020-09-04 23:18:20 +0800 <Scearpo> Marlon Brando, who had been put on house arrest by his spouse because of how fat he was getting. Despite being under strict control, he was gaining weight. It was later found that his close friends Warren Beatty and Jack Nicholson were throwing bags of Burger King over his fence.  https://t.co/a6EM32OqTZ
1301900925993447424 2020-09-04 23:12:23 +0800 <Scearpo> Marlon Brando was really fucking fat. Marlon Brando was once put on a diet by his wife, who padlocked the fridge cause of how fat he was. She woke up at 2am and found he had broken the fridge open with a crowbar and was taking bites out of a comically large wheel of cheese.  https://t.co/hi4ulcYs6G

1301290285977174022 2020-09-03 06:45:55 +0800 <Scearpo> The dish is illegal in many countries, limiting the experience to only the wealthiest patrons or most influential chefs in the restaurant, often eating in secret. The funniest part is that the same engorging occurs when you just put a curtain over its cage, no need of blinding it
1301289404577837057 2020-09-03 06:42:25 +0800 <Scearpo> The Ortolan is the most shameful delicious secret in the culinary arts. It only eats at night, so its eyes are removed so it engorges itself on seeds and grapes. Then it's drowned in cognac before cooking. It's traditionally eaten with a curtain over your head to hide from God.  https://t.co/c2Qdo1mgP8
