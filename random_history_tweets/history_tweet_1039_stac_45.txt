If Beijing Biden gets thru on this election fraud, Trump will most likely still campaign against McConnell. He’s establishment and most likely has done his own misdeeds as well. He has shown HIS true colors

Barr may have very well gave Trump ammunition but didn’t want 2 b involved with massive court cases (Lin tweeted regarding cases) since he’s known these crooks all his career so Barr resign.

No matter how u look at this, THIS has nothing 2 do with this virus! It’s dictatorship/communist behavior from the governor. And magically, we don’t have ANY flu numbers. THIS isn’t what they’re telling us.

I hardly paid anything on surgeries, premium and deductible ($2,500) were low. My deductible is about $12,000 now so basically y do any of us have insurance? Yet we keep democrats in office and they pushed ACA in without reading it.

The NO media jumped on this to indoctrinate ur brain that way if the right did find the evidence, did get judges to go by constitution then the rioting/looting would occur to have civil unrest. And that unrest should b a target to the fake media.

I have a feeling a Trump card is going to b drawn very shortly regarding this election. Too many respectable attorneys are believing he won in a landslide. Patience is our virtue. He had 10 attorney generals come forward to PA w/letter to court.

1326869314872385537 2020-11-12 20:47:51 +0800 <stac_45> @OttWatchWard23 @NewDayForNJ @realDonaldTrump Republicans normally don’t ever carry the popular vote due to large cities, more people, more liberal influence. That’s one of the reasons for electoral college. Majority of America is NOT large cities. Not one size fits all.

But really, governor said in the summer to b courteous to ones not wearing it cause we don’t know they’re situation (asthma, etc). All of this is dumb. It’s a virus.

Each business goes by square footage and only so many in at a time with face mask and distancing. Stop hurting people, at least try this approach first.

Don’t b surprised if they really go thru on impeachment this time.  241 hospitalization in the whole state? Did we do this with the flu? If Biden wins, he’s threatening a nationwide mask enforcement. Oh yeah TX and FL will go for that. 😏

U have a 99.7 or 8 chance of surviving it and most likely won’t end up in a hospital. I wear one but I’m not going to shake my finger at someone not wearing one. I just won’t b around them but I also am not around someone with one on either.

I’m not going to ever report company’s not following this because of that reason alone. And I would think lawsuits can b thrown at the state for shut downs due to not turning customers away.

Also reports of software is owned by Diane Feinstein. Too much coming out so I will wait on Trumps legal team for their real evidence. They wouldn’t b doing this if they didn’t have the evidence to #fightback

Saul Alinskys, “Rules for Radicals” have been applied to the democrats for the last 12 years but getting worse. Dems want civil war to do away with OUR Constitution, period!
1324677985581125634 2020-11-06 19:40:17 +0800 <stac_45> @realDonaldTrump I easily WIN the Presidency of the United States with LEGAL VOTES CAST.

It’s because our NO media is inflicting fear in hopes u won’t vote 4 the Orange man. The NO media has divided this nation, it’s not Trump. Virus isn’t harming younger adults, they may not want a total shutdown that Biden’s offering.

An elderly woman choked at her nursing home and had died. She was coded covid. That’s one of thousands happening all over the states. Where the flu/pneumonia numbers? Keep hiding like Biden. This is political.

Saying he believes he will run things but behind the scenes they all know he can’t. Harris didn’t even fare well during debates as presidential nominee so she’s picked 4 color and her left wing agenda🙄

This is so messed up.

Simpson has every right to call out the ignorant mayor who wasn’t given all the evidence, just like the general public. The Grand Jury was given that evidence and came up with their conclusion.

Columbus better get rid of him or ur gonna start looking like Portland. Columbus Police should not protect this mayor since he’s putting all police officers in one box.

And getting rid of police is nuts. If someone is shooting at a police officer, they best have common sense that police will shoot back.
1309118531745841165 2020-09-24 21:12:34 +0800 <stac_45> @realRyanClouse @MayorGinther You definitely don’t need Ginther. He’s making remarks when he does NOT know, just like the rest of us, what evidence was presented to Grand Jury. He should stay neutral. The LEFT are making out ANY situation as police are ALWAYS being in the wrong. Totally PATHETIC!

And says the one that retweeted on “after Christmas I can finally masturbate...” ur not looking at anything Trump is doing for America. Biden doesn’t care about ur sorry ass, he’ll b lining his pockets with China for his kid again.

When Columbus, Ohio had their riots, police cut off access to streets in downtown so they couldn’t damage buildings so they organized thru social media and moved to the outskirts. They were going thru neighborhoods.

1304416451571453952 2020-09-11 21:48:11 +0800 <stac_45> @CodyDolan7 @Factinate Prob her karma. Unfortunately, karma hits someone u love. The article said she was very devoted to her son. I don’t know how she had all this time on her hands to bang these guys and do all the other things if she were spending time with her kid. 🤷‍♀️ it’s really ones perspective.

I finally got thru it. Lord how some people live in drama. U think she would’ve had heart disease and HBP. But it’s sad, she was forced into a marriage at 17 and he was 29, big difference in maturity.
1304410550907142144 2020-09-11 21:24:44 +0800 <stac_45> @victoryrapper1 @Factinate That’s because she doesn’t know what she’s talking about. She wouldn’t care if America collapse due to the Green Deal. Funny how the LEFT wants this in America but it doesn’t change a thing when other countries don’t do anything. China? 🤣

And then u see people who got tested, may b a false positive and now ur being told this will somehow show up 4 the police? How many rioting are being tested? None if they’re still rioting..

This will screw up sports if each sport isn’t consistent with this ruling.
1303875332395675648 2020-09-10 09:57:58 +0800 <stac_45> @0netakeshawty @gada1gh No, reality check. They’re doing this because it needs to b RIGHT. She has too much testosterone and most likely will b at a GREATER advantage than the other women. I’m happy about that ruling, otherwise, this is going to hurt ALL sports! She wants to b a woman then b a WOMAN.

That’s what democrats/media count on, for the dumb down to not know what’s going on and just go out and vote for them. Bet he doesn’t even know Cuomo killed a high number of elderly but is now spewing it’s Trumps fault. What a joke.🤣🤣

Nancy is, as usual, playing her political games. She doesn’t care about the people of this land. Look at her own district. She is a pathetic, evil, OLD woman.

Bet you’ll find out it’s a liberal mayor. I’m in RED Ohio, but Columbus has very high poverty and it hasn’t had a Republican running it for sometime.

What is wrong with people in government there? What is wrong with people continuing to elect these nut jobs?
