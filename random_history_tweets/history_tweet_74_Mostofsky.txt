1329437941106667520 2020-11-19 22:54:39 +0800 <Mostofsky> I think their problem here was that they thought they would only have to cheat a little bit, not a lotta bit.

1329437939982610446 2020-11-19 22:54:39 +0800 <Mostofsky> Once there's a challenge, &amp; the ballot gets tossed, they would lose that vote for Joe Biden.  The Dems know this, so they make sure that the ballots would not be challengible by any other campaign, as typically those canvassing only care about the race they are looking at.  2/4
1329437938162216965 2020-11-19 22:54:38 +0800 <Mostofsky> This is exactly why you have ballots that only have voting for Joe Biden &amp; no one down ticket.

1319531474652139520 2020-10-23 14:49:53 +0800 <Mostofsky> Biden went on and on about 212k dead by covid.  Curious, the 6-800k that are killed in the womb, what about them?

1319459659955187715 2020-10-23 10:04:31 +0800 <Mostofsky> Can Biden please tell us where nurses and first responders make minimum wage?  If they do, their unions suck!

1319451085065637888 2020-10-23 09:30:27 +0800 <Mostofsky> I love when @realDonaldTrump take about himself in third person.
1319450757184278528 2020-10-23 09:29:09 +0800 <Mostofsky> Joe Biden asks everyone to take his "pledge".  @realDonaldTrump should ask him to get through the Pledge of Allegiance.  #debate2020
1319448507091243014 2020-10-23 09:20:12 +0800 <Mostofsky> Joe Biden: only close areas "with high reproduction rates".  So I guess Catholics, Mormons, &amp; Orthodox Jewish communities I guess are ü§∑üèª.

1309597018554236928 2020-09-26 04:53:55 +0800 <Mostofsky> @SKastenbaum yeah, like you care.  You work for @cnn, one of the most antisemitic "news" orgs in the country.

After Yom Kippur, @SKastenbaum is going to drive around Midwood to find all the posters written in English that have people that look like Orthodox Jewish families that aren't wearing Chassidim garb.  He shouldn't hold his breath.
1309576609754763264 2020-09-26 03:32:49 +0800 <Mostofsky> @SKastenbaum typical progressive response.  Attack someone on their religion.

1309570492890845186 2020-09-26 03:08:30 +0800 <Mostofsky> @SKastenbaum go do your virtue signaling elsewhere.  You couldn't give two Craigslist about Yom Kippur.  If you did, maybe you would've actually kept Rosh Hashanah. ü§∑üèª  ü§°ü§°
