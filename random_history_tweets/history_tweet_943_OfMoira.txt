1340366918226567169 2020-12-20 02:42:30 +0800 <OfMoira> @Soulhorses I was going to say that her conformation is kind of amazing. She has Arabian hind quarters, but the head of a Mustang or Qhorse. I think she's kind of beautiful.

The tea baggers found the gate open and the welcome mat out from the republicans back in Bush#2. The opposite is the case with the democrat party and progressives. They've got the castle hermetically sealed and counter insurgency everywhere.

One of the most exciting moments of my childhood was receiving the sugar cube to eat that contained the polio vaccine. The 2nd coolest moment was night swimming in a motel pool in LA after driving all day to get there.

AOC talked openly about the process early on, then Nancy took her to lunch and brought her into the club.

One must do what is right, but cultivate detachment from outrage. One must disengage so that one can maintain an inner core of truthfulness and adherence to eternal principles: compassion, service, bliss. 2/2

1337475803638951936 2020-12-12 03:14:15 +0800 <OfMoira> @inmyownfashion2 Psychopaths are drawn to power. They despise actual work.
1337475219108241410 2020-12-12 03:11:55 +0800 <OfMoira> @Fishbones2020 Tell her that every time I wear my mask and struggle with it I think worshipfully about the thousands of doctors and nurses who have to wear them, under a bunch of other PPE, for hours at a time, day after day, while doing the most stressful work going. Send her my love.
1337473096450596864 2020-12-12 03:03:29 +0800 <OfMoira> @SallysRaveCave No judgment. It's an exciting shot.

1337360245035655168 2020-12-11 19:35:04 +0800 <OfMoira> @nodank_ The only path forward lies with citizens making guerilla war on transnational corporate conglomerates. They are the force buying congress out from under us and setting this psychopathic, loveless policy agenda that's killing us and the biosphere.

We make them the targets of our dissatisfaction and ire. We need to make their assholes pucker.

All celebrities, especially clients of CAA in LA, magazines, radio, TV, the work product of Hollywood, and cable news work together to manufacture a political concensus that serves Big Business.

1337335608507682818 2020-12-11 17:57:10 +0800 <OfMoira> @PaulSorrentino3 @soggystella1 Yep. One of our good friends had everybody in his family (+/- 25 people) over for Thanksgiving at his house in Berkeley. Many drove or flew in from far flung parts of the state. Only 1 wore a mask. We're waiting to hear how many got sick. I just SMH.

1336720586500816905 2020-12-10 01:13:17 +0800 <OfMoira> @JoshuaPotash It is so deeply insulting. So wholly inhumane.
1336720286863921152 2020-12-10 01:12:06 +0800 <OfMoira> @TomJChicago Harwood is a little slow on the uptake. Trump has always been off his rocker.

You've made a liar out of me, telling young people, "oh, you can count on Bernie, he's solid gold, never waivers." I feel so bad for wrongly encouraging them to believe you were with the people.

1336477616157540352 2020-12-09 09:07:48 +0800 <OfMoira> @akoonce53 @MarkCranfield_ @winningmatches When I read that I knew what was needed. On Twitter we spend copious amounts of time railing about Pelosi and McConnell, but that's just swatting at flies. You can call and fax and email and it gets 0. Bc they are owned by the corporate bosses. It's the bosses' agenda, not ours.

Trillions are given to these industries in a snap. Evo Morales said upon his return to Bolivia from exile this Nov, of American elections "Transnational corporations run America. The people vote but they do not rule."

But I believe covid will be around for a while and I do not want to get it. My husband is asthmatic, so we cannot afford exposure.
1336428279280979970 2020-12-09 05:51:46 +0800 <OfMoira> @LZgrath @djhutch74 I know. It's Twitter and one must draw a narrow focus. Sorry.

General strike, mass phone, email, letter writing campaigns, actions where nobody gets arrested, but we harass and shame them and destroy their markets. I have a lot of ideas. Us &gt; them

Then organically a tipping point will come. We all need to be teachers right now, waking up our neighbors. Then we go after the corporations. We back them off, everything changes.

1336347332057518081 2020-12-09 00:30:06 +0800 <OfMoira> @Jaybefaunt Yes! We need to get citizens reminded and informed as to who their real enemies are, and they are the transnational corporations that run America. We must hit them directly and forget about politicians. A general strike is the eventual stake through the heart of their control.

1335981801588760582 2020-12-08 00:17:37 +0800 <OfMoira> @ComptonMadeMe The correct answer is D. Life in America is a ceaseless grind because the Collective Corporate Mind wants it that way. Government serves them FIRST, then serves themselves, and if there is a crumb left, and they can get around to it, the people might get the crumb.
1335977983912210432 2020-12-08 00:02:27 +0800 <OfMoira> @JeremyWard33 That's my observation. Our revolutionary target is corporate comfort, not our silly "representatives" in DC. If we can pucker their assholes we might get somewhere.

1335672096291098624 2020-12-07 03:46:58 +0800 <OfMoira> I have just watched the best production of A Christmas Carol I have ever seen. It's a dark, very frank, modernized &amp; slightly expanded retelling such as Dickens would've dared not written. A black Mary Cratchet plays a central role!

1335482976482729985 2020-12-06 15:15:28 +0800 <OfMoira> @Chacelounge Sometimes I do think about this, how horrible it must have been, and I feel deeply sick.

1335478213141643264 2020-12-06 14:56:32 +0800 <OfMoira> @TimNissen1 @MadMax1105 I compile mine in a a big can on my back porch potting bench to dry and when they pile up I smash them with the bottom of a bottle. They don't get as fine as yours though!
1335477110232608771 2020-12-06 14:52:09 +0800 <OfMoira> @mr_clark14 @tekstone What it is, mostly. The idea that people inside the agencies are up to something nefarious, and secretly run things. And, that this "deep state" is the actual enemy of the American people. Government does shitty things because corporate bosses control policy &amp; legislation.

1335316031842131968 2020-12-06 04:12:05 +0800 <OfMoira> @tekstone @mr_clark14 But "deep state" is such demagoguery. Who exactly is that? People inside the constitutionally sanctioned agencies inside the Executive Branch? It sounds like some secret organization behind the government that does the work of the people. I don't buy into the concept.
1335298276317229056 2020-12-06 03:01:32 +0800 <OfMoira> @PatTheBerner But they won't listen to us because they don't work for us. Their loyalty is to corporate bosses. It's the corporate bosses the people need to scare. They drive everything. Trying to get Congress's attention is just so much swatting at flies. We have to clean up the shit.

1335294808588386304 2020-12-06 02:47:45 +0800 <OfMoira> @mr_clark14 Barack Obama and the democrat party are the deep state, then.
1335293390779371525 2020-12-06 02:42:07 +0800 <OfMoira> @pauljimerson It suggests what the rise of oceans will look like from a drone's eye view.

He captures the ocean having these inspired, sacred moments where something secret and very important is going on. It's marvelous.

I painted a ripping portrait of Michelle &amp; Barack on their inauguration walk, except he proved impossible. His head was HUGE. I could not pare it down or get it right so I painted over the canvas &amp; reused it.

1334701017179381761 2020-12-04 11:28:14 +0800 <OfMoira> 2. Hubby put on Madonna, 'Cry Baby' from Dick Tracy. It's hilarious.  46 minutes of voter fraud details county by county, through AZ, GA, PA, MI, WI AND MN. Full details yelled about with twitchy body language and regular cutaways to camera 2, where he shows charts. WGAF?
1334699158259650561 2020-12-04 11:20:51 +0800 <OfMoira> Watching the 46 minute rant of butthurt-ness by the man boy. It is Extreme Pro Bellyaching nonstop which actually crescendos as it goes! Two thoughts. 1. The movie Casino. Ace Rothstein thrown out of licensure by the county, goes on late night TV and tells off the county commish.

1334646152373751809 2020-12-04 07:50:13 +0800 <OfMoira> @PatTheBerner Indica is what you should try. Sativa delivers the paranoia experience, and half indica/half sativa blends can do the same. Indica induces sleepiness and enhances appetite &amp; giggling.  Be very careful with edibles bc it's easy to overdose and have a very unpleasant experience.

1333761575820218372 2020-12-01 21:15:14 +0800 <OfMoira> @StevenDBT George is the poster boy for what happens to B actors when they become clients of the LA talent agency, CAA. They all sound like George &amp; Rob Reiner &amp; every talking head on msdnc and Michelle Obama, all CAA clients. It's the Politainment Industrial Complex for propaganda.

All it required was a tuneup every two years, oil changes and gas and it was always ready to go. And it was ZIPPY with a turning radius of zilch. In 2014 CA gave me $1000 for it. I cried when I left it at the wrecking yard.

This is hair powder used to cover stubborn gray at the temples (this hair resists tint) and to make the hair appear uniformly dense. It's cheap-o stuff, because the good ones don't run when wetted with sweat or simple water. Utterly shameful.

I see this as our path to "taking our country back" and having nice things for ourselves, our children and all sentient beings.

The poops are the transnational corporations providing a hog trough of corrupting cash to our "representatives". We as a people need to target those corporations and put the fear into them. #Occupy did it in 2010

1326561999564623872 2020-11-12 00:26:41 +0800 <OfMoira> @beaukpad @StrangeTimes10 The short answer is that the two parties are hostile to the needs of the people. There is no sanctuary for us in either hive. So we're political vagabonds, homeless as it were, doing good where we can in a world gone mad.
1326560699955306496 2020-11-12 00:21:31 +0800 <OfMoira> @TubunMuzuru It's a low moment when, as a citizen, one sees that one's own government has disdain for the people.

1326556382598897665 2020-11-12 00:04:22 +0800 <OfMoira> @NathanJRobinson Because transnational corporations rule America.
1326556002209001472 2020-11-12 00:02:51 +0800 <OfMoira> @SAVoltolin The first woman president will be every bit as disappointing as the first black president. Because as Evo Morales reminded the world, transnational corporations rule America. (The people vote, but they do not rule, he said)

1326390550778490886 2020-11-11 13:05:25 +0800 <OfMoira> @SocialistMMA I think they're walking a tightrope in DC. They want their districts served, and for that they need the cooperation of other dems, a group real defensive about their foibles. AOC has recently spoken out about the impossible situation in DC.

1326385194832695297 2020-11-11 12:44:08 +0800 <OfMoira> @beaukpad @StrangeTimes10 They hire election law lawyers to negotiate and/or sue for the numbers. If they don't muster something like that they're just so much hot air, at best a think tank.  You know who're getting results are DSA and Our Revolution. Both active everywhere getting progressives elected.

1326027169156403200 2020-11-10 13:01:28 +0800 <OfMoira> @joesegal $30K is starvation wage in most places in the US. And if you live somewhere affordable on that much money, you'll never find a job locally that pays you that much. American Catch-22. I remember trying to live on 30K back when I was a law librarian. Your description is 100% right.

It's important, however, to carve out meaning and then own it and fight for it. It's required. It's a bitch, I know, and the. forces of darkness are strong now.
1322843778336522241 2020-11-01 18:11:48 +0800 <OfMoira> @PMemeister The folks who moved into the long-empty house behind us have been having a rip snorter of a party. It's 2 AM and they're still yukking it up in the back yard. It's nice hearing people having a good time, but the covid!
1322840691391623171 2020-11-01 17:59:32 +0800 <OfMoira> @jonstall2020 Obama has a lot of nerve showing up in Flint, wagging his finger at them.

1322235691053449216 2020-10-31 01:55:29 +0800 <OfMoira> This is what it means to be black in America. It's utterly terrifying. Read this thread.

1322232509338320901 2020-10-31 01:42:50 +0800 <OfMoira> @peterdaou Look to organizational psych. The personality of the individual at the top of the organization becomes the mood/style of the whole organization.
1322231666958454791 2020-10-31 01:39:29 +0800 <OfMoira> @a9ymous Well said.
1322229667781173248 2020-10-31 01:31:33 +0800 <OfMoira> @CGoustin @melodijoy They've internalized capitalism. When you feel guilty for taking time off, for sleeping in, for mental health days. When "free stuff" for the rich seems right but $20 to a beggar is an outrage. When work is always priority #1, that's internalization of capitalism.
1322227260531724289 2020-10-31 01:21:59 +0800 <OfMoira> @Rihilism @Tazerface16 I have a black hollyhock in my front yard that just keeps blooming. They're one of my favorite flowers.

I am a student/follower of @Amritanandamayi, who is the most positive, loving person on the planet, who encourages a positive, loving attitude in every situation. But American politics and politicians? I've seen too much.
1322167969661644800 2020-10-30 21:26:23 +0800 <OfMoira> @glowingcanary I know. She'll get over it.

1322151473552093185 2020-10-30 20:20:50 +0800 <OfMoira> @djhutch74 It is extremely irksome. Democrats' "democracy" is a lie.
1321983043196788736 2020-10-30 09:11:33 +0800 <OfMoira> @SocialistMMA Have you seen the one about the large mammals of the deep? I think it's elephant seals that spend considerable time at 7,000 feet! They go the deepest. I would love to find that one again. Also, National Geographic's Eternal Enemies, Lions vs. Hyenas!

1321976393069068290 2020-10-30 08:45:07 +0800 <OfMoira> @djhutch74 Government, namely the Executive Branch, will be reconstructed, life breathed back in, daca people will be safe. Environmental damage [mostly] halted/reversed. Maybe out of shame they'll release/reunite the central Americans in bondage at the border. I don't expect much tho.

1321494282327392256 2020-10-29 00:49:23 +0800 <OfMoira> @lowetze1 Because democrats are afraid to upset anybody. EXCEPT FOR PROGRESSIVES! They'll run progressives over with the car whenever given half a chance.

She didn't even make it to the California primary her campaign was so lame, she won ZERO DELEGATES. She has signaled to Obama she'll do whatever he tells her to in his 3rd shadow term.

Why is she always giggling like she's got a pitcher of margaritas in her? Did you see her campaign? She had a whole new set of policy positions every other week. Did you seeher in the Hamptons 5 minutes after Hillary lost to trump?

1320009186629963777 2020-10-24 22:28:09 +0800 <OfMoira> @inovajon What a great film!!
1320009105193324545 2020-10-24 22:27:49 +0800 <OfMoira> This is the most exciting film I've seen in ages. It actually gave me hope about climate change, and it modified my thinking on my own garden.
1320001754402963459 2020-10-24 21:58:37 +0800 <OfMoira> @secularcitizen2 One of the first things I thought about this morning was the long lines of cars waiting in food pantry lines, all of the families who are struggling to stave off HUNGER all over this nation. It is unforgivable.
1320000427279069184 2020-10-24 21:53:20 +0800 <OfMoira> @BethLynch2020 It's a SCREAM. Watched it yesterday morning.
1320000143957999618 2020-10-24 21:52:13 +0800 <OfMoira> @benigma2017 @ninaturner Every time people on the left make kissie face with the George Bushes and John Kasiches of the world they're rehabilitating them, putting them in some rosy glow of affection and esteem in the public eye when they belong in obscurity alongside the wrongs they've perpetrated.

1319337534367825920 2020-10-23 01:59:14 +0800 <OfMoira> @nodank_ Biden's big idea is to wind the clock back to the time before the Republican party purged their liberal members, when everybody in DC were pals. Thing is, clocks and culture don't wind backwards and Biden lives in a fiction.

It's about elevating the white trash class to a powerful position by identifying with the bosses' whiteness while intimidating the dark people.

I dislike discussing the topic of ego on Twitter because everyone gets all up in arms over it.   Trump as symbol of ego is your idea?

I'm a lucky retiree who can sequester, but others are not so lucky. There too is the tragedy. The nation is wealthy enough to shelter us all, but tptb won't have it. Tragedy again.
1314055549986635776 2020-10-08 12:10:31 +0800 <OfMoira> @dailyrev Right? The romping had been going on for quite a while, running as fast as we could through the long marble halls of the place, laughing like children. An animus. An equal.   A deep little white ceramic bowl with, like, corn pops in milk, plenty of milk.  Why trump?

1313868532476604416 2020-10-07 23:47:23 +0800 <OfMoira> Incidentally, he was dressed in his golfing clothis, the white izod shirt and light slacks as big as a tent.
1313867856858161152 2020-10-07 23:44:42 +0800 <OfMoira> I think, "Hey wait, he's got the covid!!" and I run out of the room as fast as I can. Don't know what happened to the cereal. End of dream.
1313866728066019328 2020-10-07 23:40:13 +0800 <OfMoira> This morning's dream: In a structure full of large, high ceilinged rooms made wholly of sandy colored marble I'd been romping with a male friend, but now I'm alone enjoying a bowl of cereal. In walzes Trump. He sits opposite me and starts talking, bla bla. No mask.

It has stayed nice, but shifting winds will bring us smoke on and off until the fires are out, which could be a couple of months. This is the new normal for climate-changed California. I've lived here for 65 years. This burns down every summer thing is newish.

They wouldn't count votes, they assigned Bernie's delegates to Biden or anybody but Bernie, they ran gaggles of unviable stooges to confuse the process and then hand picked the 1%'s favorites.

Pick out a neoliberal or move along. Democracy is an illusion, a lie, a sick joke...one of trump's classic hoaxes which democrats delight in peddling.

The least democratic people in the usa are Dems! "Democracy" is a damn lie.
1307666207932211200 2020-09-20 21:01:33 +0800 <OfMoira> @marwilliamson Do you remember right after Hillary lost to the boob, in the Hamptons Kamala was seen being secreted into hurry-up meetings of TPTB in posh Hampton residences to be vetted out as The Chosen One? Sweetie, that's the "democratic process" the dems love: they only count the votes of
1307665275144167424 2020-09-20 20:57:51 +0800 <OfMoira> @marwilliamson "Democracy" Marianne, darling, were you watching that scam of a "primary" the dems ran? Nobody's vote counted--literally: they did not count the votes. They gave delegates to Biden that were Bernie's. And in the end they chucked all votes and installed Joe and Kammie.

1303053742237835264 2020-09-08 03:33:16 +0800 <OfMoira> @joesegal In my grandparents' last years there were many nights when, after having dinner at their apartment, I would cry all the way home. One night, watching my grandfather wave goodbye to me in my rear view out on that dark sidewalk I had to pull over and sob for about 5 minutes. 游땬

1302683740158660608 2020-09-07 03:03:01 +0800 <OfMoira> The good times our oil economy created are at an end. But big oil and alotta others aren't having it. Those far off target dates for compliance this and that are just so much 50-60% masked on the boardwalk and only 9,000 (ONLY 9,000!!!) on the beach on Labor Day Weekend.   Doomed
1302681880647483392 2020-09-07 02:55:37 +0800 <OfMoira> In the 1950s big oil knew what they were doing to the atmosphere, retailing all of this gooey liquid carbon for the burning. Their industry is run by scientists and engineers, men of science. They knew the absolute certainty of the outcome of what they were doing: making it hot.

1301223471020609537 2020-09-03 02:20:25 +0800 <OfMoira> @upNorthmigrl I was very moved by what he said at People's Party convention. He's a good guy.

1301221387357487106 2020-09-03 02:12:08 +0800 <OfMoira> @RexChapman He said "SOUP" nine times.

1301220407408615424 2020-09-03 02:08:15 +0800 <OfMoira> @AOC FYI, our mail had slowed to a trickle, three days/week no mail at all, before the dejoy hearing. Two days after the hearing a huge pile of mail was delivered and it seems back to normal every since. Your committee had an impact. Thank you.
1301217895045836801 2020-09-03 01:58:16 +0800 <OfMoira> @jvgraz When I was a teenager I was in the kitchen with my mother and sister and her blue budgie, George. A huge tin of honey was open and George flew right into it! He was going down fast when I grabbed him just before his head went in. George was ok, and you make a good point.
1301215878231592961 2020-09-03 01:50:15 +0800 <OfMoira> @SocialistMMA Too bad I'm married, because that's my idea of an evening well spent.

1301209794423001091 2020-09-03 01:26:04 +0800 <OfMoira> @ClaireBerlinski "The way blacks behave..." Do you hear yourself?

1301208870082224134 2020-09-03 01:22:24 +0800 <OfMoira> @nashville_brook They're fishing for Republican defectors. That's the whole strategy.

1301204970998358017 2020-09-03 01:06:54 +0800 <OfMoira> @JenniferBart Why is your heart akin to a single pea gravel? Why be so small and mean?
1301204424254205953 2020-09-03 01:04:44 +0800 <OfMoira> @rtyson82 Summary execution for a "bike violation". The US is a shithole country run by psychopath cops. God help us.

1301181206810095617 2020-09-02 23:32:29 +0800 <OfMoira> I cut this zucchini two days ago. It has been hanging out on the kitchen counter with a closed blossom attached to its stem. This morning the blossom opened! Nature amazes me every.  https://t.co/JqMLuQRNDg

1301168413344112640 2020-09-02 22:41:38 +0800 <OfMoira> @kaitlin_sb @chrsdcook Wow. Damn.
