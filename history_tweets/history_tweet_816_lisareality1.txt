1344044822936637440 2020-12-30 06:17:11 +0800 <lisareality1> @tedandharry The new strain is affecting youngsters so they may not open schools for January.
1344042120164864001 2020-12-30 06:06:27 +0800 <lisareality1> @Bigdogdigs If they’re attempting to be educational then yes but maybe in future there needs to be information at the beginning of historic or period programmes to inform viewers that poetic licence has been used where eg Anne Boleyn is portrayed by a black actor.

1306856482898616322 2020-09-18 15:24:00 +0800 <lisareality1> If they’re thinking of using military camps, introduce 3 years of national service for illegal immigrants. Win win. @pritipatel @BorisJohnson  https://t.co/27cWyOtVUX
1306855834312466434 2020-09-18 15:21:25 +0800 <lisareality1> @ukJ0N @HappyHarryMedia 3 years of national service if you arrive illegally - that should sort the men from the boys.
