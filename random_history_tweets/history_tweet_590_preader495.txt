1342312746650578946 2020-12-25 11:34:32 +0800 <preader495> @MsAvaArmstrong I agree with you Ava. 100%!
1342312373869281280 2020-12-25 11:33:03 +0800 <preader495> @jimmyrfoister @NitaObojememe @RealCandaceO Candace is wise and AOC is delusional. That is why AOC cannot hold dialog with her. It is basically truth vs fiction.
1341586404019752961 2020-12-23 11:28:18 +0800 <preader495> @MsAvaArmstrong Ava - you write so beautifully - even your tweets say what I wish I could write myself, but it does not come across half as well! I completely agree with what you are saying and wish I could say and/or write what‚Äôs in my heart like you do! You are amazing! Thank you!!

1327701227753205760 2020-11-15 03:53:34 +0800 <preader495> @DineshDSouza Sheep!!! It is beyond disgusting.

1327696742972682240 2020-11-15 03:35:45 +0800 <preader495> @RealJamesWoods It‚Äôs getting old, race-baiters! You need to move on and quite using race as an excuse for your personal short comings - which has nothing to do w/ what race you happen to be.

1325241355522633731 2020-11-08 08:58:55 +0800 <preader495> @LindaC2010 Some owners are into racing but not breeding - she will be well taken care of and cherished by whoever buys her. Nobody pays the money it will take to buy her and not give her the best care possible!

1311872674629443586 2020-10-02 11:36:33 +0800 <preader495> @kidgolferman @JulieReichwein1 @VP How about Larry Elder being moderator?! He would be perfect! Smart, fair and able to see who the real racists are. The Democrats! But he is still fair although he has conservative values. We need dialog. A true back and forth. Why is that so rare anymore??
