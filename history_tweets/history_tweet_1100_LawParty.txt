1301215565726482434 2020-09-03 01:49:00 +0800 <LawParty> @JanOSullivanTD Don’t mind the media ... you know how much they re into the trans nonsense.. they’re probably covering themselves there in some warped way!
1301209461659439105 2020-09-03 01:24:45 +0800 <LawParty> 89 new cases of coronavirus, one further death  https://t.co/MggSgVfAZK via @rte.... The HSE/Glynn and the boys had to go back 3 months and trawl through the recorded deaths to be able to record 1 further death today. pathetic doesn’t even come close to describing this LIE!
1301205891128139777 2020-09-03 01:10:34 +0800 <LawParty> ‘I never thought I would be that sick’: Young doctor on getting Covid-19  https://t.co/k1xCAeDbx3... an exceptional case which the media love to unearth..no different from healthy people who’ve got the real flu over the years.still not a reason for all this lockdown mask nonsense.

1301101037672116224 2020-09-02 18:13:55 +0800 <LawParty> @wendyannegrace This is about control..deaths for 2020 are no worse than previous yrs..in fact they may even be less..March &amp; April excess figs are skewed mainly because they neglected the most vulnerable in nursing/care homes &amp; accelerated their deaths which would sadly have happened anyway!
1300945275842895872 2020-09-02 07:54:58 +0800 <LawParty> @NewstalkFM Stupid so called law..don’t pay. they can’t prove in court your refusal to wear a mask caused any crime let alone infected anyone! But even if you did pass on this cold/mild flu that’s no different to what happens all the time which is not a crime.they might even be asymptomatic!

Coveney’s name wont be put forward unless the Govt has been promised in advance by Ursula that he has the trade portfolio! That’s the way it works!
1300852777728475137 2020-09-02 01:47:25 +0800 <LawParty> @fahey_tom Point is they don’t die in agony or shouldn’t.. chances are if they are at that stage they don’t have long to live anyway so care comfort and attention from family is most important..
1300845015002996736 2020-09-02 01:16:34 +0800 <LawParty> @PaulOMahony5 Medical/palliative care is available..one could use the same argument for those of all ages with a debilitating illness or disability.Nothing is better than Life.tending &amp; comforting ill parents/family regardless of their deteriorating condition brings its own reward for them too
1300840368280399872 2020-09-02 00:58:06 +0800 <LawParty> @McDonaghDJ @Smudgerbhoy88 @rtenews It has been reported that they’ve 2,000,000 people + 65 whilst we have 650,000.. both countries seriously neglected that category in nursing homes.They admit that mistake.They don’t believe in trampling over the rights/liberty of their citizens using common sense unlike us!

It’s how they describe one person murdering another! bit like the murdering of 6666 babies in 2019 an action described as being compassionate to the murderers!
1300773456250839040 2020-09-01 20:32:13 +0800 <LawParty> @CoraSherlock It’s all optics.. also coveney will need to know he’s getting the trade brief before he commits so a few phone calls between Ursula and our joint taoisigh should sort that one.
