1344070360082223105 2020-12-30 07:58:40 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @hrkbenowen Probably not a slip up. His handlers probably just forgot to remind him today not to say it in public.

1344067418423873536 2020-12-30 07:46:58 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @KTLA Hundred of historical statues hundreds of years old destroyed and THIS is the damaged statue you decide to report?
1343964695963713536 2020-12-30 00:58:47 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @OANN Funny how so many historic statues were destroyed by violent rioters and it was never mentioned by MSM. One useless statue of drug dealer is damaged and all hell breaks loose.

1343755598123286529 2020-12-29 11:07:55 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> This is why the politicians don’t resolve the transient encampments, they’re making a fortune off it. Human trafficking is what it is.

1336814147141390337 2020-12-10 07:25:04 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @beachgirlCA @RealJamesWoods Nancy and Kamala already working on his impeachment! 😂
1336813949136719872 2020-12-10 07:24:16 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @RealJamesWoods What about the ‘underage affairs’ on his laptop?
1336813542167613440 2020-12-10 07:22:39 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @ignore_garcetti @CBSLA It will be a win for us in Los Angeles since we’ll get rid of him but then he’ll continue his reign of terror across all the US until all states are cesspools like LA.
1336813156581007360 2020-12-10 07:21:07 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @cross_jy @CBSLA It must be percentage wise compared to entire population? because all the transient just in LA would overtake at least 3 islands.
1336812754326286337 2020-12-10 07:19:32 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @CBSLA Majority of them are in Los Angeles. CA is trying hard to win this contest, nice job garcetti. 🙄
1336781604564336640 2020-12-10 05:15:45 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @MayorOfLA @AsmLuzRivas @BringCAHome Here a brainstorm idea- help the ones accepting help temporarily until they get on their feet. Open psychiatric hospitals for the ones with mental issues ( a majority). The rest- enforce laws- vagrancy, public nudity, public drug use/ intoxication, littering...   You’re welcome.
1336711509678821377 2020-12-10 00:37:13 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @KTLA Because CA has become a cesspool. Every other business is fleeing CA , so you already know what the problem is.
1336556961307881473 2020-12-09 14:23:06 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @ignore_garcetti @MrAndyNgo They should have done this during the riots in all the cities. Electrical fencing around businesses. F plywood- they just used it as kindling for their fires.
1336555717122134016 2020-12-09 14:18:09 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @thunderthighsLA @lalovestrump Yes, or a homeless encampment.
1336555303035228162 2020-12-09 14:16:30 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @ignore_garcetti @MrAndyNgo Let’s also throw up some electric fencing to secure it.⚡️ ⚡️
1336554021633417216 2020-12-09 14:11:25 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @MrAndyNgo So then restrict travel in and out, cut power and internet service to the area.
1336553148530343936 2020-12-09 14:07:57 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @lalovestrump They had no problem collecting their Biden votes.
1336518029937537024 2020-12-09 11:48:24 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @koat7news As if NM doesn’t already have an over the top crime rate. They’re there for a reason, keep em there.
1336477718699884546 2020-12-09 09:08:13 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @KamWah888 I blame viagra and big pharma for this. 😂
1336477297415602177 2020-12-09 09:06:32 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @lalovestrump @GeorgeGascon Seems like if citizens arm themselves without a CCW that makes them criminals and therefore protected under all these crazy pro criminal laws... Full circle.
1336468722786045953 2020-12-09 08:32:28 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @ignore_garcetti @NBCLA Was it?! Well maybe he didn’t fit the race and gender as needed. But we all know he’d fit right in with the Biden propaganda machine to do to all of the US like he did to LA- turn it into a dangerous broke cesspool.
1336457564200943618 2020-12-09 07:48:08 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @nypost Sorry but she was a hot mess before covid hit town.
1336456866079989760 2020-12-09 07:45:21 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @NBCLA Was she picked on qualifications or gender/ race?
1336456626627211265 2020-12-09 07:44:24 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @Joannnoe1 @onejendoll @KTLA How exactly are the wealthy benefiting at the expense of the poor? Government help ( aka taxpayer funded) should be a temporary helping hand not a lifetime career.
1336442777261895680 2020-12-09 06:49:22 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @nypost Eww. Is corona also responsible for those horrible tats? I’ve seen better artwork on the 101 in DTLA.

1336380249714528256 2020-12-09 02:40:54 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @KTLA So now corona virus is racist? Is that where this is going?
1336220761648898049 2020-12-08 16:07:10 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @NBCLA Wow that sounds so forced !
1336220169543159808 2020-12-08 16:04:48 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @NBCLA The ONLY virus Bill Gates is qualified to discuss is a computer virus.  When exactly did he become a medical expert?
1336218489212661760 2020-12-08 15:58:08 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @robbystarbuck The 4 Seasons, and they have an online store. It’s called a down comforter and then you will need a cover to go over the comforter- the cover itself is the duvet.
1336194963609059333 2020-12-08 14:24:39 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @ignore_garcetti @lalovestrump @nypost I’m sure it’s been in the works for quite some time. So
1336187532912984064 2020-12-08 13:55:07 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @GeorgeGascon So what turned you from protecting the innocent citizens to protecting the criminals?
1336154740103598083 2020-12-08 11:44:49 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @GeorgeGascon Let’s hear what the monsters on death row did to get there in the first place.  Share the racial stats of their victims as well.
1336153580810584064 2020-12-08 11:40:12 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @BillFOXLA @FOXLA Sounds like the transient encampments will be fully protected. More than they already are.
1336152891430641665 2020-12-08 11:37:28 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @BillFOXLA @FOXLA Within a few months I’m sure murder and rape will be on that list to be declined for prosecution.
1336117721054900224 2020-12-08 09:17:43 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @GilbertScholtz @jetusername @KTLA Exactly. If anything , they need a death penalty express lane IMO.
1336099323122077697 2020-12-08 08:04:36 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @MrAndyNgo Looks like China flu is to only hope of stopping these terrorists...
1336093114088374272 2020-12-08 07:39:56 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @BillFOXLA @FOXLA Everyone’s chance of being a victim of crime just shot up 100 times.
1336091681679032320 2020-12-08 07:34:14 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @QuincyRLehr @MayorOfLA They’re not all victims,  majority refuse help and transients is EXACTLY what they are. Turning communities into cesspools.
1336090798744457216 2020-12-08 07:30:44 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @jetusername @KTLA If someone committed such gruesome crimes that there’s no chance of rehab and they’re a danger to the public that they’re sentenced to death - would you want him living next door to you?
1335846152336379906 2020-12-07 15:18:36 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @Malinche2020 The gif! 🤣. At that point you’re just thinking please don’t push me to say something I’ll never forgive myself for saying.
1335836348557606913 2020-12-07 14:39:38 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @Malinche2020 They’re like children. It’s like you gotta keep reminding them of stupid shit NOT to do all the damn time!
1335832398693421057 2020-12-07 14:23:57 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @KamWah888 @KTLA 😂
1335826532887977984 2020-12-07 14:00:38 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @KTLA How about picking the the person for the job regardless of sex, race, religion ?
1335812101797908481 2020-12-07 13:03:17 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @1PatriotForLife Who else but criminals would want to defund police and close prisons?
1335767771087392769 2020-12-07 10:07:08 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @Ilhan You forgot: JOBS FOR ALL.  Or was that intentionally left off ?
1335761548216737793 2020-12-07 09:42:25 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @liquidlaugh Probably using the Dominion voting machines to track cases. Sometimes running same results 2 or 3 times that they found stuffed in a suitcase.
1335761181932355584 2020-12-07 09:40:57 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @LawEnforceToday The Catholic Church needs to stay in its own lane.

1335699775463673858 2020-12-07 05:36:57 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @Faith_Trumper @ArtValley818_ Makes you wonder how only a certain party is catching this biological warfare infection.
1335632862498881536 2020-12-07 01:11:03 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @NBCLA What if a white male applies for help- will he decline based on race and gender?
1335631935897362433 2020-12-07 01:07:23 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @alicetweet Kinda like stopping a criminal investigation? Nope.
1335630819457581056 2020-12-07 01:02:56 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @StephenCroft25 That’s obvious since day one ! Look what he did to San Fransisco, then supposedly he’s elected to governor of the state?
1335629557114671104 2020-12-07 00:57:55 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @chicagosmayor What about the shootings and murders ?  https://t.co/9OluG1c01J
1335628136470306816 2020-12-07 00:52:17 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @SamKatz88157229 @ochealth @City_of_Anaheim You seriously expect tellers to enforce how masks are worn? Maybe you should put blinders on when you go to the bank so it doesn’t upset you. Or do online banking and use outdoor ATM.
1335464224726773760 2020-12-06 14:00:57 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @MayorOfLA Walk or bike ride where? Transients have taken over the sidewalks- it’s unsanitary, no room to pass them on sidewalk and they shout obscenities and make threats!
1335461327364521984 2020-12-06 13:49:26 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @NBCLA Bring back the Navy ship hospitals then.
1335460954868314112 2020-12-06 13:47:57 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @LAVagrants They should also include underlying medical issues of ICU patients in their propaganda.
1335453479129608192 2020-12-06 13:18:15 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @CovfefeKatie What a bummer! I thought you just escaped the power outages. 😢 Stay safe.
1335383673638539270 2020-12-06 08:40:52 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @lapublichealth @MayorOfLA What a joke. Those regions all lumped together seem a little large. Might as well split it in half North CA vs SO CA.
1335374121190871042 2020-12-06 08:02:55 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @LawEnforceToday If that’s the case let’s hope they accept welfare food stamps to sell tickets to fill the stadium.
1335364439004962823 2020-12-06 07:24:26 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @NBCLA Just in time for F up everyone’s holidays. In the meantime this tyrant will probably host a Christmas party in the North Pole with 20 different households, at taxpayers expense.
1335300896545116160 2020-12-06 03:11:57 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @SenKamalaHarris Pretty funny hearing you talk about something/ anything spreading since that’s how you got to where you are.
1335298547336396800 2020-12-06 03:02:36 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @TimCarruthers2 @MissionViejoCA It’s surprising that Santa Ana is even part of OC. Ugh
1335270171108241409 2020-12-06 01:09:51 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @MrAndyNgo @ybouziar Why do these fuckers  have so much power and  zero repercussions?  Live rounds! Enough is enough.
1335122234705289216 2020-12-05 15:22:00 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @sydneypage95 @washingtonpost I have a feeling this is another self inflicted hate crime.
1335007097436524545 2020-12-05 07:44:29 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @BlazeKush325 Probably the same chit as when we found out voting was a hoax. Spin our wheels, get mad but nothing has changed yet.
1335005905314742273 2020-12-05 07:39:45 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @MayorOfLA @LACity @LAPDHQ I’m sure the gangbangers and felons you released early from jails are already lining up to turn in their weapons  🙄
1334969006223028224 2020-12-05 05:13:08 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @KamWah888 ‘It’s okay now that we’ll be taxing the working citizens to death to pay for it’. There, fixed it.
1334968550675468288 2020-12-05 05:11:19 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @PearlsFromMyrna Or they can simply add a disclaimer at the bottom in tiny print referencing your city’s household entanglement maximums.
1334967726306160646 2020-12-05 05:08:03 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @PearlsFromMyrna Personally, I miss the busy signal tone. Keep cranking that rotary dial until you luck out.
1334954806180397057 2020-12-05 04:16:42 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @newsmax How do we know they’re filling the syringe with the vaccine? These pervs are probably getting viagra injections then acting like it’s the vaccine.
1334893552199856129 2020-12-05 00:13:18 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @NBCLA And I’m sure the local transients will still Figure out how to reach it so they can chit all over it and shoot up drugs There.
1334888255649529857 2020-12-04 23:52:15 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @MelPendergraft @ParkerGFitness Same here. I’ll give it a few years to see the side effects.
1334887002970365952 2020-12-04 23:47:17 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @lalovestrump Yet ironically they release the murderers, rapists, molestors and thieves from jails to keep them safe while the rest of us are on lockdown.
1334885874140475393 2020-12-04 23:42:48 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @nypost WTH is an ‘alleyway’ inside a house?  This clown lost his mind years ago.

1334731565541195776 2020-12-04 13:29:37 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @Elex_Michaelson Should he also tweet about all the American deaths due to influenza? Did any previous presidents do that?  He should tweet about all the communities,  businesses And lives destroyed by the BLM/Antifa riots and destruction.

1334729770752385026 2020-12-04 13:22:30 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @1PatriotForLife Maybe an internship with the mob to hone in on those corruption and racketeering skills.
1334716346269982721 2020-12-04 12:29:09 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @koat7news I’m gonna pass on the unknown side effects. Y’all go first.

1334692543464759296 2020-12-04 10:54:34 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @LACoSheriff How about focusing on enforcing the law and catching criminals instead? Or is that too ‘white supremacist’ these days?

1334631087037804549 2020-12-04 06:50:22 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @catturd2 Probably will just fill syringe with vitamins to put on a show. Propaganda
1334598871243059202 2020-12-04 04:42:21 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @OC_Scanner They ran out of his favorite hair gel?
1334564671634882560 2020-12-04 02:26:27 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @MrAndyNgo Re-arrested, not shocking. Wouldn’t be shocking if they were already released and charges dropped. Disgusting.
1334564091990429697 2020-12-04 02:24:09 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @KTLA He must be planning a vacation for himself.  Not capable nor trustworthy in the least.
1334419090572599297 2020-12-03 16:47:58 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @OC_Scanner They need to start bringing in sheep/ goats to graze in that area to clear the vegetation.
1334414241936236544 2020-12-03 16:28:42 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @CNN As if they can’t fill the syringe with vitamins or something else while going ‘on camera’.  I’m gonna pass on that ‘vaccine’.
1334355494014570496 2020-12-03 12:35:15 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @KTLA Maybe just rehire all the ones that were recently laid off.
1334355242486353921 2020-12-03 12:34:15 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @LawEnforceToday All in the name of stopping ‘systematic racism’ I guess.
1334350919035588610 2020-12-03 12:17:04 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @nanatez @RageGrl @KTLA Of course it’s the perpetrators fault! Nobody deserves to be murdered but you can’t deny people need to make responsible decisions for their own safety especially with a bunch of kids at home who will now sadly grow up without a mom and who knows if the dad(s) will step up.

1316466585289125888 2020-10-15 03:51:07 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @lalovestrump @jenvanlaar Exactly why I escaped LA county. Paying a fortune to live there and not safe to leave your home. My blood would boil every time I went outside and saw tents, druggies, broken RVs in my residential area...
1316465805467414528 2020-10-15 03:48:01 +0800 <HadEnoughCA1> @KTLAMorningNews And this is why more police is needed instead of defunding.
