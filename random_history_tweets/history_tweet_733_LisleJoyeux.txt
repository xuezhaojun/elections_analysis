When a property is sold, the depreciation is added back as part of the gain and taxed. Just ask the two co owners of your building. Stop selling your soul for a paycheck.

The spraycharts were so predictable where the cubs were hitting the ball. Everybody tried to pull the ball and hit it hard but at an infielder. Plus a pathetic farm.
