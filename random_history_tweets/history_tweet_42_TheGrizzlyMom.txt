1343820614902009856 2020-12-29 15:26:16 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SexCounseling Sludge and cowardice
1343635256658731009 2020-12-29 03:09:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts We need the republicans in both houses to stand up on their chairs and give us a "Captain, My Captain" moment! #DeadPoetsSociety
1343321564205334528 2020-12-28 06:23:13 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts Of course they do. Now let's re-visit the Las Vegas massacre.
1343320489872134144 2020-12-28 06:18:57 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @realstewpeters While we're at it, let's re-visit the Las Vegas massacre, too, shall we?
1343320092377944064 2020-12-28 06:17:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @realstewpeters Contrary to what @senatemajldr and his @GOP may think, we 80 million angry supporters of @realDonaldTrump will not be obediently crawling back. We have had enough. #StopTheSteal.
1343319444341182465 2020-12-28 06:14:47 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @realstewpeters And that bothers the swamp creatures on both sides of the aisle more than anything. We are taking names and will not forget. Or forgive.
1343094765814857730 2020-12-27 15:22:00 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @AZGOP @Destinbeach22 Of course he knows. He took the 30 pieces of silver. He won't be objecting.
1343069875019730950 2020-12-27 13:43:05 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MsAvaArmstrong And ended that way too
1343069302816030724 2020-12-27 13:40:49 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @EmeraldRobinson And @realDonaldTrump will be getting custody of 80-million plus of us who stand with our president. Bye bye @GOP
1343068535514271745 2020-12-27 13:37:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @amuse Revolting
1343042615466369026 2020-12-27 11:54:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @gregkellyusa The @GOP republicans long to make the swamp great again. They can do that without 80-plus million of us who ushered them in to office along with @realDonaldTrump. Hey 'pubs, instead perhaps you should #StopTheSteal!
1342997258610962432 2020-12-27 08:54:32 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @AdamBaldwin Ask them and I guarantee their audio systems will suddenly suffer technical difficulties. As happens whenever they are asked real questions.
1342996579888685056 2020-12-27 08:51:50 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SherryMAGA @RealDealAxelrod @GOP Those betrayers of the @GOP are truly deluded if they think those of us who had our votes stolen from @realDonaldTrump will just quietly reclaim our republican identities and follow them once more. Wrong! #StopTheSteaI
1342979788634374144 2020-12-27 07:45:07 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @EpochTimes @LindseyGrahamSC That's nice. What we want is @LindseyGrahamSC and every republican senator to stand up and object to certification on January 6th! #StopTheSteaI
1342979293723254790 2020-12-27 07:43:09 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @AdamBaldwin We need those names, which we will very soon. And we will never forget (or forgive).

1342977698566529024 2020-12-27 07:36:49 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @sandyleevincent @senatemajldr @GOP Because they're all one and the same and want to make the swamp great again!
1342717605509906434 2020-12-26 14:23:18 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MsAvaArmstrong In this spirit, here's hoping @RandPaul will also be one who objects to certification on January 6th. Please, Senator, #StopTheSteaI
1342712800402001920 2020-12-26 14:04:12 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @AussieQ4 @kek4freedom007 Revolting.
1342710886809530368 2020-12-26 13:56:36 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Feisty_FL Instead, out of cowardice and corruption, they are destroying themselves and their party. We will never forget or forgive.
1342706668153446401 2020-12-26 13:39:50 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MarshaBlackburn Senator, please be one who stands up and objects to certification on January 6th. It will be a day, and an act, that lives in infamy.
1342701091167735808 2020-12-26 13:17:40 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts Would so love to see most stand up and surprise us on January 6th. Won't hold my breath, but can hope.
1342689354892759045 2020-12-26 12:31:02 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @leachmanjohn @1Rubra @SidneyPowell1 @RNC @realDonaldTrump @LLinWood @senatemajldr @GOP @SenTedCruz @RandPaul @HawleyMO We will never forget. We will never forgive.
1342689148939878400 2020-12-26 12:30:13 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @catturd2 Wonder if @senatemajldr and the rest of the republicans are paying attention.
1342684514699493376 2020-12-26 12:11:48 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BritMartinez Nine Lives of Christmas is very cute
1342684315419693057 2020-12-26 12:11:01 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @humbolt47 @BritMartinez And she had to save something.

1342671836971032577 2020-12-26 11:21:26 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @gatewaypundit Please hold the line Coach @TTuberville, and ignore @senatemajldr and all who would betray @realDonaldTrump and our great nation.
1342667354665205760 2020-12-26 11:03:37 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts When will the republicans realize that #WeThePeople, we 80-plus-million who voted for @realDonaldTrump, do not stand with @senatemajldr or anyone who betrays us. #StopTheSteaI
1342664399966728193 2020-12-26 10:51:53 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @catturd2 @Geevers1 @gatewaypundit Stand strong, Coach! Don't listen to those who would betray America!
1342663688679948289 2020-12-26 10:49:03 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @senatemajldr #StopTheStealand and quit telling US senators to stand down! If you don't the republican party will no longer exist. We certainly won't be staying with those who betray us.
1342658773941243904 2020-12-26 10:29:31 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump And are you determined to object on January 6th? That's what matters right now senator. We expect you and your colleagues to #StopTheSteal. Do that and the rest will follow!
1342657575481798656 2020-12-26 10:24:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ColumbiaBugle Or if he thinks he can betray @realDonaldTrump and the 80-million-plus who voted for him and those occupying his coattails will stay with @senatemajldr and the republicans! Think again swampies!
1342624922498080770 2020-12-26 08:15:00 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> Please do the same, sir, on January 6th, oppose the fraudulent slates and #StopTheSteal.
1342618607801417729 2020-12-26 07:49:55 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> My all-time favorite
1342607389627875328 2020-12-26 07:05:20 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> Hold the line please Coach @TTuberville! What say you @tedcruz? What say you @RandPaul? What say you @RonJohnsonWI?
1342604719999516672 2020-12-26 06:54:44 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GOPLeader @StopTheSteal
1342602722302861312 2020-12-26 06:46:48 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SenRonJohnson Thank you Senator. Now please bless our country on this day by pledging to object to the fraud and #StopTheSteal.
1342601999716470784 2020-12-26 06:43:55 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @davidchapman141 In so doing, they created their own career-damaging, and party-damaging, moves. Good-bye republican party. @RandPaul @tedcruz
1342145559981768704 2020-12-25 00:30:12 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @PrivilegedLydia I am hoping certain republican senators are doing the same, just waiting for January 6th. @tedcruz @RandPaul
1341978298373427203 2020-12-24 13:25:33 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @newtgingrich Whatever, Newt.
1341945576498233346 2020-12-24 11:15:32 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Maximus_4EVR But we like when you say good night and then come back!🌌
1341849316462309376 2020-12-24 04:53:02 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @redsteeze @kylenabecker He did win.
1341812425616621570 2020-12-24 02:26:26 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LindseyGrahamSC I trust you will be objecting to the fraudulent slates on January 6th, yes?

1341625067231268865 2020-12-23 14:01:56 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TheRightMelissa God love you, @vp @Mike_Pence. You're our only hope.
1341604169866641410 2020-12-23 12:38:54 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Maximus_4EVR Please @VP have courage. You can save our great republic.

1341396042605072394 2020-12-22 22:51:53 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @senatemajldr @Wizard_Predicts You passed a democrat slush fund, nothing to do with covid relief. #StopTheSteaI and open the country.
1341164062290235392 2020-12-22 07:30:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @P8R1OT That was quick! Glad we have other options.
1341162946022367234 2020-12-22 07:25:38 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SenRonJohnson @STUinSD @RandPaul With this in mind I trust you and Senator Paul will be objecting officially to the fraudulent elector slates on January 6th. Please, sir, #StopTheSteaI
1341162303224381441 2020-12-22 07:23:05 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @CodeMonkeyZ It's looking like ACB doesn't love the Constitution quite as much as she thought.
1341138663703367680 2020-12-22 05:49:09 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TomFitton And we're surprised? My question is why is he still making decisions on anything?
1341138348677611520 2020-12-22 05:47:54 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @kelliwardaz Wow. Why is this person so angry if her candidate won fair and square? Please stay say Miss Kelli.
1341136846323994625 2020-12-22 05:41:55 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealDrGina @realDonaldTrump Not with election fraud, which will at that point be intitutionalized if this election is allowed to be stolen. We must #StopTheSteal now
1341132912775684096 2020-12-22 05:26:18 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @tymac265 @MikayesFiona Sure didn't take long.
1341132445316308992 2020-12-22 05:24:26 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SexCounseling And the republicans apparently find that a-okay. #StopTheSteaI!
1340876560035823616 2020-12-21 12:27:38 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @tracybeanz And many with masks don't want the vaccine either
1340874797933182977 2020-12-21 12:20:38 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Timcast None of the above
1340834843135905792 2020-12-21 09:41:52 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KDTGlobal @kylenabecker @Magister_Ludi_8 @Chirruped @rechtendesign @mikesasin Dear Senator @RandPaul, it must be fixed NOW with this election, which means all republican senators need to unite and object to the fraudulent slates on January 6th. Period.
1340751676408393728 2020-12-21 04:11:24 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JackPosobiec If they refuse to stand with courage, they do not deserve an office of any kind
1340751321364754433 2020-12-21 04:09:59 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @senatemajldr We need you and the republican senate to #StopTheSteal and object to the fraudulent elector slates. Chovid will solve itself. A stolen republic will not.
1340703920067203072 2020-12-21 01:01:38 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @marcorubio People are tired of weak republicans who refuse to block a fraudulent election. #StopTheSteal, Senator, or we will have no republic, no country.
1340558004786106369 2020-12-20 15:21:49 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SidneyPowell1 @realDonaldTrump You found the truth. And you are magnificent.  It's just the corrupt cowards who refuse to do their sworn duty.
1340550725747666945 2020-12-20 14:52:53 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @liquidlaugh Corrupt cowards need not apply.
1340542330944688128 2020-12-20 14:19:32 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SteveGuest @JennaEllisEsq So? The fix is in.  Again. So they can be as despicable as they want.

1340473999336194048 2020-12-20 09:48:00 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SJPFISH One and the same
1340473722440798208 2020-12-20 09:46:54 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GOPChairwoman Rally the party to object on January 6. I'm tired of the republicans wimping out and "taking the high road." #StopTheSteaI
1340407149676019712 2020-12-20 05:22:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KurtSchlichter @kylenabecker Well, given how wimpy so many men are acting these days, who knows.
1340406877927079937 2020-12-20 05:21:17 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DonaldJTrumpJr @kylenabecker More disgusting is that @LindseyGrahamSC has protected Biden all these years. And now he's failing to #StopTheSteaI
1340388340206510080 2020-12-20 04:07:38 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GOPChairwoman @KLoeffler @Perduesenate You could also be rallying the troops to #StopTheSteal, yes? But you're not.
1340386540090961922 2020-12-20 04:00:28 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @AndrewYang An armband with a yellow star perhaps? Read "In the Garden of the Beasts" and get back to me. @scrowder @HeyTammyBruce
1340385529179766784 2020-12-20 03:56:27 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Maximus_4EVR @SidneyPowell1 Our nation was not founded by cowardly men. The corruption and cowardice we are witnessing today are staggering.

1340384055502667780 2020-12-20 03:50:36 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @FranMFarber @kylenabecker If they get away with this steal -- which the republicans are allowing--any future "elections" will be one big show.
1340367309093785602 2020-12-20 02:44:03 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Maximus_4EVR @realDonaldTrump Our country was not founded by cowardly men. Ignore the threats and do your job!
1340367096102809605 2020-12-20 02:43:13 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Maximus_4EVR And they all apparently wimped out?  What's the point of being on a committee if we have no country?
1340366730309165059 2020-12-20 02:41:45 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts At this point, that's the only remedy. @realDonaldTrump, our Commander-in-Chief and his few trusted souls must act to save our republic.
1340365825165824006 2020-12-20 02:38:10 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @senatemajldr Protect our republic, support @realDonaldTrump, sign on to object to the fraudulent elector slates, and please, for God's sake, #StopTheSteal!
1340215950365270017 2020-12-19 16:42:37 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SexCounseling @KelemenCari @tedcruz @andybiggs4az How truly beautiful that would be. But the corruption and cowardice run far too deep, as we are seeing on a daily basis. Save the grandstanding, republicans. We need action. @tedcruz
1340208063400222720 2020-12-19 16:11:16 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @liquidlaugh Nope. They don't.
1340201686019657729 2020-12-19 15:45:56 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BillFOXLA Bless you, sir. You are one of the only journalists who truly deserves the mantle. Happy holidays to you and enjoy your break.
1340160947755728897 2020-12-19 13:04:03 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @senatemajldr How about you fight to #stopthesteal and gather the senate to object to fraudulent elector slates.
1340157599153410049 2020-12-19 12:50:45 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LLinWood @CodeMonkeyZ This is a bonafide threat to our national security. It cannot stand.
1340153237337346049 2020-12-19 12:33:25 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @EmeraldRobinson You still have time to fix this @senatemajldr
1340144072980275200 2020-12-19 11:57:00 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts I had such high hopes for AG Cameron.
1340126122961342464 2020-12-19 10:45:40 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @sjme102 @ScottFishman @ScottPresler @RudyGiuliani @LLinWood @PhillDKline @RepMoBrooks @JennaEllisEsq @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Definitely viable! But our elected officials, so-called patriots, keep betraying us. The cesspool lives.
1340110881074475009 2020-12-19 09:45:06 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts We won't forget. Anything. Ever.
1340075463432044545 2020-12-19 07:24:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GOPLeader Congressman, if you really care about what is going on, start fighting to correct the massive steal of this election, object to the fraudulent elector slates and demand that the true republican slates be certified. We've had enough with weakness and corruption. #StopTheSteal
1340066893986590721 2020-12-19 06:50:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BillWhiteNY @GaSecofState @GabrielSterling @JordyFuchs @GBI_GA This time they'll make sure the cameras are blocked.
1340041643899043841 2020-12-19 05:09:59 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> Apparently some republican governors are, too.
1340041342081064960 2020-12-19 05:08:47 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DiamondandSilk That would be epic.
1340041111646031873 2020-12-19 05:07:52 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @toddstarnes @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump And Rubio should be primaried ASAP
1340037739958321152 2020-12-19 04:54:28 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @49Alicat @ChuckCallesto They apparently don't need to pack the court.
1340036745186824198 2020-12-19 04:50:31 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts A country of corrupt cowards, all down the line. This is appalling.
1340011289179897857 2020-12-19 03:09:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Maximus_4EVR Well, one of my senators is trying to become the president...er, I mean vice president...right now, so that's not going to happen. But I'm contacting senators from other states!
1339979145879539714 2020-12-19 01:01:38 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @davestwittylife Read the book "The Natashas" and see if you still hold that opinion.
1339977715781312512 2020-12-19 00:55:57 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @newsmax Love you @SidneyPowell1, our warrior queen, but when they refuse, we'll now know why.
1339973638968119296 2020-12-19 00:39:45 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SammiG0203 Absolutely! At least I have to remind myself each time. It will never become second nature to me.
1339946614543171585 2020-12-18 22:52:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @AmyKremer @Raiklin @TTuberville And where are all the others who should be joining him? @tedcruz @RandPaul @HawleyMO @SenTomCotton @SenRonJohnson   to name a few. Stand together.
1339788580755935233 2020-12-18 12:24:24 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Raiklin Time for all the other senators who talk about saving the republic step up, too. @tedcruz @HawleyMO @SenTomCotton @RandPaul and @SenRickScott to name a few
1339758031492399105 2020-12-18 10:23:00 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SenTomCotton Senator, please sign on to object to the fraudulent elector slates. we need you to help #StopTheSteaI. Many thanks from our great republic.
1339756160832827392 2020-12-18 10:15:34 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Maximus_4EVR If done properly, could this make the run-off unnecessary?
1339755688096980992 2020-12-18 10:13:42 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> And you @tedcruz  And you @HawleyMO
1339735025026179072 2020-12-18 08:51:35 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @senatemajldr #StopTheSteal
1339734765260263424 2020-12-18 08:50:33 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TheRightMelissa Time for him to recuse himself.
1339725043559923712 2020-12-18 08:11:55 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @AngelWarrior321 That's great, but will republican watchers have to stand 100 feet away?
1339716430044909568 2020-12-18 07:37:42 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SexCounseling Not
1339711442035953664 2020-12-18 07:17:53 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Maximus_4EVR The PWs can sit right on top of the proceedings with plexiglass and masks. And cameras.
1339698517120438273 2020-12-18 06:26:31 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Mrsmmtbeauty @WashTimes With republican observers 100 feet away?
1339697593316569088 2020-12-18 06:22:51 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MArepublican18 @Mrsmmtbeauty Now he needs to be joined by @tedcruz, @SenTomCotton, @RandPaul, @SenRonJohnson and @HawleyMO -- indeed all the republicans if, as they say, the want to preserve this nation.
1339689478873513984 2020-12-18 05:50:36 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @HawleyMO @ColumbiaBugle I trust you will also be signing on officially as a Senatorial objection to the fraudulent elector slates? We need you and every republican senator to engage in this fight.
1339688433829089280 2020-12-18 05:46:27 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Longtimepatriot @SidneyPowell1 @LLinWood @BillWhiteNY @marklevinshow @GovMikeHuckabee @RichardGrenell @MariaBartiromo @Scavino45 @LouDobbs @jbinnall @SaraCarterDC @GaSecofState And I guess that's fine with the @GOP, @GOPChairwoman and @senatemajldr
1339688104651677697 2020-12-18 05:45:09 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SidneyPowell1 @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn @POTUS @Scavino45 @marklevinshow @BillWhiteNY @GovMikeHuckabee @jbinnall @LLinWood @SaraCarterDC @LouDobbs @BluntForceTrut1 @RichardGrenell @BarbaraRedgate Unprecedented corruption, I'd say.
1339687885599952897 2020-12-18 05:44:16 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @StewardshipAmer Looks like it didn't take long for ACB to realize she doesn't love the Constitution quite as much as she thought.
1339685652703498247 2020-12-18 05:35:24 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @tedcruz @kylenabecker With all due respect, Senator, perhaps your first priority right now should be committing to blocking the fraudulent elector slates as a senatorial objection. Please help our republic.
1339681664046309382 2020-12-18 05:19:33 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BoSnerdley What say you @tedcruz? @SenTomCotton? @SenRonJohnson? All the others constantly professing love and loyalty to the republic? Time to prove that patriotism.
1339664091527274496 2020-12-18 04:09:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Jim_Jordan @ScottUSApatriot Please join @RepMoBrooks and your brethren who are vowing to block the the fraudulent slates. You have the power to save our republic.
1339661824497569794 2020-12-18 04:00:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Maximus_4EVR @GaSecofState And I'm sure the @GOP finds this peachy keen, right @senatemajldr?
1339613013280653312 2020-12-18 00:46:45 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @EmeraldRobinson The @GOP weaklings don't realize that if they don't fix it THIS time, there will be no republican party. Eighty million of us will abandon them for the Patriot party, corrupt cowards need not apply.
1339598853817810946 2020-12-17 23:50:29 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LadyRedWave And why aren't used masks treated as hazardous biological waste?
1339458878681935872 2020-12-17 14:34:17 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GayLatina4Trump I grew up with Maltese dogs. They are wonderful. But of course, ALL dogs are wonderful!
1339458144834002944 2020-12-17 14:31:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @jjauthor With observers right on top of each one!
1339453981567827968 2020-12-17 14:14:49 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @anthonykernAZ @ali @EagleEdMartin @realDonaldTrump Thank you, sir. May your courage be contagious.
1339426886238138369 2020-12-17 12:27:09 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @redwins3_first @GOP And we will remember every corrupt coward who betrayed #WeThePeople and our republic.
1339426502664835073 2020-12-17 12:25:38 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GayLatina4Trump What a cutie. And kudos for responsible dog ownership!
1339426190356959233 2020-12-17 12:24:23 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @senatemajldr The American people need our representatives and senators to stand up and fight for our republic. Refuse the fraudulent electors and #StopTheSteaI.
1339413672033091584 2020-12-17 11:34:39 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @redwins3_first @RandPaul Indeed. And now both @RandPaul and @SenRonJohnson need to sign on to #StopTheSteal. And get their conservative brethren to join them. @tedcruz, @TomCottonAR, @HawleyMO and @ScottforFlorida to name a few. We thank you for fighting for our republic!
1339410811953922049 2020-12-17 11:23:17 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @danhill2011 @ScottUSApatriot The typical scenario. Time for the new Patriot party, 80 million strong right out of the gate. No corrupt cowards need apply.
1339409802980589568 2020-12-17 11:19:16 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DevoidMichael @iheartmindy @Annakhait @RealMattCouch @PatriotPartyNV @AZPatriotParty @IDPatriotParty Eighty million strong right out of the gate -- and very, very angry. No corrupt cowards allowed.
1339408203033968643 2020-12-17 11:12:55 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BreitbartNews Who?  We're so over these Hollywood dweebs.
1339405630247895041 2020-12-17 11:02:41 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Raiklin Even contact representatives and senators from states not your own. They need to know they are fighting for all Americans (real voters, not just algorithms and blank sheets of paper), and we have their backs!
1339403115183755264 2020-12-17 10:52:42 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @jim_desmond Bravo! Every restaurant, every business, in the country should follow your lead. Enough is enough!
1339390445877489665 2020-12-17 10:02:21 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @marklevinshow And the cowardly, corrupt republicans are more than happy to assist them in that.
1339389669457317888 2020-12-17 09:59:16 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @marklevinshow It sure didn't take ACB long to realize that perhaps she doesn't love the Constitution as much as she thought!
1339381659452358657 2020-12-17 09:27:26 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Maximus_4EVR How wonderful it would be if all the republicans would sign on to save the republic. Come on guys!
1339372426971365376 2020-12-17 08:50:45 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Raiklin @RepMoBrooks @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr @GOPLeader @NRCC @NRSC Those who refuse to sign ... well we know what's going on there, don't we?
1339370121370849280 2020-12-17 08:41:35 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TheRyanRoberts @1AmericanWoman How wonderful it would be if every republican in congress would step up like that, but far too many are far too compromised.
1339367711407673344 2020-12-17 08:32:01 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @toddstarnes @Wizard_Predicts @realDonaldTrump They are making it very obvious -- and we will remember. They're also thinking all DJT's voters will stay with them. Boy are they wrong. Patriot party here we come.
1339355226130661376 2020-12-17 07:42:24 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RepBarryMoore @Raiklin @RepMoBrooks @mtgreenee So @tedcruz? @SenTomCotton? @RandPaul? Show us you're not all talk
1339353362978938880 2020-12-17 07:35:00 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @jessiprincey And it will disappear. The DNI was our last bastion.
1339350180542308353 2020-12-17 07:22:21 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @C_3C_3 @STUinSD Would be a simple ruling for a court, any court, to make.
1339349857287303169 2020-12-17 07:21:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @marklevinshow It didn't take long for ACB to realize she doesn't love the Constitution as much as she thought.
1339349255937425409 2020-12-17 07:18:41 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @waynegone @marklevinshow It sure didn't take ACB long to realize she doesn't love the Constitution as much as she thought.
1339346298625900544 2020-12-17 07:06:56 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Barnes_Law Without @realDonaldTrump -- and #WeThePeople -- they cease to exist. Welcome Patriot party, no RINO weaklings allowed.
1339305358943166464 2020-12-17 04:24:15 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @PhillDKline And they're doing it again in GA
1339304654702690304 2020-12-17 04:21:27 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts Once again, fraud right out in the open. And at this point they're just laughing about it
1339303568021458944 2020-12-17 04:17:08 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Raiklin @senatemajldr @GenFlynn I never thought of him as a defender of the Constitution. I think you could probably count on one hand the elected officials -- and apparently SCOTUS justices -- who are.
1339275939570536449 2020-12-17 02:27:21 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RyanAFournier And Ric is a warrior patriot. Pete...not.
1339274374486978566 2020-12-17 02:21:08 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @sandyleevincent @newsmax Done with them too then. We have plenty of other sources for news
1339271530744672256 2020-12-17 02:09:50 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JackPosobiec Not to mention the fact that none of them have ever read the Constitution.
1339267292534693888 2020-12-17 01:52:59 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JackPosobiec Portman sure likes him. What a nauseating display that was!
1339261568719065088 2020-12-17 01:30:14 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JackPosobiec It's nauseating watching Krebs and Portman slobbering all over each other right now. Portman is very pleased with the fine job Krebs did with the election.
1339261281618911232 2020-12-17 01:29:06 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @alexbruesewitz @Wizard_Predicts Krebs and Portman are slobbering all over each other right now. Disgusting.
1339253478275731460 2020-12-17 00:58:06 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @kylenabecker So the Dominion guy yesterday lied? I'm shocked, shocked I tell you.
1339252734877257728 2020-12-17 00:55:08 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @alexbruesewitz @Wizard_Predicts @RonJohnsonWI @C_C_Krebs And thank you @RonJohnsonWI for ignoring the threats from @senatemajldr.  #HoldTheLine and #StopTheSteal
1339143202880688131 2020-12-16 17:39:54 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JennaEllisEsq And we are real people, not blank pieces of paper and algorithms.
1339089009532801024 2020-12-16 14:04:33 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @kylenabecker Once again, I guess ACB doesn't love the Constitution as much as we thought.
1339088633656004610 2020-12-16 14:03:03 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @kylenabecker Apparently they are.
1339088424049860611 2020-12-16 14:02:14 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GordonGChang @kylenabecker Corruption
1339088296689876992 2020-12-16 14:01:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @kylenabecker Hey @tedcruz, we need to hear from you on this, too! Stand up to @senatemajldr and protect our republic. You too, @RandPaul.
1339025794924826624 2020-12-16 09:53:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RepMoBrooks Please keep fighting, Sir. Ignore the swamp creatures and save our republic!
1339025242740559872 2020-12-16 09:51:10 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BreitbartNews @Wizard_Predicts Almost sounds like a threat
1339024221817618432 2020-12-16 09:47:07 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Maximus_4EVR He's the same as Kemp
1339010817967095809 2020-12-16 08:53:51 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DLoesch The testosterone shortage in this country is so sad.
1338985103075098626 2020-12-16 07:11:40 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @jimbielar @Wizard_Predicts How will any of that happen if the fraud strategies and equipment are not being corrected -- by anyone, including the republicans?
1338984452693757952 2020-12-16 07:09:05 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @llgibson1967 @Wizard_Predicts Love this logo!
1338984185420136454 2020-12-16 07:08:01 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @iheartmindy @Wizard_Predicts @PatriotPartyNV @AZPatriotParty @IDPatriotParty I'm in.
1338983435503747073 2020-12-16 07:05:02 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts Well said! Either way, once this is all over, millions will be leaving the republican party, the leaders of which will soon see they are NOTHING without @realDonaldTrump
1338936205933604865 2020-12-16 03:57:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @CrystalCarterL This way the MSM can claim that the fraud has been debunked. Nothing to see here 😡
1338932926335967232 2020-12-16 03:44:20 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Maximus_4EVR Let them know they have clearly been had by a SOS who is officially embracing his identity as a democrat. Time for republicans to fight if they still want a party.
1338928141536960512 2020-12-16 03:25:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @kylenabecker If our country gives a stamp of approval to the biggest, most disgusting and obvious steal in history, we have no country anymore (oh, and no republican party either, @senatemajldr).
1338910077932093440 2020-12-16 02:13:32 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RyanAFournier @kylenabecker Okay SCOTUS, now do a blatantly stolen election.
1338695948235468801 2020-12-15 12:02:40 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DC_Draino The thought occurred to me too. I guess we'll see.
1338685538140712960 2020-12-15 11:21:18 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts The #SurrenderCaucus needs to be reminded that without @realDonaldTrump, there will be no more republican party. We will all be heading out to the new Patriot party, 80 million strong, where "surrender" is not in our vocabulary.
1338636438984740864 2020-12-15 08:06:12 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @survivalchick21 @Rothbard1776 Remember when she wouldn't "allow" the people in her state to buy seeds? Yes. Evil.
1338604313346654209 2020-12-15 05:58:33 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Jillie_Alexis I'm old enough to remember when Whitmer wouldn't allow her subjects to buy seeds.
1338601270848851968 2020-12-15 05:46:27 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @laurenboebert Remember it was the Michigan governor who forbade the citizens of Michigan from buying seeds.
1338598877759381504 2020-12-15 05:36:57 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts God bless them and please keep them safe.
1338567293354143745 2020-12-15 03:31:26 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BrandonStraka Nope. Only if he's conceding.
1338564829292888064 2020-12-15 03:21:39 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @tracybeanz God bless them and please keep them safe.
1338548476758564865 2020-12-15 02:16:40 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Maximus_4EVR God bless them!
1338338813421076480 2020-12-14 12:23:32 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KMCRadio @kansas_sun And a minute later we'll hear that the public, the people of Michigan, have no standing to see the results.
1338311820096860164 2020-12-14 10:36:17 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @sandyleevincent @GOP If the @GOP doesn't fix this NOW, there will be no next time.

1338239835455115264 2020-12-14 05:50:14 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @kylenabecker Corrupt to the core -- on both sides of the aisle. "Learning" isn't even on the menu.
1338239097148608512 2020-12-14 05:47:18 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RyanAFournier Or, better yet, run the FBI.
1338212339791740929 2020-12-14 04:00:59 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @PrivilegedLydia Meanwhile the likes of Whoopi, Ben Stiller and the Fonz will have a grand gala to celebrate the perpetrator.
1338181979955556352 2020-12-14 02:00:20 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SexCounseling @realDonaldTrump is our Commander-in-Chief and this infiltration, this corruption, this "election," this chaos is a clear and present danger to our national security. Period.
1338180538482511872 2020-12-14 01:54:37 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @newtgingrich Maybe he was. Gavin didn't even campaign.
1338147176661143556 2020-12-13 23:42:03 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @atensnut So glad you were born! Happy birthday, ma'am.

1337924171204947968 2020-12-13 08:55:54 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @CodeMonkeyZ This obvious attempt to steal the 2020 election is a profound threat to our national security, coming from enemies both foreign and domestic.
1337901981784895489 2020-12-13 07:27:44 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DFBHarvard Why bother having any judge or elected official take the oath to the Constitution? It's a joke to them.
1337900361386889217 2020-12-13 07:21:17 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @thebradfordfile We've certainly been trying but they are in severe denial. Come on new Patriot party!
1337891350549696512 2020-12-13 06:45:29 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JennaEllisEsq That 126 needs to join us 80 million Americans who support @realDonaldTrump and launch the Patriot party.
1337800996991291393 2020-12-13 00:46:27 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ScottAdamsSays And get rid of that whole elected-officials-take-an-oath-to-the-Constitution thing. It's just a joke to them.
1337620839777243136 2020-12-12 12:50:34 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @EddieV27571181 @hrtablaze @PatrioticTexanV Thinking that may be true, but right now I just want to be mad.
1337613495794192384 2020-12-12 12:21:23 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BeholdIsrael So all the disenfranchised voters in those 4 states need to bring their own massive lawsuits to their corrupt states. They certainly have standing.
1337612476892860416 2020-12-12 12:17:20 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @AndroskiBradley @catturd2 I kind of think that, too, but right now I want to be mad.
1337597808644243458 2020-12-12 11:19:03 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts Can the millions of disenfranchised voters in those four states file massive lawsuits against their own states then based on all the massive fraud? They certainly have standing.
1337593522363363328 2020-12-12 11:02:01 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @gatewaypundit @votedegrammont @mdeperno @realDonaldTrump We'll apparently that's okay now. Right, SCOTUS?
1337589014778400769 2020-12-12 10:44:06 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @votedegrammont Will SCOTUS be striking it down?
1337580048656711681 2020-12-12 10:08:29 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @tracybeanz I guess ACB really doesn't love the Constitution after all.
1337576974156382209 2020-12-12 09:56:16 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @marklevinshow They had to know that, though. Even I know they'll become nobodies in a court-packed sea of 15, 27, 33...whatever it is. They have to know that.
1337575523610849280 2020-12-12 09:50:30 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @C_3C_3 The Dems now know they have nothing to worry about. Don't even have to pack the court.
1337572459965370370 2020-12-12 09:38:20 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @punterspunt @Maximus_4EVR @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Whether the plan or not, it certainly did that. Showed the Dems, too, that they have nothing to worry about with ACB and Kavanaugh.
1337572063729479681 2020-12-12 09:36:45 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @jaloolie @Maximus_4EVR @POTUS @realDonaldTrump True. We're back where we were on Monday, but now SCOTUS has outed itself, too.
1337571239875944448 2020-12-12 09:33:29 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Maximus_4EVR Hope they enjoy being nobodies in a court-packed sea of 15, 27, 33...however it ends up.
1337569281798594560 2020-12-12 09:25:42 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts All those Dems worried about the confirmation of ACB, no worries guys. She's got your back.
1337550048289177600 2020-12-12 08:09:16 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Concealcarrygrl @barmore27 Apparently 7 of these justices want to be nobodies in a sea of 19, 25, 33 what have you, as they have made another step closer to court packing.
1337543230871588864 2020-12-12 07:42:11 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ClaudineMinogue @CNN Yes! They cheated all in plain view. Oh and CNN, they also said it was bogus, man.
1337517343996432385 2020-12-12 05:59:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @EmeraldRobinson And the vast majority of elected officials
1337503064463298560 2020-12-12 05:02:34 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @luvkit @Barnes_Law @benshapiro Did anyone else hear him cite CNN as a source the other day? Or was I hearing things?
1337501647228977158 2020-12-12 04:56:56 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @IvanPentchoukov @Wizard_Predicts This is a turning point for political careers coast to coast. @DanielCameronAG seemed a rising star after the convention. We'll see if he was truly worthy of the admiration. #StopTheSteal
1337438449863806976 2020-12-12 00:45:49 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KelemenCari I've been saying the same. I really don't think these 9 SCOTUS justices want to become inconsequential in a sea of 26, and the issues at hand are solidly unconstitutional.
1337258426544504834 2020-12-11 12:50:28 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GeorgePapa19 Or believe that there will even be a republican party left after tens of millions of angry populists abandon them for the new Patriot party
1337253124092792836 2020-12-11 12:29:24 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts So what's up with Idaho's Governor and AG?
1337178067416977419 2020-12-11 07:31:09 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KamVTV And while we're at it, the rights of #WeThePeople come from our creator, not from the government.
1337168846298312707 2020-12-11 06:54:31 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @liquidlaugh The justices will also become 9 nobodies in a SCOTUS of 15, 21, 27...I don't think they want that.
1337148308477730817 2020-12-11 05:32:54 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Maximus_4EVR @RepBryanCutler @RepBenninghoff Do those House republicans sitting this out realize that without @realDonaldTrump there will be no more republican party? We are ready to move on to the Patriot party, 80 million strong, and very, very angry.
1337111832922746881 2020-12-11 03:07:57 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @my3monkees @WilkowMajority Leaving the SCOTUS justices to become inconsequential among a sea of 15, 21, 25....is that what they want?
1337090006603612161 2020-12-11 01:41:14 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RobertJohnDavi @realDonaldTrump This election and the China exposure are bonafide threats to our national security. This cannot stand.
1337059442710491137 2020-12-10 23:39:47 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JackPosobiec But President Trump won in a landslide. Hence the sloppy fraud.
1336961050990669826 2020-12-10 17:08:48 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DrShayPhD Time for him to concede, perhaps?
1336960488656146433 2020-12-10 17:06:34 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @pnjaban Now that we know about Dominion, how do we know how anyone really votes in California? Gavin never even campaigned. Now we know why.
1336942148332097536 2020-12-10 15:53:42 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @AdamBaldwin You guys are awesome for so many reasons (our family: big fans of Justified and The Last Ship). Down here in Orange County, we walk freely without masks.  #RecallGavinNewsom
1336939682974711808 2020-12-10 15:43:54 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RobSchneider So sad. And my family, including several 4th-generation natives, are making similar plans.
1336938807845797889 2020-12-10 15:40:25 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RobertPLewis By the way, I'm speaking of the SCOTUS
1336938486222372864 2020-12-10 15:39:08 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RobertPLewis There is also that pesky court-packing issue, which would mean the current 9 would become anonymous among a sea of 15, 21, 25...what have you. I don't think they want that.
1336937700583043072 2020-12-10 15:36:01 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GeorgePapa19 Yup. Eighty million strong, angry as hornets, and, unlike republicans, not willing to cave it back down!
1336891013441339394 2020-12-10 12:30:30 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @gracesaldanaa @Destinbeach22 While I'm sure California is more red than election results indicate, the CA AG is hoping to join a fraudulent Biden administration, so no way he's signing up.
1336889392535797761 2020-12-10 12:24:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @lesleyanne821 @SenWilliamLigon @GaSecofState @DavidShafer And for the people of the United States!
1336889023738998786 2020-12-10 12:22:36 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @jjjjgg27 @SenWilliamLigon @DavidShafer @GaSecofState And on behalf of voters in other states, too, who are seeing their votes stolen! Thank you, Senator. May others follow your lead!
1336887648690921474 2020-12-10 12:17:08 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MichaelCoudrey @dougmastriano should join as well! @SenMastriano

1336880874042712066 2020-12-10 11:50:13 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SpoonfulsaSugar @kylenabecker I really don't think they're all that excited about court packing either. I imagine they'd rather be a group of 9, than a group of 15, 21, 25...
1336879983927541765 2020-12-10 11:46:40 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @kylenabecker @CCreboot Also the death knell for their own SCOTUS positions, as the promised court packing will make them inconsequential and obsolete.
1336878845538889728 2020-12-10 11:42:09 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @1MagaPatriot @LisaS4680 That's why we need a new Patriot party, which will certainly know how to fight, thanks to @realDonaldTrump

1336873411876777984 2020-12-10 11:20:33 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TimRunsHisMouth @RichardGrenell Same
1336870526728355840 2020-12-10 11:09:06 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KamVTV And how about some complicit state houses, too?
1336867688618971138 2020-12-10 10:57:49 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @jsolomonReports Every republican should do that!  Our national security is under attack.
1336865486038962179 2020-12-10 10:49:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ClrGdr97 @DavidJHarrisJr Same happened in our household. They all stopped counting at the same time, and remember, @realDonaldTrump was up 700,000 in Pennsylvania when everyone went to bed that night. This cannot stand.
1336860164519948288 2020-12-10 10:27:55 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @PaulGill_Hawaii @Barnes_Law Sure doesn't seem like it.

1336779520989282304 2020-12-10 05:07:28 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealJamesWoods Interesting that #TexasLawSuit is trending. I thought the other side knows nothing about #StopTheSteal.
1336773345895837697 2020-12-10 04:42:56 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SebGorka Domestic terrorism must be prosecuted.
1336772499204235264 2020-12-10 04:39:34 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Barnes_Law Okay, Wyoming and Idaho: your turn!
1336744477080264704 2020-12-10 02:48:13 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JenniferNPL1 @MajorPatriot Your vote, along with every legal American vote,  was rendered null and void by those in other states perpetrating a steal. This cannot stand.
1336743057408970752 2020-12-10 02:42:35 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TheDaytonian937 @MajorPatriot No American votes were protected.
1336742830648086529 2020-12-10 02:41:40 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @vlynpowell @MajorPatriot @GeboyCindy Yet the fraudulent activity in other states rendered your vote -- and 80 million others -- null and void. This situation must not stand.
1336738674667520000 2020-12-10 02:25:10 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Ruth171125 @Carol38553 @zhangtianliang But they should be loyal to their own jobs! Why would they want to open the door to court packing by permitting the steal?
1336737347459682306 2020-12-10 02:19:53 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BibleBeltDarlin So do I!
1336736560817950720 2020-12-10 02:16:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @realDonaldTrump This so-called election is a profound threat to our national security. We are teetering, sir, and you are our Commander-in-Chief.
1336735303927664641 2020-12-10 02:11:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Roberts1865 @LuisEsp65 @kylenabecker And thus render themselves inconsequential and obsolete by opening the door to court packing.
1336734775399202817 2020-12-10 02:09:40 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @jessiprincey @RedWhiteNCurry @kylenabecker I still don't understand why the SCOTUS justices would render themselves inconsequential by a ruling that would lead to court packing.
1336732962151231488 2020-12-10 02:02:28 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @mizdonna Exactly! Aside from the clear unconstitutional issues behind this election chaos, do the SCOTUS justices really want to render themselves inconsequential with court packing?
1336715627306741761 2020-12-10 00:53:35 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LarrySchweikart Why bother having any of them take the oath to the Constitution?  It's just a joke to them.
1336715155728596992 2020-12-10 00:51:42 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LarrySchweikart So they will instead side with voter fraud and a stolen election, which will ultimately result in their being rendered inconsequential by court packing. If that happens, we are nothing.
1336543180251000833 2020-12-09 13:28:20 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @VickiMDonovan @liquidlaugh Last I checked The French Laundry is also open.

1336488932100329472 2020-12-09 09:52:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SexCounseling @marklevinshow Do the justices really want to share their exalted position with a bunch of leftists that get shoved in through court packing? I gotta believe they like being the only nine.
1336464890844774400 2020-12-09 08:17:14 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @WayneDupreeShow We'll have to see
1336449822891548672 2020-12-09 07:17:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DonaldJTrumpJr Looks like they may have targeted a certain republican governor, as well
1336449577650507776 2020-12-09 07:16:24 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @gatewaypundit God bless this American hero. Please stay safe, sir!

1336447899312349187 2020-12-09 07:09:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DrShayPhD Okay Idaho and Wyoming, your turn...
1336444193208602624 2020-12-09 06:55:00 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BuzzPatterson That would be awesome, but won't happen. I wish there was a way Trump voters trapped in swamp blue states could join as individuals.

1336362320537112577 2020-12-09 01:29:40 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MajorPatriot @jfradioshow The word "afraid" must not be in the vocabulary of anyone charged with the duty of protecting our republic. If it is, step down and let the patriots take the reins.
1336354033301221378 2020-12-09 00:56:44 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @AndrewPollackFL And a profound threat to our national security. #Fixit

1336351486515671040 2020-12-09 00:46:37 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TheOfficerTatum Time for the launch of the new Patriot party, don'tcha think? Eighty million very angry Americans right out of the gate.
1336182991777755138 2020-12-08 13:37:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @issaTrumpCard @jjauthor Exactly! His arrogance was (and is) shocking. He didn't even pretend.
1336181525792976896 2020-12-08 13:31:15 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @jjauthor Gavin didn't even campaign. He knew the fix was in.
1336181291780173824 2020-12-08 13:30:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @robjh1 Just another reminder that this corruption and this so-called election has become and profound threat to our national security. It cannot be ignored or brushed under a rug.
1336180914083123200 2020-12-08 13:28:49 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LLinWood @GeoffDuncanGA Sick and tired of republicans caving to bullying and hiding behind cowradice and corruption. Stand up for your country!
1336171419453943809 2020-12-08 12:51:05 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> Thank you, Senator @tedcruz, for fighting for @realDonaldTrump and our republic. I was mad this weekend because of the @GOP failing to fight, but I thank you for being on the front lines. Godspeed!
1336153352560787458 2020-12-08 11:39:18 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @bennyjohnson @Species10 That's become extremely obvious over the past weeks. The corruption and this election are bonafide threats to our national security.
1336152642234433536 2020-12-08 11:36:29 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @redwins3_first I certainly want to. And in my heart I really don't believe they want to render themselves inconsequential by permitting the steal and thus opening the door to a packed court
1336133341829984256 2020-12-08 10:19:47 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @scrowder I have a feeling that kid is going to be showered with nerf guns.
1336130085951164417 2020-12-08 10:06:51 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GOP @SenRickScott If that's true about republicans, then they need to stand up and defend our republic and stop hiding behind cowardice and corruption.
1336093234687184896 2020-12-08 07:40:25 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BrianSh86084519 @Maximus_4EVR I really don't think they want to render themselves inconsequential.
1336090552530432000 2020-12-08 07:29:45 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @CPriceDenver @JennaEllisEsq @GaSecofState I frankly don't see the @GOP at large doing much in terms of fighting.
1336076215757762563 2020-12-08 06:32:47 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KelemenCari This entire fiasco of an election is a matter of National Security.
1336072825912786945 2020-12-08 06:19:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MsAvaArmstrong Well,there is if you're a conservative.
1336055033935220737 2020-12-08 05:08:37 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @tedcruz Godspeed, Senator Cruz. Thank you for fighting.
1336054390776479746 2020-12-08 05:06:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @marklevinshow Courage is indeed contagious. What we're seeing in republican legislators and governors, cowardice certainly is contagious, too. I pray the Supreme Court Justices are immune to the latter.
1336053469648568320 2020-12-08 05:02:24 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @AppSame Hope the machines mandated by @GovKemp don't switch their votes to democrat, but at this point, with all the republican cowardice and corruption, that's certainly a possibility.
1336052784462876672 2020-12-08 04:59:41 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Mrsmmtbeauty I wish every business of every kind would just open their doors and do business as usual. They can't arrest us all. Or, better yet, just rename every business of every kind "The French Laundry."
1336007300574629890 2020-12-08 01:58:56 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Maximus_4EVR Of ALL republicans.
1336005374374072325 2020-12-08 01:51:17 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TomFitton @robjh1 @SidneyPowell1 The cowardice and corruption in this country right now is staggering.

1335855787004981249 2020-12-07 15:56:53 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Thomas1774Paine I guess Biden's pro-infanticide position is fine with him, too.

1335802659622637568 2020-12-07 12:25:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @kelliwardaz The cowardice and corruption in this nation is stunning. Get these "men" some testosterone!
1335802355464372225 2020-12-07 12:24:34 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @catturd2 And if masks work, why shut down any businesses?
1335801979910516736 2020-12-07 12:23:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MaureenWolf1 @drdavidsamadi Me too, and I knew plenty of people who had the swine flu.
1335798371248828416 2020-12-07 12:08:44 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SebGorka Why not right now?
1335795990800998400 2020-12-07 11:59:16 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts Corrupt coward.
1335795776056827904 2020-12-07 11:58:25 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Maximus_4EVR Yes, but the cowardice and corruption among these so-called men is disgusting.
1335761020258639873 2020-12-07 09:40:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @catturd2 It's all about control of the masses, the reason the left exists.
1335760142948679680 2020-12-07 09:36:49 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @EricMMatheny And this election has become a threat to our national security.
1335757182516617216 2020-12-07 09:25:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MsAvaArmstrong And quite a few republicans too
1335706665459437568 2020-12-07 06:04:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @newtgingrich Now please tell those Georgia voting officials to fix their system first. Otherwise what's the point?

1335701239971999744 2020-12-07 05:42:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LaurenWitzkeDE This so-called election has become a genuine threat to our national security.
1335697839280689152 2020-12-07 05:29:15 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ScottAdamsSays @OcrazioCornPop Yes! This entire election has become a national-security threat. It cannot stand.
1335697164350021632 2020-12-07 05:26:34 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @davereaboi @FoxNews @newsmax Same.  Whole extended family in multiple states.

1335680339855855616 2020-12-07 04:19:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LLinWood @GaSecofState Can other GA voters join you in this?
1335676658871750656 2020-12-07 04:05:05 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @CindyKendrick11 This "election," this steal, this chaos, has become a genuine threat to our national security.
1335676318436839424 2020-12-07 04:03:44 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ScottFishman I did. Because of the millions of everyday Americans, we the people.
1335675845910753280 2020-12-07 04:01:51 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RyanAFournier They have no argument against it. Ever again.
1335485754324054022 2020-12-06 15:26:30 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @mikandynothem Given that this happened coast to coast, this election has become a threat to our national security. It must not stand.
1335484555852058624 2020-12-06 15:21:44 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @WayneDupreeShow The fake yawn is just too much.

1335465436108840961 2020-12-06 14:05:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @my3monkees @GenFlynn I'm doing the same.
1335423235995791360 2020-12-06 11:18:05 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JohnJamesMI Given the election chaos in Michiga, isn't there still a chance you won?
1335422861591244805 2020-12-06 11:16:35 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @giannajessen I've been wondering the same thing! We need to keep pushing for @JohnJamesMI too!
1335420288792625152 2020-12-06 11:06:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @michaeljohns @AngelWarrior321 Could a signature audit affect the Senate races, too?
1335418465826426880 2020-12-06 10:59:07 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @trinityblest @marklevinshow Someone here mentioned that @FoxNews carried it. Used to be my go-to choice. Tonight didn't even bother to check, even just out of curiosity. @RSBNetwork
1335417855848792066 2020-12-06 10:56:42 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @atensnut This truly has become an issue of national security.
1335417100978909184 2020-12-06 10:53:42 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @my3monkees She despises the woman trying to steal the presidency. Goes way back to their shared days as Bay Area attorneys. I would not read anything in to this.

1335399828054921218 2020-12-06 09:45:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @FeliciaDee9 @thebradfordfile Have done the same with my family members. Done with @FoxNews. Cancelled @foxnation too.
1335399264743133185 2020-12-06 09:42:49 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @thebradfordfile Too little, too late. @FoxNews will never be my go-to again
1335397384197586945 2020-12-06 09:35:21 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MarkFinchem @LarrySchweikart Godspeed, sir. May you serve as an example to other state legislators
1335396571806982147 2020-12-06 09:32:07 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LarrySchweikart I agree, but at this point, who knows who any of us actually voted for?
1335390332184215552 2020-12-06 09:07:20 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KLoeffler @realDonaldTrump Now let us know that you intend to #StopTheSteaI and demand in person that Kemp call for that #SpecialSession.
1335386821765697537 2020-12-06 08:53:23 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @CalebJHull @Destinbeach22 I hope the turncoats in the @GOP are taking note of this crowd and deciding to start fighting for @realDonaldTrump, #ElectionIntegrity and #StopTheSteal. Choose wisely, guys.
1335385921735196672 2020-12-06 08:49:48 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GOPChairwoman @RepDougCollins @KLoeffler @Perduesenate Will you also be fighting for @realDonaldTrump  and #StopTheSteaI?
1335384945804550145 2020-12-06 08:45:55 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GOPChairwoman What are you and the @GOP going to do to help @realDonaldTrump and #StopTheSteal2020? Eighty million of us are waiting to hear.
1335363309730635776 2020-12-06 07:19:57 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @AZGOP Soon they'll only have themselves to fight, because the rest of us, 80 million of us, will have abandoned them and started our own Patriot party. It's not too late to change your strategy @GOP.
1335362522862350337 2020-12-06 07:16:49 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @sandyleevincent @realDonaldTrump @GOP And after how they are treating @realDonaldTrump, the warriors fighting to #StopTheSteaI2020, and 80 million angry Americans!
1335334403690483712 2020-12-06 05:25:05 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BrianKempGA @IngrahamAngle @KLoeffler @Perduesenate Now call for an immediate special session of your state legislature.
1335333037249204225 2020-12-06 05:19:40 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ItalianGroyper3 And @govkristinoem
1335322526960898048 2020-12-06 04:37:54 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ItaliaPin0 @catturd2 They will disappear without him. And us.
1335320950686957569 2020-12-06 04:31:38 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Irishwren94 @catturd2 And so many more RINOs than we even imagined. #StopTheSteal
1335311381529120769 2020-12-06 03:53:36 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @laurenboebert Why is it wrong simply to demand that the candidates, the @GOP, the GA officials, the governor, and everyone else supposedly on our side support @realDonaldTrump and #ElectionIntegrity and fix the system first? #StopTheSteaI
1335309690603880450 2020-12-06 03:46:53 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @newtgingrich Yes. It's horrible. As is the failure if the @GOP and a whole new batch of newly revealed RINOs abandon @realDonaldTrump and #ElectionIntegrity. #StopTheSteaI!
1335308991283556353 2020-12-06 03:44:07 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GOP Yes you are right. And at the same time #WeThePeople want you, @RNC, @GOPChairwoman, @GOPLeader and @senatemajldr to fight for @realDonaldTrump and #StopTheSteaI.
1335298281035898880 2020-12-06 03:01:33 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @seanhannity And @senatemajldr, @GOPLeader and the @GOP are about to lose leverage among 80 million angry Americans if they don't start fighting for @realDonaldTrump, #ElectionIntegrity and #StopTheSteaI.
1335297086359654402 2020-12-06 02:56:48 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @stclairashley Also blank sheets of paper and algorithms.
1335293193571639296 2020-12-06 02:41:20 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GOPChairwoman @GOP @KLoeffler @Perduesenate We need you and the @GOP to fight for @realDonaldTrump and to join #StopTheSteaI. If not, you can kiss everyone who voted for our president good-bye. @GOPLeader
1335291751880216579 2020-12-06 02:35:36 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @EmeraldRobinson And 80 million of us are ready to abandon them. Eighty million very, very angry Americans.
1335289883380760576 2020-12-06 02:28:11 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @baalter @CB618444 They've used 80 million of us, too.
1335270320811360256 2020-12-06 01:10:27 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts It's not too late for the @GOP and the elites to change course. #StopTheSteaI!
1335262907005714434 2020-12-06 00:40:59 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @sethjlevy @TexasBaseballMa The @GOP elites think they can abandon @realDonaldTrump and 80 million of us will just go back to supporting them. How very naive of them. #StopTheSteaI!
1335260846562283520 2020-12-06 00:32:48 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @sethjlevy @TexasBaseballMa Apparently they think attacking @LLinWood, @SidneyPowell1 and 80 million angry Americans is a good strategy. Right @GOP? #StopTheSteaI!
1335259832631214083 2020-12-06 00:28:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DC_Draino @ScottUSApatriot We're seeing that even those we thought were on our side, absolutely we're not! @GOP #StopTheSteaI!
1335257915482021890 2020-12-06 00:21:09 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ArtValley818_ Looks like a creepy hostage video.
1335257159261540352 2020-12-06 00:18:09 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GOPLeader And the @GOP is ignoring the destruction of our republic. Will you be in Georgia today with @realDonaldTrump?
1335256675377238017 2020-12-06 00:16:13 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @FionaS_Writer @ArtValley818_ @realDonaldTrump has given us just the opportunity for the new Patriot party -- and we are 80 million strong (and angry) right out of the box.
1335256137076109313 2020-12-06 00:14:05 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @daneli_69 @ArtValley818_ Sadly so many more are RINOs than we knew. @realDonaldTrump has made everyone reveal who they truly are. Red pilled indeed.
1335255509021020160 2020-12-06 00:11:35 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ArtValley818_ Nothing
1335139173624246274 2020-12-05 16:29:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @carrieksada @realDonaldTrump Eighty million strong -- and very, very angry.
1335138956485148672 2020-12-05 16:28:27 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @newtgingrich @joelpollak First:  Fight for @realDonaldTrump and #VoterIntegrity.
1335136066379005957 2020-12-05 16:16:58 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LLinWood So disappointed with @newtgingrich and the entire @GOP.

1335132595063906304 2020-12-05 16:03:10 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @jjauthor With the chaos that is our voting system right niw, we may have voted them out already. Even in California. Who knows?

1335112913833455616 2020-12-05 14:44:58 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @gamer188326240 @ericmetaxas @SidneyPowell1 @LLinWood It's become a badge of honor. Gotta wonder, though, about a company that intentionally rids itself of customers
1335098154992115713 2020-12-05 13:46:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ali So will you be in Georgia tomorrow supporting @realDonaldTrump in person, Senator? Will you be asking the GA governor to call for a #SpecialSession? I'm sure you and the @GOP are fully invested in preserving #ElectionIntegrity, yes?
1335094763469455361 2020-12-05 13:32:51 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Raiklin @junogsp7 @GovKemp @GaSecofState @Perduesenate @KLoeffler @LLinWood @SidneyPowell1 Hey @tedcruz, @DanCrenshawTX and @newtgingrich, we're talking to you, too! God bless @krakenwood on the front lines.
1335090233231065089 2020-12-05 13:14:51 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealMattCouch @JasonWe09808720 More importantly, where is the @GOP?
1335089721861533696 2020-12-05 13:12:49 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @thebradfordfile @StacyLStiles More than all of those others combined. Time to leave them all behind and start our own new party, tens of millions strong and very, very angry.
1335086828869718016 2020-12-05 13:01:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @steph93065 @ladyliberty01 A shared cesspool, all of the dwellers eager to see @realDonaldTrump gone as they beg 80 million angry MAGA folks for money and assume we'll be staying with them. My, aren't they in for a surprise.
1335083049453637632 2020-12-05 12:46:18 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DrKarlynB @mattgaetz Me too. One of the few who is actually fighting for the republic.
1335080243942445056 2020-12-05 12:35:09 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ArtValley818_ The grangrene runs deeper than we even imagined.
1335070864241434625 2020-12-05 11:57:53 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @StewardshipAmer @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump We are already so angry, these corrupt officials crawling out of the cesspool, lecturing us, begging us for money and abandoning @realDonaldTrump just infuriates us even more. Once this is all settled all my friends and family are registering Independent.
1335054775499411457 2020-12-05 10:53:57 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @jessiprincey @SidneyPowell1 Well that will make the @GOP happy. And everyone else opposing @realDonaldTrump and #ElectionIntegrity.
1335054230873239554 2020-12-05 10:51:47 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @gatewaypundit @sendavidperdue What say you @GOP? @tedcruz? @newtgingrich? @GOPLeader McCarthy? Anyone?
1335053210403315714 2020-12-05 10:47:44 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Elisa_freedom @atensnut Yes indeed.
1335031332242509826 2020-12-05 09:20:47 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Gil1957 @Hung_Hippo @Feisty_FL @ccontede How do you win with the same corrupted system -- and same corrupt officials? You don't.
1335031086938685440 2020-12-05 09:19:49 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Hung_Hippo @Feisty_FL @ccontede They're all members of the same cesspool. They're all eager to see @realDonaldTrump gone and figure 80 million of us will stay with them like the old days. Boy are they wrong about that!
1335030541049970689 2020-12-05 09:17:39 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KeishaJake @strmprl @senatemajldr @Jim_Jordan @SenateGOP @GOP @realDonaldTrump @newsmax Bought and paid for
1335023207569485825 2020-12-05 08:48:30 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @csmgomez @LisaMarieBoothe They will find themselves with no voters if they don't step up now!
1335011409600544770 2020-12-05 08:01:38 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @dbongino But will the vote be conducted with the same corrupted system?
1335011155274711041 2020-12-05 08:00:37 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LadyRedWave And if the virus is so dangerous, why aren't discarded masks regarded as hazardous biological waste?
1335007634332680192 2020-12-05 07:46:37 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @redwins3_first @POTUS @newtgingrich @senatemajldr And as soon as this is all settled, we very angry 80-million-plus must start our new Patriot party, pretty powerful right out of the gate.
1335003082464186368 2020-12-05 07:28:32 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MarkFinchem @tracybeanz Thank you, sir, for being one of the courageous ones.
1334982812252794881 2020-12-05 06:07:59 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @HowleyReporter @LisaS4680 And, of course, Ruby's daughter.
1334982632237494272 2020-12-05 06:07:16 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BrandonStraka @OcrazioCornPop Germany 1938
1334981830848614406 2020-12-05 06:04:05 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GOPLeader @my3monkees When will you be on the front lines, @GOPLeader, standing in person with @realDonaldTrump and 80 million angry Americans to #StopTheSteal?
1334980575724105728 2020-12-05 05:59:06 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @atensnut He must not be trusted.
1334980390289698816 2020-12-05 05:58:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @newtgingrich So Georgia voters, having seen their votes stolen, are just supposed to us the same corrupt system in January? @realDonaldTrump isn't about party. He is about patriots. The @GOP is once again allowing our president to fight alone.
1334962124053905408 2020-12-05 04:45:47 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ByronYork @BillHemmer And @realDonaldTrump and 80 million angry patriots need @GOPChairwoman and the @GOP to get on the front lines and #StopTheSteaI
1334961690417328128 2020-12-05 04:44:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @EmeraldRobinson And apparently that's a-okay with republican state legislators coast to coast.
1334960021109493760 2020-12-05 04:37:26 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @adamhousley And while they're at it, perhaps they should take a look at that whole driving-ballots-across-state-lines business, ya think?
1334959212472934401 2020-12-05 04:34:13 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @adamhousley Back in the day I might find that encouraging. Now, not so much. @realDonaldTrump
1334958622304948224 2020-12-05 04:31:52 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Jamierodr14 @realDonaldTrump Thank you, and God bless you.
1334958482798178304 2020-12-05 04:31:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Hoosiers1986 Hold my beer, says the @GOP.
1334958322240241665 2020-12-05 04:30:41 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn @SidneyPowell1 @DavidShafer Exactly! This has all become a threat to our national security -- and all the world knows it. Thank you for fighting for us, sir.
1334957943578480641 2020-12-05 04:29:10 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @benshapiro So should everyone just go ahead and vote with the same corrupted system and live happily ever after?
1334947180566564864 2020-12-05 03:46:24 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @C_3C_3 And no help from the cowardly and treasonous @GOP
1334946848033816576 2020-12-05 03:45:05 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @catturd2 Who cares.
1334946669318688768 2020-12-05 03:44:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BernardKerik @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump And the entire @GOP which have chosen to stand down.
1334946417878597632 2020-12-05 03:43:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RudyGiuliani Why covering? Because they're all the same, ALL corrupt.
1334946151506747395 2020-12-05 03:42:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @catturd2 They're telling us loud and clear that they are ALL the same cesspool.
1334934263230124032 2020-12-05 02:55:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RobertPLewis @MsMacAttack321 And we are real people, not blank sheets of paper or algorithms.
1334931696848756737 2020-12-05 02:44:53 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @cjptrsn @GayLatina4Trump @KevinJWatt1 New Patriot party, 80 million strong and very, very angry.
1334928713012531200 2020-12-05 02:33:01 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @sandyleevincent @JimInhofe They think they won because they resonate with the people. They won because of @realDonaldTrump and the 80 million now-very-angry Americans who stand with him. Hey @GOP fight for our president and our republic.
1334927301067194368 2020-12-05 02:27:24 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealRLimbaugh Hey Rush, it's not just the Dems who fear #MAGA. Most of the republicans are just as terrified of and disgusted by #WeThePeople. They are making that clearer every day.
1334913764735389696 2020-12-05 01:33:37 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @gatewaypundit They're all happy members of the same cesspool and couldn't care less about #WeThePeople. Meanwhile real American heroes are emerging every day, testifying to the fraud and fighting for our republic.
1334911370798587905 2020-12-05 01:24:06 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @AdamBaldwin As they say, whoever cuts the deal first...
1334890502953418752 2020-12-05 00:01:11 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @chuckwoolery He simply wants those two entitled candidates and the @GOP to fight in person for @realDonaldTrump and the integrity of the November 3rd election. Instead they are all distancing themselves and asking for money.
1334876662593323008 2020-12-04 23:06:11 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @newtgingrich Troubled? So why isn't he de-certifying and calling for a special session and forensic investigation?
1334875537714544640 2020-12-04 23:01:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @newtgingrich It's only because of the video. He cannot be trusted
1334797989374619654 2020-12-04 17:53:34 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @cagirl12345 @prayingmedic That would be awesome!
1334797444396113920 2020-12-04 17:51:24 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @CalGal106 @prayingmedic I am too! (we Californians have to think we can help somehow, right?!).
1334797083933458432 2020-12-04 17:49:58 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @prayingmedic @kansas_sun After what we witnessed today (and I watched the entire hearing), I think they genuinely want to hear from you. I think they want to have courage. Help them.
1334795266243772418 2020-12-04 17:42:45 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @realDonaldTrump @JimInhofe We the people have been betrayed by so many we trusted (right, @tedcruz?) We can only trust @realDonaldTrump, @SidneyPowell1 and the rest of the legal team. Promises made, promises kept.
1334793783586611200 2020-12-04 17:36:51 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @lcsimon136 @kimfreethinker @pinkk9lover @FoxNews We were too, but now we watch none of it. We have moved on to greener pastures.
1334793573477171201 2020-12-04 17:36:01 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @bostonrandy @kimfreethinker @Redeemed1952 @FoxNews I'm happier with @scrowder and his discussions of Tucker and the #tucksclusive! Laugher -- and brilliance -- are the best medicines! I don't miss @FoxNews at all. Cancelled @foxnation, too.
1334792709253435393 2020-12-04 17:32:35 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @swtf_podcast @kimfreethinker @FoxNews @newsmax @OANN @FoxBusiness And @RSBNetwork for all the hearings! They are awesome!
1334792375483305985 2020-12-04 17:31:16 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @IndianaVaughn @kimfreethinker @BamaJeans24 @FoxNews It was actually early evening November 3rd for my family and me. And we've never looked back.
1334792174882279424 2020-12-04 17:30:28 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @biddergalore It's been a great opportunity to discover other channels, outlets and sources (my whole family loves @scrowder and the mug club!). And I don't miss @FoxNews one bit!
1334787739590410240 2020-12-04 17:12:50 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @kylenabecker @RSBNetwork Don't rtust him! Need a special session and full forensic audit of everything (Dominion!).  And besides, didn't he already destroy and shred most of the material?
1334787386539012097 2020-12-04 17:11:26 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RSBNetwork You guys have been awesome keeping us up to date on everything happening. What would we do without you!
1334786961995747328 2020-12-04 17:09:45 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ScottPresler @DrShayPhD It's not enough. He has destroyed and shredded most of the material. Demand a special session and a forensic audit of machines. And don't trust him!
1334786466669494273 2020-12-04 17:07:47 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LLinWood @SouthernJReb @senatemajldr @KLoeffler @sendavidperdue @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA He should answer your call. And he and the @GOP should understand that 80 million of us are ready to abandon them and start the new Patriot party -- and we are very, very angry.
1334784838553935872 2020-12-04 17:01:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @mrntweet2 Such a sublime moment!
1334781275509379072 2020-12-04 16:47:09 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KLoeffler @OcrazioCornPop @ReverendWarnock @staceyabrams So why aren't you out fighting for @realDonaldTrump in person? And why aren't you demanding that your governor call for a special session and a full forensic audit of ballots, signatures and machines? Instead you've just been asking me for money.
1334779605375307777 2020-12-04 16:40:31 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @beyouonlybetter @RealCandaceO You need to make sure your vote will be counted and that you are voting for the candidate you are actually voting for!
1334777989637160961 2020-12-04 16:34:06 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @biddergalore How can you have a signature verification when you have destroyed and shredded most of the material?
1334777644408180737 2020-12-04 16:32:44 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @EmeraldRobinson @OcrazioCornPop And if the virus is so dangerous, why are not discarded masks treated like hazardous biological waste?
1334776301790527489 2020-12-04 16:27:23 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Italians4Trump @TuckerCarlson @SidneyPowell1 Too little, too late Tucker. After years watching you every night, our family has moved on.
1334749081948680194 2020-12-04 14:39:14 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @gatewaypundit @secondhandwoke Now he needs to de-certify, call for a special session, and call for a forensic audit. But he already had most of the material shredded and destroyed, didn't he?
1334743314050949120 2020-12-04 14:16:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealWayneRoot Didn't he already destroy and shred a bunch of the materials? Did @IngrahamAngle ask him about that?
1334740985041940481 2020-12-04 14:07:03 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @lennyflamenco @RealCandaceO @LLinWood Little do they know we Trump supporters are ready to leave them for the new Patriot party, 80 million strong -- and very, very angry.
1334738929296134145 2020-12-04 13:58:53 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LLinWood @newtgingrich @KLoeffler @sendavidperdue See the big picture, Newt! Americans see their votes stolen and no change in any type of run-off. Instead of bashing warriors on the front lines, get the weak &amp;lazy @GOP to join those warriors for @realDonaldTrump &amp; our republic!
1334714733421711364 2020-12-04 12:22:44 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LarrySchweikart Full forensic audit!
1334713797978681344 2020-12-04 12:19:01 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JennaEllisEsq @TeamTrump Also decertify and call for forensics of the machines you mandated be used for this atrocity if an election.
1334713319832256512 2020-12-04 12:17:07 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JennaEllisEsq @TeamTrump Didn't he already shred and destroy everything?
1334709540353265668 2020-12-04 12:02:06 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @OANN Of course they are. The rude awakening will be when 80 million angry Americans suddenly morph into the Patriot party. Oh well, the cesspoolers had their chance.
1334708931134799873 2020-12-04 11:59:41 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @C_3C_3 @kansas_sun Newsom never campaigned either
1334708420406964224 2020-12-04 11:57:39 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TheLeoTerrell @realDonaldTrump @KLoeffler @seanhannity @seanspicer @StephenLawson_ @DonaldJTrumpJr Understood, but shame on the @GOP for ignoring election integrity and once again leaving @realDonaldTrump to stand and fight alone.
1334706310579773443 2020-12-04 11:49:16 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @rolltide_lizlee @atensnut Didn't watch (used to daily), but I'm guessing she was providing him damage control, and I'm guessing she didn't ask him about today's video bombshell.
1334703015308083200 2020-12-04 11:36:11 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MelissaEngelh13 @ColumbiaBugle @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity And most of the legislators seemed genuinely concerned (probably because of the nature of the evidence).
1334702144046297090 2020-12-04 11:32:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BluntandHonesty @ColumbiaBugle @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity It would help if the @GOP and congressional republicans would join them in that fight, but we know that's not going to happen. @GOPChairwoman
1334700349706289154 2020-12-04 11:25:35 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @scrowder Hey Steve, I heard that Tucker aired it tonight! But sadly for him, he didn't get the #Tucksclusive (spelling?).
1334699756971466752 2020-12-04 11:23:14 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @giannajessen Wouldn't it be nice if legislators would read the Constitution? And if state legislators would also read their state Constitutions?
1334698895104851968 2020-12-04 11:19:48 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @sandyleevincent @LLinWood @DanCrenshawTX Remember the campaign ad Crenshaw made with his fellow TX candidates where they were mobilizing for battle? That was certainly a fairy tale.
1334692508329111554 2020-12-04 10:54:26 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Jt92Gyp @GOPChairwoman @KLoeffler @Perduesenate They all just find it easier to let the fighters -- state legislators, @realDonaldTrump and #WeThePeople -- stand alone. Right, @tedcruz and @GOPLeader McCarthy?
1334691572693172225 2020-12-04 10:50:42 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GOPChairwoman @KLoeffler @Perduesenate So let those Georgia legislators who waded through the bombshells today know you will fight with them in the call for a special session to fix THIS election. Or will the @GOP just leave them to fight alone like they've done with @realDonaldTrump all this time?
1334689815950807042 2020-12-04 10:43:44 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GOPChairwoman @KLoeffler @Perduesenate So when will you be starting to fight for @realDonaldTrump ?
1334687425004666882 2020-12-04 10:34:14 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @heather_giron @LLinWood Remember the ad you &amp; your fellow TX candidates made about going into battle @DanCrenshawTX? Make that a reality, mobilize your #GOP brethren, and get fighting for @realDonaldTrump &amp; our republic!
1334675132271321088 2020-12-04 09:45:23 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @hollandcourtney @JVER1 And today we got to see video evidence of it!
1334674032751362048 2020-12-04 09:41:01 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DanCrenshawTX Maybe if you and your colleagues would surround the president and start fighting for him in a decisive way--like that commercial you and your fellow Texas candidates did before the election. Then @LinWood wouldn't have to humiliate the republicans into taking up the fight
1334671877222981639 2020-12-04 09:32:27 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Project_Veritas Funny that they think they have any idea what is going out there in the country.
1334669656670400512 2020-12-04 09:23:37 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @eddiecarl4468 I have a feeling one or two may be flipping at this very moment.
1334667887085174785 2020-12-04 09:16:35 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @pnjaban Every restaurant and business in California should change its name to "French Laundry," Califsornian who choose to go to those restaurants and businesses can do so mask-less, and we'll all be golden.
1334665700552544257 2020-12-04 09:07:54 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LadyRedWave After today?  Maybe.
1334665075039203328 2020-12-04 09:05:25 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @chuckwoolery I couldn't care less if they fire him. I don't watch @FoxNews anymore -- and until November 3rd I and my whole extended family watched daily.  But now, never again.
1334664752593694723 2020-12-04 09:04:08 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SenMikeLee Thank God you're not on the US Supreme Court. Utah needs two new senators.
1334663757197295620 2020-12-04 09:00:11 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @catturd2 Me too! Leaving @FoxNews has led me to some amazing new outlets and sources, and I've brought plenty of people with me! Never look back.
1334656661626056704 2020-12-04 08:31:59 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RichardGrenell @ericgarcetti @RonDeSantisFL Maybe Californians have been trying to vote them out, but now that we see how widespread voter fraud is coast to coast, I'm guessing the fix is in for California, too, no matter how the people vote.
1334651574279229440 2020-12-04 08:11:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GOP @cat17534 @dgvaladao I remember the old days when my extended family and I used to watch @IngrahamAngle. We have all moved on
1334649940132261888 2020-12-04 08:05:16 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ACTBrigitte Yes! Eighteen million of us. And we are very, very angry.
1334649404603518976 2020-12-04 08:03:09 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GOPLeader Any comments, sir, on the fraud bombshells going off in Georgia and what you and the #GOP tend to do to help @realDonaldTrump and our great republic? Awaiting your action.
1334648204160192513 2020-12-04 07:58:23 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @reubing @270ev And of course there's the video evidence...
1334647722427654144 2020-12-04 07:56:28 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @catturd2 Did she end her post with a high-pitched panicked chirp?
1334645602945142784 2020-12-04 07:48:02 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts How nice it would be if legislators would actually bother to read the US Constitution and their own state's Constitution.
1334645105513299969 2020-12-04 07:46:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @valdostagirl13 @Wizard_Predicts Then he owned them with the info that he's a member of the 11th Circuit Bar and Supreme Court Bar.
1334644242543640577 2020-12-04 07:42:38 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts I don't think most of these legislators even know what's in their own state Constitution, let alone the US #Constitution
1334639501382090752 2020-12-04 07:23:48 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JennaEllisEsq Clearly people lied during the morning whatever-that-was. The video evidence nailed the liars!
1334638978813718528 2020-12-04 07:21:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts Why do they even bother to take an oath to the Constitution. It's a joke to them.
1334625441362022401 2020-12-04 06:27:56 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @newtgingrich And what say you, sir, about the bombshells going off in the Georgia hearing today?  Any concern about that?
1334622984074534913 2020-12-04 06:18:10 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @EmeraldRobinson Nauseating. And says all we need to know about the swamp in a single image.
1334618177636945921 2020-12-04 05:59:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @gatewaypundit He, of course, will be exempt, along with all the other overlords.
1334617988117360641 2020-12-04 05:58:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GOPLeader Okay, Congressman, now comment on the election fraud bombshells going off in Georgia, and what your party is going to do about it in support of @realDonaldTrump
1334606395312750592 2020-12-04 05:12:15 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ArtValley818_ Wondering why we're not seeing elected republican "representatives" posting en masse this video. What say you @tedcruz? @KLoeffler? @LindseyGrahamSC? @GOPLeader McCarthy? @marcorubio? Anybody?
1334601995760463872 2020-12-04 04:54:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @City_of_Irvine What about restaurants that rename themselves "The French Laundry?"  Can they open for indoor dining?
1334597656480346113 2020-12-04 04:37:31 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @gatewaypundit @TheDemocrats Unfortunately, far too many republicans are trying to do that, too!
1334596671322300417 2020-12-04 04:33:36 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @catahoula_mama @Patrici15767099 @EmeraldRobinson Eighty million of us collateral damage are ready to leave them in the dust and start a new Patriot party. And we are very, very angry.
1334595778648543233 2020-12-04 04:30:03 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @carrieksada @TX_Bruce @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Hey @tedcruz, let's talk about what your buddy @SenMikeLee is doing to our country, shall we.  And let's talk about what is happening in Georgia right now!
1334595010059141122 2020-12-04 04:27:00 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DrShayPhD Absolutely! The Patriot Party, 80 million strong.  And very, very angry.
1334594786267779072 2020-12-04 04:26:07 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RudyGiuliani Thank you, Mr. Mayor. You and your team, and everyone testifying, working, risking, sacrificing and voluteering to save this great republic, are superheroes.
1334593102607130624 2020-12-04 04:19:25 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LivePDDave1 @catturd2 I'm guessing she's currently in the process of trying to cut a deal.
1334592305651621890 2020-12-04 04:16:15 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @joshdcaplan Never mind that whole stolen presidential election thing, I guess.
1334590484874850304 2020-12-04 04:09:01 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @haddock_kapten @KamVTV @Barnes_Law As we know the key states all stopped counting at the same time.
1334590026731069440 2020-12-04 04:07:12 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KamVTV I'm guessing there's a woman with blond braids who has run to a lawyer and is trying to cut a deal about now.
1334583727263862784 2020-12-04 03:42:10 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SteveHoggIII @JennaEllisEsq I'm guessing she ran to a lawyer and is trying to cut a deal about now.
1334572790934999041 2020-12-04 02:58:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JennaEllisEsq Biblical!
1334572663499497473 2020-12-04 02:58:12 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @EmeraldRobinson I wonder if they're watching the hearing right now -- namely, the fraud footage!
1334559376254750720 2020-12-04 02:05:24 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SexCounseling @prayingmedic Total waste of time: them just lying and congratulating themselves and each other.
1334558788406263809 2020-12-04 02:03:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Bud_Doggin Absolutely! Patriot party, 80 million strong (and angry) right out of the gate!
1334552736059117568 2020-12-04 01:39:01 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @EmeraldRobinson They're too busy selling out America (@SenMikeLee), ignoring the steal, high-fiving kamala (@LindseyGrahamSC), and slandering @LLinWood (@tedcruz).
1334550646687637504 2020-12-04 01:30:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ArtValley818_ @tedcruz @LLinWood is fighting harder for the sanctity of this republic than any of your senate colleagues. Any comment from you, Sir, about your pal @SenMikeLee?
1334548272556331009 2020-12-04 01:21:17 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ArtValley818_ That's assault, isn't it?
1334546939791069184 2020-12-04 01:15:59 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts And the bobbleheads just smile and go along with it
1334544136188280832 2020-12-04 01:04:51 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @gregkellyusa It's a waste of time
1334542992946839554 2020-12-04 01:00:18 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ACTBrigitte The spelling of their names
1334380568591495168 2020-12-03 14:14:53 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @realCarone_ You were amazing today and yesterday. Thank you for your courage and your heroism. We need you!
1334370743170134016 2020-12-03 13:35:51 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LLinWood It's not as if the republican party has stood with @realDonaldTrump. He has stood alone through everything they have thrown at him for the last four years, but not entirely alone. He has 80 million patriots standing with him, and that's why both parties want him gone.
1334369791398694913 2020-12-03 13:32:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KelemenCari @TrumpWarRoom Trump represents a whole new party: the Patriot party, 80 million strong and angry, and made up of fed-up republicans, dems, independents and anyone else.
1334368115216420865 2020-12-03 13:25:24 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @mizdonna I'm sure you guys are also disgusted that the same corrupted machines will be used for the runoff, all with the governor's blessing.
1334354424064446465 2020-12-03 12:31:00 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TX_WalkerRanger Most of them didn't even know the U. S. Constitution gives them the power, and the responsibility, to maintain the integrity of their state's election.
1334353203803029504 2020-12-03 12:26:09 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @tracybeanz And know they're gleefully using the same corrupted machines, so your vote wouldn't matter anyway
1334352787967119366 2020-12-03 12:24:30 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts They clearly have never read the Constitution -- nor, it appears, do they care.
1334327048316207109 2020-12-03 10:42:13 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RSBNetwork His bedtime is apparently 9:30
1334323084409520130 2020-12-03 10:26:28 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @EmeraldRobinson Eighty million of us are ready to abandon them, and we are very, very angry.
1334322285717557248 2020-12-03 10:23:18 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MajorPatriot If only the congressional and all elected republicans would display such courage and such love for our country. The establishment cesspool is a disgusting place.
1334321824729972737 2020-12-03 10:21:28 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @EmeraldRobinson And the #GOP thinks 80 million of us will stay with their party if they betray us. Oh how wrong they are!
1334310563321536512 2020-12-03 09:36:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @cheryleliz It's always the women on our side, isn't it? All those simpering republican men in congress and various state houses could use some of that courage.
1334306033888452608 2020-12-03 09:18:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts That would be a true Christmas miracle. The scores of courageous regular people in the hearings should make the republican "leadership" ashamed -- but I don't think their capable of shame.
1334305151436247040 2020-12-03 09:15:12 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KelemenCari @RoBud2u @JennaEllisEsq And it sounds like he voted illegally.
1334304311023554563 2020-12-03 09:11:52 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Patrick03319315 @KelemenCari @JennaEllisEsq Exactly!
1334303766686748672 2020-12-03 09:09:42 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KelemenCari @JennaEllisEsq The chairman just wants to go home and go to bed.
1334303478198329345 2020-12-03 09:08:34 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KelemenCari @JennaEllisEsq And followed by bada** Melissa Carone! Such heroes. God bless them!
1334291069094121472 2020-12-03 08:19:15 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @robbystarbuck But it won't happen with the same corrupted voting system.
1334290089510203395 2020-12-03 08:15:21 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KLoeffler Why weren't you and @sendavidperdue on the stage with @krakenwood at today's presser?
1334288396701687811 2020-12-03 08:08:38 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KLoeffler @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump So why weren't you and @sendavidperdue at the @KrakenWood presser today?
1334288096112697344 2020-12-03 08:07:26 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ColumbiaBugle New Patriot party: 80 million strong (and furious) right out of the gate.
1334287857444245504 2020-12-03 08:06:29 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ColumbiaBugle No wonder they're not fighting to defend our republica. Both parties are too busy sloshing around in the cesspool.
1334274662969167873 2020-12-03 07:14:03 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @nedryun I'm not. They're going to use the same cheating voting methods, so we already know the results, and #Loeffler and #Perdue didn't even show up at the @krakenwood presser today. This is unforgivable.
1334272640203145216 2020-12-03 07:06:01 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SidneyPowell1 @GovKemp @LLinWood @KrakenWood @realDonaldTrump @molmccann @marklevinshow @MariaBartiromo @RichardGrenell @TomFitton @JamesOKeefeIII @SharylAttkisson @JackMaxey1 @SaraCarterDC @CollinsforGA @sendavidperdue and @KLoeffler need to explain why they weren't at the presse conference today in Georgia.  As our warriors @SidneyPowell1 and @LLinWood said, these candidates need to fight for @realdonaldtrump and earn their votes in January.
1334226592420139009 2020-12-03 04:03:03 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @gregkellyusa Eighty million strong right out of the gate. And very, very angry. @KrakenWood @realDonaldTrump
1334225899504340993 2020-12-03 04:00:17 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Wizard_Predicts They can kiss their whole party goodbye. Eighty million of us will be moving on. And boy are we angry.
1334225287060414465 2020-12-03 03:57:51 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KLoeffler Just wondering why you're not at the @KrakenWood press conference today, Senator. I'll await your answer. @realDonaldTrump
1334223651848142850 2020-12-03 03:51:21 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @AndrewPollackFL @BibleBeltDarlin Not just the senators. All of them at every level. And we are 80 million strong (and furious!).
1334222977102086144 2020-12-03 03:48:41 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @gregkellyusa @realDonaldTrump I won't watch or listen to anyone discussing any of that. One strike they're out.
1334220501900660737 2020-12-03 03:38:50 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JackPosobiec I don't think any Christians are supposed to support infanticide, are they?
1334218358657433601 2020-12-03 03:30:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @dbongino @NatShupe Amazing that Fox business is actually covering election fraud.
1334218119150067712 2020-12-03 03:29:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Mrsmmtbeauty If theby tried to hold one of these for Biden, just a bunch of photocopy paper and algorithms would show up.
1334217385188884480 2020-12-03 03:26:27 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SenTedCruz @mschlapp @AjitPaiFCC @SenateCommerce @FCC You are awesome, Senator, but you need to be devoted full-time right now to the great fraud that is being perpetrated upon our great nation.  And remind your colleagues if they continue to hide behind chovid and the GA run-off, there will be no more republican party.
1334178982024003585 2020-12-03 00:53:51 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @marklevinshow Another important voice. May he rest in peace.
1334178693804032000 2020-12-03 00:52:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MrMichaelBurkes Same!
1334152438194999301 2020-12-02 23:08:23 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MsAvaArmstrong Why do they even bother to take the oath to the Constitution? It's just a joke to them -- and an oath they are permitted to break with no consequence.
1334151082398781440 2020-12-02 23:03:00 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @toddstarnes If masks do indeed work, why are there shutdowns, lockdowns or restrictions of any kind?
1334055421674287104 2020-12-02 16:42:52 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SJPFISH @realDonaldTrump And the republicans are in for a rude awakening if they believe our loyalty and enthusiasm are for them. They need to get out there and fight for our president @realdonaldtrump.
1333967636397395969 2020-12-02 10:54:03 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DrKarlynB @JamesOKeefeIII And all the republican state houses, too!
1333945084207775744 2020-12-02 09:24:26 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ksorbs I think it's actually more of a cesspool.
1333887304226590720 2020-12-02 05:34:50 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JackPosobiec I think they're having a competition  to see how long they can keep locking down the peasants while they joyfully go about thumbing their noses in said peasants' faces as they go about their maskless lives.
1333878498562215937 2020-12-02 04:59:50 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @pnjaban Only if you're a democrat overlord

1333875254867890176 2020-12-02 04:46:57 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KamVTV Part of the deep state sludge.

1333843524505145346 2020-12-02 02:40:52 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @atensnut Cesspool
1333836046681796608 2020-12-02 02:11:09 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @EmeraldRobinson @Mrsmmtbeauty Exactly! Why even have them take an oath to the Constitution. It's a joke to them. The republican party is done. Emerge the new Patriot party, 80 million strong (and angry!).
1333831162758774789 2020-12-02 01:51:45 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KelemenCari From each of these hearings, American heroes emerge -- despite the sludge of the elected officials. This woman is a hero.
1333817590494363650 2020-12-02 00:57:49 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @hrtablaze @GOP Time to start the new Patriot party, 80 million strong (and angry) right out of the gate!

1333812315586641920 2020-12-02 00:36:51 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @McKaylaRoseJ The gangrene is far more advanced in the republicans than we even realized
1333810222914174977 2020-12-02 00:28:32 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Real_Gigabear @JackPosobiec @OANN Exactly. But the elected officials are failing to do their Constitutional duties. Why even bother having them take the oath to the Constitution. It's a joke to them.
1333794251486887943 2020-12-01 23:25:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @n3tjunki3 @ScottAdamsSays @Wizard_Predicts Indeed. The Patriot party, 80 million strong (and angry) right out of the gate!
1333793959630422017 2020-12-01 23:23:55 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ScottAdamsSays They care more about lobbyists, the big bucks and the media than their constituents, that is abundantly clear.
1333783590459514880 2020-12-01 22:42:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JosephJFlynn1 We need the new Patriot party, 80 million strong, and incredibly powerful (and angry) right out of the gate.
1333649323817504769 2020-12-01 13:49:11 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TX_WalkerRanger Same.
1333590343644704775 2020-12-01 09:54:49 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @PolitiKurd And that there might be republicans finally willing to fight back!
1333590115956899841 2020-12-01 09:53:55 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LATiffani1 @SupportOurPres We must start a new Patriot party, 80 million strong, and a force to be reckoned with right out of the gate.

1333292949598191618 2020-11-30 14:13:05 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Ron4California Abraham Lincoln was a republican. Abraham Lincoln, Ulysess S. Grant (also a republican) and the Union won the Civil War.
1333240552641368065 2020-11-30 10:44:52 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @prayingmedic Republicans are subverting it, too. Look at Georgia.

1331286958471929857 2020-11-25 01:21:59 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @atensnut The Patriot party, starting out of the gate with 74 million angry Americans.
1331135742823735297 2020-11-24 15:21:07 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @senatormelendez Constantly lying.

1331057762445365248 2020-11-24 10:11:15 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DrShayPhD Seventy-four million angry Americans would be a formidable party right out of the gate.
1330912662692118528 2020-11-24 00:34:40 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @catturd2 A new party of 74 million angry Americans would be pretty strong right out of the gate.

1325494991288897536 2020-11-09 01:46:47 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JennaEllisEsq They want to speed this through to prevent further fraud revelations, and more is coming to light daily. Pray the decision makers in the courts and legislatures will have courage. Sunlight is the best disinfectant.
1325493978922299392 2020-11-09 01:42:45 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @WayneDupreeShow @BretBaier found it funny that Americans were disgusted by the @FoxNews role in the steal. Methinks he's probably not laughing now.

1325293205156372480 2020-11-08 12:24:57 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @McKaylaRoseJ He also told us they had set up the largest voter fraud organization in history.
1325292809977548800 2020-11-08 12:23:23 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Timcast So? If the steal succeeds, he starts his own media empire with TV news and social media - 71 million furious Americans beside him (buys Newsmax, OAN &amp; Parler). Leave the likes of Fox &amp; Twitter in the dust.

1325208209271922688 2020-11-08 06:47:12 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JennaEllisEsq Do they think that 71 million furious Americans are going to suddenly support the spineless, appeasing republican party?

1325136722556981257 2020-11-08 02:03:09 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> Yes! I've been saying the same! Once @realdonaldtrump launches his own empire - social media, TV news, everything - methinks the steal team won't be laughing then.

1325133607199891459 2020-11-08 01:50:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BillOReilly And he won the 2020 election by a landslide.

1324507971297013760 2020-11-06 08:24:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TheOfficerTatum Absolutely. I hope they're bleeding viewers. Like the fraudulent dems, they're not even pretending. After years and years, my household, and many others I know, have moved on (still watching @TuckerCarlson, however, but hope he moves on soon, too).
1324504575471091712 2020-11-06 08:11:13 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @nedryun Wow. Fox is really going all in on this. They truly have fallen, and many of us have moved on. I hope @TuckerCarlson -- the only one I still watch -- will leave soon, but if he doesn't, I'll have to do without him, too.

1324499927758639104 2020-11-06 07:52:45 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity Sorry, Senator. A bunch of us have left @foxnews.

1324445929101877248 2020-11-06 04:18:11 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Jim_Jordan Would love to see you and your colleagues on the ground in Philly, Detroit, Milwaukee, Vegas, Maricopa...take your pick!
1324444648077582336 2020-11-06 04:13:05 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @HeyTammyBruce @realDonaldTrump Yet when faced with their own challenges, they pretended to support @realDonaldTrump, begged for support from we the people, and have now retreated back in to the cesspool.
1324443078367698944 2020-11-06 04:06:51 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealBobbyDMAGA @CB618444 I wish @TuckerCarlson would leave. Maybe he will. He doesn't fit in there anymore
1324442581489446912 2020-11-06 04:04:53 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @AndrewPollackFL @RyanAFournier It's the same ones who were pleading for our support just a week ago. DC really is a cesspool.
1324442170946826240 2020-11-06 04:03:15 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Idahoguy74 @BretBaier He's just happy that he's earned his spot in the coup.
1324441947117772803 2020-11-06 04:02:21 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RichardGrenell @HARRISFAULKNER I guess just like @BretBaier she finds it funny that votes are being cancelled and we're witnessing a coup. So long @FoxNews
1324441547853631488 2020-11-06 04:00:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RichardGrenell @HARRISFAULKNER @foxnews has fallen. Started several months ago.
1324439836413972480 2020-11-06 03:53:58 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @1776Stonewall @ScottUSApatriot Biden's America
1324439698207510528 2020-11-06 03:53:25 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @w_terrence @MaddieAdams75 Hiding in Biden's basement
1324438976040632321 2020-11-06 03:50:33 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DC_Draino @RichardGrenell A true warrior he is. If only the #GOP members who were begging us to support them a week ago would follow his lead now!
1324436259926732800 2020-11-06 03:39:45 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MariaBartiromo Careful Maria. The Fox overlords may not be pleased with your honesty. Look what they did to @trish_regan.
1324433040056020994 2020-11-06 03:26:58 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @joshdcaplan 100 percent for Biden no doubt.
1324432666649743360 2020-11-06 03:25:29 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> Self-serving cowards at that.
1324432098871046144 2020-11-06 03:23:13 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @mikel_strmnn @robbystarbuck Spineless with him too. They leave  all the heavy lifting to him.
1324431709295685632 2020-11-06 03:21:40 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @douglaskarr @robbystarbuck And that's exactly why @realDonaldTrump was elected.
1324431481108787200 2020-11-06 03:20:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @robbystarbuck @nedryun Hanging out somewhere with Hunter perhaps?
1324430826050744321 2020-11-06 03:18:10 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BrianClowdus @GOP @realDonaldTrump Yes, how about that @tedcruz, @LindseyGrahamSC, @GOPLeader McCarthy, @senatemajldr Mcconnell, @marcorubio, and all the rest? Get out there and fight for this country!
1324423503072817153 2020-11-06 02:49:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @AmericaFirstPAC @LisaS4680 And they would find all the votes they need
1324408449715724288 2020-11-06 01:49:15 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RitaVotesRed @OcrazioCornPop They're too busy protecting their own positions in the swamp.
1324407354826256384 2020-11-06 01:44:54 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JackPosobiec I'm sure that doesn't please Obama at all. Narcissists don't take kindly to being minimized.
1324406846115905536 2020-11-06 01:42:53 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DonaldJTrumpJr @StacyLStiles I'm sure Obama isn't happy about that.
1324405660625203200 2020-11-06 01:38:10 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @catturd2 @MsAvaArmstrong And where are the republicans?! McConnell, McCarthy, Rubio, Graham, etc.?!  Where is the DOJ and the FBI?! Do your job, get out there, and fight for our country en masse!
1324400494349938688 2020-11-06 01:17:38 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @catturd2 @BretBaier It happened all over and he knows it. Bret is taking such pleasure in laughing at those of us who don't appreciate witnessing a stolen election. His overlords must be so proud.
1324399959823675394 2020-11-06 01:15:31 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RubinReport Yes, it ended on November 3rd when the CDC announced that people with chovid-19 should feel free to go out and vote in person.
1324396022081019904 2020-11-06 00:59:52 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ClaudineMinogue @JosephR76594997 @marklevinshow I'm more than willing to lose in a fair fight. That is not what this is. This is a coup.
1324395098612916227 2020-11-06 00:56:12 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @seanhannity Anyone with a brain knew the polls were BS. More concerning is that your network played a key role in "taking out a duly elected president."  I wish you'd talk about that.
1324389726753746944 2020-11-06 00:34:51 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @chermess @Azcatryo @greggutfeld I did the same, and @newsmax was great. As for Fox after all these years ... I'm done, especially after seeing @BretBaier laugh at Americans who don't appreciate witnessing a stolen election.
1324380947681140736 2020-11-05 23:59:58 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MsAvaArmstrong They're quite proud of their place within the coup.
1324380310935531520 2020-11-05 23:57:26 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @yogagenie @RacySicilian @JoeConchaTV What do polls have to do with them calling Arizona immediately. Oh, that's right, they're part of the steal.
1324240449658220547 2020-11-05 14:41:41 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LeahR77 @kristi4freedom @trish_regan pretty much said just that early on, and @FoxNews fired her the next day.
1324234944374206464 2020-11-05 14:19:48 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RonColeman God bless you, Sir.
1324231832183869441 2020-11-05 14:07:26 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @yesnicksearcy @BretBaier Baier finds it funny, apparently, that he is part of a coup.
1324212093055246336 2020-11-05 12:49:00 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Lrihendry Hanging out with Hunter.
1324209092177530882 2020-11-05 12:37:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SusanMondie @DreamWeaver61 @GOPChairwoman @TeamTrump Maybe he's with Hunter.
1324207094745030657 2020-11-05 12:29:08 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @gatewaypundit @RealDrGina How do you like that, Obama?
1324203295594803202 2020-11-05 12:14:02 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @terryamann3 @BretBaier I was part of that mass exodus to @newsmax (and Daily Wire) early last night. They were great and I will be back only for Tucker (and hope he leaves).
1324202231231438849 2020-11-05 12:09:49 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BretBaier Nope. We just hope that Tucker will come with us.
1324144275861336064 2020-11-05 08:19:31 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BretBaier After years and years with #foxnews, I moved to @Newsmax early yesterday, and they were great. See ya, Fox. You have betrayed us all.
1324141958638432257 2020-11-05 08:10:18 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @toddstarnes It would seem most of the hosts and reporters agree, even those I love.  I guess contractually they have to.
1324139705953185792 2020-11-05 08:01:21 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealSaavedra But when those news organizations are actually part of the coup, it's their job to do that.
1324133524337696771 2020-11-05 07:36:48 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TimRunsHisMouth He also told us he didn't need votes to be elected.
1324132527074811906 2020-11-05 07:32:50 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KurtSchlichter This explains Nancy's smarmy "Good morning," The PA AG's comment about the state having all the votes they'll need, and Biden's outright announcement that he didn't need votes to be elected and they had set up the biggest voter fraud organization in history.
1324129887041417216 2020-11-05 07:22:20 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @kcarpenter55 @redwins3_first @DonaldJTrumpJr I'm surprised Twitter isn't tagging your response to this video with the message, "Yes, it is normal."
1324129570824450049 2020-11-05 07:21:05 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @gracesaldanaa @RobinEnochs @realDonaldTrump On Monday he introduced his granddaughter as his deceased son who was a senator. His son was never a senator and his granddaughter is not his deceased son.
1324128627483553796 2020-11-05 07:17:20 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DebHaslam @MsMacAttack321 I'm surprised Twitter isn't tagging this video and saying "Yes, itis perfectly normal to throw away batches of live ballots on election day."
1324127758432133122 2020-11-05 07:13:53 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ericbolling @Lrihendry @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump So you believe the magical single-vote ballots that appeared overnight? Okay....I thought better of you Eric.
1324124824986214400 2020-11-05 07:02:13 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BretBaier Go ahead and brag but here's hoping this is the end of such numbers. After years with @Foxnews I left yesterday for @Newsmax and @realDailyWire. For good. Your coverage was a disgrace.
1324124230934355968 2020-11-05 06:59:52 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @PolitixGal @TheFive @newsmax Leaving @foxnews but wanted to see what @TheFive was saying. Sad that they are apparently signing on to the possibility that tens of thousands of ballots can magically appear overnight, every single one for Biden. I know they have to carry the Fox water, but so sad. Bye Five.
1324094526688952320 2020-11-05 05:01:50 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ligiaelenagv @TuckerCarlson And Biden admitted they had established the largest voter fraud organization in history.
1324092810841059328 2020-11-05 04:55:01 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TuckerCarlson You are the only one I will still be watching on @FoxNews. Hope you leave soon for better pastures (and please take Jesse with you), so I can leave Fox altogether.
1324089736558858240 2020-11-05 04:42:48 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BretBaier So @FoxNews believes that almost 200,000 ballots can magically be found in the middle of the night and every single one - every single one - can be for Biden. Good-bye Fox News.
1324088251523584002 2020-11-05 04:36:54 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DC_Draino He's also the guy who on Monday introduced his granddaughter as his deceased son who was a senator. His son was not a senator and his granddaughter is not his deceased son.
1324087388675584000 2020-11-05 04:33:28 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @seanhannity I know you're trying Sean, but I can't stomach @FoxNews anymore, which will mean leaving trusted ones like you behind. Oh and by the way, the Dems say that about their leadership every 2 years
1324083339981070336 2020-11-05 04:17:23 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GOPLeader I hope you intend to fight with @realDonaldTrump this time. Once again it looks like he is standing there all alone.
1324072061988335616 2020-11-05 03:32:34 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealEricCarmen @NanHayworth @robbystarbuck Me too. Except for @TuckerCarlson, who needs to go elsewhere, as so many of us have.
1324068946295758851 2020-11-05 03:20:11 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @michaelbd @news_revolver They didn't retreat. They were active members of the coup.
1324068469046874113 2020-11-05 03:18:17 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @catturd2 @DallasFaninIL No, except when the CDC announced yesterday that even if you have chovid, go ahead and vote in person.
1324067472790548481 2020-11-05 03:14:20 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ACTforAmerica @realDonaldTrump I absolutely trust him. And when he wins, the left will see that it's probably not a good idea to poke the murder hornet.
1324064438547226624 2020-11-05 03:02:16 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealJamesWoods Even if they did, too little, too late
1324064212490969094 2020-11-05 03:01:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @newsmax I did. Right away.
1324047521887387650 2020-11-05 01:55:03 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @robbystarbuck After years with @FoxNews, I am one who is moving on.
1324034125573939200 2020-11-05 01:01:49 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @thebradfordfile @OcrazioCornPop They're not going to recover anyway
1324025721430237185 2020-11-05 00:28:25 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @bayareagirl2012 @pnjaban Sadly, we all know the answer to that. 😡
1323905121290387456 2020-11-04 16:29:12 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Travistritt @FoxNews @newsmax Yup. @newsmax for our house, too! Disgraceful, manipulative coverage on @FoxNews. Only trust two or three of them anymore.
1323899873503010816 2020-11-04 16:08:21 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @WatchChad Surprised at how obvious they are about it. What a coincidence that critical states all decide simultaneously just to stop counting when a man they have despised for four years is winning.
1323887184567390208 2020-11-04 15:17:56 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GoldenlawSuze @DreamWeaver61 Impeachment 5.0

1323872849208123392 2020-11-04 14:20:58 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ScrewedHumans @DickMorrisTweet on @Newsmax certainly thinks so.
1323868273193086977 2020-11-04 14:02:47 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JosephJFlynn1 I left early for @Newsmax, and it's been great -- plus it's been fun hearing all about the trainwreck that has been @foxnews tonight. I, and I get the feeling plenty of others, will be making different viewer decisions moving forward.
1323856967010410497 2020-11-04 13:17:51 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TheBrandonMorse @MsMacAttack321 Sorry @TuckerCarlson. I love ya, but not watching. After years and years of Fox election nights, I, like so may others, have moved to @Newsmax.
1323851907094306816 2020-11-04 12:57:45 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SebGorka I don't even recognize them anymore -- and I have moved to @Newsmax.
1323851588683751424 2020-11-04 12:56:29 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @carolmswain @FoxNews @election2020 Absolutely not!!
1323848960524443648 2020-11-04 12:46:02 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Lrihendry Definitely.
1323842477128708098 2020-11-04 12:20:17 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @seanhannity We already knew that, Sean. @Foxnews is doing a terrible job, mostly intent on manipulating congressional races. Like so many others, I have officially left Fox for @Newsmax.
1323841706383474689 2020-11-04 12:17:13 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @michaeljknowles And @foxnews is now officially of the left.
1323840438361415683 2020-11-04 12:12:10 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @iheartmindy No, because I'm not watching @foxnews. After years of election nights with Fox, I have switched to @Newsmax, and it's great.
1323840129123848197 2020-11-04 12:10:57 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @PhillyTalk @DreamWeaver61 I hear Georgia is doing the same thing.
1323837976179191808 2020-11-04 12:02:23 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @secondhandwoke @FoxNews Switch to @newsmax -- or anyone else you can find. For the first time, I'm not watching @foxnews, and I'm having a great time!
1323835709371736064 2020-11-04 11:53:23 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @bfraser747 @FoxNews I'm not missing @foxnews at all! Having a great time with @newsmax.
1323834383891980293 2020-11-04 11:48:07 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Mitt Romney must be devastated.
1323832786604617728 2020-11-04 11:41:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MavericTV @FoxNews @Newsmax!
1323832666702032902 2020-11-04 11:41:18 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SebGorka Yes indeedy! I have always watched @foxnews on election night, but no more. They are spending all their time trying to manipulate the congressional races, and I'm spending my time on @newsmax, which is doing a great job!
1323828722248511488 2020-11-04 11:25:37 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @stillgray Oh, I hope so!
1323825791545741312 2020-11-04 11:13:58 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RubinReport Oh, I so hope so!
1323824762909384705 2020-11-04 11:09:53 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KamVTV Please, oh please!
1323821558368882689 2020-11-04 10:57:09 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JFrank3375 Turn on @Newsmax! They're great. And I say this as a former @foxnews fan.
1323821366399754240 2020-11-04 10:56:23 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @trish_regan Very I hope
1323820602575081474 2020-11-04 10:53:21 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TrumpJew Paul Ryan, plus they put some democrat operative in charge of calling (and apparently manipulating) races. For the first time, I'm not watching @foxnews. I'm watching @Newsmax and they're doing a great job.
1323819185508478976 2020-11-04 10:47:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @GregRubini @FoxNews @Foxnews is trying to manipulate the west. California polls haven't even closed yet, and we have some important congressional races here.
1323818896340606976 2020-11-04 10:46:34 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Marechtare1 @USMCMIL03 I agree! In the past I was loyal @foxnews. No more. The @newsmax coverage is great!
1323814617479405569 2020-11-04 10:29:34 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @realjuliasong Meanwhile @foxnews is tampering with voter perceptions and manipulating.
1323813483620704256 2020-11-04 10:25:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ArtValley818_ @Newsmax. I've always watched @foxnews in the past, but no more.

1322246748903940097 2020-10-31 02:39:25 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @jsolomonReports Then why no follow-up questions, Chris?

1322229579214327810 2020-10-31 01:31:12 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @charliekirk11 In my experience, it's those on the left who fear the virus. On the right ... not at all.

1322094481999454208 2020-10-30 16:34:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Rhumbaman @Lrihendry Indeed. We now know exactly who he works for.

1319521828281303040 2020-10-23 14:11:34 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @hodgetwins @JoeBiden To those claiming it was a joke: A joke is only a joke if it is delivered properly -- and with finesse.

1319342233796001792 2020-10-23 02:17:55 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MZHemingway Stahl was so whiney. And I loved when she had to admit that people are better off now and that she won't be fact checking, both of which I trust will be edited out.
1319003739995344897 2020-10-22 03:52:52 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BreitbartNews Note to leftists: The Nazis disarmed the populace, took over medical care and education, and silenced all opposition. Now who does that sound like?
1318990462426861570 2020-10-22 03:00:06 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DiamondandSilk I guess #thebigguy figured he's not a #mandatedreporter, so...

1318962021933535232 2020-10-22 01:07:05 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LarrySchweikart We also need to remember that not every dem is voting democrat.

1318711749701292032 2020-10-21 08:32:36 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RaheemKassam @JoeBiden The other side will claim that the VP isn't a mandated reporter.
1318625752103809024 2020-10-21 02:50:52 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @thebradfordfile @kansas_sun They can. They just won't.
1318622912690016256 2020-10-21 02:39:35 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @McKaylaRoseJ And she thinks it's adorable.
1318610525811474432 2020-10-21 01:50:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @XChrisopoulou @Phreadys And no #NFL
1318610110877368322 2020-10-21 01:48:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Phreadys Celebrating with my family as I always do.
1318589140909223937 2020-10-21 00:25:24 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Timcast She thinks it's cute.
1318270876597374976 2020-10-20 03:20:43 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @OD_ant Salute you!
1318048626334072832 2020-10-19 12:37:35 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @my3monkees @OcrazioCornPop He is an American hero. Lord, please keep him safe.
1318048336981549056 2020-10-19 12:36:26 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KellyO Have you ever been to a house of worship?
1317934816793227264 2020-10-19 05:05:21 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @FrankLuntz So why the heavy local California advertising for Biden in the Bay Area and LA?
1317930526104199168 2020-10-19 04:48:18 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealJamesWoods Unforgivable
1317861514271879169 2020-10-19 00:14:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BreitbartNews He was also open to standing by, smiling proudly, as his daughter was manhandled by the current dem nominee for president, ignoring her attempts to escape.
1317688551207698432 2020-10-18 12:46:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @CBSNews Biden keeps mispronouncing her name, too.
1317167705988845568 2020-10-17 02:17:07 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DineshDSouza I wish they would keep those promises -- but maybe all those other countries don't want them.
1316977223744839680 2020-10-16 13:40:13 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ColumbiaBugle Promises, promises, and they never follow through.
1316917064565751809 2020-10-16 09:41:09 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @AdamBaldwin @SteveGuest Shocked, shocked I tell you.
1316916793898917890 2020-10-16 09:40:05 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ReaganBattalion @NYGovCuomo What's next. Yellow stars on their sleeves?
1316812604094832640 2020-10-16 02:46:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LarryOConnor @GloriaJRomero @KABCRadio @recallgavin2020 Your dissertation on the polls this morning was awesome, @LarryOConnor. Everyone needs to listen to that!
1316776149549084672 2020-10-16 00:21:13 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @CoslettLinda @LindseyGrahamSC Yes you did! WTH @LindseyGrahamSC??!!
1316584069338079232 2020-10-15 11:37:57 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BrandonStraka Beautiful
1316494618591027200 2020-10-15 05:42:31 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @michaelbeatty3 @realDonaldTrump Beautiful
1316493729541185537 2020-10-15 05:38:59 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LeahR77 Equally disgusting is the laughter from his interviewers and the audience.
1316446122693529602 2020-10-15 02:29:48 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @joelpollak @BreitbartNews If only Coons had been so fierce when his daughter was being fondled by the current dem nominee for president. Instead he stood by smiling proudly while his daughter struggled to escape.
1316445057981972481 2020-10-15 02:25:34 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @yesnicksearcy @GeorgeTakei Just watch the highlights of the Biden "event" later to catch up on all the latest gaffs.
1316444184425848833 2020-10-15 02:22:06 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @FreeBeacon @AdamBaldwin @MerriamWebster @jchristenson_ Another institution compromised.
1316410728778141696 2020-10-15 00:09:10 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @kayleighmcenany @ValerieHarwell @JoeBiden His interviewers and the audience find this oh-so-funny. That is what I find even more disgusting in this clip.
1316394063025770496 2020-10-14 23:02:56 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DanScavino Most disgusting is how the interviewers and audience laugh at this.
1316269349687095296 2020-10-14 14:47:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @onetontex @TrumpJew And that tactic backfired bigly today with #ACB.
1316228802855403521 2020-10-14 12:06:15 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @thebradfordfile @jjauthor And our sons. All Americans who love and revere the Constitution.
1316228167036596225 2020-10-14 12:03:44 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SebGorka @DevinNunes Nothing.
1316226579312209920 2020-10-14 11:57:25 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SaraCarterDC @SpeakerPelosi Admitting her -- and the overall democrat -- tyrannical desires.
1316197996980125696 2020-10-14 10:03:50 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @pnjaban She did the same thing yesterday
1316168689528389632 2020-10-14 08:07:23 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @kayleighmcenany And this time kamala can't cry #mansplaining like she did with the @vp. Meanwhile #ACB had to endure relentless lecturing today, which she did with dignity and grace.
1316142189265612801 2020-10-14 06:22:05 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KatiePavlich A true role model for women. And men. All Americans.
1316141933232758784 2020-10-14 06:21:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealJamesWoods And she has had to endure mountains of #mansplaining today.
1316141589127860224 2020-10-14 06:19:42 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LLinWood And in the process revealing what dullards her inquisitors are.
1316114437137330177 2020-10-14 04:31:48 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @charliekirk11 Perhaps he needs to answer for stolen valor
1316110033059344385 2020-10-14 04:14:18 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RinaldoAndMe @scrowder @dbongino @amyklobuchar I think she did!
1316109209860071424 2020-10-14 04:11:02 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @scrowder @amyklobuchar Klobuchar always sounds and looks like she's about to cry.
1316107775710126080 2020-10-14 04:05:20 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @nopoliticaltalk @atensnut And she is an incredible role model for young men and women alike.
1316073018846711809 2020-10-14 01:47:13 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LadyRedWave Certainly what I'm hoping for during the next term of @realDonaldTrump
1316071470234136576 2020-10-14 01:41:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealJamesWoods I'd say more of a Participation Trophy.
1316067458520760321 2020-10-14 01:25:08 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @charliekirk11 She shamed his mansplaining.
1315859891513294848 2020-10-13 11:40:20 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @dr_palazzolo @maziehirono In addition to skyrocketing costs, our family lost our insurance 3 times and lost our doctors.
1315856994947932160 2020-10-13 11:28:49 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RichardGrenell Done? Nope. Methinks we'll be needing a new FBI director soon...
1315824377707950080 2020-10-13 09:19:13 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @StewardshipAmer They should have voted the Monday after she was nominated.
1315775095252553728 2020-10-13 06:03:23 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TrumpJew @ScottAdamsSays Does he think he was running for president against Romney?
1315745728883355648 2020-10-13 04:06:41 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ImJohnOHurley Well, you know, in case that whole president thing doesn't work out.
1315698498281508865 2020-10-13 00:59:01 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @sandyleevincent @GOP Same story for my family. And we lost our insurance and our doctors
1315698058206744576 2020-10-13 00:57:16 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @grammy620 When I see that senator, I just think of him (and his wife) standing by smiling while his daughter was being fondled by the current dem nominee for president. And I think of him (and his wife) ignoring his daughter's attempts to escape.
1315689936318689280 2020-10-13 00:24:59 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @charliekirk11 And after
1315401163378892800 2020-10-12 05:17:30 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ScottAdamsSays @americanblonde9 I don't know any Trump supporters who believe the polls. I doubt most on the other side do either.
1315351717806923777 2020-10-12 02:01:02 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealJamesWoods "Deserve." Such implications in that word.
1315314809043218432 2020-10-11 23:34:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @yesnicksearcy You were awesome in Justified! Everyone was.
1315211079908126720 2020-10-11 16:42:11 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @realMikeLindell @bfraser747 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @foxnews has fallen.
1315042325664415746 2020-10-11 05:31:37 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @tedcruz So tell us @JoeBiden, what do the American people "deserve?" Scraps from your table? Bread and circuses?
1315041894087368705 2020-10-11 05:29:54 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @kayleighmcenany Schitt's Creek and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel!
1314827534559703041 2020-10-10 15:18:07 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JesseKellyDC And it would seem this is a-okay with his wife.
1314821959167799296 2020-10-10 14:55:57 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @heather_giron @RubyRedRose8 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump God bless your wonderful granny. Prayers for her recovery.
1314611247527030784 2020-10-10 00:58:40 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ATPittman @DanielCameronAG @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr This "MAGAT" is pretty well-versed in the old Strunk &amp; White, so methinks I'll be leaving it as is.
1314609304582844422 2020-10-10 00:50:57 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MZHemingway @MattBatzel And we all believe the tired old "I-was-hacked" excuse, right?
1314481952188100608 2020-10-09 16:24:53 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Chicago1Ray @michaelbeatty3 @realDonaldTrump Tomorrow!
1314426744657518592 2020-10-09 12:45:31 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @atensnut Senate, just vote! ASAP!
1314415701394743297 2020-10-09 12:01:38 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ScottAdamsSays Dems just proving that they do indeed consider women weak and in need of accommodation.
1314345983422001152 2020-10-09 07:24:36 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DanielCameronAG @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Their refusing to answer is the answer.
1314335576284295168 2020-10-09 06:43:15 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DineshDSouza Great film. Saw it last weekend.
1314297642629779457 2020-10-09 04:12:31 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MeganFlanigan8 Plus according to Joe, two-thirds of our population has died from covid, so...
1314296970798718976 2020-10-09 04:09:50 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealJamesWoods My thought exactly!
1314231237041504256 2020-10-08 23:48:38 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @yesnicksearcy So many men. So little testosterone.
1314228522664169472 2020-10-08 23:37:51 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @itskylefife Nope
1314114853871599622 2020-10-08 16:06:10 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealJamesWoods And he and his boss both ignored her parents when they could have done something.
1314104842369945600 2020-10-08 15:26:23 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @dcreasman @BrentBozell @realDonaldTrump broke him. And there's no turning back.
1314104502182580229 2020-10-08 15:25:02 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BrentBozell Big surprise. Glad I wasn't there to see it. I refuse to watch him, Juan, the cheater-who-will-not-be-named, or most of the Fox team.
1314100488346898432 2020-10-08 15:09:05 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @CHIZMAGA @RealDealAxelrod I was thinking the same thing!
1314100172217958400 2020-10-08 15:07:50 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KNeal12 @RichardGrenell @Car0lina_Queen @KamalaHarris The fracking ad will be epic!
1314100041917689857 2020-10-08 15:07:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RichardGrenell @mrntweet2 @KamalaHarris California politics: where she ran for Senate as an Asian-Indian/American.
1314071572999593988 2020-10-08 13:14:11 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Mrsmmtbeauty He was so great that even the msm lapdogs are kind of having to admit it.

1314069990505508866 2020-10-08 13:07:54 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TheLeoTerrell @realDonaldTrump @VP @seanhannity Yes indeed, Sir, on both counts! You and our Vice President are awesome!
1314042490895233024 2020-10-08 11:18:38 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JasonMillerinDC @Italians4Trump She completely messed up the last question, and @Mike_Pence crushed it!
1314034821425840128 2020-10-08 10:48:09 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RichardGrenell @KamalaHarris And she proudly made it clear that she and Joe will sell out to China.
1314031256435191808 2020-10-08 10:33:59 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealJamesWoods And Kamala is on tape saying the same thing.
1314030932756635648 2020-10-08 10:32:42 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @benshapiro She's also made it clear that she and Joe are ready and willing to sell out to China
1314025088094674944 2020-10-08 10:09:29 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealJamesWoods And those questions have been tailored to assist her in that.
1314000549906317313 2020-10-08 08:31:58 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @marklevinshow @JRA19591 Nah, just leave them. Won't be back.
1313948821030723584 2020-10-08 05:06:25 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DiamondandSilk He also laughs at @greggutfeld whenever Greg talks about his neighborhood being looted and trashed. Yeah, real funny Juan.
1313948107256721408 2020-10-08 05:03:35 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DailyCaller Who cares? Too late.
1313947712128081920 2020-10-08 05:02:01 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump Nope.

1313908549047578624 2020-10-08 02:26:23 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DailyCaller They think that's inspiring?!
1313537247271022595 2020-10-07 01:50:58 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @1776Stonewall Suggesting that Biden even has a leadership style is laughable
1313515815304486913 2020-10-07 00:25:48 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BreitbartNews Shocked, shocked I tell you!
1313512787721641984 2020-10-07 00:13:47 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SaraCarterDC @JoeBiden Even after the baby is born no doubt.
1313317056909991937 2020-10-06 11:16:01 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DLoesch Compare this to the thousands permitted to show up at the "agenda" funerals. This is unforgivable.
1313315170421108739 2020-10-06 11:08:31 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @benshapiro Only counts if you found everything on the list -- and didn't have to call home for clarification 🐻
1313149840545574922 2020-10-06 00:11:33 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @_sassyboricua And they apparently don't realize that his secret service detail has been with him in the hospital. Ridiculous.
1313027397332033537 2020-10-05 16:05:01 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @jtd_gameon12 Yup. My family is moving on a little at a time, on to @OANN and @newsmax. Still love Tucker, Greg, Jesse and Laura, but daytime is unwatchable.
1313026384214724608 2020-10-05 16:00:59 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RichardGrenell @realDonaldTrump You are a warrior, too, @RichardGrenell. Thank you.
1313021188013084674 2020-10-05 15:40:20 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @pnjaban His secret service detail has been with him in the hospital. This isn't The Godfather!
1313004947189886977 2020-10-05 14:35:48 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @WendyLNDF So sorry. We never know when they are going to leave us, so we need to cherish every day. But he will be waiting for you and watching over you, and you will see him again.
1313003679864156161 2020-10-05 14:30:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @realDonaldTrump Looking and sounding like yourself again, Mr. President. So glad. But you stay there as long as you have to to make sure you are truly well.  We need you.
1312967614897905665 2020-10-05 12:07:27 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KurtSchlichter Do they think his Secret Service detail isn't with him in the hospital?
1312792577284870146 2020-10-05 00:31:55 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @pnjaban Wow! Warrior @joniernst! And all with a big beautiful smile!
1312791789833650176 2020-10-05 00:28:47 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @StarLasswell1 @Shem_Infinite There are so few @realDonaldTrump can trust.
1312790864469532673 2020-10-05 00:25:07 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @brithume Shocked, shocked I tell you.
1312536187236577281 2020-10-04 07:33:07 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @realDonaldTrump God bless you Mr. President. Take good care of your self and get some rest. We the people need you!

1312510816562810880 2020-10-04 05:52:18 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Mrsmmtbeauty @abbienormal9 @newsmax @OANN My household had been doing the same. Can only tolerate a few people on @FoxNews these days.
1312498250885156865 2020-10-04 05:02:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @catturd2 @FoxNews assisted him with damage control yesterday. Didn't work. Damage done.
1312496843750744065 2020-10-04 04:56:47 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealJamesWoods @YouTube And as usual, the parents just stand there smiling.
1312495723741499392 2020-10-04 04:52:20 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @senatemajldr @POTUS Thank you for the update. Now do the #SCOTUS vote this week!
1312431584528662529 2020-10-04 00:37:28 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @pnjaban And decent people hold doors open for everyone!
1312411240493281280 2020-10-03 23:16:37 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @CB618444 Damage control
1312410981213982722 2020-10-03 23:15:35 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @CB618444 I did the same.
1311920151827116032 2020-10-02 14:45:13 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @catturd2 Now more than ever!
1311919770833354754 2020-10-02 14:43:42 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @thebradfordfile And when @realDonaldTrump beats this too, the leftist head explosions will be deafening. Again. God bless our president, God bless @FLOTUS, and God bless America.
1311915974627524609 2020-10-02 14:28:37 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @almostjingo Stronger and even more powerful than ever.
1311915122718175236 2020-10-02 14:25:14 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @pnjaban @abc7newsbayarea @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Indeed. Positive doesn't mean sick or hospitalized. God bless our president, and when he emerges from this, he will be seen as even more of a warhorse!
1311767584916688896 2020-10-02 04:38:58 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealCandaceO @JoeBiden He also said that suburbs are being decimated by chovid.
1311764939149725696 2020-10-02 04:28:27 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Hoosiers1986 @FoxNews Nope
1311500857981067264 2020-10-01 10:59:05 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @HeyTammyBruce In other words, voting to destroy America. Forever. And oh how proud he is proclaiming it.
1311413679988985856 2020-10-01 05:12:40 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SteedleyMarnie @KatyinIndy @realDonaldTrump Our insurance costs skyrocketed. And we were not alone.
1311413102282383360 2020-10-01 05:10:23 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JunkoPatsye @norsemaid @marklevinshow I was so heartbroken when we lost him. Still am. We could certainly use his voice right now.
1311379730478690304 2020-10-01 02:57:46 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DLoesch Lot of material to dredge up on someone who has been 47 years in the swamp.
1311373829365665792 2020-10-01 02:34:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @chrismanack @TrumpGirlOnFire @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @kilmeade @Cowgirls4Trump @atensnut @TNTrumpGirl @my3monkees @caskett2014 @gailsline @YourJediMinion @fightinirish109 @ChanelRion Glad there are alternatives now to @FoxNews:  @OANN and @newsmax to name a couple.
1311372235051921408 2020-10-01 02:27:59 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @TeaBoots @TdAmerican The questions sure sounded like it. For example, Trump's taxes and not a word about Hunter's 3.5 million. And every question framed as though the leftist agenda is accepted truth.  Infuriating.
1311364068695920641 2020-10-01 01:55:32 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @norsemaid @marklevinshow It was that attack that changed Andrew Breitbart's life.
1311362745736941568 2020-10-01 01:50:17 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SusanStJames3 And the questions were framed as though every liberal agenda item and talking point is truth.  Of course @realDonaldTrump was angry!
1311216603271323651 2020-09-30 16:09:34 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JehannesD @benshapiro And the questions were framed as democrat talking points.
1311211263574159361 2020-09-30 15:48:21 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealJamesWoods @michaelbeatty3 So glad we have a republican who is willing to fight -- much to the chagrin of the mainstream pearl-clutching lapdogs.
1311205736030957568 2020-09-30 15:26:23 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealJamesWoods Even the way the questions were framed....nauseating.
1311201845621088256 2020-09-30 15:10:55 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BrandonStraka @AmericanPugs Great point, Brandon! So wonderful to have a street fighter on our side!
1311201094781947904 2020-09-30 15:07:56 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LLinWood @StayAwakeMarieS @realDonaldTrump And apparently, according to Biden, the suburbs are being destroyed by chovid. Huh?
1311200860152627202 2020-09-30 15:07:00 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KurtSchlichter What is going on with Jake Tapper? Wimpier and wimpier every day.
1311200433369567232 2020-09-30 15:05:18 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealEricCarmen @foxnewsnight @SpeakerRyan I wasn't about to listen to the cheater on the @foxnews post-game. Headed off to @newsmax, which I'm doing more and more these days.
1311178784083648514 2020-09-30 13:39:17 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @larryelder And Chris Wallace made it abundantly clear tonight that he is Team Biden.
1311145581239136256 2020-09-30 11:27:21 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealEricCarmen @FoxNews Won't watch @FoxNews when they have the cheater as a commentator. Switching to @newsmax
1311142597520314369 2020-09-30 11:15:29 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @michaelbeatty3 @realDonaldTrump He was protecting Biden
1311142089548161025 2020-09-30 11:13:28 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @kilmeade With very few exceptions, Wallace was Biden's guard dog.
1311125718042996736 2020-09-30 10:08:25 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @WEdwarda And Chris Wallace ran in to save Biden.
1311106665366708225 2020-09-30 08:52:42 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @seanmdav I won't watch anything with her on it. Sorry @foxnews. New tradition.
1310986840258695168 2020-09-30 00:56:34 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JohnRLottJr And the ears must be re-inspected after each break.
1310980523540410368 2020-09-30 00:31:28 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @toddstarnes @michaelbeatty3 @JoeBiden @KXEL1540 Shocked, shocked I tell you.
1310644340109185024 2020-09-29 02:15:35 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Lrihendry Here it comes....
1310270689337724928 2020-09-28 01:30:50 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @marklevinshow Someone tell Biden that the Nazis disarmed their populace, took over health care and education, and silenced all opposition. How does that differ from his and his party's agenda?
1310231531676299264 2020-09-27 22:55:14 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RaiderGang941 @GavinNewsom And so do the big smiles on her parents' faces.
1310138720884895744 2020-09-27 16:46:26 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @HeyTammyBruce Do it anyway, Sarah!
1309995947179388928 2020-09-27 07:19:07 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @WaShuGolf @Patrici15767099 And apparently the View chicks think Biden's wife should be Surgeon General!
1309947235317157888 2020-09-27 04:05:33 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @jerrywaynear14 @JoeBiden Someone needs to tell the left that "science" isn't just one big blob. The list of scientific disciplines is practically endless, each one unique and governed by unique protocols. Quit using one word to describe them all!
1309944170392350721 2020-09-27 03:53:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SeanCordanon Singing hymns outdoors -- and way too many to arrest.
1309906139425828864 2020-09-27 01:22:15 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DrKarlynB And which party seeks to take over health care and education, disarm the populace, and silence all opposition? I'll wait for the answer.
1309901428429709312 2020-09-27 01:03:31 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @WaShuGolf @Patrici15767099 She's actually not an MD. PhD in education. Just like "Dr." Ferrer in Los Angeles who is dictating medical policy: PhD in social welfare.
1309632985512079361 2020-09-26 07:16:50 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @tracybeanz His audience sure isn't finding him funny.
1309596011522711552 2020-09-26 04:49:54 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @KurtSchlichter So tired of the pampered elites promising this and not following through.
1309407867389136896 2020-09-25 16:22:17 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealJamesWoods This must go viral.  We will not "tolerate" animal abuse. And the dems are accountable.
1309394040954130432 2020-09-25 15:27:21 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @realredtarget @GSD_Guardian Most nauseating was that the other people in the stands just sat there quietly. In a real America, everyone would have ripped their own masks off (masks outside? Seriously?) and shouted, "Now come and get me!"
1309392522758598657 2020-09-25 15:21:19 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @benshapiro Perhaps this would be a good time for the men and women in the Congress actually to read the U.S. Constitution that they supposedly swear an oath to uphold.
1309337927025963009 2020-09-25 11:44:22 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LizRNC @TexasBaseballMa And some men -- too many men -- have truly have lost all remnants of testosterone. Every one of the other spectators should have ripped off their own masks and said, "now come and get me!"
1309278306743664640 2020-09-25 07:47:28 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @gatewaypundit And in Idaho!
1309268612234973185 2020-09-25 07:08:56 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DeAnna4Congress Lawsuit. First amendment. Cruel and unusual.
1309261894780293120 2020-09-25 06:42:15 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @chiIIum Thank you. Such a lovely story  And another reminder of the actual "essential" jobs on our society, something that has become abundantly clear in the last 6 months.
1308885497171898368 2020-09-24 05:46:35 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @SidneyPowell1 @realDonaldTrump Is @FoxNews even covering this?  If not, that is certainly telling.
1308864414322429958 2020-09-24 04:22:48 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealJamesWoods Read #TheNatashas to see how insidious this is.
1308839660416905216 2020-09-24 02:44:26 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DailyCaller The Nazis took over health care and education,  disarmed the populace, and silenced all opposition. Now who does that sound like, huh?
1308839222841937920 2020-09-24 02:42:42 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @michaelbeatty3 @gaye_gallops @realDonaldTrump And just what did you and your husband and daughter do about it, darling?
1308838492236140544 2020-09-24 02:39:48 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @charliekirk11 Read #TheNatashas and see what Hunter and so many others have supported.
1308824217836597249 2020-09-24 01:43:04 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @DonaldJTrumpJr @thebradfordfile Everyone read #TheNatashas and see what a big deal it is.
1308822045753450496 2020-09-24 01:34:27 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @WatchChad Enter corona excuse to get out of the debate. Wait for it...5,4,3,2...
1308820791513903104 2020-09-24 01:29:28 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @trish_regan Hey Joe, you are judged by the company you keep. Oh and hey @FoxNews, bring back @trish_regan!
1308820429306343425 2020-09-24 01:28:01 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @trish_regan Shocked, shocked I tell you!
1308820129833132037 2020-09-24 01:26:50 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Nakadinthemud @charliekirk11 @CNN Indeed. He needs to write a second edition.
1308807616735322114 2020-09-24 00:37:06 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @charliekirk11 @CNN I suggest everyone read the book #TheNatashas and see exactly what this means.
1308805185049772032 2020-09-24 00:27:27 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @charliekirk11 @CNN We know they don't care about the victims of human trafficking. This is despicable.
1308578455814987776 2020-09-23 09:26:30 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @yesnicksearcy @AP She's been "endorsing" against @realDonaldTrump for years. No shock here.
1308255670660030466 2020-09-22 12:03:52 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BreitbartNews Hurling threats with rapid-fire speed at the American people.
1308189165528334337 2020-09-22 07:39:36 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @JesseKellyDC These never Trumpers sure are trusting of the Dems. Where have they been all these years?
1308188332015251456 2020-09-22 07:36:17 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @mattmargolis @JamesRosenTV I was just going to ask the same thing!
1308158384009482240 2020-09-22 05:37:17 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RubinReport In addition to such a disgusting spectacle, such a fine example kimmel is setting for his children.
1308144359297003520 2020-09-22 04:41:34 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Timcast @maverickgolddfs Absolutely appalling scenario. What an example he is settin for his own children!  Oh and the "abused-child" analogy is spot on!
1308142466487316482 2020-09-22 04:34:02 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LovelyGigi33 Even more despicable are the smiling parents who permit their daughters to be fondled and manhandled by that dirty old man.
1308139759936528391 2020-09-22 04:23:17 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @MelissaAFrancis @DanHenninger Used to trust you. So sad. Oh and hey, @FoxNews, bring back @trish_regan!
1308121517050347520 2020-09-22 03:10:48 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Ljarvis75 Wow. So done with @HARRISFAULKNER. What a difference a week makes!
1308081100611178496 2020-09-22 00:30:12 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @greggutfeld Apparently Thanos did the snap. But by some miracle, my whole family and everyone I know survived!

1307540598983802881 2020-09-20 12:42:26 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @BillFOXLA Yes! I saw it last night in Orange County. I, too, was totally confused, but I didn't care because I was at a movie theater and it was sublime!

1306994875745804288 2020-09-19 00:33:55 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @LadyRedWave Never mind classless.  Just so boring, repetitive and un-creative.  Is that the best she's got?

1306243401872936960 2020-09-16 22:47:50 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @Tommy_USA @DLoesch @JoeBiden Everyone see the documentary "Waiting for Superman" and see the children and families Biden and his party are trying to crush even more.
1306019551461756928 2020-09-16 07:58:20 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @johnrich @greggutfeld @TheJuanWilliams @KatiePavlich @DanaPerino Juan's response today to @greggutfeld about the horrible Compton shooting was that this is why we need police reform, so no.
1305984385863229440 2020-09-16 05:38:36 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @michaelbeatty3 Any minute now.

1305065218398060545 2020-09-13 16:46:09 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @ClayTravis Too late. Not watching. Ever again.
1304942471990841345 2020-09-13 08:38:24 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @atensnut Indeed.  We already have that, Joe.

1303863938421981186 2020-09-10 09:12:42 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @atensnut And he did a little fake cough today to prepare us all for the big announcement.

1303803678575308800 2020-09-10 05:13:15 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @adamcarolla @MayorOfLA A left-wing politician once again acknowledging that masks don't work.
1303389883789008897 2020-09-09 01:48:58 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @atensnut That is exactly what will happen.
1302348129883189248 2020-09-06 04:49:25 +0800 <TheGrizzlyMom> @RealEricCarmen Notice how the Atlantic story dropped the day after Nancy stepped in it. Methinks they planned to release the Atlantic story closer to the election.
