1343338346710511618 2020-12-28 07:29:54 +0800 <L48130> @RetroCrone Definitely feels real. I am almost 70. My husband is 74.  We stay home. Have only been to medical appts or grocery store since March. Mom, 91, is in a nursing home. First Covid outbreak killed 13 residents. Second outbreak just identified.  Cannot even visit her.

My family always cut another few inches off the trunk, before putting it in the stand.  Usually the Sunday before Christmas.  Then, took it down the Sunday between Christmas and New Year.

Some items, I label no substitutions, such as no sugar added applesauce. They pick&amp;pack the grocery list, run thru checkout, then load in my car trunk. Cash or credit card. Really like it.

I was the first person in my Dad's family to graduate from college.  And the first to graduate from high school.  UofM was worth every effort. Study hard and enjoy A2!

1333960620476166145 2020-12-02 10:26:10 +0800 <L48130> @SassyWoman2020 I have not heard this. Is "subject to mandatory recall" a licensing requirement? A student loan rqmt? Males might potentially be subject to military draft. Drafting women would need a legislative change. But, we are a long way from a military draft.

1333869670340898818 2020-12-02 04:24:46 +0800 <L48130> @VoLinxx Hi!  Just stopping by to say hello.  Let's have virtual tea together in this street cafe, enjoy the sun on our faces, and watch the people walking past us.

Strategic planning looks at today, visualizes what should be or will be, and lays out the plan to get there. So, as a population ages, zone for more one story homes, train more health workers, nurture public trans, repurpose schools to senior centers, etc.

But, we have also spent 5 years taking care of her children while she got her life together.  It hurts me.  But, it breaks my husband's heart.  We did not hear anything either.

1331775759992680450 2020-11-26 09:44:19 +0800 <L48130> @notyour_uncle Please do not feel shame. Losing your job, reduced hours, are mostly beyond your control at this time. This is the year for something other than electronics and Legos. Walks in the park, baking Christmas cookies, your kid's making gifts from recycle or crayon candles &amp; ice cubes.

1331646079402713089 2020-11-26 01:09:00 +0800 <L48130> @clairecmc The key to celebrating holidays away from family is to do something different.  Maybe a different meat or side dishes.  Watching that longed for movie rather than the parades.  Little differences make distance easier.

1305576556270686208 2020-09-15 02:38:02 +0800 <L48130> @ida_skibenes Take a deep breath.  We need to stay the course.  Calm.  Determined.  United.  Effective.  About 7 weeks to Election Day.  Then, we work like hell to clean up the mess.

It covers the extra expenses from her long term care.  I paid the LTC insurance for her for 14 years.  Tapped out.

1304675053645238278 2020-09-12 14:55:47 +0800 <L48130> @ScoobyMcpherson Start a 401k.  As much as you can.  Maybe half of any raises?  Or, 7%.  Or, whatever it takes to meet the company match.  I started with $10 per pay period.  Then a flat percentage afterward.  I have money to retire on while similarly situated relatives &amp; friends do not.

Some accomplishment that you can point to  doing in this time. Third read funny books, watch funny movies, listen to upbeat music.  We will get thru this.

When the story broke last night, he sat here with his head in his hands. Could not sleep. The hurt and anger these cmts instilled in the military family is deep.

Smoking any substance inside a building is most likely a fire and safety hazard as well as illegal. Failing to do anything is endangering the health of others. It will probably just take a hallway stroll.
