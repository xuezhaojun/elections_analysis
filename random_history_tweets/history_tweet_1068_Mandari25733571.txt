I think his call out to her that "He wishes her well." was a dog whistle for her to remain silent and that he's got her escape route planned.

That very few Dems got Covid, and that was because they wore masks. Including AOC.

Putting his unqualified sychophants in charge, he opened the door to Rusdia..  It was the final loyalty test for Trump that was put forth by Putin. Trump passed with flying colors.

1339625819304579073 2020-12-18 01:37:39 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @RepSwalwell Possibly that Russian hack was a loyalty test to Trump from Putin to stand down and stand back?  Seems by weakening our security agencies by firing top security officials and hiring unqualified sycophants, Trump opened the door for Russia.  Treason!?

He will think it's a Big "Fuck You!" to Americans who voted for Biden, as well as a "GoFuckYourself!" to the people in Palm Beach opposing  his Maralago residency.    Truthfully, we will be glad to see him go.

Trump's got something up his sleeve. He's too stupid to realize if something happens to Biden/Harris, he still leaves Jan. 20 and Nancy Pelosi becomes President.

1337380907624390658 2020-12-11 20:57:10 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @realDonaldTrump You've made the world a more dangerous place by leaving an opening for authoritarian regimes to attack our Allies.  You worked hard to give Putin everything he wanted.   What did you get in return? How much?  What was the price to be a traitor to our country?
1337379847178477569 2020-12-11 20:52:57 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @realDonaldTrump Ha!  The H1N1 vaccine was a success.  Sadly over 12,000 people died, but the virus was put in to control by a wise, caring leader. We didn't shut down and lose millions of jobs.  Here we are 9 months later and over 290,000 people are dead, with 3,000 dying PER DAY! U DO NOTHING
1337378667501137923 2020-12-11 20:48:16 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @Monaheart1229 Ironic words as he sits by and watches executions during his lame duck session. There are 5 more scheduled in the next few weeks. Trump wanted to bring back the firing squad too.
1337372880166850560 2020-12-11 20:25:16 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @Monaheart1229 Rand doesn't care. His bills are paid and he has money in the bank. He doesn't give two shits about the federal employess being separated from their paychecks at Christmas during a pandemic.

Shots don't work, because she has never had the flu.   Oh, and masks dont work because she has not had the Coronavirus. Vaccines don't work either.  🤔🤔🤔

However, it would be her admitting she was wrong for making fun of us doomsday preppers who have been wearing masks up in NY.

I mean Trump even had Dejoy sabotage the mail!

Since going back to work in June she has been exposed to Covid three times, and has had to quarantine for two weeks each time. She did not get paid, 2 of her patients lied to her in the health form when asked if they had been tested recently.

Including about the packaging company Uline, whonow sells PPE.

He went in, conveniently, a month before the election for a heart or arterial stent. It was prob discovered last November, in the sudden Sat night Walter Reed visit, as a partial blockage. Dr. Phillip prob knows it too.
1336262218585939969 2020-12-08 18:51:54 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @ColinJ1992 @MattGertz @realDonaldTrump There's a hidden money trail somewhere to Trump's coffers by letting the virus run rampant through the country.   The 63 million doses of hydroxychloroquine Trump bought and needs sold, the control of the PPE prices as well the prices on the effective drug Remdesivir.
1336260863502716928 2020-12-08 18:46:31 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @chipfranklin Kelly Loeffler's husband made a million dollar donation to a RNC Super pac after news of his wife's suspicious stock trading (bribe to stop the investigation?)

Trump's malignant narcissism is paranoid at times, requiring him to issue loyalty tests to his sycophants, to make sure they are solid.

Trump is handing them out like candy to spoiled children who have mouthfuls of rotten teeth.

Familiar with logos, directors, release dates.  He is in a group on FB that is similar autistic that do videos of opening &amp; explaining the DVD's they acquire from thrift or flea markets.

1334156571182587904 2020-12-02 23:24:48 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @davidfrum Putin most likely blackmailed Trump while also enticing him with monetary rewards to help get Trump voted in, and have Trump do his bidding.   As we see, 4 years later Trump has made many moves to reward Russia for their support.  Trump is their useful idiot.

To see if they would go. Narcissists like Trump put people through different types of loyalty tests. I think this wasoneof them.  Probably to thank Putin in person for the money.

1331025765530546176 2020-11-24 08:04:06 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @realDonaldTrump You have to "We will prevail" to keep your base to continue on donating. Do they know the RNC gets 25 cents, your leadership PAC gets 50 cents, and the voter fraud fund gets 25 cents of every dollar? That the PAC is money at your disposal, and left over fraud $ goes to ur debt?

1330620286815916032 2020-11-23 05:12:52 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @tomiahonen I just want a man to look at me with so much desire like the way Pence does to Trump.
1330619659977170944 2020-11-23 05:10:23 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @scrowder Omg...that's what a home health aide to my friend's mother said about a Halloween party.  Advance forward two weeks, and the aide is positive, my friend's mom is, and her husband died last week of Covid.   The home health aide had a great time at the party, its all that matters.

I look at all your awards and I am like, "Wow"....but I guess being a respected journalist got boring  and/or didn't pay enough.  So, I guess you are okay with being a Fox News hack now.  This is so sad to see. Very sad.
1330474537499176962 2020-11-22 19:33:43 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @WajahatAli I would prefer Biden hanging Obama's potrait instead of Trump.

My grandfather had polio, he missed the Salk vaccine by 25 years. He lived to be 82. He would be pro science and pro vaccinations if he were here today.

1330461037343207426 2020-11-22 18:40:04 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @stevenportnoy I remember in the early days of 2017 how pissed off you were when Trump put a lid on the WH and then after the press pool left he went over to his DC hotel to have dinner with a fawning crowd.  At least Biden went to church.

He has a small disclaimer that any donations under 8,000 are used to pay his campaign debts.  He does, however, want to take the election decision to the Supreme Court to decide.  5 to 3 in favor of him.

I came home from kindergarten, after month in, and found 8x10 and 16×20 professionally framed pictures of my Mom and 3 yr old sister on the walls.  Just them, no pics of the other 3 children anywhere in frames.  Like, wow, really

1329167466640134144 2020-11-19 04:59:53 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @Rebellionista @Wilson53055839 Business needs to ve reported tgrough an agency.  My Uncle used to taxi a young man who was wheelchair bound to a facility where they kept telling him he'd get paid soon..mess up on the paperwork?  6 weeks later they let him go, no paycheck, and he was out 6 weeks of taxi money 2
1329166636373389312 2020-11-19 04:56:35 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @BSpider17 @Rebellionista It's free labor a week before Thanksgiving.  Busiest time for a lot of bakeries.   The owner will probably decline after a week of free labor, but willing to give him another shot with a  pay-free week in a month's time, which is a  week before Christmas.   Get it now?
1329165607573594115 2020-11-19 04:52:30 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @Rebellionista The week before Thanksgiving is the busiest time for a bakery.  Owner wants free help.  Say no.  It's against labor laws anyways.

1329115464170164225 2020-11-19 01:33:15 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @chipfranklin Trump's tweets are a danger to the whole world. By doing a public notice of his scaling back troops, he's offering up our Allies and endangering the remainder of our troops over seas.

It's blatant ignorance and abject deniability.   People aren't born racists and bigots, mostly it's taught at home.
1329090683005648896 2020-11-18 23:54:46 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @TheRealHoarse It isn't education that failed them, it's the blatant ignorance of their moral sense that leads to premeditated brain washing.

1329089593388331011 2020-11-18 23:50:27 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @NikkiHaley Hi Nikki. Do you know how SSI started?  The first set of people who qualified due to their retirement age did not pay into SSI but they benefited right away. This relieved poverty and homeless for the elderly.  The forgiven college loans will roll back into the economy. Win win.

Biden/Harris are smart, but if they move too quick they can cause Trump to do more damage to our country in next 64 days.    He seeks vengeance, they know it, so just wait. At least there is a future with them, none with Trump.

1328665498993762304 2020-11-17 19:45:15 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @OhNoSheTwitnt I asked a week ago in my pinned tweet if Trump might start a war with Iran. Trump wanted to be a wartime President and he is deranged enough to attack first.
1328665201047199744 2020-11-17 19:44:03 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @OhNoSheTwitnt I'm suspicious of Moderna announcing a vaccine that is 94% effective on Monday before opening bell.  4% more effective than Pfizer's?  Like a threatening tweet from Trump manipulated their announcement to avoid their stock from tanking. Trump Tweet controlling the markets again.
1328663682109337605 2020-11-17 19:38:01 +0800 <Mandari25733571> Anybody else besides me suspicious that Moderna announces their vaccine is 94% effective just before opening bell on Monday? 4% better than Pfizer's?  Trump operates with the threat of a vengeance tweet that could sink your stock, might make Moderna make premature announcement?
1328552141980626944 2020-11-17 12:14:48 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @LisaHagan7 Yes. Whats a few weeks of shutdown and a bit of inconvenience to get the infection under control compared to months of more people dying.
1328551720528601089 2020-11-17 12:13:08 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @educated_educ8r Yes. Anything to control the infection and reduce the risk.
1328551576517140480 2020-11-17 12:12:33 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @smalltwngirl918 In a coroner's van.  Too harsh? I don't care. Just like he does not care about the 246,000 dead Americans from Covid.

1328537335571632132 2020-11-17 11:15:58 +0800 <Mandari25733571> My tweet from 6 days ago. Now, today  we find out Trump wanted to attack Iran last week.  Trump wanted to be a wartime President. He has been fascinated with nukes since the beginning.
1328536796268023810 2020-11-17 11:13:49 +0800 <Mandari25733571> My tweet from 5 days ago. Now we find out Trump was going to attack Iran first.

Lindsey was a huge critic of Trump until Trump &amp; Graham played golf Oct 2017, Graham became Trump's greatest sycophant that day.  What was in the emails?  https://t.co/TffqkVvepC
1328528635138072577 2020-11-17 10:41:24 +0800 <Mandari25733571> Lady G had his emails hacked in Dec. 2016 by Russia.  They never surfaced. Graham flipped to Trump's greatest sycophant Oct. 9, 2017 during a game of golf. What was in those emails?  https://t.co/TffqkVvepC

He came down from his home in Canada as a snowbird when his Florida friends said things were under control and Gov. Deathsantis was doing a phenomenal job. Things are not under control. He died due to the lies.

One year it didn't happen and we thought our preventative measures finally worked. Until a customer spotted a fat little bat hanging upside down by the EXIT sign.   We removed it, flies were back in an hour.

My guess is they took advantage of Hope Hicks getting Covid to take him into WR for a heart cath or stent. Something they diagnosed last year w his surprise WR "part 1 of annual physical" last November.   He then kept saying Regeneron to boost the stocks.

1327386497746690048 2020-11-14 07:02:57 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @tremans @VP Pence was neutered by Trump back in 2016. I kind of wonder what deep dark secrets Trump has over him.

1327248964668829696 2020-11-13 21:56:26 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @TheRealHoarse I love defunct series finales. It's a relief when the excessive internal cringing finally ends.  This particular show never got off the ground, but we have our vocabulary misspelling  memories...Covfefe, Hamberders, text massages, Prince of Whales, smocking gun, etc.

BTW, 1 million is the going rate to sell out our future  generations of childrens health.  In 2017 Trump reversed a ban on a pesticide Dow company makes that causes nerve damage and possible autism in children.  Dow gave him a million for his campaign.
1326322694678339584 2020-11-11 08:35:46 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @MalcolmNance Hi Malcom, @MalcolmNance What are the chances that Trump will start a war with Iran in the next 70 days?He's replacing DOD heads with his unqualified sycophants and the overseer for our nuclear stockpile resigned Friday.   He has always wanted to be a wartime POTUS.He is deranged

1325455451383848960 2020-11-08 23:09:40 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @J_Schiavo That there were 1.8 m  Democrats registered in KY. but only 1.6 m Republicans and Amy McCrath got less than 800,000 votes. But McConnell cleared 89% of the votes. McConnell surpressed the vote in GA by getting rid of polling sites.   Imagine what he could do in KY?

He gave his we are losing speech, was able to pick up a little light reading with a unique book light, and cremate the only printed copies of Trump's tax returns. Which now, will never see the light of day, so that's completely solved

1325126476824535041 2020-11-08 01:22:26 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @EricCortellessa Maybe it's all Donnie could afford. Are they the ones that did the hack job on the Rose Garden?

1325104064523362305 2020-11-07 23:53:22 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @bridget_joy_ No.   We have paid enough for his garbage leadership.  It should be a free watch of a  shit show.   I hope the Vindman brothers are designated escorts.
1325103743189327876 2020-11-07 23:52:06 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @BillKristol The fact that the overseer for security of the nuclear stockpile resigned yesterday does not help me feel very confident.    Trump has wanted to throw a nuke at somebody for over 4 years now.  Possibly one of the blue states, he's that deranged.
1325102863735910400 2020-11-07 23:48:36 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @tusslebug It's not how your state turns out Red or Blue. It's how you feel knowing you did the right thing.
1325102488920481799 2020-11-07 23:47:07 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @MrJonCryer 30,000 cases and countin, over 700 dead and counting.  He had 4 rallies the day before election alone.  Covid infection results are not in yet.

1325101396107145222 2020-11-07 23:42:46 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @maggieNYT Wow.  Maybe Trump gets it for realsies this time. I think his other "covid infection" was a heart stent or heart cath.  They will try to hide everything.
1325100848461045764 2020-11-07 23:40:36 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @soledadobrien His next tweet says it's satire.  LOL.

1325097746555080704 2020-11-07 23:28:16 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @AshaRangappa_ Very nice eulogy Laura.

1324938718638190593 2020-11-07 12:56:21 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @TheRealHoarse Imagine having half a nation despising you and they are frequently express it on social media. That's a lot for one person to handle, it can effect their very soul.  If they have one. Trump does not and I imagine he has made sure his children hide theirs from vulnerability.

If it were a non pandemic year itd be huge just with Harris as first woman Veep.  Somebody should tell Donnie that his Inauguration was bigger than Biden's will be. Maybe then he will concede. Prepare to gloat.

He will start rallies right away, once a week, then it will slow to twice a month, then peter out to once a month or every 2 months.Eventually the $$ dries up. He retires to golfing.

1324514615745761281 2020-11-06 08:51:07 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @Davidlaz I think he will be past mid state dementia by then. My guess, he will distract the media and file to run for 2024 on Biden's Inauguration Day.  Then start having weekly rallies, which over time will taper down to once or twice a month, then slowly peter out in 4 yrs time.
1324513983907405826 2020-11-06 08:48:36 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @pdx2ord Also, a zoom sing along.   Nah, nah, nah, nah Hey hey hey Kiss him goodbye.

Hey everybody, do not engage with them. Stay home and celebrate. Make popcorn and watch a much deserved movie. Turn off the news finally after Biden is declared.  Stay safe.

He will then start doing rallies till the campaign money runs out. He needs the adoration like he needs air.     He will then retire to Maralago to go  golf everyday. Unless the SDNY gets him for Rikers.

He will then start doing rallies immediately, using some of his own money, for almost 4 years, in which then will taper off.   Unless SDNY gets him tossed in jail.

If so, those temporary ones can be whomever he chooses. Still putting forth his choices to Mitch. It'll keep Mitch busy but also blowing in the wind.  Hope he doesn't get wind cancer.
1324394662728224768 2020-11-06 00:54:28 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @kim He's building a wall around Maralago. Mexico won't pay for that one either.

Anybody heard me say that would assume its about his reporting, not sexism. Exactly the way you feel about Maggie, it's her way of reporting that at times sowed confusion and contempt.

Half the class would be siding with him because they themselves admired his bullying ways and also did not want to be a victim of this bully.   Trump is a bully and class clown in this introspect.

Katko has voted with Trump 99% of the times and claims he likes Trump's policies (for example, Kids in cages).  Now that Katko's race is close, he is backpeddling as fast as he can.

Instead, Hope Hicks had it, so he went ahead and played off that for sympathy and empathy votes. Also, great time to get Regeneron stocks to soar. After all, he gave them $750 million to find a cure.

Two new studies suggest that people with type O blood may be less likely to contract and suffer serious complications from the coronavirus.   That's all I can fathom as to why Porky didn't pass from it.

Anything to keep the media focused on him, not on Biden.  Then he will spend the next 4 years doing rallies. He needs the adoration and the desire to feel loved, just like humans need air and water.
1318133824405078017 2020-10-19 18:16:08 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @donwinslow  My guess, he will file for presidential nomination on Inauguration Day.  Mostly to distract the media from Joe's Inauguration event.   Then Trump will spend the next 4 years doing rallies.  He needs the adoration for his frail ego and his desire to feel loved.

However, there are some solutions, like wearing masks, sanitizing and washing hands frequently to reduce infections.  Like Arizona who decreased infection by 75% wearing masks. Such a small ask, please wear a mask.

Let's see if you can defend your wife, your father and yourself against Trump like you defend the repulsive GOP.

1314060764395843584 2020-10-08 12:31:14 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @realDonaldTrump Mike Pence is not a she, although in your defense, it is hard to tell at times.
1314060417648517121 2020-10-08 12:29:52 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @AngrierWHStaff Somebody should put this to the song "Shoo Fly, Don't Bother Me".

1314056448494784512 2020-10-08 12:14:05 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @maddow  Todays video. Right eye mostly closed, right cheek swollen and it looks like stiches disguised by bandage and makeup. O'Donnell @Lawrence pointed out the bottom half of face was a darker color than the top. A darker color on the bandage would be very obvious. Trump fall?  https://t.co/FrWbeAYhWm

Cheeks and the bottom of face darker than top.  With darker color on top then the bandage they have over his stiches  would be very obvious.

My guess, he's afraid Kamala will bring bigger ratings then his debate w Biden.   So, if he shows up, he can claim the ratings were bigger because the citizens of America wanted to see him to be sure he is well.

1313789106015666176 2020-10-07 18:31:46 +0800 <Mandari25733571> In most of America it would be very wealthy.  In big cities, where it costs a lot more to live, taxes and cost of living expenses, it would not.   Biden is talking to the large percentage of America that live under 75,000 a year.

If he wins, it'll be a moderate sum to help the poor and down trodden. If he loses, it will be peanuts.  He's literally buying votes with taxpayers money.

It didn't work.  Hearing Biden speak intelligently and with full, comprehensible sentences was ❤💯.   You don't realize how much you have missed it, like breathing fresh air.

1313426115030069250 2020-10-06 18:29:22 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @ShimonPro Trump also did his best to time his leaving Walter Reed, knowing the media would be fully tuned in, so it would overlap Joe Biden's Town Hall.   Except, most media outlets turned to watch Joe Biden's Town Hall. Hearing intelligent words and full sentences was like  ❤💯. (sigh)

He is friends with the CEO.  Bet Trump has secret stock.
1312887619483824129 2020-10-05 06:49:35 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @yasminv Are you positive? Is he?

1312875150208110592 2020-10-05 06:00:02 +0800 <Mandari25733571> Good!! Trump just put his staff and secret service at infection risk with a jaunt to wave at proud boys outside.

1312637466638266368 2020-10-04 14:15:34 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @IvankaTrump There's one problem.  Two photos, at a small round table he wore a jacket, at this long table his jacket is off.  The metadata shows these two pictures were taken at 5:35 p.m. Et and the other at 5:45 p.m. Et.   Which means they were staged photo ops.

The only problem is that the metadata shows these two pictures were taken exactly 10 minutes apart. Moved him to a diff room. Staged photo ops.

It has not been through all the trials, it is not FDA approved.  According to one Dr. just one dosage can cost $20000 to 40,000 The stock yugely rose up Friday.

1312096283839127553 2020-10-03 02:25:06 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @jeremynewberger It'd be a hell of a series finale of  The Apprentice: POTUS Edition.  Also, a happy ending for Americans who knew this vile monster was evil.

1309573790980923392 2020-09-26 03:21:37 +0800 <Mandari25733571> Trump is using the media for distraction by saying he won't concede if he loses.  He doesn't want the media and the country focused on the 204,000 people who have died from Covid, and we are still losing up to a 1,000 people a day.  Trump will be escorted out and he knows it.

Then after your last interview July 21st you continued to withold it and over 20,000 people died in that 7 weeks.  So you could release it to coincide with your books release.    Murderer!

1304168771616223237 2020-09-11 05:24:00 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @TomJChicago So tell me, why did Bob do his last interview on July 21st, but Bob withheld that audio till September 8?   Meanwhile over 20,000 people died in that 7 weeks time.  Hd did it to coincide with the release of his book. He wrote the book independently, the tapes were all his. Greed!

He even waited an additional  7 more weeks after the last interview,  where 20,000 more people died, to release it to coincide with his book release.  B.S.

A month earlier in NYC could have saved tens of thousands of lives.  Bloody hands still on Trump &amp; GOP. But, cmon Bob!
1304139824652222472 2020-09-11 03:28:58 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @sjredmond Exactly.  Bob Woodward included!  He kept that audio to himself for 7 months for a freaking book!!  It could have saved lives!

Now, we willnever know.  Trump handed Bob a smoking gun and Bob hid it as a favor to Trump for 7 months!! If even one or two lives could have been saved, it wouldve been worth it.

It could have stopped him from lying, so he didn't look like a fool contradicing himself.  Malignant narcissists hate looking like fools.   That tape could have changed everything and lives saved.

He could have shared it months ago, or even after thr last interview of July 21st.   That's what journalists do.  Instead, he did what greedy, self serving aholes do.  And yes, Trump is always at fault, no  contest, Ill agree
1304056658537177088 2020-09-10 21:58:30 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @ChrisCuomo As much as I despise Trump, a soulless bastard, I have to ask..  Why didn't Bob share the audio 7 months ago?  He even waited for 7 weeks after the last interview, over 20,000 people died.   A nationwide mask mandate could have saved lives. Even red state Govs wouldve complied.
1304055316926132224 2020-09-10 21:53:10 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @SoulBlossom_Wen @mechteldehuning @robreiner Thank you.  Bob not pulling the alarm would be the same as me watching my neighbors house burn, with them in it, because I've been hoping to buy their property to expand mine.   I could never sleep with that on my conscience.
1304054421794455553 2020-09-10 21:49:36 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @DoYouEvenLif I worry.  But I'm also pissed. We already know Trump lies 24/7.  That audio Bob shared, he had that for 7 months. How many could have been saved w a nationwide mask mandate? Bob should have pulled the alarm. He even waited 7 weeks after the last interview due to his precious book

I think that audio would have shamed many of the red state governors to participate in a nationwide mask mandate.    If not, their citizens might have chosen to wear them on their own.

I'm a NY'r and thanks to Cuomo I know what masks can do to stop Covid-19.

My point, that even red state Governors would have been forced into a nationwide mask mandate.  It alone could have saved so many.   Ima NY'r, so I know what masks can do. Thanks Cuomo!

Bob should have pulled the alarm 7 months ago. As a reporter, he should have revealed this vital audio. Not save it for his book.   1,000's have died in that time 2 were my family
1304049086908301312 2020-09-10 21:28:25 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @TeaPainUSA Tea, I despise Trump &amp; his sycophants.  Woodward had a vital, life saving audio for 7 months that could have saved 1000's.  Even after his last interview, July 21, and over 20,000 died, he waited 7 weeks to reveal his tape for his book. Nationwide mask mandate could have saved
1304048347850903552 2020-09-10 21:25:28 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @LisaMoraitis1 Trump lies, we know that.  Why did a respected man like Bob Woodward hold  onto  vital, life saving audio for 7 months? For a book? One that will be marked down and sitting on a dusty shelf in a year?  How many 1000's  could have been saved 7 months ago w a national mask mandate?
1304047388009656320 2020-09-10 21:21:39 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @mechteldehuning @robreiner I totally agree!  I wonder if Herman Cain would still be alive if he had heard Trump's audio back in February 2020.  I hold no love or respect for him but Herman Cain was not a stupid man.
1304047009452748803 2020-09-10 21:20:09 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @g1gary Tucker wouldn't do this without Trump's approval.
1304046814983794688 2020-09-10 21:19:23 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @faceratHV Tucker would not be throwing Lady G under the bus without Trump's approval. Let that sink in.  We are about to find out, in a tweetrantrum by Trump, what he holds over @LindseyGrahamSC .
1304046236727750657 2020-09-10 21:17:05 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @mechteldehuning @SoulBlossom_Wen @robreiner I'm very aware.  They are brainwashed. That's a fact, they believe everything he says.  That audio revealed months ago could gave started a nationwide mask mandate. It could have saved 1,000s.   I lost 2 very dear loved ones to Covid-19 in April. To think they couldve been saved
1304045251724795905 2020-09-10 21:13:10 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @Rtreatwilliams Greed.  He had a book to write.   Just like Bolton &amp; Cohen.   Even 7 weeks ago after Bob's last interview, when over 20,000 deaths occurred, he waited to reveal this audio. All for his precious book.   A nationwide mask mandate 7 months ago could have saved tens of thousands
1304044598709415938 2020-09-10 21:10:34 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @waltshaub I despise Trump &amp; his sycophants.  Bob's audio could have prompted a mask mandate 7 months ago and tens of thousands of lives could have been saved. He waited, even 7 weeks after his last interview, for a book.   Let that sink in @waltshaub .
1304043428444073984 2020-09-10 21:05:55 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @mechteldehuning @robreiner Yes, they, too, lack conscience and empathy.  I despise tgem all.  But Bob had an actual audio that could have saved lives back in February.  A nationwide mask mandate could have saved tens of thousands of lives. He evenwaited another 7 weeks after the last interview for his book
1304042792671469568 2020-09-10 21:03:24 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @AngrierWHStaff I despise Trump, that's no secret.  People are ignoring the fact that Bob Woodward held onto a life saving audio for 7 months for a book!   Last interview was July 21, over 20,000 people died since then, but he waited 7 weeks for his book.  A nationwide mandate could have saved.
1304041929571794946 2020-09-10 20:59:58 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @SoulBlossom_Wen @robreiner Thank you.   Bob Woodward is no hero.  He's the same as Bolton and Cohen. Sacrificed lives for a freaking book!
1304041571671834625 2020-09-10 20:58:33 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @oldmanschaller @EmGusk @Fahrenthold I am aware...Trump and his GOP sychophants.  A nationwide mask mandate could have been started 7 months ago. We could have crushed the curve, like NY did, thanks to Cuomo's leadership.    My point is that audio could have saved 10's of thousands of lives.  Sacrificed to a book.
1304040854181548034 2020-09-10 20:55:42 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @WaterDean A freaking book! One that in 5 years will be irrelevant and sitting on shelves in local thrift shops.
1304040635981344768 2020-09-10 20:54:50 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @WaterDean You are upset about the audio, I am too.  However, Bob held onto this audio for 7 months.Tens of thousands of lives could have been saved with a nationwide mask mandate.   Even 7 weeks ago, after his last Trump interview, he waited...over 20,000 died, but  he waited 4 his book.
1304039725993545728 2020-09-10 20:51:13 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @realDonaldTrump Fun fact: You've been in office for almost 4 years and Flint still doesn't have clean water.  You'ce done nothing for Flint.

He could have shared this life saving audio 7 months ago.  Mask mandates would have gone nationwide.  Instead tens of thousands died, including 20,000 since Bob's last interview.
1304038665556025344 2020-09-10 20:47:00 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @ktumulty BOB COULD HAVE REVEALED THIS VITAL, LIFE SAVING AUDIO BACK IN FEBRUARY OR AT LEAST 7 WEEKS AGO AFTER HIS LAST INTERVIEW!  WE LOST OVER 20,000 PEOPLE SINCE JULY 21 FOR BOB'S BOOK!   A NATIONWIDE MASK MANDATE COULD HAVE SAVED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS!
1304038007557820416 2020-09-10 20:44:23 +0800 <Mandari25733571> Yes, Trump lies all the time, we knew that already. Bob Woodward held onto this audio for 7 MONTHS! IF WE HEARD IT BACK IN FEBRUARY WHO KNOWS HOW MANY COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED BY A NATIONWIDE MASK MANDATE!!  He withheld this vital, life saving audio for a BOOK!!
1304037329858965504 2020-09-10 20:41:41 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @EmGusk @Fahrenthold It does not excuse the fact that Bob Woodward held onto a life saving audio for 7 months to write a BOOK!! His last interview was 7 weeks ago and over 20,000 plus people died due to Covid.  If he had shared it earlier, who knows how many could have been saved by mask mandates.
1304036601371275270 2020-09-10 20:38:48 +0800 <Mandari25733571> Bob held onto this life saving audio for 7 months to write a BOOK!   His last interview with Trump was end of July. Over 20,000 have died since then, but it was saved till now to finish his BOOK!!    How many died for a book that will be found in thrift shops in 5 years??
1304035486894350343 2020-09-10 20:34:22 +0800 <Mandari25733571> You resigned! You withheld vital information during an impeachment trial so you could write a freaking BOOK! You could have been a hero, but you are now a zero.  Bob Woodward held onto life saving audio for 7 months for a BOOK too!  Over 20,000 have died since his last interview
1304034806326530049 2020-09-10 20:31:40 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @JSweatervest I hate Trump! Bob Woodward held onto this life saving audio for 7 months to write a BOOK! I lost 2 dear loved ones to Covid-19 in April. To think they could still be here if that audio was revealed in February, instead of September, all for a damn, fucking BOOK!

You did not start to wake up till New Years 2018 and Trump made fun of you and Joe.  You for bleeding thru a face lift.  Tides turned when it was your turn for a tweetantrum about you.

As a novelist, would you have withheld this life saving  audio for 7 months?To write a book?  Bob was done in late July w interviews, he still waited 6 more weeks to reveal it. How many died in that time? Over 20,000
1304031757776363520 2020-09-10 20:19:33 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @WaterDean I plan on following you as soon as I am able. Im at my maximum right now.

He did not reveal it, even at the end of July when he was done interviewing Trump, so he could write his book.  I lost 2 loved ones to Covid-19 in April, for a book!

1304026570735091712 2020-09-10 19:58:56 +0800 <Mandari25733571> @TheRealHoarse Question: Bob had audio on Feb 7, 2020. Tens of thousands have died since then. He finished interviewing Trump late July.  It's September 8th and we just discover this vital, life saving information for yet another Trump book!  Lives sacrificed to a demi god and for what? A book!
1304025480602046465 2020-09-10 19:54:36 +0800 <Mandari25733571> Thousands of lives sacrificed to a  malignant narcissists dereliction of duty. Thousands of lives sacrificed due to another person writing another Trump BOOK!!  Bob Woodward had this info on audio since February 7, 2020. He was done interviewing Trump in July 2020. Its 9/8/2020!
1304023776334696455 2020-09-10 19:47:50 +0800 <Mandari25733571> Eighteen tapes from Feb. 7 thru late July 2020.   Trump's tape of his awareness and lies about the Covid occurred on Feb 7th.    Bob Woodward held on to those tapes for his BOOK!!!  That one tape alone could have saved thousands of lives!   Let that sink in!!
