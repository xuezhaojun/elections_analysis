1341114588205637632 2020-12-22 04:13:29 +0800 <BrandonKitchin> @SupermanVelasco I guess what I mean is a player who rarely took 3's and wasn't expected to handle the ball outside of their post moves. So Giannis is a perfect example of the evolution of what a big man has become lol.
1341107696255250436 2020-12-22 03:46:06 +0800 <BrandonKitchin> @SupermanVelasco A "traditional" PF or Center (which traditional is also subjective) but a back-to-the-basket player, someone whose points come primarily from post play, banging down low, etc.

1331396571813044224 2020-11-25 08:37:33 +0800 <BrandonKitchin> @cameronisthelaw @ReezeSZN What did Rosa Parks say on that bus? I think it was "Nah."
1331303375384678400 2020-11-25 02:27:13 +0800 <BrandonKitchin> Bio says "passionate about politics" but doesn't understand how power in politics works.

1330951773398446081 2020-11-24 03:10:05 +0800 <BrandonKitchin> Absolutely despicable. @TCU this professor's language towards students is 1) beyond ignorant 2) a harmful mockery of real issues affecting them or someone else and is 3) downright hateful. What will you do about it? To do nothing or remaining silent means to accept this behavior.
1330725045849755650 2020-11-23 12:09:09 +0800 <BrandonKitchin> @Frank_thefuture oh yeah bro! I knew it was the 30th reunion, I loved every bit of it! I took some years off since Ashley looked like a teenager in the first pic so I knew it was the back half of the series lol
1330716239669440516 2020-11-23 11:34:09 +0800 <BrandonKitchin> Based on how old Tatyana Ali (Ashley) looks, I'm guessing these photos are 24-25 years apart. Black is so Beautiful!
1330695226315386881 2020-11-23 10:10:39 +0800 <BrandonKitchin> So proud of you brother! Congratulations on finishing the mission! Keep changing the world 🙏🏾

1314029693692252161 2020-10-08 10:27:47 +0800 <BrandonKitchin> Susan Page letting Pence go well over his time and saying "thank you" but not doing the same to Harris is a microaggression

Tased with his hands up and once he started convulsing on the ground, he was "perceived as a threat" and was shot to death.  Tired. #JonathanPrice #BLM
1313171189028716549 2020-10-06 01:36:23 +0800 <BrandonKitchin> @danieeeb exposed the fact that I only type with one finger on my right hand and I haven't recovered since. I used to fly through emails and now I stumble all the time because it's always on my mind :'(

1310053092063354882 2020-09-27 11:06:11 +0800 <BrandonKitchin> If Bron got that continuation on the and-1, there's no reason Murray shouldn't have gotten his in the 4th last game. This officiating is WILD

1308872531022143490 2020-09-24 04:55:03 +0800 <BrandonKitchin> Firing shots in and around apartments matters more than Black lives. 📝
1308864517682728961 2020-09-24 04:23:13 +0800 <BrandonKitchin> Amerikkka does it yet again, unsurprisingly. There is no just system in which Black lives matter and those who swear to protect us are held accountable for wrongdoings.   We still gonna keep saying the shit that needs to be said though. Black Lives Matter. RIP Breonna Taylor 🖤
