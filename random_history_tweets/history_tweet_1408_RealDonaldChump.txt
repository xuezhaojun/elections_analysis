1342279150590066688 2020-12-25 09:21:02 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @SecondLady @800273TALK This is very important as the president felt it was better to have people starve at Christmas than to throw them a bone at the hardest time of year. He has hurt too many people to count anymore. I hope your message helps one of them.
1342278529824608256 2020-12-25 09:18:34 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @SecondLady Tell your husband to stop letting that ass of a boss of his destroy the nation and divide it, He did not win and he is embarrassing your political party on the world stage. Tell him to be a leader and invoke the 25th or impeach so can become a hero not a zero.

1341595363405221894 2020-12-23 12:03:54 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @gkgguy @realDonaldTrump @GOP @senatemajldr In Canada people get 2K. for covid relief a month not a one time check.
1341594796733829121 2020-12-23 12:01:39 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @chipfranklin @CalltoActivism He has a lot of many to pay escorts but can't give the American people their own money when they need it. Go knock on Lindsay's door and ask for food. Maybe they would take things seriously then.
1341594405816266753 2020-12-23 12:00:06 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @KelemenCari @LindseyGrahamSC Trump would never do that he is bsing you to make you think he cares. He knows congress would never let it through. Nancy even said ok let's sign that. Crickets.
1341593885114449920 2020-12-23 11:58:02 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @blueeyedblue_47 @semperdiced @Tildys He knows it. He wants people to think he cares which anyone with half a brain could figure out. They are craven assholes the whole lot of them.
1341593153590083584 2020-12-23 11:55:08 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @SvitlanaKatya @semperdiced Rich arrogance by the filthy rich. Love to see him lose his house and starve.
1341592907921256449 2020-12-23 11:54:09 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @semperdiced Tell him to live on $600. He has never missed a meal in his life.
1341591761085337601 2020-12-23 11:49:36 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> Can you say guilty any louder?
1341575330004234240 2020-12-23 10:44:18 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @LaMachine__ He knows Mitch won't go for it. Why didn't they get at least $1200 that Nancy was fighting for? Trump could say give everyone a million because he knows it doesn't matter he wants to look good.
1341574756483514369 2020-12-23 10:42:01 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> Most people know this only his dumb base believes him.
1341574517475274753 2020-12-23 10:41:04 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @RendarSelin @realDonaldTrump He is saying it because they will never let it happen. HE may as well say 50 grand because it's a lie. Why didn't he tell Mitch to ok the $1200? Because he is a liar.

1341572782774046721 2020-12-23 10:34:11 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @realDonaldTrump It's like he is a 5 year old.

1341516366998749185 2020-12-23 06:50:00 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> These people need a visit from each and every starving AMerican to ask for food.
1341516104074588161 2020-12-23 06:48:58 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @VABVOX Go to these people's houses knock on the door and ask for food.

1341515587915169795 2020-12-23 06:46:54 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @VABVOX They should get a taste of not knowing where their next meal is or having a shelter over their head. Go to their houses knock on the door and ask for food. That may change their minds.
1341514659531112448 2020-12-23 06:43:13 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @TheRickyDavila I would love to see some of these people miss paychecks and have no food. Craven jerks.

1341513204812316672 2020-12-23 06:37:26 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @1Tblair @senatemajldr That is bs. They should all get zero after their term. There are people who NEED that money, not just want it.
1341512863110721537 2020-12-23 06:36:05 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @LindseyGrahamSC SDNY is coming after trump and the gang. I hope you go down too. I remember you saying awful things about trump, what  does he have on you? What did the Russians find out Lindsay? That you are a gay republican?
1341512351636283392 2020-12-23 06:34:03 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @LindseyGrahamSC Let's see what Kushner and trump have been up to first.

1341511915416166400 2020-12-23 06:32:19 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @LindseyGrahamSC So from hearsay?
1341511645021884417 2020-12-23 06:31:14 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @LindseyGrahamSC what about Ivanka Trump  and Kushner? Under your theory you won't mind them being investigated either.

I hope you get arrested you immoral disgusting person. You need to keep your mouth shut and get some counseling, stop the lying bs for Trump. We know about his escapades with Epstein. YOU ARE BOTH SICK.
1341472800268140544 2020-12-23 03:56:53 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @Sabiens I trust Biden a million times more than trump. Trump is trying to steal the election when he didn't even win.

1341465893352534016 2020-12-23 03:29:26 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @Sabiens You do know Donald Trump is a drug addict who has cheated on every wife , his taxes and even cheated playing golf. How is it that you think he won't cheat you? Also  Trump is not religious and has paid for many abortions. You think he is best? What is wrong with you?

1341158599737843712 2020-12-22 07:08:22 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @SaraCarterDC @RepMattGaetz Trump lost. The lies about Dominion and Smartomatic are fables created by conspiracy theorists and right wing fake news. That is why he lost all those cases, it's all bs and nothing more. Trump knows his base is buying what he is selling.
1341157580098293762 2020-12-22 07:04:19 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @EpochTimes @RepMattGaetz Your state election was not clean. Dejoy got rid of 1000's of mail in votes. You are crooks.

I never understood how this could happen. Most of his allies hated him now love him??? kompamat, threats and or money is the only way their minds changed. Complete 180 degree turn.
1341154771911077888 2020-12-22 06:53:09 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @Yecats29_ @Quicktake Trump is the one who has dirt on him. He killed Epstein for Trump or at least let it happen. Barr got out before all the charges going down on Trump and his tax evasion. He knew it would implicate him and didn't want to have to explain away Trump's charges.
1341153334573498368 2020-12-22 06:47:27 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @EdieS @4PawShop After separating America with their lies.

I don't live in America but we know what's going on and the republicans are morons that believe anything that conman Trump says.

It is what's wrong in America, If you get sick you are done unless you are rich.

Nancy wanted at least double the $600 Mitch said no because they are all rich they don't care. Trump has never missed a meal in his entire life with his silver spoon. They set up a shell company and took 900 million tax payers dollars divided equally.

You are being ruled by a grifting conman and have no clue and keep sending him money for his fake fight and lie that he won. Never have a seen people as dumb as they are in the US. Sad they are so easily conned.

1338779695664357376 2020-12-15 17:35:27 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @PalmerReport LMAO you are a tad bit unhinged.
1338779419377168384 2020-12-15 17:34:21 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> lol I would love him to succumb to his burger habit and never hear his name again. You are totally off base with your assessment of me. Once Biden in in the WH I will stop but not until. Things will surface and he will be put away for a long time. Then maybe he will get Epsteined
1338777676593520641 2020-12-15 17:27:26 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @PalmerReport His buddy Flynn is the one who brought it up and wants him to do it. Don't blame me that I am concerned because nothing is too low for this man.
1338777244978696199 2020-12-15 17:25:43 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @PalmerReport DO you blame people? Something goes on each day with this mess of a man. Each day is more shocking than the last. When he said he won I knew he is going to cause chaos. His ego is bruised and he can't deal with it even by suing. He will look for other ways. Desperate ways.
1338776388954812416 2020-12-15 17:22:19 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @PalmerReport Actually I have hated him way before he was running. It was when him and Epstein raped those 2 children that made me hate him.
1338775937228427264 2020-12-15 17:20:31 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @PalmerReport Barr is going to get pardoned by Trump, you just wait and see when he starts the pardons.
1338775535837609996 2020-12-15 17:18:55 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @PalmerReport He wants one so he can call martial law. He isn't going to fight himself he will play golf while it happens.

People are starving and he is golfing, tweeting or filing court cases. It's not what a president should be doing. He works for the people not wasting their money on his ego.

1330256215771918337 2020-11-22 05:06:11 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @SteelerRepublic @JohnJamesMI He is teaching his kids its ok to cheat even if you don't win.

1330255555307376648 2020-11-22 05:03:33 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @JohnJamesMI Is this the legacy you want for your children? Aiding a racist , rapist cheater to steal an election and discount POC votes? That is what you want??? Your poor children.
1330249948428955648 2020-11-22 04:41:17 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> This

1330248825651466242 2020-11-22 04:36:49 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @Dhs64dhs @LeeChatfield He was bought. He has delayed certification.

1330247407632867334 2020-11-22 04:31:11 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @29_welder @B_Helderop @LeeChatfield Where? How come they lost 30 cases of there is so much proof?

1330246693774831621 2020-11-22 04:28:21 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> He can be bought.
1330246605056958466 2020-11-22 04:28:00 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @fourmoreever @B_Helderop @LeeChatfield There has been no fraud. 30 cases filed all no fraud.
1330246336814452737 2020-11-22 04:26:56 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> This is the truth.
1330246177896468480 2020-11-22 04:26:18 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @lolevy6 @LeeChatfield TRUTH. Think of your family and what will be your legacy. Don't do them wrong by helping that fascist stay in office. America will be ruined with another 4 years of the reality star.
1330245617772359685 2020-11-22 04:24:04 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @LeeChatfield There has been no proof of anything. You are stalling the certification to help Trump. Your champagne celebration gave you away.
1330245167476056073 2020-11-22 04:22:17 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @LeeChatfield Your children will not be proud of you when they realize you sold out democracy and got bribed by Trump. I would have hated to have a sell out for a father.
1330244788751360001 2020-11-22 04:20:47 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @onlytruthhere @LeeChatfield Trump lies, steal, cheats, rapes women and that is what you want as a leader? What is wrong with you people? He cheats on his wife he will cheat you no problem. He is a con artist.
1330244328036425731 2020-11-22 04:18:57 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @metaphorsalive @onlytruthhere @LeeChatfield Trump is pulling a coup and goodbye democracy. The man is a con artist. If you are not aware of the con you most likely are the mark.
1330243868642643968 2020-11-22 04:17:07 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @julietfes @onlytruthhere @LeeChatfield BRIBED and sold out America.
1330243447664635905 2020-11-22 04:15:27 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @charliefox_1984 @emilyjanelawler @GOPChairwoman @MIGOPChair @realDonaldTrump @LeeChatfield I don't think Biden wants to concentrate on revenge or charges because he is more focused and getting things working again in the country. That would just distract. Trump knows that and why he is so brazen.
1330242847333904384 2020-11-22 04:13:04 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @uexhausting @busymomsbento @ChidiNwatu @SenMikeShirkey In light of the timing, it is a very suspicious meeting to say the least. The champagne after was the kicker. At $750 a bottle you must be celebrating something. Trump was calm after and that said it all.
1330241821126119427 2020-11-22 04:08:59 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @pimpogluti @ChidiNwatu @SenMikeShirkey Canada here and we are watching and shaking our heads at the disgrace that Trump has bestowed on your country. He will always be a stain on democracy in the history books.

1330240309318586370 2020-11-22 04:02:59 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @Hjoral @SenMikeShirkey It will take away democracy.

1330239474933108736 2020-11-22 03:59:40 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @ranae_lawson @SenMikeShirkey Don't forget the champagne celebration after the meeting.
1330239189800132608 2020-11-22 03:58:32 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @SenMikeShirkey You are selling out America. People don't drink bottles of champagne if they aren't celebrating a win fall. All the world's eyes are on you two. History will never forget. IIs that the legacy you want for your family? The 2 who threw away democracy in America? Do the right thing.

1329926431841812480 2020-11-21 07:15:44 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @senatemajldr Then pass it through NOW. Christmas is coming and all these people are broke homeless or sick because of you. You rich olds criminals don't give a shit about anyone but yourselves.
1329925209193803776 2020-11-21 07:10:53 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> No it's all about Trump. But both these republicans has inside traded so if they broke the law once, they are most likely going to do something again. I heard the woman bought a jet with her state taxes.

1329884250733117440 2020-11-21 04:28:08 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> Yes that or threats. I think threats because everyone seems to be afraid of saying anything to stop him. America is losing their democracy because of an egomaniac insane ex-reality TV celebrity. What's next???? .
1329882506271748096 2020-11-21 04:21:12 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> Stop just standing by Republicans, you are trying to help end democracy. History isn't going to forget the disgusting acts you are committing. I hope they name you one by one so future generations can all see how treasonous you have been in this coup.

1328789628355186688 2020-11-18 03:58:29 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> Both McConnell and Graham should be investigated.

Your party has turned so corrupt it is refreshing to see someone tell the truth for once. Be proud you are serving your country.

1328768024116039680 2020-11-18 02:32:38 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @dawnfrommass35 @maddow It's why Trump said Joe wouldn't win unless he cheated, because he was cheating. Turns out god screwed his plan up.

1328555001464057859 2020-11-17 12:26:10 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> They cheated for sure and it's why Trump thought he was going to win too but did not expect the popular votes to be so high for Joe.

1328548697219612673 2020-11-17 12:01:07 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @yompitts @mmpadellan He always accuses people around him of doing what he is doing wrong. He deflects. He is accusing Joe of cheating because he and his party were. He didn't realize people were catching on to his dirty deeds. Now it's out in the open. They cheated Biden did not.
1328547730667438081 2020-11-17 11:57:16 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @rsguy999 @mmpadellan No doubt that he did. I was shocked to hear he won, same with McConnell. They were cheating and why Trump said Joe would have to be cheating if he won. But justice and good prevailed with the help of god.

I didn't think he had a chance of winning since Jaime had raised so much money and Graham was literally begging for money then gives Trump $500,000 for his legal to fight the results of the election. VERY FISHY.
1328544346577137664 2020-11-17 11:43:50 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> He cheated.
1328544264595247106 2020-11-17 11:43:30 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @dfresh1120 @mmpadellan He cheated and threw out votes and was trying to get others to do it. He needs to step down and be investigated.

1328543072502759425 2020-11-17 11:38:46 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @JustinMatkin @mmpadellan This party needs to end. It's very broken and not the traits Repubblicns usually have. They are supposed to be god loving people and they are not. Even Billy Graham wanted Trump gone.
1328542300759236609 2020-11-17 11:35:42 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @Shenatic14 @mmpadellan I know it's so sad these people are so invested in him. He is a conman and has always been one. Barr, Mitch , Lindsay, Cruz, Jordon. All in on it.
1328540988889915392 2020-11-17 11:30:29 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> I knew something was off. this is why Trump was so sure he was going to win. If worked for those 2

Then I heard he gave Trump 500,000 for his legal fights. Doesn't anyone want to know WTF is going on in the GOP? They are ALL crooks.
1328539394349756416 2020-11-17 11:24:09 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @AmyEGardner Barr will just cover for Lindsay. The whole party is corrupt. These people at the top are faux republicans. The party was never about this kind of stuff. Trump has fired and replaced yes men and it is run like a mob because it is one. Republicans need to eradicate these people.
1328538151724359681 2020-11-17 11:19:13 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @AmyEGardner This family has to hire private security, as these are people in  high places that are corrupt. He was prettty brave to speak out. I hope god protects him and his family.
1328534870465814531 2020-11-17 11:06:10 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @AmyEGardner I don't think he got in, I think he cheated. Mitch McConnell too. Lindsay was begging for money on tv, he looked pathetic. He should be removed from his position for this.

1328388903070429185 2020-11-17 01:26:09 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> What are they going to say ? We are afraid of our psycho president.

1328388388890632193 2020-11-17 01:24:06 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> Exactly.

1324402363335995392 2020-11-06 01:25:04 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> He hid ballots in Miami Dade county. Thousands of them. Trump will give him clemency. They are crooks.

1324370336066924544 2020-11-05 23:17:48 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @realDonaldTrump Get over it! You are a loser. Biden is a better man that you ever will be.

1324368555224166402 2020-11-05 23:10:43 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> I will never even think of him as a president. Just an idiot who held one term in office.
1324368232757698560 2020-11-05 23:09:26 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump This is lie. 4/5 are for Biden because they are counting the mail in votes. Everyone knows that more democrats than republicans vote by mail. Trump is losing fair and square.

He hid a bunch in Miami Dade as well that were mostly dem votes because they were mail in.

1317193787005755392 2020-10-17 04:00:45 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @staytuned20201 @KatiePavlich Read the Mueller report, or does it have too many big words for you?
1317193602322239488 2020-10-17 04:00:01 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @staytuned20201 @realMWilliamson @KatiePavlich Your taxes will rise. They are only lower the first 3 years then they will climb back up. Biden only will raise taxes on people making 400k or more. Trump is always looking for tax breaks for the elite, his rich buddies.
1317192981296812032 2020-10-17 03:57:33 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @staytuned20201 @KatiePavlich Because it didn't happen. The Russians hacked some of Hunter's email and mixed them with fake ones but got caught because of the changes in font size email to email.

He did that so no one can question him about what he has made from giving himself government contracts. The salary is a pittance but let me know who he supposedly donated it to. Most likely no one.
1317191282754605057 2020-10-17 03:50:48 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @realMWilliamson @staytuned20201 @KatiePavlich He is a known con man for many years in New York. He lies all the time. He calls women names, is a racist and would not rent to POC and was taken to court about it. He is not a self made man, he got 100's of millions from daddy.

He does not care about anyone but himself and his family. They stole from their foundation money that was for sick kids. He has raped countless women and won't provide DNA, why not if not guilty?

He is in debt has bankrupted so many times and he is in a position to take money from the American people. Which he will. he already took money to build his wall that he said Mexico would pay. he lied.
1317189141025615872 2020-10-17 03:42:18 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @realMWilliamson @staytuned20201 @KatiePavlich Maybe he brought them a shit on of coke. Who cares? he is not running. What about Don Jrs coke problem and drinking arrests? Do they matter? What about Ivanka's voting machine and 20 other patents from China? Do they matter?

Maria and Katie. That fact you do support a child molester says a lot about you. Maybe that's acceptable to you but not me.

It's like bringing up Ivanka and her voting machines and Jr and his coke problem and drunken arrests. They aren't running so leave them alone.
1317183286645420033 2020-10-17 03:19:02 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @realMWilliamson @staytuned20201 @KatiePavlich It has already come out. Rudy is a sucker and fed the crap to Trump, who ran with it.
1317182489463455744 2020-10-17 03:15:52 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @missmeelie1 @KatiePavlich Where's your healthcare plan that he lied was coming out in 2 weeks 2 years ago? It is still not out 4 years in.
1317182174517293056 2020-10-17 03:14:37 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @BsmartinBradley @Phild2400 @seanhannity How's that healthcare plan from day 1  going? Oh yeah he has none. 4 years and no plan whatsoever. In court to do away with Obamacare. so how long are people going without any healthcare?

I know it's long and probably will have words you don't know but you will understand what is going on. Barr should have never said there was nothing to cover for his buddy. Once Trump loses he will flee the country.
1317179682735804417 2020-10-17 03:04:43 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @realDonaldTrump You lied throughout the Town Hall and didn't answer anything.

It always goes back to Russia. They played with senile Rudy to spread bs.. I told you so, Rudy is such a knob. Also no Obamagate or Unmasking LMAO you got conned by Don.
1316967812230008832 2020-10-16 13:02:49 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @Offendeddude @KatiePavlich If Barr had this it would have been used long ago. The investigation he did found nothing. more Russian misinformation to the Putin Puppet and his gang, they are morons.

Someone hacked into Hunters computer most likely Russia and threw some real and fake emails together, The is the font size keep changing from email to email making them forgeries.They have been feeding Rudy bs, and now got caught
1316965070178570240 2020-10-16 12:51:55 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @missmeelie1 @KatiePavlich He is never right. He is a blow hard.

1316961759333355520 2020-10-16 12:38:46 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @rmwaddelljr @KatiePavlich It's invasion of privacy if it's real. I think the Russians had a good laugh at Rudy and Trump for the crap they have been feeding Senile Rudy.

I am in the courts to cancel that bad Obamacare so 20 million will be out of any plan until we work on getting a plan. Give me 4 years

Your intelligence has let you know several times. So you are very aware of it but are doing nothing because they are helping you. Cheater.

1316617114078175232 2020-10-15 13:49:16 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @OwenGregorian @jacobkschneider Can anyone not in the mainstream tell me why Trump won't submit DNA, Tax returns or school grades? Also why did he keep covid facts from the country when we could have been wearing masks He said he is the most transparent but appears not to be at all.
1316616217398894597 2020-10-15 13:45:42 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @travis204s @jacobkschneider I would vote for a shoe over Trump it would be more useful and lie less.
1316616028940431360 2020-10-15 13:44:57 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @Senator_Simon @jacobkschneider @JoeBiden I would literally vote for a shoe than vote for Trump a shoe is more useful.
1316615705966436352 2020-10-15 13:43:40 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @travis204s @jacobkschneider who cares? anyone is better than the biggest liar in the world.
1316615430039982085 2020-10-15 13:42:34 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @Senator_Simon @jacobkschneider @JoeBiden There is a pandemic going on if you didn't notice.
1316615123016900609 2020-10-15 13:41:21 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @theangiestanton @mariLuciano11 Why not spread it to everyone only 6 million have to die to get heard immunity.
1316614592852758538 2020-10-15 13:39:15 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @IAmMonique16 @mariLuciano11 Trump would not rent to POC and was taken to court for it. You seem to like the repression of black Americans if Trump is your guy.
1316613954576281600 2020-10-15 13:36:42 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @scottdmedlock @MZHemingway Awesome
1316613671926206464 2020-10-15 13:35:35 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @MoSoxFan @MZHemingway Well they controlled our election in 2016 you are just concerned about it now?
1316612846831063040 2020-10-15 13:32:18 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @guru_scout @MZHemingway look at the polls he won't win
1316611055066378241 2020-10-15 13:25:11 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @JediCounselor @atrupar Yes promise that he won't come back.
1316610675930587136 2020-10-15 13:23:41 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @Anonymo52211909 @ThePlumLineGS Barr did and found nothing, but Rudy has another plan.
1316610332115124224 2020-10-15 13:22:19 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @MrsFalconn @ThePlumLineGS Don Jr was a heavy drinker and cokehead when he was bartending in Colorado but don't tell anyone because we don't want to distract from Hunter.
1316609513525370886 2020-10-15 13:19:04 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @atrupar @JuddApatow They are saying Promise??
1316607917903110145 2020-10-15 13:12:43 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @BrianGoodlife @ChrisMegerian @JoeBiden I am so glad my republican colleagues always cover and lie for me. my family has made lots of money being in  office and we want to make more. Don't let Biden at money that could be mine
1316607316586713088 2020-10-15 13:10:20 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @BradBrownell4 @ChrisMegerian Joe is the only decent man in this race.
1316604584417128448 2020-10-15 12:59:28 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> Yay! Lies. lies and more lies.  This is in my wheelhouse. I can lie I do it all the time and I am the best at it too.
1316604104798400512 2020-10-15 12:57:34 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @realDonaldTrump Vote Trump and I will do my best to use the treasury as my own wallet then move the gold from Fort Knox to a much safer place but you can keep your guns. Joe will allow guns but I lie to say he will take them away for votes.
1316597284277108736 2020-10-15 12:30:28 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @realDonaldTrump I can't tell them that really Russia will win if I win, they don't need to know it. The less they know the better.
1316596973676367875 2020-10-15 12:29:14 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @realDonaldTrump @CoryBooker I am the only president who has got away with so many lies that's how good I am. Wait until you see my healthcare plan in 4 years, you will be so happy when you finally see it.
1316596338608332805 2020-10-15 12:26:42 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @TheRickWilson It's pretty astonishing, isn't it. Biden is too classy to involve Trump's charity stealing grifter family.
1316595804329529345 2020-10-15 12:24:35 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @EvanAKilgore That sounds good tell everyone that lie, I like it.
1316595083836186624 2020-10-15 12:21:43 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @realDonaldTrump Cheat as much as you can or I am going to jail. We got Ivanka's voting machines, DeJoy taking away ballot and mail boxes. The fake ones we planted in SoCal And Rudy with the fake emails. What else can we do?
1316594190550147072 2020-10-15 12:18:10 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @kayleighmcenany @nypost @JoeBiden I love that Hunter just handed over his computer and never picked it up. The chances are pretty unbelievably because all the sensitive information on it. What luck. You would almost not believe it, if it didn't come straight from Rudy. He knows all the computer fixers in Scranton
1316592651764858880 2020-10-15 12:12:03 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> I have a great team spinning away to make these stories. They should get Pulitzer prizes for the stuff they come up with. This is way worse that colluding with the Russians because it's the dems.
1316590443849674753 2020-10-15 12:03:17 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @seanhannity Damn twitter I hate when they take off my lies. It hurts my numbers.
1316589896769826816 2020-10-15 12:01:07 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @seanhannity I can't wait for Hunter to lose the election. It's like he isn't even running..........oh yeah he isn't. Well that doesn't matter let's taint the whole family.
1316589406522798082 2020-10-15 11:59:10 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @seanhannity I am so glad he took his computer to be fixed and didn't want it back with all this sensitive material. We must have a horseshoe hidden somewhere. Just a coincidence just before the election. Imagine my luck that he didn't ever pick it up again and for it to land in Rudy's hands
1316588350313177088 2020-10-15 11:54:58 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @seanhannity So what can we do tonight Seam to mislead my base? If this one doesn't work what's next? We only have a few more things left before the election. Should we say Biden is a lizard person? That might fly.
1316587831561605120 2020-10-15 11:52:54 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> Just wait and see what we got planned. If you don't believe this crap then I'm screwed. So we got everyone in on the call to lie. Fingers crossed. Thank you for loyalty not to mention they would lose their jobs if they didn't go along.
1316587265867436033 2020-10-15 11:50:39 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @seanhannity I got caught because Rudy forgot to change the font size and they found out it was a fake. it could have worked had we a better story how we got it. I hate when no one believes me. they should believe everything I say I am president.
1316586557164249088 2020-10-15 11:47:50 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @seanhannity I like court packing ask Mitch what he did for us.

1316584288444243968 2020-10-15 11:38:49 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> Why do we need ventilators for a mild flu? They are trying to make me look bad with the truth.
1316583638528454657 2020-10-15 11:36:15 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> Don't watch they will brainwash you with the truth.

1316577857154420738 2020-10-15 11:13:16 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @MrAndyNgo @realDonaldTrump Keep lying for me. If you repeat it 3 times my base will believe it.
1316577430677594118 2020-10-15 11:11:34 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> Don't believe the Denver Police because they will just lie for no reason.
1316577118831038465 2020-10-15 11:10:20 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @McguireScotty @realDonaldTrump It's sad he hit the guy then maced him. Had he not he would still be alive today. You can not predicts someone's actions after you assault them.
1316576464133738496 2020-10-15 11:07:44 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @realDonaldTrump They won't just take your guns but your forks, knives and even spoons. They will take it all and you will live in a empty bare house. They may even do away with McDonalds, the are awful sick people.
1316575431923908608 2020-10-15 11:03:38 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @realDonaldTrump When I say fight hard, I mean cheat.
1316571969802833920 2020-10-15 10:49:52 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @unleashthetea @realDonaldTrump I know if the dems win they cheated because I have cheated so much they would have had to.
1316571684606889991 2020-10-15 10:48:44 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @ChafedCharlie @realDonaldTrump Hey not fair the virus was a deep state hoax
1316571519565217792 2020-10-15 10:48:05 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @No1alpha @donwinslow @realDonaldTrump I handled covid like a rock star. I just pretended it never existed. Just ignore it and it will go away.
1316571088273375232 2020-10-15 10:46:22 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @scientificrealm @realDonaldTrump Hey I am not a doctor but I play one in real life.
1316568902655074306 2020-10-15 10:37:41 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @PatrickNova6 @realDonaldTrump Not fair I choked, I have never been a president before. Cut me some slack only 6 million will die to get my herd mentality.

1316565560239382529 2020-10-15 10:24:24 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @Vicki45424407 @seanhannity Hey that's my line.

1316564836675842048 2020-10-15 10:21:32 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @Serendipity7845 @seanhannity Hey if I didn't owe him 421 million then I could say something bad about him but I can't until it's paid which I hope to do after elected, I will just take it from the stimulus package that I said should be higher. I will pay back my buddy,
1316564133030973440 2020-10-15 10:18:44 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @Godalwaysfirst1 @seanhannity Look Bill is doing his best to find something before the election. anything to distract people away from knowing about the voting machines Ivanka has counting the votes.
1316563655744393216 2020-10-15 10:16:50 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @WowJustWowJust1 @seanhannity @IvankaTrump Ivanka don't tell them about the voting machines and coffins. Remember it's not how many votes you get ,it's who is counting them.
1316563202595930112 2020-10-15 10:15:02 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @RichMize130 @seanhannity If I deny things 3 times my base will believe me instead of their own eyes. I have that effect on people. I pretend to not know everyone that way they can't link me to them. I saw it work on Columbo one episode.
1316562597013938179 2020-10-15 10:12:38 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @I_Write_Or_Die @seanhannity My partner in crime................literally.
1316562413517377536 2020-10-15 10:11:54 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @harleykid59 @seanhannity And?
1316562304687775744 2020-10-15 10:11:28 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> Can we just please pretend it was my kids winning and Hunter losing. I need a big distraction to take attention off my sticky fingered children.
1316561757498822657 2020-10-15 10:09:18 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @DavidSp19613259 @seanhannity I am so glad my base is stupid enough to believe this without them and Barr I may have to go to the big house instead of the White House. Keep saying deep state and far left and please try to scare people with violence if I am not elected.
1316560802472554500 2020-10-15 10:05:30 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> Hey it might be working. I just need to keep deflecting until election because if enough people believe me, I can stay out of jail.
1316560063281033218 2020-10-15 10:02:34 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @RMyria @seanhannity We are going to try this Hunter one first, if it doesn't work we will have to try the fake Hilary email server.
1316559478066569216 2020-10-15 10:00:14 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> If we repeat it at least 3 times it becomes true.
1316559225313656833 2020-10-15 09:59:14 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> Well we have to get me elected again so we will try everything.
1316558786329366528 2020-10-15 09:57:29 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @collis_tate @seanhannity I know it a huge fake news story and no one is picking it up. I guess I will have to call in to Hannity to keep talking about it or it will die.
1316558346535624705 2020-10-15 09:55:44 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> We needed to come up with someway to pretend we got it from Hunter's computer. They guy was a Trump fan and did it for only 10K.
1316557860159983617 2020-10-15 09:53:48 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @ben_tweet @seanhannity I know but we couldn't find anything on Joe, too much of a goody goody. SO I have to keep talking about Hunter finders crossed no one looks into Don Jr. past when he was a bartender in Colorado.
1316553156965273601 2020-10-15 09:35:07 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @MalCav1987 @seanhannity Just wait Rudy still has some tricks up his sleeve. We have to win because they can't charge a sitting president. IT'S NOT HOW MANY VOTES YOU GET IT'S WHO IS COUNTING THEM
1316552392234528768 2020-10-15 09:32:05 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @AlTheBoss03 @seanhannity @nypost Just keep saying Hunter Hunter Hunter, If you say it 3 times people will believe it. We can't have Hunter beat me in November.
1316551963832545281 2020-10-15 09:30:23 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @TGalore2 @seanhannity Please believe it. I need to play the victim or people won't vote for me. You all know I could never win against him.

1316550772494987265 2020-10-15 09:25:39 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> Shhhh! please keep it down until I get elected again.
1316549929569902595 2020-10-15 09:22:18 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @Happy4U26280559 @seanhannity Rudy is so helpful to me. Thank god the the Russian hackers  are so good at forging emails. I hope they don't ask why he didn't give the email before or during the investigation.
1316548800383574019 2020-10-15 09:17:48 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @Phild2400 @seanhannity It's ok I am just in office until I can pay back Putin.

1316548065646395392 2020-10-15 09:14:53 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @Bookgurl6 @seanhannity Grasping at straws because I am desperate.
1316547068937207808 2020-10-15 09:10:56 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @Dallet__ @thebr0keb0i @realDonaldTrump He was killed by me and my good buddy Bill Barr. We couldn't have him talking about what we used to do together. I have to be nice to Giselle so she doesn't rat me out. She knows she could get Epsteined so I doubt she will  say anything.
1316541953274572801 2020-10-15 08:50:36 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @SexCounseling @realDonaldTrump It's fake, like all the other stories that I make up. I need to distract people. I got a great Russian guy to doctor them. I thought he did s goof job but then the pixilation of the MK didn't jive with the font size, so we got caught.

1316499587159355393 2020-10-15 06:02:15 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @LisaHagan7 I got Rudy to forge some emails for me but I think he screwed them up. I like Rudy but sometimes he screws things up. I will just deny knowing anything.
1316495767524139011 2020-10-15 05:47:04 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @NotJohnPrager @Kilroy_Wuz_Hurr @LisaHagan7 They never talk about Don Jr so I hope they never find out about his alcoholism &amp; drug use. I paid to bury those stories already.
1316495131281813505 2020-10-15 05:44:33 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @JustinTymACGIII @Kilroy_Wuz_Hurr @LisaHagan7 Donny Jr used drugs so thank god no one had brought that up. We need to focus on Hunter to distract what my family is doing.
1316492319697240064 2020-10-15 05:33:22 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> I can't admit I am wrong so we will go with the herd mentality.
1316491704074072064 2020-10-15 05:30:56 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @SchreiberEvan @betsy_klein @CDCDirector What does he say about my super spreaders? Nothing you know why? I have him in my pocket if he is not loyal he is fired like the others. It's you people and your small gatherings spreading it.
1316490833323941888 2020-10-15 05:27:28 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @null_laura @KerrieLJ1 @ProjectLincoln Laura they are finding our marbles and keeping them. Pretty soon they will have all our marbles and won't give them back. I will Quid Pro Quo by not paying stimulus checks untilled they are returned.
1316489294341521409 2020-10-15 05:21:21 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @ChidiNwatu @ProjectLincoln I hype them up and get them scared and defensive. Hitler used it why can't I ? He had some good ideas.
1316488660129259520 2020-10-15 05:18:50 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> Totally conned supporter, I make the think the corona virus is a hoax so they won't believe anything anyone else says. They don't know I never had it to begin with. Had a cold and we got the idea after my debate with Joe.
1316487910049280000 2020-10-15 05:15:51 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @TheRickWilson Wow how can people believe the bullshit I spew. O hope they don't find out what I  did at my foundation, I got Eric to plead the 5th. Thank you our for fathers for creating the 5th. My family and I use it often for cover ups.
1316486806448160768 2020-10-15 05:11:28 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @realDonaldTrump America is a disaster since you got in office. You are a game show host not a president. The mess you made in America has the whole world praying the Biden get into office and you go and become bankrupt somewhere else.
1316485933164752896 2020-10-15 05:08:00 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @realDonaldTrump Vote Biden not the corrupt lying desperate jerk in office now. Then get rid of Graham, Barr and McConnell to start.
1316327906948247553 2020-10-14 18:40:03 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @RealDonalDrumpf It reminds me of Studio 54 And no I did not not take any drugs, that wasn't me. Some guy used to copy my look because I would get all the beautiful women. Copied my hair , clothes even my dancing looked identical but it wasn't me.
1316326880396468226 2020-10-14 18:35:59 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @MichelletypoQ It is to fake a new better healthcare plan so can get re-elected then after that it doesn't matter because I won't have to campaign again. I will still do rallies because I love how people adore me to the likes that no one has seen before.
1316325609174298627 2020-10-14 18:30:56 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> If anyone says anything about me or my family Bill promised me he would bully them and best part we don't have to pay. you get to. Bill will make some threats and she will be afraid and back off. It's great.
1316324343060684802 2020-10-14 18:25:54 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> I needed a distraction from what I was doing. I was hoping Bill would have got creative. He is loyal and let let everyone I like out of jail. Every crook needs a Bill.
1316323758261460992 2020-10-14 18:23:34 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> Just don't believe anyone if they say I don't know the bible, I have seen one in every hotel I have stayed in.

1316321305885515776 2020-10-14 18:13:50 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @TeamTrump Great to see you all !! Don't watch any movies or clips on me because we had to make up some of out own, using stock photos from Russia I got a great tech guy there. I made Fauci look like I was doing more than anyone could with a little edit magic. He is a bit mad. Get over it.
1316320038748471296 2020-10-14 18:08:47 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @realDonaldTrump They are going to take your knives and forks as well. You won't even be able to have cutlery in your home. I even heard they may sew your mouths shut, but don't panic we have it totally under control. I promise not to triple your taxes ever, except when my loans are due to Russia
1316316106328477696 2020-10-14 17:53:10 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @freep I just pretend I am religious so I can keep my base, If they know I have no clue what's in the bible it could be bad for me, very bad. I try to avoid any questions of my knowledge of it by changing the topic fast. A few times I almost got caught.
1316315130464890881 2020-10-14 17:49:17 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @willfulbindnes1 @ericgarland @TheRickWilson @neilvogel yeah I used this to distract from the other things I was doing. I know no one spied on me but I got to make Obama , and Hilary bad. It almost worked but they wasn't anything we could pin the them. I begged Barr to come up with a charge. We will see.
1316313447894667264 2020-10-14 17:42:36 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @OhJoSo @TheRickWilson @MarionBurr5 @WendiAarons But I need her to help  me get away with things. Don't take her away. I need as many people as I can to cover for me. I have some big loans dues soon. I am announcing we are putting the gold from Fort Knox in my safe so it will be well looked after.
1316312736712671232 2020-10-14 17:39:46 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> I put all my friends into powerful positions with no experience because they are loyal and won't rat on me. If they do they may have an accident or Barr with help me bully them. I will fire anyone who dares to question my word.
1316312033453772800 2020-10-14 17:36:59 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> @TheRickWilson Barr will find something we can use. Lock them up!! Ooppps maybe it's just me that needs locking up. My lies are starting to cave in, People have caught on about DeJoy and I limiting ballot boxes in blue areas. Also the fake ones we put out as well. I hate getting caught.
1316311007782817793 2020-10-14 17:32:54 +0800 <RealDonaldChump> This how I danced at the party my buddy Jeffrey Epstein and I had that party full of models and just us. great night, that Jeffrey is a terrific guy!
