I just wanted to bring you back to reality that #Qturds had nothing to do with this, since you posted a #Qturd slogan.  Trump participated in a human trafficking ring, with his buddy epstein.

1321099823349727233 2020-10-27 22:41:57 +0800 <jdls333> @NikkiHaley Nikki, Trump says dumb shit that he can't back up. When he is questioned, he lies about it. Thats why it seems like the press is out to get him. You just cant help but stick up for an incompetent politician that happens to fight for the same thing as you. You have zero integrity

1316586661216751616 2020-10-15 11:48:15 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks Lol, sure jan
1316586598386065409 2020-10-15 11:48:00 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks Wait are you saying the right doesn't use tactics to scare people into their ideology?  Do you live under a rock?
1316586111360262145 2020-10-15 11:46:04 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks So you are saying they will amend the constitution? You realize how difficult it is to do? Their policies will be set by the legislative process. Stop getting your panties in a bunch.
1316585686800183299 2020-10-15 11:44:23 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks Man you are triggered.  Can you show me one time I called you a racist? Because this whole convo is you playing victim.
1316585365164175362 2020-10-15 11:43:06 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks No one cares.
1316584981922230272 2020-10-15 11:41:35 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks And? I don't follow her here. I'm not white knighting for her like you are for your cult leader.
1316584810903678976 2020-10-15 11:40:54 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks Wow, super original.
1316584662882545669 2020-10-15 11:40:19 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks So not "scrap the constitution", just legislate according to the constitution. Do you always step on your own dick?
1316583954997219328 2020-10-15 11:37:30 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks Lol, that's hilarious.  He can't read.
1316583881768947713 2020-10-15 11:37:13 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks So no quotes that they want to "scrap the constitution ", huh?
1316583000847650816 2020-10-15 11:33:42 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks Quote just one of those people you listed saying they want to rewrite the constitution.   And no, no he hasn't.
1316581669747466240 2020-10-15 11:28:25 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks No, no they don't. And you won't find one democrat that has said anything close to that.  DONALD. TRUMP. HAS. NEVER. READ. THE. CONSTITUTION.
1316580771608567813 2020-10-15 11:24:51 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks Again, your cult leader hasn't read and doesn't know whatvisbin the constitution. Scrap the constitution and start anew? Republicans want Christian sharia.

1316463177153077249 2020-10-15 03:37:34 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks Why do want to lick trumps balls so hard?  See, its easy to ask dumb fucking questions.
1316462941399592962 2020-10-15 03:36:38 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks Ask the board of Burisma. Why would you want my answer? I'm not changing your mind
1316462561760628737 2020-10-15 03:35:08 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks If Hunter was doing anything illegal, I hope he is prosecuted. Can you say the same for the Grifty Bunch?
1316462357594419205 2020-10-15 03:34:19 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks BTW, where was Hunters office in the white house?  Oh thats right, only Grifter Barbie gets an office in daddys admin.
1316461849697832966 2020-10-15 03:32:18 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks Uhhh because it was the second tweet
1316461686191198213 2020-10-15 03:31:39 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks No, they are exactly what I thought they would be.....grifters
1316461537872273408 2020-10-15 03:31:03 +0800 <jdls333> @BaldHeadMan2 @RepJimBanks Good argument
1316461011680088065 2020-10-15 03:28:58 +0800 <jdls333> @RepJimBanks @BaldHeadMan2 A pretty good example of what that might look like would be Don, Jr., Ivanka, Jared and Eric.

1316398831182000128 2020-10-14 23:21:53 +0800 <jdls333> @Euro22 @loosebricks @thehill Dude, a quid pro quo was actually asked for, by our president. The media was reporting it. Sorry you didn't like what they had to say about tour dear leader.. I dont give a shit what Real Clear Politics or Jim Jordan have to say.
1316388682799218690 2020-10-14 22:41:33 +0800 <jdls333> @Euro22 @loosebricks @thehill So the Russians turned themselves in?
1316387715437428736 2020-10-14 22:37:43 +0800 <jdls333> @Euro22 @loosebricks @thehill So the news reporting the news is your "big" story?! Dude, just stop. You're just looking pathetic now.
1316386164308353024 2020-10-14 22:31:33 +0800 <jdls333> @Euro22 @loosebricks @thehill Lol "temporarily"  That really is all you got from the Senate Intelligence Committee report?!
1316381670648557568 2020-10-14 22:13:42 +0800 <jdls333> @Euro22 @loosebricks @thehill So you didn't read or comment on the Senate Intelligence Committee report, because it doesn't fit your narrative. You can send me links all you want. Real Clear Politics? Lol  Trump and his admin has so many links to Russians, the arrests and convictions are real.
1316371205109186561 2020-10-14 21:32:06 +0800 <jdls333> @Euro22 @loosebricks @thehill Here is the link to the Republican lead Senate Intelligence Committee report. The only one that matters. The Judiciary committee shouldn't be concerned with intelligence matters.   https://t.co/VwccshdRDd

1316366913908416512 2020-10-14 21:15:03 +0800 <jdls333> @Euro22 @loosebricks @thehill No, because Bill Barr doesn't give a shit about actual justice. He is just another one of Trump's Lackeys.  The New York Post is a terrible source.
1316356726598361090 2020-10-14 20:34:35 +0800 <jdls333> @Euro22 @loosebricks @thehill John Solomon was in on the smear campaign to cover up Trumps Ukraine quid pro quo   https://t.co/NuN8m6WYx2

1316338920863526912 2020-10-14 19:23:49 +0800 <jdls333> @Euro22 @loosebricks @thehill So what you are saying is the report won't be released but you know "it goes to the top - of the Obama administration"?
1316318110769651714 2020-10-14 18:01:08 +0800 <jdls333> @BJebrasky @MaryWills612 @thehill Its in the first paragraph, my dude  https://t.co/IFWCN9zOQd

1316315392000905216 2020-10-14 17:50:20 +0800 <jdls333> @BJebrasky @MaryWills612 @thehill They didn't release the report, because nothing is going to happen the Trumplethinskin's enemies like he wanted. You think Barr would hold onto a report that criminally implicates Obama administration officials?

1314553532801056768 2020-10-09 21:09:20 +0800 <jdls333> @Nick34886394 @thehill This is the same problem with health insurance. The government ends up footing the bill for those that decided they don't want to protect themselves. What would happen to the number of homeless people if you had a choice?
1314552662034182146 2020-10-09 21:05:52 +0800 <jdls333> @Nick34886394 @thehill I didn't want Bernie. Hell, I didn't even want Biden. But we are stuck with 2 parties and trump is a dumbfuck.  Its hilarious you think this is some sort of insult.
1314552252326084608 2020-10-09 21:04:14 +0800 <jdls333> @Nick34886394 @thehill Can I admit our government isn't perfect? Yes.  Can I admit capitalism isn't perfect? Yes.  Thats why we have a mixed economy.   What do you think would have happened to seniors around 2008? Would they just have to fend for themselves because their ret. investments were gutted?
1314550534704168960 2020-10-09 20:57:25 +0800 <jdls333> @Nick34886394 @thehill Nick, this is pretty standard stuff if you don't get your info from 4chan.  The US has a mixed economy. But you know that, you just aren't serious. Im laughing at the fact you are trying, unsuccessfully, to say the US has no socialist programs.
1314549681972817920 2020-10-09 20:54:01 +0800 <jdls333> @Nick34886394 @thehill But you agree its socialist, correct?   The EPA protects the people, paid for by the people. Pretty simple.
1314549339948277761 2020-10-09 20:52:40 +0800 <jdls333> @Nick34886394 @thehill Wait, you think I'm uneducated on the matter, but you want me to explain it to you? Again, you aren't serious. Furthermore, i don't owe you shit. BTW, I thought you didn't have the time?
1314548884618780672 2020-10-09 20:50:51 +0800 <jdls333> @Nick34886394 @thehill Social Security is a socialist program. You're just not good at this.
1314548652422164480 2020-10-09 20:49:56 +0800 <jdls333> @Nick34886394 @thehill Nick, be honest. Your question isn't even serious and asked in bad faith. Google is free, find out for yourself why communism (not socialism) is bad.
1314547369908858881 2020-10-09 20:44:50 +0800 <jdls333> @Nick34886394 @thehill The only one who mentioned communism is you. The tour is about socialism. The right doesn't understand the difference. So here you go so you can be educated.  https://t.co/aADJ4yoEmq

1313804117383565312 2020-10-07 19:31:25 +0800 <jdls333> @webmaster_tx @AslanL18 @BunnysMomm @Reuters @JarrettRenshaw @JTanfani Polls are not the same as ballot drop boxes. Sorry, but words matter.
1313802686639280129 2020-10-07 19:25:44 +0800 <jdls333> @webmaster_tx @AslanL18 @BunnysMomm @Reuters @JarrettRenshaw @JTanfani The only thing trumps 'army' can legally do at a ballot drop box is take pictures or video.
1313801234864799744 2020-10-07 19:19:58 +0800 <jdls333> @webmaster_tx @AslanL18 @BunnysMomm @Reuters @JarrettRenshaw @JTanfani That applies to ballot drop boxes. Again, trumps 'army' can not enter polling places on election day to watch people vote.
1313796463969869825 2020-10-07 19:01:00 +0800 <jdls333> @webmaster_tx @AslanL18 @BunnysMomm @Reuters @JarrettRenshaw @JTanfani Lol, cite your source.  The rules vary by state, but one poll watcher per party or one poll watcher agreed upon by both parties per voting place is all that is allowed. You can't just walk into a polling place and say 'I'm here to make sure people are voting for Trump'. Pathetic.
1313794816006860800 2020-10-07 18:54:27 +0800 <jdls333> @ClarkHutchinso2 @Reuters @PaulieD55 @JarrettRenshaw @JTanfani I would love for one of you mouth breathing trumpdicks to try and 'watch' me while I vote. Your teeth will be meeting my boot. It tastes like steel and leather.
1313792476088602624 2020-10-07 18:45:10 +0800 <jdls333> @AslanL18 @BunnysMomm @Reuters @JarrettRenshaw @JTanfani Yeah, and they are approved by the election board and can't speak to actual voters. Your fascist tactics won't help Trump win. There is nothing you need to watch at the polls.

1311623946077433857 2020-10-01 19:08:12 +0800 <jdls333> @gbrockell @washingtonpost Do they then spread the pictures all over social media? For those that want this done, to each their own. But this isn't that common, sorry.

1310949414077444099 2020-09-29 22:27:51 +0800 <jdls333> @KenNYBUnChained @thehill You don't know if anything illegal is going down. Thats the point.
1310947038318809092 2020-09-29 22:18:24 +0800 <jdls333> @KenNYBUnChained @thehill You don't know what a conflictbof interest is. Sorry you are having a hard time understanding why your leader is corrupt. Im not wasting anymore time explaining to you. You are too far gone.
1310946784131387394 2020-09-29 22:17:24 +0800 <jdls333> @KenNYBUnChained @thehill We are talking about the most powerful position in the world. Stay on topic.
1310944877576941573 2020-09-29 22:09:49 +0800 <jdls333> @KenNYBUnChained @thehill You just don't understand what a conflict of interest really is. Forget about the taxes.  He literally couldn't get a security clearance unless he became president. He is compromised.
1310943769081020419 2020-09-29 22:05:25 +0800 <jdls333> @KenNYBUnChained @thehill Paying your daughter a consulting fee while an employee of the organization and then writing it off on your personal tax is not allowed. The audit hasn't been completed yet. You can't say "nothing illegal here".
1310941476172554243 2020-09-29 21:56:18 +0800 <jdls333> @KenNYBUnChained @thehill You think him personally guaranteeing $421 mil is not a conflict of interest? Who does he owe? Do you think he has a vested interest in keeping interest rates low? He has disparaged his own fed chair because of rate hikes.
1310940650276352000 2020-09-29 21:53:01 +0800 <jdls333> @KenNYBUnChained @thehill And why hasn't he?
1310936857006551042 2020-09-29 21:37:57 +0800 <jdls333> @KenNYBUnChained @thehill I do not care how much tax his businesses paid. We are comparing how much he personally paid to what you and I personally paid in tax.  I think a flat tax would make things a lot simpler. But corporate America will never let it happen.
1310936215051538432 2020-09-29 21:35:24 +0800 <jdls333> @KenNYBUnChained @thehill No it does not. Future taxes doesn't mean he didn't pay $750 in taxes in 2017 &amp; 2018. You have nothing to prove otherwise. Your own "evidence" says the tax liability was wiped out.
1310935895558754306 2020-09-29 21:34:08 +0800 <jdls333> @KenNYBUnChained @thehill Unfair attacks? He has said he pays more taxes than anyone and now there is proof he is lying. It's not unfair, its warranted. Im sorry you fell for the con.
1310935713001746435 2020-09-29 21:33:24 +0800 <jdls333> @KenNYBUnChained @thehill Dude, that doesn't mean he is paying or will pay any tax. The NYT has evidence he paid $750 per year in tax liability.
1310934047066124294 2020-09-29 21:26:47 +0800 <jdls333> @KenNYBUnChained @thehill "...all of that liability was washed away."   Dude, fucking read yourself.
1310932004821757959 2020-09-29 21:18:40 +0800 <jdls333> @KenNYBUnChained @thehill $750 is not $5.2 million. Trump can release his taxes and refute the NYT's reporting.  I'm glad you are outraged that we pay more in taxes than billionaires. At least we can agree on that. But you are at the same time defending a tax dodger.
1310928670488498176 2020-09-29 21:05:25 +0800 <jdls333> @KenNYBUnChained @thehill If you aren't outraged that you paid more tax than the billionaire president, you might be in a cult.
1310927948044697600 2020-09-29 21:02:33 +0800 <jdls333> @DytellS @8GD1 @thehill You paid more tax than the billionaire president. Climb down off your high horse.

His tax returns tell the real story which is why he won't release them.  Also, he has lied to rube nation about how much tax he pays. The sane people knew better.

1304616164191076354 2020-09-12 11:01:46 +0800 <jdls333> @MaryLousTweets @nataliesinger @washingtonpost So what you're saying is the current KKK supported Hillary Clinton and now supports Biden? What about Obama? Did the current KKK support him?  https://t.co/oUWHYmXb6O

He disparaged a gold star family because they are Muslim. He told a gold star widow, "he knew what he signed up for."  Just stop with the God King worship. It's pathetic.
