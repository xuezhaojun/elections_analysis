1340546821664485378 2020-12-20 14:37:23 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @SSFriend88 She absolutely did patriot💯
1340546626776150021 2020-12-20 14:36:36 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> $1200 is half my rent.  Which is still cool. But they act like $1200 is gonna solve everyone’s problems after being locked down for almost a year.
1340546377600933888 2020-12-20 14:35:37 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Although I’m grateful that $1200 will be able to help some families and is better than nothing, $1200 really isn’t Jack when people have lost their jobs and businesses because of these covid lockdowns.   Don’t get me wrong. In principle I hate it when the govt gives out money.

1328007115940761607 2020-11-16 00:09:04 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> I see thousands of images and video of police officers standing by while trump supports are getting attacked and jumping in to help BLM and Antifa   Tell me this isn’t true   If it is true, they are chicken shit coward scum too. I hate say that because I back the blue but wth !
1328006579426365441 2020-11-16 00:06:56 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> These police officers are cowards!   They are scared to lose their jobs to do what’s right. Plain and simple   Real men do what right even when told to do what’s wrong.   There’s a higher law than man’s law and that comes from the big boss in the sky   #GodsWord #police
1328005085331402757 2020-11-16 00:01:00 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Absolutely correct!  BLM  and antifa are constructs of the Democrats specifically Hussein Obama.

1328001314878582791 2020-11-15 23:46:01 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Comeon man we know this! Now, what do we do about it?  They aren’t going to report it so the GOP needs to get to work legislation and oversight or you raid all the MSM and arrest everyone and hold them on trial - at least they will cover that on the news 🤪🤣😂🇺🇸

1324948531333959680 2020-11-07 13:35:20 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> The US government should offer 10k for information on fraud and 100k for information on a public official committing voter fraud

1324940258056818688 2020-11-07 13:02:28 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> No every table and counter should be one democrat and one republican.  When a ballot is opened they both look and have to agree.   In addition the should have to wear scrubs issued at the location and have no personal items on them.

1324598064519282688 2020-11-06 14:22:43 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> I’m gonna tell you why they are going all out to win the election at any costs   Trump and Barr uncovered big time corruption.  They got to win to fire Barr and close all the cases.
1324597756204355584 2020-11-06 14:21:29 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> I guarantee you that the Pennsylvania AG was in on it.   Guaranteed.

1324550263017975809 2020-11-06 11:12:46 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Once again I told them last night hire 20 security force your way in and when the cops come have your security show them the court order.   Have 2000 extra ready for each city and if there are issues flood the building with them and neutralize any issues
1324548455591792640 2020-11-06 11:05:35 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Raise your hand if you hate mail in ballots!  RT if you hate it  ❤️ if you love it   #MailInBallots
1324547622670077952 2020-11-06 11:02:16 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Omg.  Ok so they broke the law denying Republican observers. What’s the penalty on that offense?  I guess it’s up to the democratic AG? Maybe you’re not allowed any more lattes for the rest of the week?
1324544206585692160 2020-11-06 10:48:42 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Marches for BLM at night and works the polls and election booths by day   - Loyal Democrat #MAGA
1324543675624529920 2020-11-06 10:46:35 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Ted Cruz is right.  It’s almost impossible to get a re-vote in the states that are found to be violation of election laws and that a have a high number of fraudulent ballots   It’s sad but true.  The best you can hope for is to invalidate the ones you can prove. That’s it

Both have the same hairstyle  4. Both did bad things to the younglings 5. Biden executed order 66 on Election Day.   Cooncindence? #StarWars #2020Election  https://t.co/r4S7LMbvp3

Republicans are generally more law abiding and less apt to protest and cause problems  3. Republicans generally believe in the “system “  The left funds and supports their militant factions like antifa+ blm
1324453270929158145 2020-11-06 04:47:21 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Wow autocorrect made my tweet sound bad. Apologies patriots
1324452020435210246 2020-11-06 04:42:23 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Part (2) 7. If you haven’t paid income taxes in 2 years, you don’t vote unless you are retired or other special cases  8. If your signature or is doesn’t match you are detained without bail  9. People who workout, lift weights , own guns and eat meat are allowed to vote twice
1324450700898799620 2020-11-06 04:37:08 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> If I ran the elections I’d do the following  1. Photo ID 2. Signature match  3. Fingerprint match 4. Military oversees all operations no volunteers or election committees ect  5. Capital punishment for voter fraud  6. 24 hour surveillance of every booth every table everywhere
1324449370163585028 2020-11-06 04:31:51 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @DayDreamin1830 Just a hint for the future.  Any country that can make fake US currency can make ballots with watermarks.   They help but don’t ensure security.

1324377051713994754 2020-11-05 23:44:29 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> This is what the real GOP should do :  Immediately 100k award for evidence of voter or ballot fraud for the following locations.   Whistleblowers would be coming out like crazy
1324376540893925377 2020-11-05 23:42:27 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Short answer.  Yeah homie. Whatcha gonna do about it
1324376162726981634 2020-11-05 23:40:57 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Hiding like little bia bias  They really didn’t even support him during his campaign. I didn’t see a bunch of tweets or tv interviews supporting Donald

1324281983468523521 2020-11-05 17:26:43 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Every GOP watchdog and attorney should have arrive at the voting stations with 20 of these types.   EVERY SINGLE ONE  https://t.co/fiTCjAJi9C
1324280526463660032 2020-11-05 17:20:56 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @SenateGOP @GOP ok let me break it down. You guys need people to do things that you are not accustomed to 👇  Give me a contract - it could be just for 1-2 medium sized cities for a trial run, and I guarantee you there would put be all these issues.
1324279691511910402 2020-11-05 17:17:37 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @kokuraclouds @fleccas Good question....but a better one is which government agency?
1324278307404304386 2020-11-05 17:12:07 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> One way to stop voter fraud :  Capital punishment for anyone caught in voter fraud or voter intimidation.   Investigated not by the DOJ but a rotating committee of US military, Interpol( yes I know), Israelis , and the most aggressive conservative twitter peeps.    Boooooom!
1324275215497601024 2020-11-05 16:59:49 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Once again the Republicans were unprepared.  These gop watchdogs should have hired private firms. Got security details of 20 each w/ 2000 on standby in each city. When that van came up, boom citizens arrest time. You got the evidence and you got em. Sort the legalities out later

1324273143385640960 2020-11-05 16:51:35 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Well...that’s why the dems are smart....they put their agents and people in positions to really affect elections.   Why do you think Clinton and pelosi and kamala had all those please volunteer as a poll person or whatever.
1324272280059420678 2020-11-05 16:48:10 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @fleccas Ok....just look at that atmosphere and tell me it wouldn’t be easy to throw away or destroy ballots lol   We should have the Mexican cartels oversee the elections,  nobody would steal, destroy, or throw away even one ballot. They’d be walking up and down the rows.
1324271399679234053 2020-11-05 16:44:40 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @DC_Draino @liquid_swords17 Super dumb and weak too. They what they think.
1324271217424162823 2020-11-05 16:43:56 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @RealJamesWoods @AmericanDrones See how easy it is. Smh republicans should have stopped this years ago. You’re no5 gonna catch them all, and even if they just a couple thousand through in every county that’s a win
1324269828501286912 2020-11-05 16:38:25 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Republicans are so weak, why do you think they want “ easy voting” and “no ID.   Who in American doesn’t  have ID because without an ID: you aren’t driving, buying alcohol,flying anywhere, getting an apartment or home, buying a car, renting a car, buying a fire arm, ect.........

1324265583286853633 2020-11-05 16:21:33 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @DonaldJTrumpJr Bro....they are still investigating the Biden bus thingy in Texas. All hands are on deck to solve that crime.
1324232121725181954 2020-11-05 14:08:35 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Wouldn’t it have been cool if you had some armed security grab that dude by accident and open up all the suitcases.  Then if they had the cops called on them just say oops we thought they were making threats at the person we were hired to guard. Oooopsie.

1324214600976445440 2020-11-05 12:58:58 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @aricnesbitt @MIGOP Once again the GOP is totally unprepared. I would have sent all the GOP attorneys with 20 armed escorts at least with 2000 on standby in each major city   For a mere 100 million this could easily happen for every major city in America and some smaller ones too   Read up.

1324210665406517250 2020-11-05 12:43:19 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Republicans are so naive.  If I was in charge of screwing up ballots what I would do is after you used your pen or to bubble in your vote and ran it through the machine I’d bubble in the other choice on your ballot so when it got recounted it would be thrown out.   #MAGA
1324207243663986688 2020-11-05 12:29:44 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Then the “volunteer” double checks the signature with tired eyes and says that’s good.  Hands it over to her supervisor who is a democratic activist. Yup that’s good.

1324202177099898881 2020-11-05 12:09:36 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Anybody that “volunteers “ to spend 20 hours counting vote for free is up to something. - generally.
1324167638436761600 2020-11-05 09:52:21 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> The jobs in America where you can be wrong all the time and still keep your job   1. Weatherman  2. Pollster  3. Congressman 4. Journalists   #MAGA2020 #Poll

1324165650105978882 2020-11-05 09:44:27 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Republican senators don’t give a damn about Donald Trump because they get their paychecks and get to be senators regardless of who is president.   They have no loyalty and no incentive. Not a god dang one is on tv disputing the vote counting   Shady mfkers I see you
1324144758596476929 2020-11-05 08:21:26 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @PatriotKimmie @Apocaloptimist2 In my homeland, the army comes in and arrests them all and interrogates them to find out the masterminds and leaders and then those people get arrested and tried for treason   But that’s a communist country. In our con try pretty much nada. Maybe they get a finger wagging
1324144399299891201 2020-11-05 08:20:00 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Hey @SenateGOP you guys gonna have more hearings and stuff 👇
1324144079333167105 2020-11-05 08:18:44 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> If i was the president. I’d fly there and make a citizens arrest.    See but I’m slick. Weeks before the election I would have sent in fake democratic poll workers and volunteers everywhere with hidden cams catching everything
1324142993025150978 2020-11-05 08:14:25 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> I’m tired of this shit.   Republicans need to grow balls man. If I was a senator I’d be crazy.   Those stupid hearings w big tech what did that amount to? Some cool tweets?   No action.  Look there’s a guy throwing away Trump ballots.  Let’s have a hearing on it 😂🤣😂🤣
1324142237056487424 2020-11-05 08:11:25 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Ok why isn’t that mofo arrested. Why isn’t the whitehouse operatives down there with that poll worker. Work him for info on who else is doing it and who’s paying.   Damn Republicans are slow AF
1324141710214156288 2020-11-05 08:09:19 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Republicans are weak AF.  In a dirty anything goes fight their ideals keep them from doing what is needed to win.   They need to develop the asshole wing of the Republican Party. Guys who will do whatever is necessary.   Just my 2 cents.

1324044357356429312 2020-11-05 01:42:29 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Mail in voting is Bull Shit   You can goto the grocery store, pump gas, walk your dog, mow your lawn, pick up your kids, go shopping , drive through for fast food but you need to mail your vote.   Nah.  I don’t like it. Plus this no ID is BS.
1323895079329845248 2020-11-04 15:49:18 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> To elaborate   Me: yo yo yo. Ok you three come here   Them: what’s sup   Me: I got a lil sumptin for ya. I’ll pay you $200 an hour to hand out these sharpies   Them: what’s the catch   Me: nothing but you never saw me got it.
1323894299889729536 2020-11-04 15:46:12 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> For such a sophisticated country we sure do have dummy set ups of the elections.

1319583745263980544 2020-10-23 18:17:36 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @AnnCoulter People should file complaints  against Jill Biden and the DNC medical staff. They should all have their licenses suspended ceded.
1319582531117862913 2020-10-23 18:12:46 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @drbiden complaints should be filed with Delaware division of Professional regulation to have your license suspended for malpractice   Joe has dementia and you know it.   #DonaldJTrump #bidendementia
1319581594030501892 2020-10-23 18:09:03 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> 😂😂😂😂. It pains CNN to prove trump was right #PresidentialDebate2020
1319579983115935745 2020-10-23 18:02:39 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> In order to start an investigation of possible violation of Delaware licensing, registration or certification laws and regulations, you must complete this online form. Submit documents you may have to support your report by emailing them to investigations.dpr@delaware.gov.
1319578101945434113 2020-10-23 17:55:10 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Every democratic medical professional should have their license revoked. In fact, I think you could file complaints on the DNC medical,staff, Biden’s personal medical doctors ect   There is no way that any medical person, could watch this or Biden on stage and not have red flags.

1317637527063461888 2020-10-18 09:24:01 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Hardest working president ever!  #Trump2020Landslide
1317636391082262529 2020-10-18 09:19:30 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Twitters algorithm isn’t so smart, it didn’t consider the ramifications of suppressing the Hunter email stories and suppressing conservative tweets and opinions on a consistent basis.   Now the betas that rule Silicon Valley and tech industries will feel the might of the Right!
1317635446109777920 2020-10-18 09:15:45 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Uh oh.   Finally Congress is considering breaking up big tech as monopolies.    This is ultimately what must happen. Revocation of 230 is not enough. The main stream media currently have no 230 protections and they suppress information and conservative views!

1317527165144125440 2020-10-18 02:05:29 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Republicans have zero follow through. They love hearings then drop the issue.    1.  What is happening w the ilhan Omar voter fraud  2. Kim Gardner tampering w evidence  3. AG Ellison beating two women  4. Why hasn’t Lebron and Bloomberg been arrested for bribery
1317525057317502985 2020-10-18 01:57:06 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @GeraldoRivera @JoeBiden I get what you are doing, you want us to do the work for ya.  Here’s the bottom line   laptop was hunters verified, emails verified, fbi had it for over a year, people need to be arrested. That’s the story
1317524452922576896 2020-10-18 01:54:42 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> It’s a national security issue. You can have your government officials being bribed by foreign interests. Pretty simple.

1317519971447169025 2020-10-18 01:36:54 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> See below 👇
1317519909585342465 2020-10-18 01:36:39 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Twitter is stopping me from retweeting hunter Biden tweets. That’s messed up.
1317519418730139651 2020-10-18 01:34:42 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> 1. Yes because hunters attorney asked for the laptop back  2. Yes a person that was on the email message confirmed that those emails are real  3. We already know that   You are the reporter, you should be on top of these issues. Comeon man.
1317515922438017024 2020-10-18 01:20:48 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 yo cbs there’s a big story you need to cover about hunter Biden and his crime family.   Or how about you investigate the voter fraud by ilhan Omar. Some new evidence just emerged.   Or how about you follow up on Kim Gardner the DA who tampered with evidence in St Louis

1317487164184272896 2020-10-17 23:26:32 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> If hunter Biden’s emails are authenticated then Joe Biden needs to be immediately arrested.
1317485981096939520 2020-10-17 23:21:50 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Man ur a dumbass.  Let’s just start by saying that the trumps had businesses way before Donald ran for president. Their money was made from business and not politics  Second, what hunter did is a risk to national security.  He’s been compromised.

Biased people make biased alogorithms   Ie nerd coder allocates more importance to terms like: IT, free, tofu   But gives less importance to: beef, beer,badass
1317098312789610497 2020-10-16 21:41:22 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Government guidelines for twitter employees   1. Must bench press at least 1.5x you weight, deadlift and squat 2x your weight  2. Males must weigh 230-325lbs w under 12% body fat  3. Must be proficient in fighting, eat red meat, and know something about coding and computer stuff
1317096757986250755 2020-10-16 21:35:12 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> I don’t care about policy changes. They will still do the same shit- shadowban, deboost,suppress   The only way to stop this is to force them to hire a bunch of smart, cool, non nerdy conservatives to oversee everything.   For too long social media has been run by betas
1317095337119653888 2020-10-16 21:29:33 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @GeorgeTakei Donald trump smacked your limp D,feeble, mentally declines candidate in the ratings.

1316900027256705026 2020-10-16 08:33:27 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> How many times does the president have to denounce white supremacy ?  Wtf
1316899828132175873 2020-10-16 08:32:40 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> If trump actually had any MSM who were half honest and a FBI that wasn’t corrupt, he’d be the greatest president of all time   #facts   This was fact checked and proven true by independent fact checkers ✅✅✅✅

1316892883027431425 2020-10-16 08:05:04 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Republicans and conservatives have been sleeping and silent waaaaaay too long while the left has been infiltrating the government, educational system, the legal system via soros sponsored DAs, big tech, pollsters, and media.   Now we must reverse all of this.

1316841923894796290 2020-10-16 04:42:35 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @AjitPaiFCC @FCC Don’t know if we trust you because you might be in the pocket of big tech and are like minded.   How I read that statement is that you have the right to seize all of their assets and appoint a conservetive council to regulate their companies and immediately fire all liberals.
1316839846372143105 2020-10-16 04:34:19 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> You got tested for Covid but how about for STDs?

1316777318162083846 2020-10-16 00:25:51 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Now you see how the Dems and Leftists really treat those they disagree with. That’s not the party of love and unity.   Im glad you experienced it. Now you can speak the truth
1316776932097372162 2020-10-16 00:24:19 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @twitter employees and fact checkers engage in classic confirmation bias.   Yo homies just because cnn and politfact says it’s true makes it true.  There are opposing views and you only look at those that support your personal view.

This is not true but you are presenting it as a fact.  This is very misleading but.

1316739030256693248 2020-10-15 21:53:43 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> There should be an expansion of the affirmative action   Conservatives should be protected under an expanded affirmative action law requiring that conservative views be present in businesses, educational systems, entertainment ect   That would be a game changer
1316738088207515648 2020-10-15 21:49:58 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Nothing is more satisfying the defeating the enemy on their own ground.  That’s when you know they are truly conquered

1316652488460775425 2020-10-15 16:09:50 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> No more talking, we need action and not just hearings. I’m tired of hearings

1316422047115948033 2020-10-15 00:54:08 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> There should be no reporters privilege given all the abuse and fake stories.   In fact their should be criminal or penalties for reporting fake news on purpose.    Pollsters and fact checkers should also be held accountable.
1316418734899240962 2020-10-15 00:40:58 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Nah we will destroy the left and their crazy woke policies and return law and order to the US.

1316249096395649024 2020-10-14 13:26:53 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Ilhan should have been banned. Also did you a bunch of Somalis in her neighborhood were arrested and deported on terrorism charges, and sexual assault on minors ect.
1316248164672905221 2020-10-14 13:23:11 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @IlhanMN My neighbors are Muslim ladies, they say it’s sucks bad.  They can’t even swim in bathing suits and had a whole list of crazy stuff they had to abide by.
1316247697159065600 2020-10-14 13:21:20 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @IlhanMN Like you answer any questions lol. But she did in fact answer it, she’s just to smart to be lured in by your leftists antics.
1316243634660966405 2020-10-14 13:05:11 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @AnaMardoll The Republican Bill is awesome.  There’s no pork or bailout money of blue crazy states who refused to stop antifa and blm and no ballot harvesting.   Pelosi wants ballot harvesting in the bill. That’s crazy! Just do a bare bones bill that everyone can agree to.
1316242784991490048 2020-10-14 13:01:49 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Now you know how Trump feels. Unfair isn’t it. But when Biden lies about fracking or taxes the media doesn’t call him out on it, and you democrats call him or the media out.   So this is what you get.

1316097467323158530 2020-10-14 03:24:22 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Obamacare is the healthcare equivalent of its namesake Barack Hussein Obama   It’s total junk and only helps people below poverty and illegals while hurting everyone else.   It also has a trashy name. #FactsMatter
1316093682454597632 2020-10-14 03:09:20 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @AOC I hardly ever see you in pictures with white people.  Do you hate them?    Just asking for my white neighbors. They were scared to ask.
1316090744696864769 2020-10-14 02:57:39 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> How many people wish Amy Barrett would say “ yes I hate Obamacare and I’m gonna decide against it everytime and whatcha gonna do about it?”  “Yeah that’s what I thought “  https://t.co/q0MXUZMOF7
1316082229957849088 2020-10-14 02:23:49 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @ShannonMarie302 Yes!!!! It’s obvious.  Good call!  https://t.co/vI8PnufLQk
1316080005961658372 2020-10-14 02:14:59 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Amy Barrett is Magna Cum Laude and Klobuchar is Super Dum Loud
1316077004333232134 2020-10-14 02:03:04 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> The more i hear democrats speak, the more I despise them.

1316075154628317184 2020-10-14 01:55:43 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> If you like Obamacare then we are soooooooooooo far apart there’s no room for discussion   If you want a $15 minimum wage, then you failed macro and micro economics.  I know it. You failed
1316074771700944897 2020-10-14 01:54:11 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Why not old man? Obamacare sucks for hundreds of millions of people. It’s terrible.  It screwed up so many lives that the people who passed it should be prosecuted.
1316074374051627009 2020-10-14 01:52:36 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Yes sir!  Just vote already
1316074074930589698 2020-10-14 01:51:25 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Klobuchar is a bia and I hate her voice. Amy is so superior to her.
1316073608687628290 2020-10-14 01:49:34 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Antifa watches Amy Barrett and her family sitting behind her with disgust but secretly they wish they had parents like her and her husband.
1316072356272635905 2020-10-14 01:44:35 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Ted Cruz is growing on me.  I like that dude
1316029104928419844 2020-10-13 22:52:43 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> I bet Amy Barrett wins all the arguments with her husband at home. He’s toast 😂
1316026415049973761 2020-10-13 22:42:02 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> These hearings make our country look really stupid.
1316025050303090688 2020-10-13 22:36:37 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> This can’t be good to have all these grandpas in the senate.  I’m serious.
1316022885278834688 2020-10-13 22:28:01 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Patrick Leahy is putting me to sleep  Zzzz zzzzzz zzzzzz
1316022685818777600 2020-10-13 22:27:13 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Is it a requirement that you have to be over 70 to be a democrat senator.  Man these guys are ancient and boring ?

1315881174980603904 2020-10-13 13:04:54 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> You’re not a real Texan.  You’re a skate boarding non gun toting lawless hippie wannabe  Youre trying to turn our state into blue shitholes like Cali   Pass CABRON

1315879421849542656 2020-10-13 12:57:56 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @SpeakerPelosi   Good Morning  Sunday Morning  I hear they are gonna get a committee to determine if you are mentally fit to be in Congress #PelosiMustGo
1315878406333005824 2020-10-13 12:53:54 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Hell yeah.  They should have done  this long ago.   Good morning!   Sunday morning !
1315877891570368513 2020-10-13 12:51:51 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> The left can do whatever they want and get a pass.  They can loot and riot.  They can kneel. They can call you foul and racist names. They can celebrate felons and vilify law enforcement. They can lie and have the media cover for them.
1315876569429299200 2020-10-13 12:46:36 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @Ihate2wait @ND Good post 👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
1315875392058728449 2020-10-13 12:41:55 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @TheOnlooker18 Well I’m kinda different. Im not an insane mask up guy but I think it might help. But like I said I’m not the type that will call you out on it. I think of it as a personal preference and not a mandate.    If you wanna wear it cool, if not that’s cool too.
1315874849953382400 2020-10-13 12:39:46 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> If you are a health professional and think biden is not in mental decline, then you should lose your damn license and you know it.   #FactsMatter
1315874576400822272 2020-10-13 12:38:41 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @JackPosobiec There’s no freaking comparison and it’s so embarrassing that the left pretends that nothing is mentally wrong with Biden. It’s obvious
1315874321118777345 2020-10-13 12:37:40 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Truth, and I think even more people will vote this time.  The people who passed on voting in 2016 will come out  in force.

1315746797726437378 2020-10-13 04:10:56 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Nobody likes you.    Wait let me change that : no sane and gainfully employed person with sound morals likes you.
1315744649902993409 2020-10-13 04:02:24 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> But it’s constitutional which means it’s legitimate and lawful. You want to change the rules and laws then there’s a process for that.   Hey didn’t you work as a lawyer or something?
1315743585011195908 2020-10-13 03:58:10 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> I say the US must ABOLISH KAEPERNICK in Order to ‘Eliminate Lunacy’

I prefer a doctor that has great expertise over one that has great bedside manners.

How many of these people could I pay off?  A lot!

1314834806694449154 2020-10-10 15:47:01 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @bbmidorii Just social media Asians fell for that BS.  Traditionally Asians are more conservative and have family values.   Some of those are just trying to belong to something.   But I agree 100% it was disturbing

1314826730318843904 2020-10-10 15:14:55 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Affirmative action has hurt Asians in college and post college admissions.   Asians are considered minorities for “minority scholarships” and good luck getting into a Ivy League school even with a perfect SAT score.
1314825379094450176 2020-10-10 15:09:33 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Thanks Lindsey now is the time to get out there and support our President. Round up the rest of the Republican senators too !

1314782030819979265 2020-10-10 12:17:18 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @NPR Just a question but are we  allowed to call black women that we despise anything? Can we call the dummy or crazy or loser?  What are the rules ?

1314751848708964353 2020-10-10 10:17:22 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> If a white man cuts of a black man during a debate is that  racist man-on-mansplaining?   Someone help me out here
1314751470936510465 2020-10-10 10:15:52 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> So what is mansplaining and if there is mansplaining is there womansplaining?   If there’s two men debating and one cuts the other off is that man-on-mansplaining?  Now if your child is being disruptive and you tell them to be quiet or hush is that childsplaining?
1314750782412066817 2020-10-10 10:13:08 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> I need you out and supporting our president more!  This campaign has really shed a light on who is truly loyal to our President and this administration
1314750000593858566 2020-10-10 10:10:01 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Good morning.   Sunday morning 😂
1314749364104048644 2020-10-10 10:07:29 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @twitter see the question below. 👇. Who determines what is real and what is fake. Today I saw someone steal mail out of a mail truck but if post that will you suspend me too? I got video
1314747998111444992 2020-10-10 10:02:04 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> This is the problem. Donald has to fight the media, foreign aggressors, the deep state, the democrats, and even the republicans.   He gets hit from every side. How he stays strong is amazing.

1314693315514826752 2020-10-10 06:24:46 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @Newsweek Honestly though. If you’re struggling and below the poverty line, 44 probably hooked you up pretty good while taxing everyone else.    It’s really based on your situation in life. The have nots want free stuff and the haves want to hold on to what they worked hard for. Simple
1314692735991980035 2020-10-10 06:22:28 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @Newsweek If they could reduce taxes a bit more and bust these rioters up, and lock down immigration to only legal immigrants and give business owners more tax breaks I’d be in heaven. Plus let’s not pay for all those crazy leftist welfare programs. I’m tired of paying for others
1314692287486734336 2020-10-10 06:20:41 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @Newsweek I’m a lot better under trump.  I’m paying less taxes for my businesses and personally. The economy was booming and all of my investments went up considerably but I’m still hoping for more.   I’d like some more reduction on taxes
1314691083662757888 2020-10-10 06:15:54 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Trump uncovered all their bad dealings and evil deeds.  That’s why so many of them are fighting against Donald.  Donald’s is like James Bond in Quatumn of Solice #JamesBond

Now I’d love it if all athletes and sports leagues banned political statements.   Now if they chose to support Trump they should each get 1 billion from Fed 💰 earmarked for Cali and NY
1313974169659486209 2020-10-08 06:47:09 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @PGoodDMD @TwitterSupport Thanks! This twitter suppression is something else
1313969003803611136 2020-10-08 06:26:37 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @kylegriffin1 Because the freaking news won’t air anything except hit pieces.  Where u been man hiding in your CNN cave ?
1313965298966560768 2020-10-08 06:11:54 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Ruth’s Chris is kinda like on the same level as Cheesecake Factory  It’s ok 👍.  Nothing superb but every dinner doesn’t have  to be  5 star.
1313964059973349376 2020-10-08 06:06:58 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> I agree but I gotta a lil ghetto in me. Waffle House and McDonald’s are good. 😁. Waffle House is so fast and olive  Garden is all right.   I go there when I’m feeling a little sick and just get them endless soup and salad.   It isn’t great but serves a purpose.
1313961259126198272 2020-10-08 05:55:51 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Every time I’m on that 3 day suspension/ limiting of functions thingy I start losing followers. Not a lot but some.  @TwitterSupport can you explain what that is?
1313628095082123270 2020-10-07 07:51:58 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @TheRealEnemies Ur suppressed homie. Most are.  I did my own testing and it’s true. Check your impressions too.

1313610337397112832 2020-10-07 06:41:24 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @JoeBiden 1. Blm was created during your administration. And their were numerous riots ie ferguson  2. The cages at the border were created by Obama and you  3. The unemployment rate currently is better with the pandemic and shutdowns than when you left office  4. 47 years in politics 👎
1313609813465673729 2020-10-07 06:39:19 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @JoeBiden Ok im tired of your bumper sticker campaign slogan comments that are ambiguous.   How are you going to bring unity when you couldn’t do it with the black mesiah working with you.  All those riots and blm stuff started during your administration, and they didn’t stop.
1313576600714313728 2020-10-07 04:27:21 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @JackPosobiec Biden Sucks

Yes there are numerous small blm protests if like 25 people here and there that skew those statistics.  The majority of all large blm protests end in violence. Period.   Don’t try to use you’re BS statistics.

1313553186330943488 2020-10-07 02:54:18 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Dana Pareno on Fox doesn’t seem like she’s 💯 w the patriots.  To me she seems like a Romney Republican. Anyone else feel this way? And if you don’t that’s cool just tell me why. Im open minded !
1313508053589938178 2020-10-06 23:54:58 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @C_3C_3 @CourseMonkey18 Absolutely.  This is strange.
1313505987786084356 2020-10-06 23:46:45 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> When I look into your eyes there’s nothing there. Everyone can see this. Just watch and focus on his face. Sigh. There’s no spark. It’s dull. This is a red flag for medical professionals.  Shame on all the social media docs who don’t admit this.

You keep thinking that. You better ask your dads and uncles about LA during the Rodney king riots. Forget history, make the same mistakes.

1312895569266909184 2020-10-05 07:21:10 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Democrats and media flip flop and change their talking points and outrage by the second.   Today they are worried about the agents driving POTUS home ? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 👇  https://t.co/rqB8Gonmnp

1312804514886488064 2020-10-05 01:19:21 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @SenJoniErnst I went through your tweets and didn’t see one tweet wishing the POTUS a swift recovery or one tweet supporting the president and his administration.    That’s curious from a Republican Senator. Do you care to respond ?
1312802188444479494 2020-10-05 01:10:07 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @marcorubio I went through your tweets and some good stuff there. But you need to support the president more! Come out and speak about the good policies of this administration and how Biden and Harris would destroy this country.

It’s a shame that the RNC and Trump campaign people didn’t have the smarts to object to Wallace as a moderator.    Are there traitors trying to u undermine the pres from within?

1311446637064138752 2020-10-01 07:23:38 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Who cares about taxes! Let’s talk about  1. Burisma and Biden 2. 3.5 million wired to Hunter  3. Voter fraud 4. Green new deal/Biden deal which gives government control over all energy  5. Refusal to condemn antifa and blm  6. Tax plans  7. Stacking the court  ..more
1311333857728364552 2020-09-30 23:55:29 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Absolutely Bernie Bros! Look you guys love that green new deal and Biden doesn’t support it  (he said so last night ), you guys might as well vote for Donald at least he’s honest about it.

1311098514034827266 2020-09-30 08:20:19 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @Breaking911 I’m worried about counterfeit ballots from China. Earlier this year thousands of counterfeit us driver licenses and Ids were confiscated from a shipment from China.  All it would take is for some to give them a real mail in ballot and a roll of all registered voters

1310428080402575361 2020-09-28 11:56:15 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @RealJamesWoods @Jenariel17 James I ❤️ u man. You do so much for the cause.  I know you’re just phrasing your tweet a certain way and totally understand that people from a certain political side have been buying votes for years.   Goto to a section8 housing unit with about 300-500 adults living there 💰
1310425828992446465 2020-09-28 11:47:18 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> The retweet w comments has double the views/impressions.  https://t.co/wDmqxBdzYv
1310425511617851393 2020-09-28 11:46:03 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Tik Tok -  what you did alone should bring that up to 33%. Now I see how you won because it’s impossible that someone with your background and hatred for America could be elected without some  special “help”. The truth always comes out. It’s just a natter if time  https://t.co/7yZqBdhJmm
1310424548106530816 2020-09-28 11:42:13 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Shame on twitter. Suppression at its finest. The retweet with comments is getting more impressions and traffic then the original. 🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
1310423208273883139 2020-09-28 11:36:53 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> That teacher needs to be fired immediately. Her racism is showing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1310422189389361152 2020-09-28 11:32:51 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Well lizzy the reason you should ge able to wear a maga hat is because maga is a godly and good movement that promotes love and respect whereas the other movements promote violence and destruction. We should really try our best to be good people. 😁🙏❤️🇺🇸
1310420968641355776 2020-09-28 11:28:00 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Good for your teacher but I noticed that your email has the Antichrist 666 in it. Something tells me you could benefit from some mentoring or guidance. - that’s not a good number to use.
1310420343211855873 2020-09-28 11:25:30 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Oh man this so predictable. Twitter is suppressing the tweet below 👇. It’s actually a very civil and polite tweet.

1310415753393385473 2020-09-28 11:07:16 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @CNN @MSNBC are you guys interested in this story. I hope so. Have a great day ! 😁🙏

Third, your electrical infrastructure isn’t set up for all of these vehicles requiring charging.  Fourth, the reliability of electrical vehicle isn’t there yet. You gotta charge 9 hours between
1310359635661148166 2020-09-28 07:24:17 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> This will not work.  Electric cars are priced out of the reach of low income families. You can get a cheap used vehicle that runs for 2000-3500.  You are not gonna get in that price range for a used electric vehicle. Second, the electric pick up industry is lagging a lot of
1310358156271398914 2020-09-28 07:18:24 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Daily reminder to all patriots. Because twitter suppresses conservatives views the retweet has become a powerful and necessary tool for us.  Retweet each other as much as possible and help get our opinions and voices heard. Just my two cents and if you don’t that’s still cool. 🇺🇸

1310275319065128961 2020-09-28 01:49:14 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @RealJamesWoods I know about 100 homies about that size around 240-360 and would handle about 10-20 antifa blms each easy.  Just got to u leash them. These guys do this for a living.  They bounce and collect past due “bills” but are very patriotic
1310274519559540736 2020-09-28 01:46:03 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> The kind of idiot who doesn’t pay taxes.  Simple bro. If you don’t have a job what does it matter.  If your parents take care of you, it doesn’t matter.

1310131476483190789 2020-09-27 16:17:39 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @RickStearns4 Obama basically got nothing accomplished except increasing my medical insurance 3x the normal amount and hiking my taxes up. Beyond that he did pretty much nothing.
1310131233972785157 2020-09-27 16:16:41 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @RickStearns4 Well he works a lot more than Obama - prolly 3-4x more so he should have waaay more golf  days.  Obama was super lazy and didn’t get shit done. It’s kinda like a part time employee doesn’t get as many PTO days as a full time employee.

They still don't understand how crooked and deceitful the Dems are.  We need new GOP representatives, that are street smart and wise to the game.  This is embarrassing.  Basically, they got "tricked"

Play their game!   Like RedneckAzn Daily has an awesome reporter/journalist. He would ask all the juicy questions. “Any update on joe Biden’s criminal dealings with Ukraine?” Ect
1309395385731997696 2020-09-25 15:32:42 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @PortlandPolice @tomtomboombang Hey not trying to be a that guy but......hasn’t prettt much every gathering been declared an unlawful assembly or riot.  So save yourself some time. Next time you see them gather, trust me on this, it’ll end up as an unlawful assembly or riot.   Hey this advice is free - gratis
1309394485722390530 2020-09-25 15:29:07 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Here’s what protesting is like in Russia. They don’t play. Actually a lot of countries don’t play, we let everyone have waaaaaaaay to much leeway. You protest like that in China, and they’ll just end you right there or make you disappear and you’ll end up making Nike stuff 4 free
1309392936082305024 2020-09-25 15:22:57 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @TwitterSupport bros this would be a good time to get me off that 3 day suspension/ limiting of my functions thingy for “aggressively” following people who like my tweets and or follow me. Time is ticking, eventually it’ll come out. There are already whistleblowers lined up.
1309391552851185665 2020-09-25 15:17:28 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Ok Charlie now your talking!

1309385555755626498 2020-09-25 14:53:38 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @SportsCenter Lebron is uneducated on the facts surrounding this case. But he’s also too prideful to listen and learn. Most people are too stubborn to listen to all the facts because once they have committed themselves to a certain view or opinion their pride gets in the way.
1309384484165505024 2020-09-25 14:49:22 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Give him 10 years at least

1309384125908955136 2020-09-25 14:47:57 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @ElijahSchaffer Does that Florida law apply here. People need to walk on sidewalks and not the streets or highways. Just to be safe you know.

I miss players like Jerry Rice and emitt Smith. These new cats are all about self promotion and social media. A majority of them do these protests so they can get more attention. Sick

1308839811512492034 2020-09-24 02:45:02 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Yo shahid ....ummm she was also listed on the warrant.  She was letting him sell drugs out of her apartment and letting him mail out drugs too. That’s besides the point, she knew what he did and he shot at the cops.
1308838882990006272 2020-09-24 02:41:21 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @ajplus Justice is being served
1308838274887225344 2020-09-24 02:38:56 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @MsPackyetti Justice was served.  Shooting at the police has consequences.  Being a drug dealer has consequences. Associating with criminal has consequences. While a tragedy, her death was the result of the drug dealing boyfriend shooting at the police. People should be mad at him!
1308837641492856835 2020-09-24 02:36:25 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> If they block you.  Move through them. They have no right to block traffic.
1308837314588803077 2020-09-24 02:35:07 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Why are you leaving out the important part.  Her boyfriend who was next to her started shooting at the police officers.  That’s a very important piece of information.  Leaving it out is dishonest man. Is kinda slimy and scummy
1308835897056600067 2020-09-24 02:29:29 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Couple 8.  Ted Wheeler refuses to stop the riots but is so hypocritical that he moves out of Portland  9.  And twitter suspends for me for three days because I broke some follow rule which I didn’t exceed 400 by any means.
1308835476024033281 2020-09-24 02:27:49 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> 4. Alyssa Milano called the cops after she endorsed defund the police  5. Ilhan Omar married her brother and used someone else’s name to get into the US  6. More than 2000 more Clinton emails were found on a laptop 7. Kim Gardner tampered with evidence to prosecute the St. Louis
1308834973747732482 2020-09-24 02:25:49 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Ok so let me break it down for ya  1.  Hunter biden took $4 million from the Moscow mayors wife and distributed to his family  2. Bloomberg broke federal law by paying fines for inmates or criminals so they can vote  3. Pelosi violates mandates by getting a hair cut

1308828734720487424 2020-09-24 02:01:01 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @piersmorgan Wait am I reading the tweet right.  So voting against trump is unacceptable and voting for trump is acceptable corrrct?   I’m trying to debate if I should say   Helllllll yeah!   Or   Hellllll no!
1308825395752509440 2020-09-24 01:47:45 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @twitter is your algorithm so dumb that it can’t differentiate a bot from a real user?  Look man I follow people who like my tweets and are in the same threads of discussion. You guys suspend me every 3 days and for what? Because I press the follow button too fast? Explain homie
1308793229496680448 2020-09-23 23:39:56 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> After working hard there’s nothing better than replenishing your body with the nutrients it needs. I prefer a combo of #GOYA coconut water and #palmettocheese  https://t.co/Y3TncAUaQz

1308079549373206528 2020-09-22 00:24:02 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @EscaleraCat @HKrassenstein New York and California are so broke. Lol they can’t even pay for themselves. lol

1308078695136067584 2020-09-22 00:20:38 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @HKrassenstein Nah.  It’s because these cities decided to play positive and refused to stop the riots immediately.  A lot of minority business owners had their livelihoods destroyed by the violent mobs. People who condone th is behavior are evil and heartless.  Look in the damn mirror
1308077805779980288 2020-09-22 00:17:06 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @DrShayPhD Ok I’ll play.....I’d save Nancy at the last minute after the shark had some lunch.  Don’t know how long she will make it but she’s saved, I pulled what’s left of her to shore.
1308077299854708739 2020-09-22 00:15:05 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> BLM and antifa are losing the battle of public opinion. Good hard working families are tiring of their antics.  The English premier league just broke away from BLM and others will follow soon.  The Dallas cowboys didn’t kneel on Sunday. The DOJ is investigating both organizations

They are helping conservative families.  I don’t care what a persons personality is like if their policies screw me over, why wold I vote for them.

I’d also revoke their license and make them spend the rest of their lives opening the doors of trump tower. That’s about right. Now, if they give up 100 other antifa culprits, we can talk

1306380923475292160 2020-09-17 07:54:18 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @francoisvkw @dbongino Another great question would be:   It’s obvious that president trump would destroy Biden in hand to hand combat but do you think that Donald could beat Biden, schiff, nadler, and pelosi at the same time in a bare knuckles back alley brawl?
1306380570851774465 2020-09-17 07:52:54 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @francoisvkw @dbongino A great question would be : after securing peace for the Middle East what do you think the presidents chances are of winning the nobel peace prize

They are being fed propaganda and believe the first thing they hear without doing any research. The old school athletes were smarter. Guys like Karl Malone, Shaq, and the round mound of rebound !

You should pay taxes, pass an IQ test, a mental stability test, and a current affairs and politics test, and be a citizen in order to vote.   It’ll never happen but think about this everyone one of those idiots get to vote

If Biden wins the people will Iive in a state of DESPERATION, RAGE, and INSOMNIA
1305395538066468864 2020-09-14 14:38:44 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @PolitiFact can you be balanced or are you super leftists and use wierd marxists sources to back up your “fact checking”. 😂  Let me play your game  Trump accuses Biden of being mentally incapable   True! Many neurological experts have watched Biden’s on screen and concur
1305394761956823040 2020-09-14 14:35:38 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @ElijahSchaffer More riots more trump voters. It’s sad but blm is driving more people to vote for 45. Except unemployed losers and never do wells and grifters and gutter rats

1305393875733876736 2020-09-14 14:32:07 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> God dang you lie so hard. Read his freaking platform. Hes going to take away tax breaks which will result in the same thing. Plus with all the crazy programs that he’s trying to push, just taxing people 400k+ won’t cover it.  Another day another lie
1305393293950320641 2020-09-14 14:29:48 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @politifact and he has said in an interview that he would re-divert police funds to other programs. Once again you lie. Can you not be honest ? #DonaldTrump
1305392914584031237 2020-09-14 14:28:18 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @PolitiFact we now can see that you are fake news and partisan. Joe Biden totally called the China travel band racist and xenophobic but you spun it that he “coincidently “ made that comment about other issues@on the exact same day the travel band was instituted. You lie

1305371781293903873 2020-09-14 13:04:19 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @JoyAnnReid Trump is gonna win big time and you’re gonna cry for weeks.

1305173680503357441 2020-09-13 23:57:09 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> This is absolutely true....indian people are crazy about Trump. They are supporting him like 99.9% percent. They are for higher learning abd family values.

1305164510232285184 2020-09-13 23:20:42 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> BLM and antifa need to be designated as a terrorist organizations immediately !
1305163689025310720 2020-09-13 23:17:26 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Blm needs to be ended. This is just as bad as shooting them.  They should be arresed and charged with felonies immediately ! #Compton -#BlueLivesMatter
1305161865203507200 2020-09-13 23:10:12 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> This is absolutely true. I’m already seeing it.  Pay attention and you will see people behave more recklessly, drive crazier, be quick to snap and confront people. I can see it in their eyes.
1305160128006504450 2020-09-13 23:03:17 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @johnpavlovitz Jesus would love Donald Trump the bringer if truth and justice. Jesus would hate:  1. Antifa  2. Blm  3. Cuties -Netflix  4. High taxes  5. No bail system  6. No fracking  7. No Christian values  8. Parties that support any of the above
1305159038246825984 2020-09-13 22:58:58 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @johnpavlovitz Jesus would absolutely hate BLM and how they are terrorizing people and terminally ill children.

Some of the businesses were Hispanic owned and they don’t like it.  Also in Texas a lot of Hispanics are in law enforcement.

1303387410311634945 2020-09-09 01:39:09 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> China is helping Biden with fake ids and probably fake ballots. It would be so easy for them to do

1303152080304173058 2020-09-08 10:04:01 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @CBSNews Stop being naive. I’ve seen people taken boxes of mail outside of mail trucks when the mailman parks for a second. I’ve seen people take other people’s mail from complexes. I’ve seen people come with crowbars to pry open the entire door to an apartment complexes mailbox.

I’ve seen co-op farms and markets and stuff. They don’t do so good but they are free to do so. Yeah socialism just isn’t my thing homie.  But to each their own. Capitalism is working great for me 👍

He is so strong I believe in him 100. I don’t care what they say and if he did I might not just give a damn anyways. He does right by me

Donald is legit and if he has been prescribed adderall to focus who cares   I doubt it but if he did I don’t give a dang.  He’s one of the best presidents ever and has been fighting against everyone for us

1302641700913938435 2020-09-07 00:15:58 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @Timcast More people were killed by the riots than unarmed black men by cops.   Yup. Also more people die from lightning strikes and fishing accidents   I’m about to go protest bees and wasps.
1302641053510459392 2020-09-07 00:13:23 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @stillgray Their logic is so flawed. Total whack. Please god help these people see the light.

I’m just tired of the looting, rioting, disorderly conduct. Wish they would all just go home and clean their houses, fo some laundry, get ready for work the next day.

1302470181420183552 2020-09-06 12:54:24 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @RhocanZachary @HowieHawkins Oh how do stay at moms get paid in a socialistic society if they are getting child support that’s is used to pay for everything. I know this dude who has like 3 different kids w three different ladies how does that work? So im thinking he doesn’t have to pay anything anymore
1302469357721841664 2020-09-06 12:51:08 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @RhocanZachary @HowieHawkins So just hypothetically if I make 2-3 million a year off of all of those companies, do I still get to take that money?
1302468997011693569 2020-09-06 12:49:42 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @RhocanZachary @HowieHawkins Ok but would I still get all my profits from my business?  So let’s say I own a construction company, and freight company, and a manufacturing company. Would I still get my salary plus profit?
1302458319718821889 2020-09-06 12:07:16 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @RhocanZachary @HowieHawkins Ok so if I own an apartment complex I gotta give it up. Hellllll no.  That’s shit.  How about my businesses do I have to give those up too?
1302450019149271040 2020-09-06 11:34:17 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @HowieHawkins I’m pretty wealthy , will I have to forfeit my money and properties or can I keep them?

1302364535794393088 2020-09-06 05:54:36 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @Sulliview More people die of bee stings than unarmed black people killed by cops. More white people than blacks are killed by cops and more people die from fishing and skate boarding every year but yet you guys are rioting.   Why not protest skateboarding or fishing. Lives matter

Lots of them have outstanding violent warrants so ............they probably disobeyed orders to leave the vehicle  too.

That’s why republicans are upset that democrats are cool with riots where people don’t wear masks all the time.  That’s why it’s hypocritical of Nancy. Science Nancy as she always preaches

The Democrats are all about enforcing the masks and so pelosi has been caught being a hypocrite. Rules for thee and not for me

1300860336376033281 2020-09-02 02:17:27 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @USAKenji @charliekirk11 1960’s. Heck it was still great from 2000-2007/2008. Man it was awesome. The boom everything went terrible. But I pray everything returns back to when life was peaceful and great.

1300856391226269696 2020-09-02 02:01:47 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @jennerific713 @realDonaldTrump I don’t like police abuse but I’m tired of criminals too. Wish all the criminals would go away.
1300855719055495169 2020-09-02 01:59:06 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @OtisWasYellow49 @greenhousenyt @realDonaldTrump Bingo. It’s been proven incorrect
1300855573496430594 2020-09-02 01:58:32 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @greenhousenyt @realDonaldTrump This was debunked like a mofo but if I just watch rachel maddow and John 🍋 ur not gonna learn much.
1300855127218286594 2020-09-02 01:56:45 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Make biden first 😂. You guys gonna lose bad. Oh so bad. #MAGA

1300706816561745922 2020-09-01 16:07:25 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @MrAndyNgo @tedwheeler At every antifa riot, I see like hundreds of people dressed in black with press stickers on. You guys sure have a lot of journalists in Portland 😂😂😂

1300704863458930696 2020-09-01 15:59:40 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @TomasMorales_iv Looks like these officers could use some Goya coconut water. Keep cool and stay hydrated. Keep them fresh so they can deal with this blm BS   https://t.co/LGFkELMDdB

1300698690005413888 2020-09-01 15:35:08 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Damn Biden lies so much and it’s on tape and media doesn’t even call him out on it.
1300697944715390976 2020-09-01 15:32:10 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @theangiestanton Who’s ever said that?  You’re weird

1300696711820701697 2020-09-01 15:27:16 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @ArtValley818_ @tariqnasheed Does that weird tariqna mean light skinned Hispanic? I dk but the guy looks pretty dark.  Man 2020 is weird and it brings the weirdos out in force
1300695562912755712 2020-09-01 15:22:42 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @ElDubitabam @iValueNutrition @tariqnasheed Bingo. Right on

1300652138868232193 2020-09-01 12:30:09 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> @irishrygirl @DonaldJTrumpJr Weak ur missing the point. The media is lying about it being peaceful so it’s it’s soooooooo peaceful like they claim, there should be no problem w them attending the protests at night. But because we know their are violent, the media will not take his bet.

1300619073408167936 2020-09-01 10:18:46 +0800 <LMFireSystems1> Ummmmmmm this has to be against the law. This isn’t right dude.  There needs to be journalistic reform. Terrible.
