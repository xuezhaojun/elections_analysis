1343566433788149760 2020-12-28 22:36:14 +0800 <BitemeIOS> We really need to start placing blame on the entire house and senate. Not a single person in there can say they didn't do their absolute 100% best when going for covid relief. Each side had to pork up their bills.  ITS. DISGUSTING. We need to stand up and unite to clean it up.

Statistically speaking. Immigrants who come here LEGALLY vs undoc. Who commit crimes is for every 1 person who commits a crime. 241 come and dont. My math might be off. It isnt my best subject
1324084515006939137 2020-11-05 04:22:03 +0800 <BitemeIOS> @boxtotheright @hcmthethird @realDonaldTrump Furthermore, those illegal entry numbers don't have the percentage against those who come and legally get citizenship.

Its about controlling women and FORCING them to carry a child that will end up in the ALREADY OVERWORKED foster system waiting for an adoption. If people want children that bad. ADOPT OLDER KIDS NOT SHINEY NEW BABIES
1323618196314750976 2020-11-03 21:29:04 +0800 <BitemeIOS> @JusticeLiberty0 @HanKSmithGA @PeteButtigieg @JoeBiden Listen, if you want to end abortions. End SAFE abortions. You need to sterilize the problem. MALES are needed to make said babies. Woman cannot reproduce on their own. Vasectomy procedures are REVERSIBLE. So, why not just sterilize men from 15 and end abortion.
1323412664534532098 2020-11-03 07:52:21 +0800 <BitemeIOS> @JusticeLiberty0 @HanKSmithGA @PeteButtigieg @JoeBiden Thats quite litterally the point. Fact: Vasectomy is alot safer than a tubal. Fact: Men can impregnate many woman a day 365 days a year.  Fact: Woman can only get pregnant once in 40 weeks.   So, if you are going 5o regulate women. Regulate BOTH
1323378077028634625 2020-11-03 05:34:55 +0800 <BitemeIOS> @ewarren We need to can the 2 party system and stop putting old ass people as the choices.

1313254739413397504 2020-10-06 07:08:23 +0800 <BitemeIOS> @JoeBiden He won't, he doesn't care about anyone other than his own personal gain. Point in fact. His stupid joyride that risked his staff
1312923548407656450 2020-10-05 09:12:21 +0800 <BitemeIOS> @Deligracy and @JamesTurnerYT posted a video about a Mac and cheese made from veggies. Made it tonight from bad memory and got my picky 5 year old to FINALLY eat veggies.  Thanks you two!
1312839510762254338 2020-10-05 03:38:25 +0800 <BitemeIOS> @Deligracy I didnt realize you were in the US *Insert eye roll* Sorry people aren't acting right. Some folks just don't see past their noses üò≠

1312035221953372160 2020-10-02 22:22:28 +0800 <BitemeIOS> I'm not saying I'm happy dump truck has covid. Im just saying, he fucking deserves the worst of it. And then to recover with unknown lifelong issues others will be facing. But then again, he is 74 and an elder. So wherever the dice falls. Fuck you dump truck.
1311867353399881729 2020-10-02 11:15:25 +0800 <BitemeIOS> When you feel the weight of the world on your shoulders. And all you want is release.
1311798986563436545 2020-10-02 06:43:45 +0800 <BitemeIOS> I've offered praise, rewards, I've sat with her. Helped her, walked through things with her. Had her teach me her math, as I taught how I learned. I dont know what I've done wrong so I can fix it.
1311798676784701440 2020-10-02 06:42:31 +0800 <BitemeIOS> And its not that I was all "ok you did it for them, no sleep over for you" After our neighbor left. She didn't do one thing. It's like I'm some negative energy black hole that sucks the drive out of her. I just want to see her succeed üò≠
1311798270688067584 2020-10-02 06:40:54 +0800 <BitemeIOS> Hubs then decided that before he cancels it, he will see if she does the work for him. BITCH THAT AINT THE PROBLEM. I NEED HER TO DO IT FOR ME. THE ONE WITH HER 24/7. WITH NO BREAKS, NO HIM. So please, reward her...
1311798269740109825 2020-10-02 06:40:54 +0800 <BitemeIOS> I told her point blank, no sleep over this weekend if she didn't finish the 10 assignments, assigned Monday. And today, after sitting down with our neighbor. Knocked out 3 timed tests. I told her that's it. No sleepover.
1311798268980985858 2020-10-02 06:40:54 +0800 <BitemeIOS> Shits so God damn unfair. Please excuse me as I rant. I dont normally rant about personal shit but I have to. Kid will do school work for everyone other than me. I've tried everything in the book to help her and be there for her. And nothing comes from it.

1311112447281913856 2020-09-30 09:15:41 +0800 <BitemeIOS> @thillliard @JoeBiden Trump won't give his DNA for a rape kit. If we're going tit for tat
1310924637283311619 2020-09-29 20:49:23 +0800 <BitemeIOS> @keggy92 Because Pro lifers are only pro birthers. They don't give a single fuck except to control the bodies of people who do not concern them.

1310594245594546176 2020-09-28 22:56:32 +0800 <BitemeIOS> He had 4 years to attempt this and waits till the last second to pacify his cult. And not a damn one sees an issue with this. #DumpTrump2020
1308544300666421248 2020-09-23 07:10:47 +0800 <BitemeIOS> This election is stressing me out. FK the 2 party system. Let's get this blue vote and then start the change process to abolish it. We need ACTUAL leaders who give a fuck about the American people.  https://t.co/HbetEH6Z5x
1308478057720680448 2020-09-23 02:47:33 +0800 <BitemeIOS> But I thought EA and the sims team said "ItS tOo HaRd"
1308476397782851585 2020-09-23 02:40:58 +0800 <BitemeIOS> @EnglishSimmer Honestly, I'm not sure they can fix it. They've watered down every pack, have glitches everywhere and Ea refuses to listen to players. Granted, I know big companies need money for their holders. But they wont have money if they keep this ish up
1308475285596069889 2020-09-23 02:36:33 +0800 <BitemeIOS> YAS @TheSims @EA Bring on POC to help y'all get it right
1308185140191883264 2020-09-22 07:23:36 +0800 <BitemeIOS> @scamnap I know them all. And in alphabetical order. Thanks to a catchy tune and challenge in 4th grade ü§£

1306638580949766144 2020-09-18 00:58:08 +0800 <BitemeIOS> Anyone have leads on science, math or reading type sub boxes that helps grow minds in a fun way. Looking for all ages or even targeting 4th and high-school age kids. #Homeschooling
1305888278214631424 2020-09-15 23:16:42 +0800 <BitemeIOS> @NWSSeattle All I'm seeing is smoke right now at my home outside Oly. But I did see some *cough cough rain cough cough* leftovers from a night time sprinkle ‚ô•Ô∏è
1305881626417664001 2020-09-15 22:50:16 +0800 <BitemeIOS> @EnglishSimmer Because if we are being honest. The overall price of the game and costs after buying only on sale. This game is ridiculously expensive.
1305881427666378753 2020-09-15 22:49:29 +0800 <BitemeIOS> @EnglishSimmer Honestly, for me. If Sims 5 comes out and doesn't include some packs we've paid for in previous editions. I feel, with other simulation games in progress. They really need to step it up. I would GLADLY pay more at start to have things like pets and seasons included.
1304786806500515841 2020-09-12 22:19:51 +0800 <BitemeIOS> @TheBoredomBee @plumbellayt Haha I had to look him up. So, definitely not the only one.

1304415369759653891 2020-09-11 21:43:53 +0800 <BitemeIOS> @TheSimCommunity I mean, what can they gather in an hour that people haven't been screaming for years? Or are they worried their niche market is gonna crash soon?
1304207390871400448 2020-09-11 07:57:27 +0800 <BitemeIOS> Pray, dance, send good vibes. Whatever you do. We are not ok.  https://t.co/VqIUjFK2wH
1303114332998230016 2020-09-08 07:34:02 +0800 <BitemeIOS> Legit if the sims did this after the star wars fiasco. I can basically see the sims on fire.
1302680115239813121 2020-09-07 02:48:36 +0800 <BitemeIOS> @Deligracy Legit thought I forgot fathers day. Went to look it up and took a breath of relief remembering I didn't forget ü§£
