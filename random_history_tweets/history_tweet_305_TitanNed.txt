1309957917785952256 2020-09-27 04:48:00 +0800 <TitanNed> @jim_freedom @anntensity @AnnCoulter Dude - you need a cold shower üòõ  Don't you know that "clothes make the man (and woman)."  Good style never goes out of style.  If everyone walked around naked, it would get boring.  üòâ  That's just for the bed.  Looking good in public is nice too. üòé
1309245659627900933 2020-09-25 05:37:44 +0800 <TitanNed> @leecarter407260 @anntensity Interesting to hear her on other radio shows (in other cities).  Thought John relied a little too heavy on recorded quotes - cutting into the time for more direct Q&amp;A, but still good overall. No book promos tho! Lol @ her reference to "normal people" (as opposed to herself) üòâ
1309241507690491907 2020-09-25 05:21:14 +0800 <TitanNed> @anntensity She's spelled out a lot more info on ol' Breonna than I knew. So - *not* "sleeping" (which all I hear is she was shot while "sleeping") - lol at Ann's "new baby mama" reference üòÑ

1309204986065301504 2020-09-25 02:56:07 +0800 <TitanNed> @anntensity We need somebody like @RubinReport to start an alternate "GoFundMe" like site that will allow anyone (and especially conservatives and known "Trump supporters") to raise funds for their defense.
1309199092791246850 2020-09-25 02:32:42 +0800 <TitanNed> @billyducs @BuckSexton I know.  That blubberball sure is "brave" - thinking nothing will happen to them.  But then again - there's not much brain power going on there.  #MAGA2020LandslideVictory
