1335761702563016705 2020-12-07 09:43:01 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @catturd2 ......Because masks can make you more susceptible to respiratory illness and Covid-19 is a respiratory illness.

1325283752755556352 2020-11-08 11:47:23 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @hrtablaze Some1 who was a fighter that wouldnt back down like Trump@ U also would need the 3rd Branch as in the Supreme Court in which it just recently became conservative does it make sense now why Ruth held on until her death bed when she had terminal cancer this was their plan all along
1325282074388017157 2020-11-08 11:40:43 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @hrtablaze I'll make the case for this being best case scenario #1)Did they cheat@ rig the election... Yes #2)Was it their 1st time or 1st time being caught...No not 1st time@ Yes 1st time being caught #3)So if you wanted real change you need them to rig it and get caught but also needed&gt;&gt;&gt;

1318191437025083395 2020-10-19 22:05:04 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @DanPariah To go a step further the reality at this point is Trump was never debating Biden he been debating the moderator over 75% of the time if not more.
1318190653306769416 2020-10-19 22:01:57 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @DanPariah I think Trump thoroughly enjoys taking on the corrupt press and dragging them out into the deep end of the pool and exposing them for who they are this is not a tactic for everyone but is very much in Trump's lane.
1318189065087389697 2020-10-19 21:55:38 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @DanPariah ..But is it when he's the incumbent so he negotiates from a position of strength@ that doesn't even factor in that its Trump who's better than most at negotiating my moneys on Trump@ the Main Stream Media can't get exposed enough@ its never weak taking on a corrupt press!
1318185836459032583 2020-10-19 21:42:48 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @DanPariah The evidence points in those directions but one shouldn't assume either.

1303888291373121543 2020-09-10 10:49:28 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @shellsncheezzz I agree that is the best case scenario there was an interview with Denzel Washington where he pretty much said the same.
1303887110919856133 2020-09-10 10:44:46 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @shellsncheezzz ....And yes personal responsibility is key but that's usually taught and when your community leaders are not only not teaching it they are actively opposing its teachings.😬😬😬
1303885363619008513 2020-09-10 10:37:50 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @shellsncheezzz I look at it this way a color of skin does not think therefore the problem lies elsewhere so what's the problem in that community@ even more importantly is the why as in what's responsible for those problem@ to me its not color or gender its ideology which supplies mentality.
1303883829216763908 2020-09-10 10:31:44 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @shellsncheezzz To go a step further look at what NY was like before Giuliani then during him being in office and now there was a direct cause and effect between good leader ship and garbage leadership.
1303882386472611846 2020-09-10 10:26:00 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @shellsncheezzz I don't disagree but also acknowledge that the black community has been inundated with Liberal Democrats whose policies have a direct effect on said out come and to not acknowledge that I would be lying to myself its a one two punch.

1303837794398240770 2020-09-10 07:28:48 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @djsully @FancyBitch_Here You are making an in the vacuum argument as if we don't know the circumstances surrounding the situation its the same mistake Ben Shapiro makes its an over simplifying avoiding the overall big picture.
1303836826625544192 2020-09-10 07:24:58 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @djsully @FancyBitch_Here Wrong if I start punching you and you turn around and punch me back its not an equivalence for context matters and we are now at the point in the game where the Left has justifying violence discrimination and vilifying us as subhuman its not ok to ignore this@ not take action.
1303834707348590593 2020-09-10 07:16:32 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @yourwearinmeout @FancyBitch_Here I think that maybe an exaggeration but yes at this point they have crossed the line and sold themselves out to the political Left and China as in the case of the NBA.

1302810124076154881 2020-09-07 11:25:13 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @xxHaylStorm Are U assuming that they will do what you do with it because they won't in some or even many cases they don't think like U if they did you'd be correct but it goes beyond that simple explanation so only if the person actually does critical thinking@ wants the truth does it apply.

1302770780523106304 2020-09-07 08:48:53 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @DrNealHouston A Leftist sheeple there is blindness and then there is willfully blind a distinction with a difference.

1301216628311552000 2020-09-03 01:53:14 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @Celtic_Films There is a point to be made in anything if one is pointing out an inaccuracy and I get that but at the same time the overall understand of some aka the big picture is more important.Jordan will understate something just for argument sake for that reason.
1301215680591794176 2020-09-03 01:49:28 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @Celtic_Films I don't get caught up in technicalities I'm smart enough to understand the overall point is more important but its confirmation bias to latch onto something that is in significant@ elevate it to mean more than the big picture its also low resolution think.
1301212757627371521 2020-09-03 01:37:51 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @Celtic_Films It was Jordan that actually made me realize than on a side note.
1301211421611626496 2020-09-03 01:32:32 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @Celtic_Films I found it interesting before I fully got the point that there really is not a difference for its the same ideology(Marxism/Communism/Socialism/Leftism)tree a distinction without a real difference.

1301163318950985728 2020-09-02 22:21:24 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @vetsandfriends I don't agree or disagree its a catch 22 for there were many abuses going on in those places and that should not be forgotten.
1300902876756271109 2020-09-02 05:06:30 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @LegendaryEnergy Its just an illusion!
1300892772791181312 2020-09-02 04:26:21 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @LegendaryEnergy Ahhh conclusion=Anything that is good can and will be used for evil its not the thing itself but its application or another way of saying it is the title is meaningless its context that matters.
1300887540845740033 2020-09-02 04:05:33 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @AwakeToday Division it there goal and hate is their tool used to achieve it.
1300886997695967235 2020-09-02 04:03:24 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @LegendaryEnergy Its not done by accident its done by design.
1300886574838800386 2020-09-02 04:01:43 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @LegendaryEnergy "Fully insane"=really means fully subversive for their own personally gain as in power and monetary!
1300858294081290241 2020-09-02 02:09:20 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @DanPariah @El__Bohemio Correct the goal posts are moved to fit the narrative not the facts describe the truth its a start with your guilty and walk it back to confirm my bias approach.  https://t.co/bQb1GU0Jl6
1300856143384899585 2020-09-02 02:00:47 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @LegendaryEnergy "Evil psychopaths"......Now who are they and what CHARACTERISTIC 👈do they share hmmm are they all pretty much Leftist ideology wise and could the ideology cause people in general to become evil?  https://t.co/YHwvG26scC
1300851737646051328 2020-09-02 01:43:17 +0800 <rookieuserIm> 🎤.....And there it is!🔥🔥🔥 @ScottAdamsSays  https://t.co/AN5GXhhwIR
1300845176798281735 2020-09-02 01:17:13 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @burnetta36 @stillgray As any good Christian would do 🥴
1300838197069582338 2020-09-02 00:49:29 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @JonathanFalcons @cedantarmatog1 @ScottAdamsSays @JackPosobiec @Project_Veritas was exposing it for at least the last few years but really its the Left MO throughout history just go back and look at the late 60's and early 70's they are well know for domestic terrorism they are not reinventing the wheel.
1300837507395923968 2020-09-02 00:46:44 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @BashAlaniz @PadenTyrel They know they have been complicit in the "fiery but mostly peaceful"riots for they have laid cover for them and continue to do so all the while vilifying and dehumanizing Trump's side its not by accident but done by design.
1300834133011304457 2020-09-02 00:33:20 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @Lipstick_Pundit @TheMarkPantano @RoystonPotter ...Or could it be you that fail to understand because BOTH sides can be right they are not mutually exclusive.The big picture ALWAYS exists in that Trump is a comparison to for there are only 2 options at this point and yes individual ideas or policies can@ should be critiqued.
1300829714366574597 2020-09-02 00:15:46 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @LeeSmithDC @TheLastRefuge2 I would point out its the same Leftist ideology its a distinction without a real difference.Socialism is just a catalyst to Communism and Dictatorship.
1300828539655270402 2020-09-02 00:11:06 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @ScottAdamsSays @RobinEnochs Main Stream Media gives just enough information or knowledge to lead(mislead)and specifically not enough to inform its not by accident but done by design on a daily basis.  https://t.co/hwR0wb1R35
1300827715478720514 2020-09-02 00:07:50 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @ricbrilha Adam is mocking CNN.👍

1300825032206188548 2020-09-01 23:57:10 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @RedNationRising @TeriN41574377 For those that don't get it he was not writing fiction he was paraphrasing history.
1300824089016270854 2020-09-01 23:53:25 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @Lrihendry Should of happened long ago and we all need to look into the mirror and need to be honest with ourselves that we were complacent at best and that freedom takes some effort!  https://t.co/ltsSb20riQ
1300822832432254976 2020-09-01 23:48:26 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @MaireeWendy @RobinEnochs @NPR Correct that is the point,I was being sarcastic and they are so willing to lie they would do so brazenly even with actual video that proves their lying.  https://t.co/yEYV8A4k8W
1300821876957159425 2020-09-01 23:44:38 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @EMRobichaux @Timcast The Leftist will buy anything which is why their so dangerous therein lies the problem and I agree the average person does not but littered throughout government especially the Judicial are people that don't care about truth@ the ends justify the means is their motto.
1300681727950585856 2020-09-01 14:27:44 +0800 <rookieuserIm> @HeshmatAlavi They are ideological idiots they don't need to have anything on them for them to be illogical and corrupt therein lies the problem.
