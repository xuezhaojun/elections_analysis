1342285480323395584 2020-12-25 09:46:11 +0800 <tckalways> @GOPChairwoman It's convenient to focus on the vaccine and not on the nearly 350,000 COVID-19 deaths because Trump couldn't be bothered to protect the American people before the vaccine and its doing nothing about the raging pandemic. You are complicit inb this perfidy.
1342189988352561152 2020-12-25 03:26:44 +0800 <tckalways> Why did you set this up as a unanimous vote when you knew Republicans would reject it?
1342181193878548483 2020-12-25 02:51:47 +0800 <tckalways> You are a disgusting POS @GOPLeader. The foreign aid you claim to re-examine was in Trump's budget that you passed. You might fool MAGAts, but the majority of  Americans know you are a filthy liar. You also voted against giving Americans the $2000 that Trump said he wanted.
1342100844116910080 2020-12-24 21:32:30 +0800 <tckalways> You are the swamp. Republicans are the enemies of democracy and the American people. You are covered in Trump's stench.

1341812048276189184 2020-12-24 02:24:56 +0800 <tckalways> Don't forget that a lot of what lies behind these pardons is Trump's overwhelming need for revenge. That's enough of a reward for Trump. That's why he just stuck it to McConnell over the "stimulus" bill.

1341793996901933056 2020-12-24 01:13:12 +0800 <tckalways> I'm sure that's what Trump intended. He's angry at McConnell.

1341589268863594500 2020-12-23 11:39:41 +0800 <tckalways> This is why people don't vote. They know the game is rigged for the rich and the rest of us keep getting poorer. I want all the taxes I've paid my entire life back. Every last dime.
1341540167660802048 2020-12-23 08:24:35 +0800 <tckalways> The Democratic party should sharpen its messaging. More importantly, they should control their messaging and not let Republicans define them. @Reverendwarnock would have done better to demand that Loeffler call him Reverend rather than let her define him as Radical Liberal.

1338172721793019907 2020-12-14 01:23:33 +0800 <tckalways> I agree. And the Republicans who participated in the sham Texas suit should be punished. The AGs should be disbarred and the 126 MOC should be censured, heavily fined and removed from leadership positions,  especially Kevin McCarthy.

1337829174988378112 2020-12-13 02:38:25 +0800 <tckalways> What Pelosi should do is censure them, levy heavy fines, and deprive them of their leadership positions,  including McCarthy -- all are within her purview. They should be punished severely. No more Mr. Nice Guy. We must crush sedition.
1337828028899086338 2020-12-13 02:33:52 +0800 <tckalways> Congressman, with all due respect, there are no Republicans of good will or good faith. 126 of your Republican colleagues, including McCarthy, signed on to the seditious Texas lawsuit. They must be punished severely because that's the only language they understand.
1337827048744685577 2020-12-13 02:29:58 +0800 <tckalways> This. The 126 members should be censured, smacked with heavy fines, and deprived of leadership positions, all within @SpeakerPelosi's purview. That goes for @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy. The only language they understand is strength.

At the very least, the 126 Republicans should be censured, fined, and stripped of committee leadership positions and seniority. The House needs to send a clear message that sedition will be punished. @RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerPelosi

1336295658458927104 2020-12-08 21:04:46 +0800 <tckalways> To think this could have been avoided if we had leadership in Washington and the states is infuriating. It's criminal negligence.
1336293368847069187 2020-12-08 20:55:40 +0800 <tckalways> You are an execrable excuse for a human being and no patriot.

1335775709579661312 2020-12-07 10:38:41 +0800 <tckalways> Why? She was an automaton who wouldn't answer questions. They're was nothing positive in her performance.

It's been 18 months and there's been only one charge: an FBI attorney altered an email to secure a warrant. Making Durham a Special Counsel is probably to pacify Trump and get him off Barr's back.

1335329688219242499 2020-12-06 05:06:21 +0800 <tckalways> Those of us who have watched the Republicans lie, cheat, gerrymander, and suppress the vote for decades are not surprised that the party has devolved into a fascist institution dedicated to white minority rule. Where have you been? This is who Republicans are.
1335327289442250757 2020-12-06 04:56:49 +0800 <tckalways> Because they would be thrilled if Trump prevailed. Republicans don't care about democracy and they haven't for at least two decades. The only thing they care about is power and the only language they understand is strength. Democrats must act accordingly.

1335323474882154499 2020-12-06 04:41:40 +0800 <tckalways> That's the idea, @JoeNBC. Republicans don't give a damn about democracy and it's time to recognize that fact. They have no principles and no scruples. After 4 years of enabling Trump every step of the way,  the @GOP has shown us who they are. Believe it.

1335310898588741634 2020-12-06 03:51:41 +0800 <tckalways> The @GOP not only accepts fascism, they enable it.

1335308063423787011 2020-12-06 03:40:25 +0800 <tckalways> We have to codify transitions to prevent this crap from happening again. I wish Biden would sue, citing national security. It would put an end to the Trump BS about the election. I can't for the life of me understand why he hasn't. Is he waiting for the Electoral College to vote?

1335284743911444480 2020-12-06 02:07:45 +0800 <tckalways> They would be more than happy if Trump were to miraculously prevail in overturning the election. That's why they're silent, not because they're afraid of Trump.
1335283584794583042 2020-12-06 02:03:09 +0800 <tckalways> Interesting point of view on how Jews who support Palestinian human rights are being attacked by Zionist Jews who are guilty of human atrocities, some of which are shown in this video.

1334684499616075777 2020-12-04 10:22:36 +0800 <tckalways> @IvankaTrump is whining like her father because she knows she's in deep do-do. All that criming is catching up to her. Here's the world's smallest violin üéª
1334647380977864705 2020-12-04 07:55:06 +0800 <tckalways> LOL
1334647144507199489 2020-12-04 07:54:10 +0800 <tckalways> Why am I not surprised?
1334646848154460161 2020-12-04 07:52:59 +0800 <tckalways> You have plenty of fodder in the Trump Administration for such a book. Jared Kushner comes to mind.
1334645086567718915 2020-12-04 07:45:59 +0800 <tckalways> You are a racist, an ignoramus and a deplorable excuse for a human being. Some things will never change...
1334644611567022081 2020-12-04 07:44:06 +0800 <tckalways> That's not a smile, it's a grimace.
1334643575892692992 2020-12-04 07:39:59 +0800 <tckalways> Fantastic
1334643428282556419 2020-12-04 07:39:24 +0800 <tckalways> Figures.
1334642590273122306 2020-12-04 07:36:04 +0800 <tckalways> The American people have failed miserably.
1334641299287371780 2020-12-04 07:30:56 +0800 <tckalways> It's about damn time.
1334635664026046464 2020-12-04 07:08:33 +0800 <tckalways> God you're a loathsome POS.
1334618379429294084 2020-12-04 05:59:52 +0800 <tckalways> This is accurate.
1334600558611664897 2020-12-04 04:49:03 +0800 <tckalways> No. N-O. No.
1334600141433688073 2020-12-04 04:47:24 +0800 <tckalways> The judges need to start invoking Rule 11 and sanction the lawyers for filing bogus suits abs wasting the courts' time.
1334576457885118467 2020-12-04 03:13:17 +0800 <tckalways> I'm afraid you're right and it's disgusting.
1334576224430137350 2020-12-04 03:12:21 +0800 <tckalways> Ineffably sad
1334575880857903107 2020-12-04 03:10:59 +0800 <tckalways> LOL
1334574357130121217 2020-12-04 03:04:56 +0800 <tckalways> You're like your lying father. Your hotel charged 5 times the market rate. If your family weren't a criminal enterprise, there wouldn't be so many investigations. Innocent people don't get investigated.
1334573633969262600 2020-12-04 03:02:04 +0800 <tckalways> There is no bottom.
1334571503988469762 2020-12-04 02:53:36 +0800 <tckalways> Thank you @ACLU

1334530196389720072 2020-12-04 00:09:27 +0800 <tckalways> This was cruel and inhumane. Someone should sue the government officials who sanctioned this horror.
1334509913524080640 2020-12-03 22:48:52 +0800 <tckalways> You were the king of divisiveness when you were Speaker. You played a big role in creating the monster that has evolved into today's Republican party and now you're eating your own. The schadenfreude is delicious.
1334484429302095873 2020-12-03 21:07:36 +0800 <tckalways> In this article there are no quotes of CNN personnel that are out of line or untrue. Saying Trump's behavior should not be normalized is not biased, it is responsible.
1334353336322183168 2020-12-03 12:26:41 +0800 <tckalways> She was so off the rails Giuliani was trying to get her to stop talking.
1334308802448003078 2020-12-03 09:29:43 +0800 <tckalways> This.
1334308696936026112 2020-12-03 09:29:18 +0800 <tckalways> Stop with the "if", you buffoon.
1334308064481189891 2020-12-03 09:26:47 +0800 <tckalways> Flynn should have gone to prison. He is promoting sedition.
1334306705774161920 2020-12-03 09:21:23 +0800 <tckalways> There is no one Trump won't shit on if they don't do his bidding. No wonder @SenateGOP are such cowards.
1334304430192291843 2020-12-03 09:12:20 +0800 <tckalways> Trump is severely mentally ill.
1334301166843408386 2020-12-03 08:59:22 +0800 <tckalways> They are two criminals who used their positions to engage in massive insider trading. They belong in jail, not the Senate. Republicans are The Swamp.
1334299246774923265 2020-12-03 08:51:45 +0800 <tckalways> This crap has got to end.
1334285295664173058 2020-12-03 07:56:18 +0800 <tckalways> Swamp Rat
1334282726783016960 2020-12-03 07:46:06 +0800 <tckalways> If you're still calling yourself a lawyer and you're filing baseless suits because you have no evidence, you're a failure and should be sanctioned under Rule 11.
1334273035227041796 2020-12-03 07:07:35 +0800 <tckalways> You're on the wrong side of history. The problem with conservatives is they do not evolve. You cannot stop progress. The names of these bases are offensive to a large number of Americans. Get the fuck over the Civil War.
1334267947876048902 2020-12-03 06:47:22 +0800 <tckalways> He should be disbarred. Period.
1334267502961029124 2020-12-03 06:45:36 +0800 <tckalways> More swampy corruption. There is no bottom with Trump.
1334267223985295361 2020-12-03 06:44:30 +0800 <tckalways> The Swamp is fetid.
1334221590955962368 2020-12-03 03:43:10 +0800 <tckalways> These people are bonkers. Just nuts.
1334219507032858624 2020-12-03 03:34:53 +0800 <tckalways> Not good
1334174964145065987 2020-12-03 00:37:53 +0800 <tckalways> Unreal
1334116821046349824 2020-12-02 20:46:51 +0800 <tckalways> You can't make this stuff up. If you didn't know better, you would think this is an SNL skit.
1333991761312673792 2020-12-02 12:29:54 +0800 <tckalways> Is this thread for real? It reads like parody.
1333990464127643649 2020-12-02 12:24:45 +0800 <tckalways> If I were your mama I'd slap some sense into you. After 4 years of the most heinous name-calling and bullying from Trump, whom you supported every step of the way, Republicans have their itty bitty feewings hurt by mean old Neera Tanden. Give me a break.
1333989529192177667 2020-12-02 12:21:02 +0800 <tckalways> I hope Congress stops this arms sale to the UAE dead in its tracks.
1333988622186516480 2020-12-02 12:17:26 +0800 <tckalways> Not surprising.
1333987683081850880 2020-12-02 12:13:42 +0800 <tckalways> @cooperchip1 I agree. Root then it and fire them. I forgot about the civil service unions. Thank goodness for them!
1333921905909379072 2020-12-02 07:52:20 +0800 <tckalways> @realDonaldTrump SO, DID BILL BARR TELL YOU THE DOJ HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING A BRIBERY FOR PARDON SCHEME AND FILED IN COURT TONIGHT? THEY HAVE EVIDENCE AND DOCUMENTS. DID YOU ACCEPT THE PAYMENT FOR THE PARDON? IF SO, YOU COMMITTED A MASSIVE CRIME.
1333919539902500866 2020-12-02 07:42:55 +0800 <tckalways> @tedcruz is the slimiest slimeball in the Senate: oily, unctuousand creepy.
1333915736516009985 2020-12-02 07:27:49 +0800 <tckalways> It's infuriating.
1333912926315556865 2020-12-02 07:16:39 +0800 <tckalways> Can't this be challenged in the courts? This is Trump unending and usurping the role of Congress.
1333845841589710851 2020-12-02 02:50:04 +0800 <tckalways> üòÄ
1333845487116554241 2020-12-02 02:48:40 +0800 <tckalways> That's not sufficient. Language like that should result in sanctions.
1333845250004176903 2020-12-02 02:47:43 +0800 <tckalways> This is not acceptable under any circumstances.
1333758272931770369 2020-12-01 21:02:06 +0800 <tckalways> This thread is illuminating.
1333628130469306368 2020-12-01 12:24:58 +0800 <tckalways> @FoxNews should be forced to forfeit its license. It is FAKE NEWS.
1333627163820613634 2020-12-01 12:21:08 +0800 <tckalways> It certainly did.
1333574625612210177 2020-12-01 08:52:22 +0800 <tckalways> What doesn't he rage about? Rage fuels and consumed him. You'd think he would implode, but evil narcissists like Trump don't.
1333574182156836866 2020-12-01 08:50:36 +0800 <tckalways> He should lose his medical license too.
1333573584715919365 2020-12-01 08:48:13 +0800 <tckalways> This is good news. May Bolsonaro suffer the same fate as Trump.
1333572465902104576 2020-12-01 08:43:47 +0800 <tckalways> I will be displaying the flag for the first time in 4 years. I refused to do so while Trump was in "office."
1333572081125089281 2020-12-01 08:42:15 +0800 <tckalways> I bet this is spot on.
1333566982604648448 2020-12-01 08:21:59 +0800 <tckalways> Excellent.
1333565360193331201 2020-12-01 08:15:32 +0800 <tckalways> Aren't they, though. Positively joyless.
1333564387542659078 2020-12-01 08:11:41 +0800 <tckalways> Just awful and so dangerous.
1333564075553546240 2020-12-01 08:10:26 +0800 <tckalways> This is madness. And sheer stupidity.
1333559591683190794 2020-12-01 07:52:37 +0800 <tckalways> @mitchellreports has a problem with consistency and deciding what's important. She should retire.
1333558909311782912 2020-12-01 07:49:54 +0800 <tckalways> @JohnCornyn What do you have to say about this? Don't criticize @neeratanden for insulting comments when Trump's allies are advocating violence.
1333555455239532545 2020-12-01 07:36:11 +0800 <tckalways> The courts need to start sanctioning the lawyers who are filing these frivolous lawsuits. Enough is enough.
1333549644094332929 2020-12-01 07:13:05 +0800 <tckalways> You really are dumb. I mean dumb.

1333488305715998721 2020-12-01 03:09:21 +0800 <tckalways> Appalling isn't a strong enough word.
1333488065298501632 2020-12-01 03:08:24 +0800 <tckalways> The House sent a damn relief bill to the Senate in May and it has languished because the Senate has failed to act. This is on you Republicans. You own the deaths and the misery.
1333487046120370177 2020-12-01 03:04:21 +0800 <tckalways> This is great news. Pai has been a terrible FCC chair.

1333232636823801858 2020-11-30 10:13:25 +0800 <tckalways> Assange is not a journalist. He's a Russian operative who loathes the United States. He's not a martyr, he's a menace.
1333200679503081479 2020-11-30 08:06:26 +0800 <tckalways> This must happen. We cannot turn a blind eye toward the crimes committed by Trump, Ivanka, Kushner, Barr and others in the administration. The message needs to be sent to the @GOP that fascists and would-be dictators will never again gain a purchase in this country.

1333158548033966088 2020-11-30 05:19:01 +0800 <tckalways> You spent an hour on the air encouraging Trump's deranged rant. *Please* stop giving this maniac a platform and spewing bullshit. *Thank you.*
1333157733336551429 2020-11-30 05:15:47 +0800 <tckalways> This is true, and the White Supremacy Party has been making us pay since. We must #FlipTheSenate and cut out the cancer.
1333157048989724679 2020-11-30 05:13:03 +0800 <tckalways> This is what right- wing derangement looks like.
1333156205146087432 2020-11-30 05:09:42 +0800 <tckalways> The DOJ should investigate your ties to Putin. What was in that message you hand-delivered from Trump to Putin?
1333155259309563911 2020-11-30 05:05:57 +0800 <tckalways> Randy @randpaul is serving his masters, Putin and Trump, by lying because he doesn't give a shit about our democracy.

1333107293492219904 2020-11-30 01:55:21 +0800 <tckalways> There is no time like the present to invoke Rule 11. After 39 dismissed cases, it's time for the courts to say enough.
1333102673198010375 2020-11-30 01:36:59 +0800 <tckalways> This must happen. I fear those records will magically disappear.

1333101607756713985 2020-11-30 01:32:45 +0800 <tckalways> You're a multimillionaire. The massive Republican tax cut benefited only the rich. Your hypocrisy is staggering. Your base is ignorant and white. Republican policies fuck them over but, wait for it, their leaders are white supremacists, just like them.
1333097888994512900 2020-11-30 01:17:59 +0800 <tckalways> I can't watch @chucktodd. He's awful.

1333084700638932994 2020-11-30 00:25:34 +0800 <tckalways> Congratulations!
1333082229933793281 2020-11-30 00:15:45 +0800 <tckalways> The results of this election were free and fair. The chaos has been caused by Trump and the Republicans. You're part of the problem @DanCrenshawTX.
1333068512596779008 2020-11-29 23:21:15 +0800 <tckalways> Thank you for this piece. It's a lovely remembrance of the magnificent Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
1333063947545681922 2020-11-29 23:03:06 +0800 <tckalways> I hope this is the first of many such suits. Trump should pay for the misery he's inflicting on the country.
1332927258672115715 2020-11-29 13:59:57 +0800 <tckalways> I feel sorrow for the nation's healthcare workers.  It's devastating.
1332926546240221185 2020-11-29 13:57:07 +0800 <tckalways> Meaning she is likely to get any position she wants. She's valuable.
1332926096434733057 2020-11-29 13:55:20 +0800 <tckalways> Yep.
1332925640161562624 2020-11-29 13:53:31 +0800 <tckalways> I fucking hate Trump.
1332921972116910081 2020-11-29 13:38:57 +0800 <tckalways> Not one word of this long article is surprising. Trump is pathological and delusional.
1332895966463188995 2020-11-29 11:55:37 +0800 <tckalways> You people are 1-39. You keep losing because you have no evidence.The only ones playing a ridiculous political game are the Trump campaign lawyers. Time to dust Rule 11 off and slap sanctions on you shysters.
1332894667680206849 2020-11-29 11:50:27 +0800 <tckalways> Like the transparency you demanded from Trump. Give me a break.
1332826116709552132 2020-11-29 07:18:03 +0800 <tckalways> This is a bullshit lede, just like the stupid PBS lede that said Biden's picks may have a hard time getting confirmed because they're elite. The MSM are looking for scandals where there are none and playing right into Republican hands. I'm so sick of it.
1332822231160860672 2020-11-29 07:02:37 +0800 <tckalways> Excellent news! Cats rule!

1332817426564657152 2020-11-29 06:43:31 +0800 <tckalways> This couldn't be worse. Eternal shame on Republican governors who are letting the virus rampage through their states.

1332752661007970306 2020-11-29 02:26:10 +0800 <tckalways> This is a lie. They're had been zero evidence that the election in PA or anywhere else has been compromised. Trump has lost 38 lawsuits because he's presented no evidence of fraud. Stop the bullshit.
1332746856842080256 2020-11-29 02:03:06 +0800 <tckalways> Wow. Let's just be blatantly racist and attack Ebenezer Baptist Church.
1332745929296912386 2020-11-29 01:59:25 +0800 <tckalways> Yes, moron. It's called a free and fair election and your father lost.
1332745648270168067 2020-11-29 01:58:18 +0800 <tckalways> Who cares? Stop with the Trump coverage. He's not news, he's history.
1332745363439181824 2020-11-29 01:57:10 +0800 <tckalways> If they leave and have no residual interest in the fund, there are no ethical issues. This is bullshit, trying to find scandal where there isn't any. After the most corrupt administration in history, this is a bridge too far. This is why people disdain the media.

1332425091641118720 2020-11-28 04:44:31 +0800 <tckalways> I agree. @staceyabrams would be phenomenal as DNC Chair but is that what she wants? If she delivers Georgia, she can write her own ticket.

1332416049778749442 2020-11-28 04:08:36 +0800 <tckalways> The irony is selfish assholes like you don't give a shit about the nation's healthcare workers and adding to their burden when they've been overworked and stretched to the limit for nearly a year. Clapton is a racist and Van Morrison is a creep, so naturally you support them.
1332415141682548738 2020-11-28 04:04:59 +0800 <tckalways> Selfishness knows no bounds for old and useless rockers. Has anyone asked them how they feel about overworked, stretched-to-the-max healthcare workers?
1332414543897767937 2020-11-28 04:02:36 +0800 <tckalways> These measures must be reversed by @JoeBiden

1332384765379567616 2020-11-28 02:04:17 +0800 <tckalways> Hahahaha! Trump appointed the Third Circuit judge who threw out your case because it was meritless. It's time judges start sanctioning you under Rule 11 for filing frivolous lawsuits and wasting their time. You and Giuliani aren't lawyers, you're hacks who should be disbarred.

1332359416130179072 2020-11-28 00:23:33 +0800 <tckalways> This assessment makes the most sense. Israel did it with Trump's blessing/complicity.
1332358929507028993 2020-11-28 00:21:37 +0800 <tckalways> And just why are the lines so massive? Because Senate Republithugs refuse to help the American people. This is on you, creep.
1332355214620446722 2020-11-28 00:06:51 +0800 <tckalways> It's tiresome. Report the facts, not euphemisms. *Somewhat divisive*? *petty at times*? Trump is always divisive and always petty. We've seen it every day for years.

They can take their *elite* and shove it where the sun don't shine. After the trash that served in the Trump Administration, the Senate has no room to talk.

1331036744733642754 2020-11-24 08:47:44 +0800 <tckalways> The rules need to change. No majority leader should ever have the power McConnell has assumed.

1330650775727575046 2020-11-23 07:14:01 +0800 <tckalways> Wow. The Trump *team* is disintegrating.
1330635700681793536 2020-11-23 06:14:07 +0800 <tckalways> This.
1330583823621513219 2020-11-23 02:47:59 +0800 <tckalways> It's getting to all of us.
1330582823766548482 2020-11-23 02:44:00 +0800 <tckalways>  https://t.co/tmq39nzjeT
1330580345280991235 2020-11-23 02:34:09 +0800 <tckalways> That's the definition of entitlement.
1330564642377248770 2020-11-23 01:31:46 +0800 <tckalways> This is so dangerous
1330559248288329729 2020-11-23 01:10:20 +0800 <tckalways> This is a shameful lede and headline.
1330558743441010688 2020-11-23 01:08:19 +0800 <tckalways> 34 judges have thrown your lawsuits out of court, shyster. They should start sanctioning you under Rule 11 for wasting their time and you,  Sidney Powell and Giuliani should be disbarred.
1330557122178920449 2020-11-23 01:01:53 +0800 <tckalways> I've been screaming this. The failure to fight back is seen by the #AntiDemocracyParty as weakness and they will exploit it. The only thing they understand is strength. Investigate, prosecute and convict Trump administration officials and their enablers in Congress.
1330556358010265600 2020-11-23 00:58:50 +0800 <tckalways> Republicans are now the #AntiDemocracyParty. You're the reason the country is so divided.  You live by the rule "No election is over until we eliminate ballots from black voters in swing states and cheat and steal our way to victory."  Damn you to hell.
1330554559559847937 2020-11-23 00:51:42 +0800 <tckalways> So what? Your tweet is obnoxious. Another male criticizing a woman for being ambitious.
1330517341382258694 2020-11-22 22:23:48 +0800 <tckalways> Chinatown may be well-intentioned, but he is naive and misjudges Trump supporters. A pardon will not change their loyalty, nor make them disposed to support Biden and unify. The only thing they understand is strength. Fight them, one and all. Prosecute Trump and his enablers.
1330515649895010311 2020-11-22 22:17:05 +0800 <tckalways> Netanyahu is Israel's Trump. He's a would-be dictator in a world of legal trouble. I will never forgive him for his profound disrespect toward President Obama. He's another Republican criminal.
1330511458405392387 2020-11-22 22:00:26 +0800 <tckalways> Liar. The suit was without merit. It's one of nearly 30 that has been laughed out of court. Judicial Watch is *nakedly political* and you're a Supreme hack.
1330307294953934849 2020-11-22 08:29:09 +0800 <tckalways> Biden can sue.i don't understand why he doesn't. He's letting Trump and the Republicans steamroll him because of this foolish pursuit of unity. You know what the Republicans see? Weakness. Fighting back is the only thing they understand.
1330303555698388992 2020-11-22 08:14:18 +0800 <tckalways> Who got the last laugh @JennaEllisEsq? The judge threw the court case out and said what you were attempting was unconstitutional. You should all be disbarred.
1330297809556434947 2020-11-22 07:51:28 +0800 <tckalways> No he doesn't. The Pfizer vaccine was developed independently. Trump let more than 250,000 Americans die on his watch because he did nothing to stop the virus that is rampaging through the country. Give me a break.

1330253022707003405 2020-11-22 04:53:30 +0800 <tckalways> This is a good thread.
1330252061078904835 2020-11-22 04:49:40 +0800 <tckalways> Snowden and Assange deserve long prison terms and you're a disgusting hack.
1330245418106687492 2020-11-22 04:23:17 +0800 <tckalways> This is why we need to reform police departments nationwide. They are riddled with white supremacists.
1330217566619504641 2020-11-22 02:32:36 +0800 <tckalways> This.

1330214578454732801 2020-11-22 02:20:44 +0800 <tckalways> Sidney Powell is a shameless liar who should be disbarred, along with Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis.
1330214112673079298 2020-11-22 02:18:53 +0800 <tckalways> Two insider trading criminals running for reelection. If yours wasn't a dirty party, you would be drummed out of the Senate.
1330212826355556352 2020-11-22 02:13:46 +0800 <tckalways> Wow!
1330212389837561857 2020-11-22 02:12:02 +0800 <tckalways> The Trump administration has bullied, abused and terrorized the country but @IvankaTrump thinks she's being harassed. Honestly, the law is catching up to the Trump crime family and she's afraid because they will finally be held accountable.
1330211623059992586 2020-11-22 02:08:59 +0800 <tckalways> @PressSec is an abominable, hateful person. She has neither conscience nor a soul to lie the way she does.
1330210485476749314 2020-11-22 02:04:28 +0800 <tckalways> It's appalling. So much for law and order.
1330210041920708613 2020-11-22 02:02:42 +0800 <tckalways> I think this is true.
1330208501583515650 2020-11-22 01:56:35 +0800 <tckalways> Don't ponder. Do it.
1330208375662120964 2020-11-22 01:56:05 +0800 <tckalways> What a difference a day makes.
1330206993290829824 2020-11-22 01:50:35 +0800 <tckalways> It is a delight to see young people engaged in the process. They give me hope for the future.
1330177872091340800 2020-11-21 23:54:52 +0800 <tckalways> Every last one of them should be arrested. I'm sick and tired of this crap.
1330177437267877890 2020-11-21 23:53:09 +0800 <tckalways> It's time for social media to aggressively revive these people from their platforms.
1330177130127355904 2020-11-21 23:51:55 +0800 <tckalways> Good
1330144865515147269 2020-11-21 21:43:43 +0800 <tckalways> That would be poetic justice.
1329993209322369024 2020-11-21 11:41:05 +0800 <tckalways> This is not harassment. It's a legitimate investigation spurred by your family's extensive criming. It is called karma @IvankaTrump
1329980911933386754 2020-11-21 10:52:13 +0800 <tckalways> Mr. President-elect, do not start out from a position of weakness.  Republicans will eat you alive. You have a prosecutor on your team. SUE the Trump campaign, the GSA and the RNC. Get tough, for God's sake.
1329959642303238144 2020-11-21 09:27:42 +0800 <tckalways> Figures.
1329959435448569858 2020-11-21 09:26:53 +0800 <tckalways> You're being laughed out of the courts. You are aiding and abetting Trump to scam his supporters and line his pockets. But then you did say Trump's supporters don't care about facts and logic.
1329955297344049153 2020-11-21 09:10:26 +0800 <tckalways> Yes!
1329954089782947840 2020-11-21 09:05:39 +0800 <tckalways> Absolutely. It should be free to investigate members of Congress too.
1329953657308246017 2020-11-21 09:03:55 +0800 <tckalways> The entire Republican party is a criminal cabal.
1329952723832369153 2020-11-21 09:00:13 +0800 <tckalways> Jose Andres should receive the Medal of Freedom.
1329949328052547584 2020-11-21 08:46:43 +0800 <tckalways> I'm told evangelicals bailed him out because nothing says I love Jesus like bailing out a murderer.
1329948839487397890 2020-11-21 08:44:47 +0800 <tckalways> @IvankaTrump is sweating in public. Usually butter wouldn't melt in her saccharine mouth and now her Trumpian colors are coming out. Smell her fear and relish it. Karma is famously a bitch, Ivanka.
1329946160681914368 2020-11-21 08:34:08 +0800 <tckalways> lol
1329945353328746500 2020-11-21 08:30:56 +0800 <tckalways> Too effing bad @GSAEmily. You can remedy this with your signature, but you won't because you're in Trump's pocket and hate democracy. Everyone knows who you are and that you're harming our country. No sympathy for you, just derision.
1329943218071494659 2020-11-21 08:22:26 +0800 <tckalways> So sad.
1329942540615901190 2020-11-21 08:19:45 +0800 <tckalways> He's a public figure. HIPAA doesn't apply, Dumbass. God you're stupid.
1329937849186181120 2020-11-21 08:01:06 +0800 <tckalways> Hahahaha! I'm not gracious enough to wish you a speedy recovery. My hope is that you find out how devastating COVID-19 is and that you'll have a come to Jesus moment. But I won't hold my breath. Evil is as evil does.
1329936697753276422 2020-11-21 07:56:32 +0800 <tckalways> Absolutely. Hes milking it as long as he can, the shyster.
1329935664431951873 2020-11-21 07:52:26 +0800 <tckalways> It's because he can't get a lawyer worth a damn.
1329934960313192448 2020-11-21 07:49:38 +0800 <tckalways> @kaitlancollins should have replied "I'm an activist like you're a press secretary."
1329928408734834688 2020-11-21 07:23:36 +0800 <tckalways> A detailed thread.
1329927902075494400 2020-11-21 07:21:35 +0800 <tckalways> Just great
1329916016961482754 2020-11-21 06:34:21 +0800 <tckalways> NO WAY! THIS IS EXACTLY THE WRONG MOVE AND WILL BE PERCEIVED AS WEAKNESS BY THE REPUBLICANS. SUE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THE RNC FOR INTERFERING WITH THE ELECTION RESULTS AND DENYING YOU ACCESS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR YOUR TRANSITION. AND YES, I AM SHOUTING.
1329914770829545476 2020-11-21 06:29:24 +0800 <tckalways> @sendavidperdue should be prosecuted for insider trading.
1329895945631305737 2020-11-21 05:14:36 +0800 <tckalways> Who the hell bailed him out?
1329895527991959552 2020-11-21 05:12:56 +0800 <tckalways> Thank you @BrianKarem. You are doing the right thing.
1329891362620252163 2020-11-21 04:56:23 +0800 <tckalways> @GeraldoRivera It would be more appropriate to name the virus after Trump. FFS, no losing candidate has ever behaved this way with a week's long temper tantrum and you want to "soften the blow"? Go soak your head.
1329890619834175495 2020-11-21 04:53:26 +0800 <tckalways> Vomit.
1329889492774363147 2020-11-21 04:48:57 +0800 <tckalways> Same here
1329887684433735680 2020-11-21 04:41:46 +0800 <tckalways> That's why he's dragging this out. He's lining his coffers and his supporters are too stupid to realize it.
1329796555847688192 2020-11-20 22:39:39 +0800 <tckalways> This is irresponsible and stupid.
1329770775063240707 2020-11-20 20:57:13 +0800 <tckalways> This is correct. Republicans view the silence and inaction as weakness. @DNC and @JoeBiden should sue the Trump campaign and loudly condemn the #AntiDemocracyParty.
1329642951086108672 2020-11-20 12:29:17 +0800 <tckalways> Fire their asses.
1329638403999150083 2020-11-20 12:11:13 +0800 <tckalways> Keystone Kop lawyers.
1329638181285863424 2020-11-20 12:10:20 +0800 <tckalways> You are outnumbered and the true patriots in this country will crush you like cockroaches. You are the #AntiDemocracyParty and we're taking our country back from you dirty fascists. May you all rot in jail for the rest of your evil lives.
1329591866724143106 2020-11-20 09:06:18 +0800 <tckalways> Unfortunately, unless you can shut down Fox News, OANN, Sinclair, Limbaugh, Breitbart, the Federalist, Facebook, Parler and other right-wing propaganda outlets it will be impossible to deprogram them. The only thing they understand is strength. Peosecute their leaders.
1329587129622671363 2020-11-20 08:47:28 +0800 <tckalways> It's long past time to put an end to this crap @JoeBiden. Sue. Now.
1329579385393909760 2020-11-20 08:16:42 +0800 <tckalways> Congratulations!
1329579042660560899 2020-11-20 08:15:20 +0800 <tckalways> Oh hell no
1329577200576831492 2020-11-20 08:08:01 +0800 <tckalways> Unreal. Take out a whole county and we win.
1329575715470237697 2020-11-20 08:02:07 +0800 <tckalways> The Republicans haven't had a new idea or better argument  in 50 years.
1329575256399474690 2020-11-20 08:00:18 +0800 <tckalways> Jesus
1329574316711800838 2020-11-20 07:56:34 +0800 <tckalways> It's a coup. What the hell?
1329570470077853697 2020-11-20 07:41:16 +0800 <tckalways> The end, I hope.
1329568558200877063 2020-11-20 07:33:41 +0800 <tckalways> Horrific.
1329568423102337025 2020-11-20 07:33:08 +0800 <tckalways> Of course
1329568345767763968 2020-11-20 07:32:50 +0800 <tckalways> This.
1329568190276440069 2020-11-20 07:32:13 +0800 <tckalways> This is insurrection, an attempted coup. It's unconstitutional on its face. Time for @JoeBiden to sue.
1329567008556544002 2020-11-20 07:27:31 +0800 <tckalways> Not a good look to put Emmanuel in the Cabinet @JoeBiden

1329565688822894597 2020-11-20 07:22:17 +0800 <tckalways> He's keeping the contributions coming in not to pay off debt, but to line his coffers as long as he can. it's a classic Trump scam.
1329565185858826243 2020-11-20 07:20:17 +0800 <tckalways> What was dripping down his face? Hair coloring?
1329564869478264834 2020-11-20 07:19:01 +0800 <tckalways> Without  question. There is no understanding ignorance, racism and stupidity. You have to outgun them with huge numbers. This is a fight for the long haul.
1329563876464209928 2020-11-20 07:15:04 +0800 <tckalways> WTF?! Where have you been? Your leader @senatemajldr has been single-handedly preventing any stimulus bill from passing. You're a day late and a dollar short, creep
1329562931898552323 2020-11-20 07:11:19 +0800 <tckalways> Not good.
1329562397548421124 2020-11-20 07:09:12 +0800 <tckalways> Republicans have become the #AntiDemocracyParty and we should treat them accordingly. The die is cast. The @GOP doesn't give a damn about the Constitution or democracy.

1329557447799943173 2020-11-20 06:49:32 +0800 <tckalways> You're an embarrassment to the legal profession. Your little shindig this afternoon was pure propaganda.
1329537742259294216 2020-11-20 05:31:14 +0800 <tckalways> It's not people in the media, @marcorubio. They are merely reporting what is happening. The majority of Americans don't like Republicans because you have become the #AntiDemocracyParty.
1329537039956635649 2020-11-20 05:28:26 +0800 <tckalways> This is on Trump and the @GOP. It's utterly contemptible.
1329536645205528576 2020-11-20 05:26:52 +0800 <tckalways> It would have been funny if it weren't so awful.
1329536420550152199 2020-11-20 05:25:58 +0800 <tckalways> Such crap. This isn't a matter for the courts. Biden won. Period.

1329497946447024128 2020-11-20 02:53:05 +0800 <tckalways> This is total bullshit and a tacit admission they don't have evidence.
1329497458494369794 2020-11-20 02:51:09 +0800 <tckalways> I agree. And why isn't Biden suing?
1329497281117237251 2020-11-20 02:50:27 +0800 <tckalways> @JennaEllisEsq YOU ARE ACTIVELY SUBVERTING DEMOCRACY AND UNDERMINING THE FREE AND FAIR ELECTION. MAY YOU BE IMPRISONED.
1329496743680020484 2020-11-20 02:48:19 +0800 <tckalways> This cannot stand. It's time to sue the hell out of the Trump Campaign @JoeBiden
1329496327814860800 2020-11-20 02:46:40 +0800 <tckalways> Wow
1329496149531693060 2020-11-20 02:45:57 +0800 <tckalways> Exactly

1329494644460281858 2020-11-20 02:39:58 +0800 <tckalways> They're all nuts and crooked as hell. There is no Republican party, only the #AntiDemocracyParty

1329240349034897409 2020-11-19 09:49:29 +0800 <tckalways> No pity for @GSAEmily. She's not doing her job and she's endangering the nation. May she suffer until she does the right damned thing. This isn't hard.
1329238099914842113 2020-11-19 09:40:33 +0800 <tckalways> Yes and it must be done. The  Independent Prosecutor should investigate members of Congress as well. The #AntiDemocracyParty must understand that we will not tolerate their crimes. If we fail to go after them, they will interpret it as weakness and exploit it. #NeverAgain
1329237026328125440 2020-11-19 09:36:17 +0800 <tckalways> Why are he and Loeffler in the Senate? They're criminals.
1329235439715291147 2020-11-19 09:29:59 +0800 <tckalways> @marcorubio is a member of the #AntiDemocracyParty, and therefore has no standing. He should move to the Philippines or Brazil where fascists are in power. We just took back our country.
1329234663848767491 2020-11-19 09:26:54 +0800 <tckalways> Good question.

1329201608962560006 2020-11-19 07:15:33 +0800 <tckalways> It's unforgivable. I hope Trump rots in jail for the rest of his life.
1329145350851014656 2020-11-19 03:32:00 +0800 <tckalways> @AdamKinzinger maybe if Congressional Republicans had the cojones to recognize Joe Biden as the president- elect, Trump would stop sabotaging our health and national security and be forced to cave. You couldn't be a more pathetic #AntiDemocracyParty.
1329143435685748739 2020-11-19 03:24:24 +0800 <tckalways> @C_3C_3 Bullshit
1329043449467826182 2020-11-18 20:47:05 +0800 <tckalways> Yes, and their enablers in Congress too. Graham should be the first.
1329043244089532419 2020-11-18 20:46:16 +0800 <tckalways> I agree. I've  read a few op eds  advocating for Biden to pardon Trump as a way to heal the political divide. Nonsense. It would be weakness that the #AntiDemocracyParty would exploit. Look what they're doing now by failing to acknowledge Biden won. Investigate and prosecute.

1328866413902245892 2020-11-18 09:03:36 +0800 <tckalways> We cannot let our guard down. Republicans are the #AntiDemocracyParty and it is not going to change. They will dispute every election they don't win.
1328864197174829056 2020-11-18 08:54:48 +0800 <tckalways> Exactly.
1328863706852319232 2020-11-18 08:52:51 +0800 <tckalways> Republicans across the country do not care about our democracy. They are the #AntiDemocracyParty and should be labeled such.

1328852757747539969 2020-11-18 08:09:20 +0800 <tckalways> Because they're trying to nullify the black votes from Detroit. It doesn't get more corrupt than this and you should lose your license to practice law, shyster.

1328848923319005186 2020-11-18 07:54:06 +0800 <tckalways> This is an American tragedy that didn't need to happen. I'll never forgive Trump and the #AntiDemocracyParty for this.
1328846405281132546 2020-11-18 07:44:06 +0800 <tckalways> Terrifying.

1328842834783375361 2020-11-18 07:29:55 +0800 <tckalways> The rank stupidity of this question beggars belief. One means hundreds of thousands will die while vaccines will prevent illness and death. Why does this have to be explained? @RandPaul, you're a moron.

1328505284659122177 2020-11-17 09:08:36 +0800 <tckalways> Graham should be censured, but of course he won't be. The Anti-Democracy party won't do anything about it.

1328027376895340544 2020-11-16 01:29:34 +0800 <tckalways> Starr was talking about millions of voters "feeling disenfranchised" to justify the specious Trump litigation. By that non-legal reasoning, Hillary and every losing candidate should have litigated the shit out of the election results. Starr is and always has been a legal hack.
1328021458442985473 2020-11-16 01:06:03 +0800 <tckalways> Because Joe Biden won. A majority of legitimately and fairly voted for Biden. Get real and stop living in your right-wing fantasy bubble.
1328019074174087169 2020-11-16 00:56:35 +0800 <tckalways> The Republican party was headed in this direction before Trump. Since the 70's, winning has been everything to them, democracy and fair play be damned, all in the service of preserving the White male patriarchy. The Fox/Limbaugh/Federalist etc. disinformation media stoke it.

1327686294256955396 2020-11-15 02:54:14 +0800 <tckalways> Your statement isn't worth the paper it's printed on. You're a disgraceful excuse for a public servant, lying to your constituents and the country. The election was free and fair. Trump has lost every law suit because they are meritless. There was NO VOTER FRAUD.
1327682587272372224 2020-11-15 02:39:30 +0800 <tckalways> Project Veritas people belong in jail. I hope the court throws the book at them.
1327681835430780929 2020-11-15 02:36:31 +0800 <tckalways> "The Trump campaign keeps hoping it will find a judge that treats lawsuits like tweets," said Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law School professor and elections law expert, on Friday. "Repeatedly, every person with a robe they've encountered has said, 'I'm sorry, we do law here."

1327667682259374080 2020-11-15 01:40:16 +0800 <tckalways> I agree with you. But #2 is going to be very tough to achieve. The dismantling of the Fairness Doctrine gave rise to the right-wing disinformation media. How do you put that genie back in the bottle without violating the 1st Amendment? How do you combat ubiquitous propaganda?

1327665910904184833 2020-11-15 01:33:14 +0800 <tckalways> This column is the very definition of hagiography, folks. What tripe.
1327659195840204801 2020-11-15 01:06:33 +0800 <tckalways> I'm sorry I didn't see this tweet sooner. It defies belief that white women voted for Trump. The only two explanations I can conceive are they're pro-life proponents and women who are invested in preserving the White male patriarchy, i.e. racists. It is mortifying.

1327640086494781442 2020-11-14 23:50:37 +0800 <tckalways> *legally dubious* Honest to God. It's blatantly illegal and wouldn't stand up in court. It cannot be construed as anything other than tampering with an election to change the outcome. It's an attempted coup, and that's what it should be called.
1327617914111975424 2020-11-14 22:22:31 +0800 <tckalways> It's astounding that Alabamans traded a stalwart, intelligent and good man like Doug Jones for this absolute idiot. God help us all.

1327422557381943296 2020-11-14 09:26:14 +0800 <tckalways> What a moron. It's criminal that Alabama traded in a stellar person like @DougJones for this yahoo.
1327420887885295617 2020-11-14 09:19:36 +0800 <tckalways> This is sanctioning crime and must not stand. Police officers who commit crimes  should be prosecuted like Any other citizen. Period.

1327379382000898048 2020-11-14 06:34:40 +0800 <tckalways> It would not be surprising.
1327379080774299649 2020-11-14 06:33:29 +0800 <tckalways> Counterdemonstrators should stay away. No good can come of this.

1327364402106994691 2020-11-14 05:35:09 +0800 <tckalways> Someone needs to get through to this guy that it's over.

1327337900174929930 2020-11-14 03:49:50 +0800 <tckalways> Cool.
1327336984021438464 2020-11-14 03:46:12 +0800 <tckalways> Donald Trump was born aggrieved. He has the largest chip on his shoulder of anyone in the planet, and the greatest sense of entitlement.  He's abused us long enough.
1327334754618912769 2020-11-14 03:37:20 +0800 <tckalways> The sheer stupidity.
1327334313105428481 2020-11-14 03:35:35 +0800 <tckalways> So now he regrets it. Well that horse left the barn a long time ago. There is no forgiving the damage he caused.
1327330608788492288 2020-11-14 03:20:52 +0800 <tckalways> In other words, Trump is a delusional asshole who won't do what all his predecessors in history have done, concede graciously and effect a peaceful transfer of power.
1327328535241953285 2020-11-14 03:12:38 +0800 <tckalways> I can't believe this guy still has a job.

1327068691289296897 2020-11-13 10:00:06 +0800 <tckalways> You will be history in a couple of months, thank God. Your policies have done nothing to help Americans. Getting rid of Net Neutrality was a terrible move. Good riddance to arrogant rubbish.
1327067164680065027 2020-11-13 09:54:02 +0800 <tckalways> This thread. Samuel Alito is a rank partisan with out-of- the- mainstream views. He's an ideologue, and that is dangerous.

1327028936736448518 2020-11-13 07:22:08 +0800 <tckalways> @Facebook is trash. Period.
1327027314312417285 2020-11-13 07:15:41 +0800 <tckalways> Why don't Republicans want to act like adults and accept that Trump lost? You assholes are why this country is so divided.
1327024814155067393 2020-11-13 07:05:45 +0800 <tckalways> Bullshit. Labeling the GOP racist fascists is more accurate than accusing democrats of being socialists.
1327022581690544129 2020-11-13 06:56:53 +0800 <tckalways> Senseless.
1327021867090259975 2020-11-13 06:54:02 +0800 <tckalways> Just great.
1326981731585560578 2020-11-13 04:14:33 +0800 <tckalways> I don't give a damn. Just get him out of there. Honest to God, are there no adults in the room.
1326981412017348608 2020-11-13 04:13:17 +0800 <tckalways> Sounds about right.

1326678529975652353 2020-11-12 08:09:44 +0800 <tckalways> You should provide context. The courts would not support such a move.
1326676025883971585 2020-11-12 07:59:47 +0800 <tckalways> Oh please @marcorubio. Your party won't diversify because your white base won't tolerate it. The GOP has talked like this before. Nothing has come of it. Also, the GOP hasn't had a new idea in 50 years. How are you going to attract minorities to your whites- only party.
1326665696072388616 2020-11-12 07:18:44 +0800 <tckalways> If they do this, I don't see how it can be upheld in court. Also,  I fucking hate Republicans.
1326658637876621312 2020-11-12 06:50:42 +0800 <tckalways> @johnrobertsFox That's utter BS and you know it. So fanning the flames. It's so irresponsible.

1326329522246082560 2020-11-11 09:02:54 +0800 <tckalways> So much for American exceptionalism. I never want to hear that phrase again.
1326329033987149825 2020-11-11 09:00:58 +0800 <tckalways> If you wanted to unify the country, you would congratulate President-elect Biden and ask Trump to concede graciously. But you won't because it would be the right thing to do and you don't give a shit about the country.
1326328352811184129 2020-11-11 08:58:15 +0800 <tckalways> @LindseyGrahamSC is a worthless POS.

1326318809372889089 2020-11-11 08:20:20 +0800 <tckalways> I would buy the book for the pleasure of burning it in a ritual ceremony.

1326246879210901504 2020-11-11 03:34:31 +0800 <tckalways> Revenge. That's all Trump wants. It fuels him. That's why he's so dangerous.
1326246240582045697 2020-11-11 03:31:58 +0800 <tckalways> I'd love to be first to wipe that smirk off his ugly mug.

1326013922353274886 2020-11-10 12:08:49 +0800 <tckalways> @realDonaldTrump Hey Trump. Here's your voter fraud in Pennsylvania, you son of a bitch.
1326012460797661184 2020-11-10 12:03:01 +0800 <tckalways> They should file a flurry of law suits now. There's no time to waste.
1326011453086773251 2020-11-10 11:59:01 +0800 <tckalways> Wtf. Why?
1326010596077281280 2020-11-10 11:55:36 +0800 <tckalways> Hahahaha! The Navajo Nation put Biden on top in AZ, loser.
1326010035667918848 2020-11-10 11:53:23 +0800 <tckalways> Might as well. He wanted one down on the border filled with alligators and snakes , so it makes perfect sense to enhance security at the White  House with a moat to go with his new wall.
1325997590983401473 2020-11-10 11:03:56 +0800 <tckalways> No they won't. I hope judges start invoking Rule #11: Under¬†Rule 11, there is an affirmative duty to investigate both as to law and as to fact before a complaint is filed. ...¬†or risk triggering sanctions against the offending parties and their attorneys.
1325962461456048128 2020-11-10 08:44:20 +0800 <tckalways> If you've been hearing it for a lifetime, your sources of information are fake news. You've got fingers, I presume. Google the statistics on voter fraud in the U.S. Shyster.
1325959412448694272 2020-11-10 08:32:13 +0800 <tckalways> @senatemajldr May you be haunted by your evil every remaining day of your miserable life. May you suffer as you have made millions of Americans suffer.
1325957377791844353 2020-11-10 08:24:08 +0800 <tckalways> I'm no lawyer, but this garbage should be tossed out of court.

1325942372400848898 2020-11-10 07:24:31 +0800 <tckalways> Lawsuits should start flying from the Biden camp. There is no time to waste.

1325840306802135043 2020-11-10 00:38:56 +0800 <tckalways> It's a mystery. The only explanation I can fathom is that they're racists and just as invested in preserving the white male patriarchy as white men are.

1325548149260300293 2020-11-09 05:18:00 +0800 <tckalways> This thread is spot on. @AOC has become arrogant, thinking she has all the answers. She would do well to keep a lower profile for awhile. Bashing her fellow Democrats is not going to win her friends and influence people.
1325546602593968131 2020-11-09 05:11:52 +0800 <tckalways> This.
1325544880328892419 2020-11-09 05:05:01 +0800 <tckalways> Fake newspaper. Trump propaganda bullshit. Get your facts straight. The deficits Trump has to overcome in recounts are insurmountable. It's over. Biden won.
1325541609304363014 2020-11-09 04:52:01 +0800 <tckalways> He's got COVID-19. What else could it be?
1325541328013438976 2020-11-09 04:50:54 +0800 <tckalways> This must not happen. Electors should be warned that switching their votes cannot occur.
1325538658993266695 2020-11-09 04:40:18 +0800 <tckalways> Naturally, because everything about the Trump campaign and administration is a lie.
1325537697868484613 2020-11-09 04:36:29 +0800 <tckalways> The dismantling of The Fairness Doctrine unleashed Rush Limbaugh &amp; his ilk to fill the airwaves with lies, propaganda and vitriol. There is no putting the genie back in the bottle so how do we penetrate the right-wing media &amp; reach its audience? That's the question for the ages.
1325537697059004417 2020-11-09 04:36:28 +0800 <tckalways> The country can't unite when half lives in reality and the other half lives in conspiracy theories steeped in racism. This has never been about policy. It's been about the self-perpetuating perniciousness of the disinformation bubble and a woefully ignorant electorate. 2/
1325537696366940169 2020-11-09 04:36:28 +0800 <tckalways> Uniting the country is a lofty goal but it cannot be obtained with policy. Until the disinformation bubble of right-wing propaganda is burst, the divide will be perpetuated. 1/
1325530185173700608 2020-11-09 04:06:37 +0800 <tckalways> Words matter. Reform should have been the term from the outset. Defund was misleading and loaded.
1325528727338561537 2020-11-09 04:00:50 +0800 <tckalways> This. Must. Not. Happen.
1325527227178618880 2020-11-09 03:54:52 +0800 <tckalways> That's what's happened @FLOTUS, and the American people voted for Joe Biden. They're has been zero evidence of fraud, zero. The 9 specious lawsuits your husband's campaign has filed have been thrown out of court. Enjoy your last 10 weeks in the White House.
1325524172135690243 2020-11-09 03:42:44 +0800 <tckalways> Thank you.
1325522178536845317 2020-11-09 03:34:49 +0800 <tckalways> The ground game is just as important, if not more important, than leveraging the internet. It's not either or.
1325521146092134400 2020-11-09 03:30:42 +0800 <tckalways> The writer, Margaret Sullivan, cites examples of excellent journalism during the Trump years, but doesn't go far enough in condemning the normalization of Trump by the media. They didn't cut through the nose and were way to slow to defend against the fake news allegations.
1325513497162240000 2020-11-09 03:00:19 +0800 <tckalways> This is lovely.

1325490629527412736 2020-11-09 01:29:27 +0800 <tckalways> This.
1325490397443989504 2020-11-09 01:28:31 +0800 <tckalways> @WhipClyburn is right, and not the first to make that point. @RepSpanberger said the terms "defund" the police and "socialism" nearly cost her her reelection. Democrats need to understand that words matter.
1325488486879793152 2020-11-09 01:20:56 +0800 <tckalways> No, @megynkelly cannot do better. This is who she is, a sanctimonious, shallow hypocrite and a resentful has- been.
1325487403075825666 2020-11-09 01:16:37 +0800 <tckalways> There's nothing to negotiate. He can't hold the presidency hostage. He's out, whether there is a normal transfer of power or he has to be arrested and dragged out of the White House. He's desperate and has no cards to play.
1325441110248927232 2020-11-08 22:12:40 +0800 <tckalways> Sucks to lose, doesn't it? üòÖü§£üòÜüòÇ
1325389001688305665 2020-11-08 18:45:37 +0800 <tckalways> They're happy to throw Trump and people like you to the gutter from whence you came. Good riddance.
1325289179354423301 2020-11-08 12:08:57 +0800 <tckalways> Very nice!
1325288767322640385 2020-11-08 12:07:19 +0800 <tckalways> We have.

1325267875259625472 2020-11-08 10:44:18 +0800 <tckalways> Definitely.
1325266749193936897 2020-11-08 10:39:49 +0800 <tckalways> No kidding!
1325264163988516866 2020-11-08 10:29:33 +0800 <tckalways> Joe Biden won fair and square. The American people have spoken and baseless lawsuits won't change a damned thing. Also, just fuck off.
1325263158957776896 2020-11-08 10:25:33 +0800 <tckalways> Clogging the courts with  baseless suits will not win any favours from judges. He's  already been repudiated 9 times because there's no evidence of fraud or irregularities. So take your sanctimoniousness and shove it where the sun don't shine. We're sick to death of you.
1325260444416741378 2020-11-08 10:14:46 +0800 <tckalways> @DTWIESE I thought this was hilarious. " It's really chill here because everybody's stoned."
1325241261167620096 2020-11-08 08:58:33 +0800 <tckalways> What legacy? It's already garbage. He's the most corrupt, racist and venal man ever to hold the office. His legacy is cruelty, chaos, indifference to suffering and misery. There's nothing left to tarnish.
1325239011988942849 2020-11-08 08:49:36 +0800 <tckalways> Worth watching
1325236852723490818 2020-11-08 08:41:02 +0800 <tckalways> Because they're wearing masks, assholes.
1325235077534666759 2020-11-08 08:33:58 +0800 <tckalways> This.
1325234627406139393 2020-11-08 08:32:11 +0800 <tckalways> *If* The legal challenges so far have been bogus and thrown out of court. He just wants to prolong the misery out of revenge, because that's who Trump is.
1325233049655767040 2020-11-08 08:25:55 +0800 <tckalways> Because @netanyahu is a slimy Republican.
1325213874002432001 2020-11-08 07:09:43 +0800 <tckalways> Apparently he's already talking about pressuring electors. There's nothing he won't try, no matter how underhanded.
1325213303589662720 2020-11-08 07:07:27 +0800 <tckalways> Brilliant.
1325213247675408389 2020-11-08 07:07:14 +0800 <tckalways> This is brilliant.
1325208952976470017 2020-11-08 06:50:10 +0800 <tckalways> No @RudyGiuliani, the voters get to decide who won, not the courts.
1325198741834493953 2020-11-08 06:09:35 +0800 <tckalways> It certainly is! Thank you for sharing the lovely family photo and for your live-tweeting these last 4 years!

1325185833188511744 2020-11-08 05:18:18 +0800 <tckalways> Trump always wondered where Biden's crowds were. He doesn't have to wonder any more.
1325179676847960066 2020-11-08 04:53:50 +0800 <tckalways> 95% of them are wearing masks, according to reports on the street. Also, YOU'RE FIRED!

1325156740283813890 2020-11-08 03:22:41 +0800 <tckalways> @JohnKasich It's time for the half of Americans that voted for Trump to get out of their disinformation bubble and embrace the reality that this nation is changing and progress will be made in spite of Republicans, who haven't had a new idea in 50 years. Get with the program.
1325154319872778241 2020-11-08 03:13:04 +0800 <tckalways> Yes it should. We need to try to bring Trump supporters out of their disinformation bubble.
1325150645343629312 2020-11-08 02:58:28 +0800 <tckalways> No. Period.

1325129767167926274 2020-11-08 01:35:30 +0800 <tckalways> It was not a stolen election. Period. And it's absolutely disgusting that you tweeted this lie.
1325126756274106372 2020-11-08 01:23:33 +0800 <tckalways> So let him get arrested and escorted out of the White House.

1320103481429164032 2020-10-25 04:42:50 +0800 <tckalways> Trump demands loyalty from all but gives loyalty to no one.
1320102420890963971 2020-10-25 04:38:38 +0800 <tckalways> It's what Democrats in the Hill and Biden have been clamoring for -- federal Dilworth to retrofit schools with HVAC ventilation systems. McConnell and the Republicans have been standing in the way.
1320073929688518661 2020-10-25 02:45:25 +0800 <tckalways> This list should be sent to every Republican on Capitol Hill.
1320069133036363779 2020-10-25 02:26:21 +0800 <tckalways> Great thread.

1320068393538650113 2020-10-25 02:23:25 +0800 <tckalways> No forgiving and forgetting A special committee or prosecutor should be established to investigate Republicans, especially the Senators that went to Moscow last year and McConnell and Lindsey Graham. They're dirty and I want to know why.
1320061360139534336 2020-10-25 01:55:28 +0800 <tckalways> I really don't care, do u?

1320058067158028294 2020-10-25 01:42:23 +0800 <tckalways> I don't like how @facebook sold my data to Cambridge Analytica. They can go to hell.
1320047768623341576 2020-10-25 01:01:27 +0800 <tckalways> Spot on.
1320033594451070979 2020-10-25 00:05:08 +0800 <tckalways> This.
1320033325885644800 2020-10-25 00:04:04 +0800 <tckalways> After Cambridge Analytica, Facebook is hardly in a position to make such a demand, not to mention the potential 1st amendment issue. @Facebook is garbage and Zuckerberg is s monster.
1320031510423109634 2020-10-24 23:56:51 +0800 <tckalways> Wouldn't it be something if Democrats swept them all. One can hope.
1320026791986270213 2020-10-24 23:38:06 +0800 <tckalways> Democratic presidents have inherited recessions from Republicans for decades and have turned the economy around. As long as the Senate flips, Biden awful too.
1320024449349988352 2020-10-24 23:28:48 +0800 <tckalways> The @GOP is irredeemable.
1320023760586608641 2020-10-24 23:26:04 +0800 <tckalways> It will take decades to fix the damage the Trump administration and its Republican enablers have caused.
1320018023810564097 2020-10-24 23:03:16 +0800 <tckalways> @realDonaldTrump Your lies are catching up to you. A right-wing terrorist set the Minneapolis police station on fire, not Black Lives Matter protesters. Your embrace of the extremists is dangerous. Disgusting.   https://t.co/HJQZFYCwry
1320016954040717313 2020-10-24 22:59:01 +0800 <tckalways> Predictable and awful.
1319862286065033217 2020-10-24 12:44:25 +0800 <tckalways> Nobody cares about the first two things. He's been yakking about  infrastructure for 4 years and done nothing. He doesn't have a healthcare plan. He's a raving lunatic who will be defeated in November and he'll take his GOP enablers down with him.
1319820303074316289 2020-10-24 09:57:35 +0800 <tckalways> It works and it's ridiculous and hilarious.
1319810960530563072 2020-10-24 09:20:28 +0800 <tckalways> My Dad was a career FSO. In glad he didn't live long enough to witness the destruction of the State Department.

1319786780296708101 2020-10-24 07:44:23 +0800 <tckalways> Too bad this story didn't come out before last night's debate.   https://t.co/TA1FuzAis2
1319783564708356096 2020-10-24 07:31:36 +0800 <tckalways> Trump's misogyny on full display.

1319773983533899776 2020-10-24 06:53:32 +0800 <tckalways> It's already been batshit crazy with Hunter Biden conspiracy theories.
1319771658601758724 2020-10-24 06:44:18 +0800 <tckalways> I hope they listen to him
1319479064357490688 2020-10-23 11:21:38 +0800 <tckalways> Great thread
1319466482066219009 2020-10-23 10:31:38 +0800 <tckalways> Spoken by the biggest bag of wind in America.
1319458327785594885 2020-10-23 09:59:14 +0800 <tckalways> Fine. May he be stuck there the rest his sorry life.
1319458041625018372 2020-10-23 09:58:06 +0800 <tckalways> We've never seen Trump's healthcare plan because he doesn't have one, liars.
1319456286761799680 2020-10-23 09:51:07 +0800 <tckalways> Exactly. What the hell does that mean, and prove it.
1319423861318995969 2020-10-23 07:42:16 +0800 <tckalways> No question he's compromised.

1319415968205099008 2020-10-23 07:10:55 +0800 <tckalways> They will not be able to call it news.

1319411930017239041 2020-10-23 06:54:52 +0800 <tckalways> Creepy
1319411641436557314 2020-10-23 06:53:43 +0800 <tckalways> @FoxNews should lose its license to broadcast.
1319410107881574401 2020-10-23 06:47:37 +0800 <tckalways> Wonderful!
1319405790130819074 2020-10-23 06:30:28 +0800 <tckalways> Where's the Republican comprehensive healthcare plan to replace Obamacare?  This stand-alone amendment is useless and you know it.
1319404410582290432 2020-10-23 06:24:59 +0800 <tckalways> I'm for anything that will correct imbalances on all federal courts.

1319389598347296768 2020-10-23 05:26:07 +0800 <tckalways> Yes, Ratcliff put on quite a charade last night. Russia was downplayed.
1319333245146857477 2020-10-23 01:42:12 +0800 <tckalways> Of course they did.
1319333114066460673 2020-10-23 01:41:41 +0800 <tckalways> Truer words were never spoken. We also need  national standards for curricula.
1319330192284934150 2020-10-23 01:30:04 +0800 <tckalways> Let this be a sign.

1319114565188259840 2020-10-22 11:13:14 +0800 <tckalways> No thanks. Why in the hell are you interviewing that nutjob?

1319112765877981184 2020-10-22 11:06:05 +0800 <tckalways> Well, at least it will expose the shitty social workers.
1319055803509342214 2020-10-22 07:19:45 +0800 <tckalways> The scandal is creepy Republicans like you spreading malicious lies and Russian propaganda. After 2016, the media are onto you assh*les.
1319048800095305729 2020-10-22 06:51:55 +0800 <tckalways> Watching this clip makes me realize how much I miss President Obama.

1319015908300460044 2020-10-22 04:41:13 +0800 <tckalways> Taking donations from reprobates is typical of Republicans. They don't care how dirty the donor, as long as their money is green. They are amoral.

1318696231149948975 2020-10-21 07:30:56 +0800 <tckalways> Horrific.
1318694814259548160 2020-10-21 07:25:18 +0800 <tckalways> Maybe because Trump is a serial liar who tweets/posts baseless conspiracy theories, dangerous COVID-19 disinformation and threats to the safety of public officials, all with the encouragement of @FoxNews.
1318393024355905536 2020-10-20 11:26:06 +0800 <tckalways> A set up because Trump's fat as wouldn't fit in the chair üòÖü§£ü§£üòÑüòÜüòÇ

1318337870386634752 2020-10-20 07:46:56 +0800 <tckalways> She couldn't remember the 5 protections of the 1st amendment and tried counting them on her fingers like a 5 year old. She was evasive and disingenuous during the hearings and may very well have perjured herself on a couple of occasions. She is not ready for prime time.
1318261318340804612 2020-10-20 02:42:45 +0800 <tckalways> I have not seen one mention from the left or the press about Barrett's children, other than there are 7 and two are adopted @senatemajldr. However, I've seen plenty of bullying fom the right and right- wing media of Hunter Biden, who has kids himself.

1317923095320137730 2020-10-19 04:18:46 +0800 <tckalways> No it isn't. Bannon is trash.

1317907561383866370 2020-10-19 03:17:02 +0800 <tckalways> This has become a Republican bullying campaign using Russian propaganda. When you think the @GOP can't go any lower, they prove you wrong.
1317896136657698821 2020-10-19 02:31:38 +0800 <tckalways> Exactly.

1317874725683593216 2020-10-19 01:06:34 +0800 <tckalways> You don't dignify Russian propaganda and a smear campaign with a response.
1317873686456696832 2020-10-19 01:02:26 +0800 <tckalways> I disagree. We need a special independent commission to investigate the crimes committed by members of the Trump administration and charge, try and convict the offenders so this crap never happens again.
1317869608364396546 2020-10-19 00:46:14 +0800 <tckalways> Senator, it's because it's FAKE NEWS. This isn't 2016, it's 2020 and voters are on to this Russian BS.

1317859913251627008 2020-10-19 00:07:42 +0800 <tckalways> Yes, representative democracy is beautiful. Too bad Republicans hate it, especially when minority communities are represented.

You've been charged with fraud for your FAKE Build the Wall campaign, in which you and your crooked comrades enriched yourselves by stealing the money you raised. You're a liar and a crook.
1317828053528121344 2020-10-18 22:01:06 +0800 <tckalways> This.

1317826754371833863 2020-10-18 21:55:56 +0800 <tckalways> Because it's FAKE NEWS,  Comrade. It's Russian disinformation, and we know that the Trumps welcome Russian interference in our elections.

1317538447297564672 2020-10-18 02:50:19 +0800 <tckalways> You should take down this tweet. It's a lie and unworthy of any person who calls themselves a journalist. In no way was Biden's response akin to the way Trump treats the press. Erickson was spreading Russian propaganda with his insulting question. You've lost my respect.
1317536526897696787 2020-10-18 02:42:41 +0800 <tckalways> @IsaacDovere @llendonmar46 To say Biden snaps at questions he doesn't like is an unfair characterization. Biden was angry because the reporter is spreading Russian propaganda and he's probably  sick of the unrelenting, bullying attacks on his son. The sanctimonious reaction of reporters is nauseating.
1317526216337915904 2020-10-18 02:01:43 +0800 <tckalways> Are you kidding me?
1317523156618399744 2020-10-18 01:49:33 +0800 <tckalways> The question was designed to get a rise out of Biden and Bo Erickson succeeded. Is he proud of himself? Are you proud of yourselves for legitimizing and normalizing Russian propaganda? This is not the journalism I majored in. Shame on all of you.
1317523154819010565 2020-10-18 01:49:33 +0800 <tckalways> Day after day reporters are abused by Trump, McEneny and other administration and campaign officials and you go back for more because *access*. It's disgusting to watch you prostitute yourselves. 2/
1317523153745289220 2020-10-18 01:49:32 +0800 <tckalways> This holier-than-thou crap is insulting. Spreading malicious lies and Russian propaganda with your questions is not journalism. Biden's son has been relentlessly attacked and Biden reacted as a human being and a father. You are the ones who look bad, not Biden. 1/
1317519928292003844 2020-10-18 01:36:43 +0800 <tckalways> That's an egregious lie. He said he'd raise taxes on people earning more than $400,000 per year and corporations. People earning $400K or more constitute 1-2% of Americans. Americans are sick of Trump and sick of Republican liars.
1317511011348451329 2020-10-18 01:01:17 +0800 <tckalways> When your question spreads Russian propaganda, prepare to accept the consequences. Biden's son has been attacked  relentlessly. It is not a surprise that Biden had a human response to your stupidity.
1317499820110741507 2020-10-18 00:16:49 +0800 <tckalways> "Poor me. I'm such a victim." I really don't care, do u?
1317496137155334146 2020-10-18 00:02:11 +0800 <tckalways> Yes, representative democracy is beautiful. It's what our country is about. What's truly sad is the Republican party doing everything it can to suppress the vote and preserve the white patriarchy. It's grotesque.

1317453620816785410 2020-10-17 21:13:14 +0800 <tckalways> Stop doubling down and stop being a hypocrite. The daily insults hurled at the media by Trump, McEneny and the entire Trump administration are unprecedented but you go back for more every day. Biden reacts to an obnoxious question once and you're sanctimonious as hell. Gross.
1317450817570471936 2020-10-17 21:02:06 +0800 <tckalways> Maybe he's sick of the baseless attacks on his son and is tired of answering obnoxious questions.

1317284020246503425 2020-10-17 09:59:19 +0800 <tckalways> Exactly.
1317283927032299521 2020-10-17 09:58:56 +0800 <tckalways> Because the reporter is propagating Russian propaganda, maybe?

1316084316858966021 2020-10-14 02:32:07 +0800 <tckalways> Judge Barrett has hardly ruled on anything because she's only been a judge for 3 years. Prior to that she was a law professor.

1315328173534597120 2020-10-12 00:27:28 +0800 <tckalways> This obsession by the media is BS. Where were you in when McConnell refused to seat any of Obama‚Äôs 100+ federal judicial nominees and raced to fill them after Trump was elected? What about Merrick Garland? This is gotcha BS and Biden's not playing your game. Good for him.
1315326991135014913 2020-10-12 00:22:46 +0800 <tckalways> From 2015 to 2017, Mitch McConnell refused to seat any of Obama‚Äôs 100+ federal judicial nominees. Then he rushed to fill them after Trump was elected. He did the same with Merrick Garland‚Äôs seat.But you're going to be a holier- than-thou hypocrite. Pathetic.
1315320122945527808 2020-10-11 23:55:29 +0800 <tckalways> Republicans are in no position to talk about court packing. From 2015 to 2017, Mitch McConnell refused to seat any of Obama‚Äôs 100+ federal judicial nominees. Then he rushed to fill them after Trump was elected. He did the same with Merrick Garland‚Äôs seat. That's court packing.
1315317455296688129 2020-10-11 23:44:53 +0800 <tckalways> Utter hypocrisy.  Trump won't answer questions honestly about his health. He won't tell us to whom he owes $400 million. He won't show us his tax returns. He never accepts responsibility for anything. Also, you're ridiculous.
1315314419023388673 2020-10-11 23:32:49 +0800 <tckalways> If 82% of Americans make $400,000 or more a year, I've got a bridge to sell you, liar. Fewer than 1% of Americans make that kind of money.

1315313157909499905 2020-10-11 23:27:48 +0800 <tckalways> Amazing. Voters deserve to see Trump's taxes, to know the state of his health, to know to whom he owes $400 million, to know what he says to Vladimir Putin,  to name a few.

1311134938645835777 2020-09-30 10:45:03 +0800 <tckalways> Biden should decline to participate in any more "debates" unless Trump agrees to shut up. This was excruciating. I'm not a masochist. No more shitshows for me.
1311122276620926978 2020-09-30 09:54:44 +0800 <tckalways> I want to jump through the TV screen and strangle Trump. I can't fucking stand him.

1311097485079842817 2020-09-30 08:16:14 +0800 <tckalways> At least he didn't end up with 6 bullets in him, which might have happened if he'd been black. I'm not justifying it, just keeping things in perspective. Cops are violent and it needs to change.
1311094053702901760 2020-09-30 08:02:36 +0800 <tckalways> Imagine, Joe Biden can afford $13 a pint ice cream after paying more than $300000 in taxes every year, unlike Trump who pays no taxes.  Biden isn't a loser deadbeat like Trump, who has $400 million in debt coming due in the next 4 years. Who are his creditors, creep? Russia?

They paid taxes in Panama so the government would look the other way while they laundered Russian money through their condo. Lord knows what bribes they paid to Panamanian officials.

1310291055472934913 2020-09-28 02:51:46 +0800 <tckalways> Catholic Biden went to church today, as he does every Sunday. Where is Trump every Sunday? On the golf course. So tell me which party has a corner on religion. I'm sick of Republican hypocrisy.
1310290592316960770 2020-09-28 02:49:55 +0800 <tckalways> Why should Biden play the Republican game and put out a list? It's not material to what's happening... the absolute corruption of the SCOTUS nominating process while Americans are already voting. Biden's not playing the political game and neither should you @jaketapper.
1310288899932123136 2020-09-28 02:43:12 +0800 <tckalways> Womp womp.

1310285341778214913 2020-09-28 02:29:04 +0800 <tckalways> Hypocrite.  You're deflecting, just like Trump.  Even if she were a fantastic nominee, and she is far from that, this process stinks to high heaven. It's a stain on our democracy. Either you support allowing the voter to have a say or you don't. Which is it,  @gtconway3d?
1310284265465278475 2020-09-28 02:24:47 +0800 <tckalways> She is unqualified. PERIOD. She practiced law for 3 years and sat in a stolen seat on the bench for 3 years  You're trying to make her palatable when this whole process stinks. Her disrespect of RBG'S wish is profound. She's not fit to lick RBG's shoes, much less fill them.
1310276831359258626 2020-09-28 01:55:15 +0800 <tckalways> I am looking forward to your grilling of Barrett.

1309989736854032387 2020-09-27 06:54:26 +0800 <tckalways> That you have supported the policies of this immoral, cruel and heinous administration has rendered you an illegitimate commentator on other people's faith and religion.

1309988838991953920 2020-09-27 06:50:52 +0800 <tckalways> Republicans think they have a corner on God and faith, just like they thought they had a corner on morals. Then Trump became their leader, an  irreligious, immoral, indecent pathetic excuse for human being. The stench of their hypocrisy is overwhelming.
1309985804459048960 2020-09-27 06:38:48 +0800 <tckalways> Amy Coney Barrett should have had the decency to decline the nomination when people have already started voting and before Ruth Bader Ginsburg has even been buried. She has displayed a profound lack of respect for RBG, for the American people and for process. Truly appalling.

1309981482233081856 2020-09-27 06:21:38 +0800 <tckalways> @NAChristakis I disagree. His point is well- taken. Adopting a child of color doesn't guarantee that you're not a racist with implicit biases. How Barrett rules on voting and affirmative action will determine whether she's racist.
1309980238433128449 2020-09-27 06:16:41 +0800 <tckalways> What a special little girl!
1309974291308597253 2020-09-27 05:53:03 +0800 <tckalways> This is a shameful moment in modern history. Amy Coney Barrett displays a terrible lack of character and profound disrespect for Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who hasn't even been buried yet. It is sickening.
1309973388287447040 2020-09-27 05:49:28 +0800 <tckalways> It is indecent for Amy Coney Barrett to accept the nomination when Americans have already begun to vote. It says a lot about her character, or lack of it.

1309927916650856450 2020-09-27 02:48:47 +0800 <tckalways> Joe Biden is a Catholic. So is Nancy Pelosi. You sure are stupid.
1309920906186285056 2020-09-27 02:20:55 +0800 <tckalways> The Trump regime is like the Hitler regime. It's starting with immigrants and will only get worse. We must stop this grotesquely inhumane administration on November 3.

1309867457620910080 2020-09-26 22:48:32 +0800 <tckalways> Any woman who would deny the rights of other women and minority communities is not a feminist. Barrett is the beneficiary of feminism, like Marsha Blackburn, Michele Bachman, Phyllis Schlafly and their ilk. Feminists did the hard work and paved their way. They're just leeches.

1309301840685694976 2020-09-25 09:20:59 +0800 <tckalways> The Trump regime has subverted its system of justice into a cruel system of repression. Today, women are enduring forced hysterectomies by ICE "doctors," children are still being torn from their mothers'  arms, refugees are living in squalid conditions, and more. You're filthy.
1309282409926610945 2020-09-25 08:03:46 +0800 <tckalways> Yeah, Trump and DeSantis took care of Florida all right.  All those Floridians who died of COVID-19 and their families and friends are jumping for joy.
1309276850699591685 2020-09-25 07:41:41 +0800 <tckalways> That has always been the problem with  Democrats. They always operate from a position of weakness.

1302365233286176769 2020-09-06 05:57:23 +0800 <tckalways> Hey Bozo, 3 million more Americans voted for Hillary than for Trump. Russia helped Trump get in the White House. He's an illegitimate, and now an impeached, POTUS. He doesn't respect our military, his office or the country. We're living in the #BananaRepublicofTrumpistan.

1302359985737867264 2020-09-06 05:36:31 +0800 <tckalways> It's already here. He's doing away with federal anti-racism training. He hopes that will distract us from his disrespect for the military. SMDH.

1302358830945316864 2020-09-06 05:31:56 +0800 <tckalways> Chris Cillizza has no business working for a serious news outlet. This kind of both-sides commentary is what got us Trump. It's not serious journalism and it's lazy as hell. You need to fire Cillizza, @CNN. He hurts your credibility.

1302269036361809920 2020-09-05 23:35:07 +0800 <tckalways> @Captsully said it best: Trump "cannot understand selflessness because he is selfish. He cannot conceive of courage because he is a coward. He cannot feel duty because he is disloyal." And you, madam, are a liar.
1302266147417534471 2020-09-05 23:23:39 +0800 <tckalways> My father, an immigrant from Eastern Europe, served this country his entire adult life. He was a Marine Corps Captain WW II and served in the National Guard for 10 years thereafter. He served again as a career foreign service officer. He was not a loser/sucker. He was a Patriot.
1302263384386265090 2020-09-05 23:12:40 +0800 <tckalways> You surfaced from under your rock to lie for Trump. You have no credibility.

1302097336626286593 2020-09-05 12:12:51 +0800 <tckalways> God you're nauseating. You're so covered in Trump's shit people can smell you a mile away.
1302066029368152064 2020-09-05 10:08:27 +0800 <tckalways> John Kelly is a coward.
1302040466884562945 2020-09-05 08:26:52 +0800 <tckalways> John Kerry was swift- boated by Republican dirty tactics.  Republicans have always fought dirty and look what we have become because of that party. It's no wonder the military hate Trump. He's what Republicans wrought and the rest of is are paying the price.
1302037917053923329 2020-09-05 08:16:44 +0800 <tckalways> This story was corroborated by other news outlets, including Fox News. Your traitor husband won't even protect our troops when there's a Russian target on their backs. We can't vote you out of the White House fast enough.

1301850654097498112 2020-09-04 19:52:37 +0800 <tckalways> @realDonaldTrump You're a sociopath: A mental condition in which a person consistently shows no regard for right and wrong,ignores the rights and feelings of others; tends to antagonize, manipulate or treat others harshly or with callous indifference; shows no¬†guilt¬†or remorse for their behavior.

1301691090362302465 2020-09-04 09:18:34 +0800 <tckalways> No, The Atlantic story is accurate. Trump is a psychopath. What's your excuse @PressSec? You're evil.
1301690650048462850 2020-09-04 09:16:49 +0800 <tckalways> I've been asking the same question. Where is their personal and professional self-respect?
1301689461684817922 2020-09-04 09:12:06 +0800 <tckalways> Trump is a psychopath.
1301677109815980033 2020-09-04 08:23:01 +0800 <tckalways> @realDonaldTrump is a psychopath. He doesn't have normal human emotions, he cannot empathize because he is literally a psychopath.
1301664885294739456 2020-09-04 07:34:27 +0800 <tckalways> Trump is always talking about the military, but he regards service men and women with contempt. He is sickening.
