It’s a tragedy because her legacy will be, “President Trump has been so attentive to the scientific literature and the details and data”.  There went her credibility.

That man is such a mess it is difficult to understand how anyone could support him. I was afraid he was just going to start releasing state secrets. I cannot believe how much I detest him.
1337881697593913344 2020-12-13 06:07:08 +0800 <MaryandWinnie> @tedcruz It is hard to listen to anything you say. Well except for everything you said about trump in 2016. “Pathological liar”. 😁

I still have a bit of trouble understanding the diapers, but they obviously would have you in court. So it all must be true!  But doesn’t anyone ever complain about the odor?  Think about a baby. 😱

Here is a pic of our caring VP earlier in the year at Mayo refusing to wear a mask. He wanted everyone there, “to be able to see my face”.  Probably why we are where we are after all these months.

1334639162725605377 2020-12-04 07:22:27 +0800 <MaryandWinnie> @glennkirschner2 @life_art_love I’m sorry Mr. Kirschner, pence has been by his side and a yes man for over 4 years. Just because he sees the ship sinking now, he should not get a pass. He is every bit as power hungry as trump. He is now looking to 2024 and trying to save his hide. I find him worse than trump

Can’t wait until trump throws him under the bus for himself, don jr, ivanka, eric or the 25 others waiting in line. Still don’t understand how a “devout Christian” sold his soul to back that corrupt demon.

1333319449768693765 2020-11-30 15:58:23 +0800 <MaryandWinnie> @EbtStan Dearest Stan that is a pretty magnificent picture. I see one perfect egg. You are definitely a star ⭐️💙🐾

He cares about one thing only: being president. He doesn’t want to president. He just wants the power. “I’m president. I can do anything I want” He is the most despicable human ever.

And certainly you have lost a precious pet at some time. Imagine losing a child. If you don’t like his policies that is one thing. Questioning his love for his child is out of bounds.

But he basically sold his soul with his loyalty. trump would have dumped him in a second if he had thought it would help him win in 2020. pence deserves whatever he gets. 100% complicit

1322283671257190401 2020-10-31 05:06:08 +0800 <MaryandWinnie> @Canadiancentri2 She did speak on that stage. Sure sounded like her. She has a very distinctive accent. Just saying...

1322252769936306177 2020-10-31 03:03:21 +0800 <MaryandWinnie> @TheRealHoarse She spoke earlier at this rally. Would be rather difficult to mimic her accent. Instead of having COVID, looks like she had a nose job.

1320367656474759168 2020-10-25 22:12:35 +0800 <MaryandWinnie> @PodLegged Oh dearest Pod, glad that you got some walk time in spite of the rain. Seems like drying off was much more fun than the actual walk. Lucky that you have your Daddy at home and can have lots of cuddle times. Have a beautiful day and always remember how much you are loved ❤️🐾

1316356212062126087 2020-10-14 20:32:32 +0800 <MaryandWinnie> @MSNBC So he wouldn’t follow the rules about the original debate, so NBC rewards him with his own free Prime time televised rally. Despicable.

1310221881740587008 2020-09-27 22:16:54 +0800 <MaryandWinnie> @realDonaldTrump Is that Plan available to see possibly “in the next two weeks”?
1310215807163654145 2020-09-27 21:52:45 +0800 <MaryandWinnie> @SethCotlar I am remaining optimistic and agree with this. The newer justices have already made some decisions that were not favorable to trump. Maybe taking that oath has opened their eyes to the impartial role they are expected to play.Yes this is optimistic but what else do we have?🙏🏼💙🙏🏼
