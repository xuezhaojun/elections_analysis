1338621954618777607 2020-12-15 07:08:39 +0800 <NxallAnglo> Personally I think English people need to promote being English more over being British. It seems British is usually used interchangeably with English and when a Scotsman, Irishman or Welshmen does something he‚Äôs referred to by his country, not by the Union...
1338621241469571074 2020-12-15 07:05:49 +0800 <NxallAnglo> @BNAdam_ I understand that but the point is usually it flows outward for most - county - country - Union . I put English first because I believe there is a difference between us and the Scots, welsh and Irish albeit we are similar.

Tories last December talked banning lgbt kids, cutting immigration, leaving eu etc. This is good
1337865808840716291 2020-12-13 05:03:59 +0800 <NxallAnglo> @Powells_ghost @BNAdam_ It‚Äôs not meaningless because the people didn‚Äôt vote on the pretence of them being the same, which is good...
1337865666959958017 2020-12-13 05:03:26 +0800 <NxallAnglo> @BNAdam_ Lincolnshire is the highest Tory county in England -  66% Tory and only 22% Labour. Herefordshire is the least labour on 18%

Getting your own home will be made easier with better loans &amp; more homes which can only be done with enough builders (which we certainly don‚Äôt have). China have such a large workforce that they build things in a day.
1337829590803345413 2020-12-13 02:40:04 +0800 <NxallAnglo> @thegreatgwave @Based_Brunette When you have a young healthy growing population that sorts all these problems out naturally, imo. You have youth to assist the elderly/family. More workers = more builders = more homes. Plus you have a large native population which makes it very hard to subvert the nation.

1337120720246149123 2020-12-11 03:43:16 +0800 <NxallAnglo> @ToryPapist Yeah for various things. England is the only country of the UK not to have its own Parliament - we just have the UK wide Westminster.

1337120043948191744 2020-12-11 03:40:35 +0800 <NxallAnglo> @ToryPapist Many argue that the autonomy gives rise to separatism. Also, England is much bigger than the other 3 which means when it comes to separate budgets this can make things unequal- England pays for the others. University is free in Scotland but not England even though we subsidise it
