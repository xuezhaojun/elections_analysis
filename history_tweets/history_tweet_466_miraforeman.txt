1323038567292166155 2020-11-02 07:05:49 +0800 <miraforeman> If they continue to diagnose Flu as Covid, there will be pandemic  It’s not down to micro-organism, but to irresponsible politicians,scientists &amp; MSM

1317394636256792577 2020-10-17 17:18:51 +0800 <miraforeman> @Crosscolin88 Testing positive? For what? Whole world knows PCR test can’t diagnose corona virus  Wish you well
1317393118531112960 2020-10-17 17:12:50 +0800 <miraforeman> Good question  I think we know the answer  ‘GREAT RESET’
1317390315653910529 2020-10-17 17:01:41 +0800 <miraforeman> Eventually, the press decides Gov policy Ppl believe what they read/listen to MSM Even judge in SD case does  What makes them that knowledgeable? Are they a scientists?
1317388524342153216 2020-10-17 16:54:34 +0800 <miraforeman> It makes them complicit in Gov mass slaughter of ppl of Britain  They know what they’re doing  Alas, killing fields continue  SHAME ON MEDICAL PROFESSION  Their first duty should be to patients  THEY’VE BECOME AGENTS OF THE STATE
1317387123838849024 2020-10-17 16:49:00 +0800 <miraforeman> Gov doesn’t care They are only listening to SAGE It suits their AGENDA
1317383045264138240 2020-10-17 16:32:48 +0800 <miraforeman> I’ve been asking the same question  I actually asked a lady I often see in one of the shops where she works She said; I feel more more comfortable  ???
1317380927824211968 2020-10-17 16:24:23 +0800 <miraforeman> How sad We are back in 1930s But worse  There was no technology we have today Nothing learned from history  Or I maybe wrong Those in power are using it to full extent
1317375570783707138 2020-10-17 16:03:06 +0800 <miraforeman> Very narrow view A am not Scientists or virologist  If virus is that infectious  Half of London population would be sick Constant riots &amp; gatherings? PCR test is failed test Never in history did we get rid of viruses  Just logic No need to be Scientists
1317372465316810762 2020-10-17 15:50:45 +0800 <miraforeman> It will be coming here One step at the time  We are heading towards totalitarian state

Politics have reached its lowest of the low  I shall definitely not vote at next GE, if I live that long In which case it will make no difference  UNLESS a new party appears  Risky as well
1300894034320293889 2020-09-02 04:31:21 +0800 <miraforeman> @DulcieRueben64 @AeHcat I've got something similar from PHE and is several months old.  PCR test doesn't work, Scientists know it

1300848053763690496 2020-09-02 01:28:39 +0800 <miraforeman> @FraserNelson Because of more testing with hoax test
