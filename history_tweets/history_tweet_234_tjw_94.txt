1339196396956770304 2020-12-16 21:11:16 +0800 <tjw_94> We discuss other differences and reasons for these in the paper. Our work provides the first comparative study of AR with older adults in a non-industrial context. Thank you very much to the ACs and reviewers of our paper for your helpful comments. See you at #CHI2021! (3/3)
1339196393819418625 2020-12-16 21:11:16 +0800 <tjw_94> In this paper we compare four #augmented #reality (#AR) visual prompts and a Text+Audio control. Adults aged 50+ performed five actions after viewing each prompt. We found that Text+Audio was preferred overall, but a ghosthand (see gif) was the preferred AR prompt. 2/3  https://t.co/jDvLmXSyFB

Congratulations @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris from Bath, England.

1324382292828164096 2020-11-06 00:05:19 +0800 <tjw_94> I‚Äôm excited to be learning some BSL, and even happier that I‚Äôm doing it along with these wonderful people. Thank you @centre_digi_ent for organising!
1324367113797226497 2020-11-05 23:05:00 +0800 <tjw_94> @catharinebrown @guardian @BBCNews Guardian‚Äôs numbers have been confusing throughout! I think @JessRidgers is right about BBC being cautious. CBS says 253. Different levels of caution... it‚Äôs too close to call in some places. I might make Cheesecake tonight if Philadelphia turns blue &amp; call it Biden Cheesecake!

1314217240934445056 2020-10-08 22:53:01 +0800 <tjw_94> I'm looking forward to chatting with other @DoctoralBath  students tomorrow.
1312836468243562501 2020-10-05 03:26:20 +0800 <tjw_94> @JessRidgers @DesignabilityUK Absolutely fantastic, Jess, well done!
1311384834900623361 2020-10-01 03:18:03 +0800 <tjw_94> @tanmoylaskar @kscopeLGBT But as a student accessing services e.g. careers advice or wellbeing, seeing the lanyard signals I can say 'husband' without worrying how that person will react, regardless of why they're wearing the lanyard. Flirting in a work context should probably be discouraged, too. ;)
1311032128583479300 2020-09-30 03:56:31 +0800 <tjw_94> @YueJiang_nj Hallo Deutschland! Gute Reise!
