1339299352225857537 2020-12-17 04:00:23 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Archimbaldo @lmartods At the risk of sounding like"he started it", I'd love to focus on why our endless wars are bad and need to end or why our decaying imperial system needs to be burnt to the ground, but for some reason we can never agree on the rules which change all the time.
1339295082818666496 2020-12-17 03:43:25 +0800 <epiplexis_> @DurstApologist @Archimbaldo The Spectator was firing up that gun in case of an election result that went the other way.
1339293911076937728 2020-12-17 03:38:45 +0800 <epiplexis_> Lol, they really couldn't afford to hire a PR team that made this sound any better?

1339182760724979713 2020-12-16 20:17:05 +0800 <epiplexis_> Being a loudmouth with zero political power makes you a "crank", but being a corrupt war criminal who had the power to enact barbaric policies targeted at any number of minority groups and engaging in endless global war and torture makes you "electable".
1339178703008444418 2020-12-16 20:00:58 +0800 <epiplexis_> The only difference between being a so-called "crank" and a 'respected commentator' is whether or not you have friends or friends of friends who know Rupert Murdoch.

1339082509603188737 2020-12-16 13:38:43 +0800 <epiplexis_> I should be clear that this isn't my rule.  It's what the other side created. I'm merely seeking to enforce what the "winners" said we should.
1339080618295123970 2020-12-16 13:31:12 +0800 <epiplexis_> @coso9001 @grannamhaoul I sometimes place a damp cloth over the pan and then 'seal' it with the lid, a trick I borrowed from cooking dum biryani.

1338934129841172480 2020-12-16 03:49:07 +0800 <epiplexis_> @TKispeter Various laws culminating in the 2014 Immigration Act allow a Home Secretary to remove citizenship from anyone deemed to have 'foreign' heritage.  This basically makes loads of people second class citizens - our rights can be dissolved for political reasons.  No one even cares.

1338807552553807874 2020-12-15 19:26:09 +0800 <epiplexis_> @SolHughesWriter Labour should expel the religious sect opposed to my religious sect, because I'm part of the more powerful religious sect and happen to align myself with the political interests of powerful members of the majority outgroup.
1338805430525444097 2020-12-15 19:17:43 +0800 <epiplexis_> @dsquareddigest But a "bus service" (admittedly taken here to mean more than a literal bus service) ought to be bringing people in as well as taking them out.

1338539474465288197 2020-12-15 01:40:54 +0800 <epiplexis_> Bergman's book reminded me of Trofimov's book The Siege of Mecca.

The reason you need to make sure their vote is decimated is so the fuckers not only learn a lesson, but also it's the only way to deselect all of them.

1334877298743517184 2020-12-04 23:08:43 +0800 <epiplexis_> @AdamPorte @RivkahBrown I agree, think about all the people who shared a 'platform' with a politician who said:  "When I arrived in 1994, it was a predominantly white, working class area. Now go through the middle of Barking and you could be in Camden or Brixton..."   but then refused to challenge them.

Only America can do this now, whatever, e.g., China threatens against this or that country.

He just thinks it was good, whereas the "anti-racist" crowd pretend it never occurred and if you bring up the historical archives, they'll just accuse you of racism.

1330375382609121281 2020-11-22 12:59:43 +0800 <epiplexis_> The thing about a lot of these post-war leaders in the "third world" (e.g. Sukarno, Mossadegh, Arbenz) is they weren't even communists. They were 'left-leaning' nationalists or liberals who wanted for their own people what they saw "the west" had.

Seems like the left has taken republican political theory and liberal democracy for what it is and tried to make gains within it. But does this have limits?
1330209014794379264 2020-11-22 01:58:37 +0800 <epiplexis_> @jakeedmund @Archimbaldo "liberal democracy, long dead, finally buried"  Great piece, btw. Articulated what I've been thinking for a long time.

Their new donors can provide funding for years and years of court cases defending its MPs and members who have called for things like 'whites-first' housing policies.
1328866792450744322 2020-11-18 09:05:07 +0800 <epiplexis_> Genuine question: are there grounds for taking Labour to court for ignoring the decades of Good Racism its MPs and members have churned out?  I'd certainly contribute to any crowdfunding.

1327782771985702912 2020-11-15 09:17:36 +0800 <epiplexis_> I'm convinced these people read that Joe Kennedy book as "mirror for princes" style literature.   https://t.co/LDFqjoIRJd
1327780023605096451 2020-11-15 09:06:41 +0800 <epiplexis_> Harry Cole is delighted to hear about Boris Johnson's impotence.
1327779681219833856 2020-11-15 09:05:19 +0800 <epiplexis_> @SyedforLondon @inthesedeserts Sometimes I wonder whether I should just advise a young Asian or Black person to lean into wealth extraction from this shoddy island, fleece the bootlicking fuckers for all they've got, and then just leave before the decade is out.
1327777746848804865 2020-11-15 08:57:38 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Archimbaldo But unless we think NAM was a secret Soviet plot, this only shows where the "third world" believed its best chance at developing their own economies lay.
1327776999088254977 2020-11-15 08:54:40 +0800 <epiplexis_> The US and UK didn't allow millions of people in the "third world" to have this view on looking after their own, and kept doing coups and wars to ensure access to their wealth.
1327776489539072000 2020-11-15 08:52:38 +0800 <epiplexis_> Judging by people who seem to accuse you of being a cultist for not wanting World War III, while curiously having views that align with John Bolton and Mike Pompeo, we will not be lucky enough to get a NAM in the forthcoming Cold War.
1327766563928289281 2020-11-15 08:13:12 +0800 <epiplexis_> The only 'correct' geopolitical position was non-alignment and it's unsurprising which 'side' in the last Cold War systematically destroyed it.
1327758677697236992 2020-11-15 07:41:51 +0800 <epiplexis_> @SafiyaOutlines @Archimbaldo I can also throw insults around - believe me, I'm quite good at those - but before I do maybe you should ask yourself why you felt the need to call Diane Abbott a "cultist" when she, e.g., voted with the Tories over Libya.
1327742238655455234 2020-11-15 06:36:32 +0800 <epiplexis_> @SyedforLondon @Archimbaldo @Charburchar What always strikes me is how the old imperial powers - UK, France, Netherlands - immediately backed each other up in SE Asia (Malaya, Vietnam, Indonesia).
1327741941342212096 2020-11-15 06:35:21 +0800 <epiplexis_> @SyedforLondon @Archimbaldo @Charburchar China has been occupied by Britain and the US in the last 120 years.

What I'm suggesting to the likes of your respondent is *he* has a blind spot or worse, he will end up engaging in the same justification for violence he is accusing China apologists of.
1327741129954103296 2020-11-15 06:32:08 +0800 <epiplexis_> @SyedforLondon @Archimbaldo I'll have to double-check, but wasn't it Ernest Bevin who explicitly wanted Britain to continue extracting resources from its African colonies and even suggested a joint Anglo-French initiative to ensure Europe maintained its imperial wealth.
1327739450668015616 2020-11-15 06:25:27 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Archimbaldo Almost all of the Labour Party - including the "Corbynite" wing - venerates the post-war Labour government that was knee-deep in pro-colonial violence in Asia right after WWII.
1327739084878516225 2020-11-15 06:24:00 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Charburchar @Archimbaldo What about people who consider Alastair Campbell or Tony Blair or Nuke Bakehurst "allies".  What about people who venerate the man that led post-WWII colonial violence against liberation movements in Asia.

I'm suggesting that "diversity" as a liberal claim was eroded by MAGA if you go by the most recent election and by my (admittedly superficial) look at online MAGA.  "We have ethnically diverse supporters" can be met with "and so do we".

Blair's rhetoric as he left was to attack Black people and Muslims. Brown ended up by repeating BNP slogans about British jobs for British workers.

1326508972086472704 2020-11-11 20:55:58 +0800 <epiplexis_> @CallumGR1874 @zoemayenglish You believe we need a Labour govt because its policies are watered down versions of bad things done by the Tories, and in exchange we may get some watered down versions of good things.  This requires you to accept some people need to be harmed or sacrificed in some way.

If you say Labour would water something down, e.g. let's say welfare support, that watering down entails something - or someone - being sacrificed.  NewLab decided asylum seekers were the easy target

We should stop appealing to their 'fairness' or 'decency', because they have none.  They correctly believe the point is to win and defeat your opponents.

In the case of the 'Muslim community', the broad politics of the 'community' don't conform to the more dominant outgroup so they're ignored. Prevent in this case is used to control those elements that challenge the outgroup on things like war.

1322943035903299584 2020-11-02 00:46:13 +0800 <epiplexis_> @sjwrenlewis @Mc_Heckin_Duff Though admittedly, he's a right-wing politician so fair point.  Anyway, what is the criteria of "infection" that allows us to evaluate the legacy of New Labour, Simon? How much racism and war is allowed to infect a "left govt" before you say "no, this is too much"?

1322941785988042759 2020-11-02 00:41:15 +0800 <epiplexis_> @sjwrenlewis @Mc_Heckin_Duff So, you have criteria that lets you evaluate the "lesser evil".  That's what I was asking.  What is this criteria?

1322938003841523712 2020-11-02 00:26:13 +0800 <epiplexis_> @sjwrenlewis @Mc_Heckin_Duff The Tories absolutely would go to war. They'd absolutely be racist.  The argument you are making is these can be balanced out under Labour because they introduced Sure Start centres.  i.e. there's criteria we can evaluate to help us make a choice about supporting Blair, Starmer.
1322937011842568193 2020-11-02 00:22:17 +0800 <epiplexis_> @sjwrenlewis @Mc_Heckin_Duff Let me make this simpler for you:  Tories = Racism + War - Sure Start  Labour = Racism + War + Sure Start  This is what you should be bold enough to own, just like Chomsky (funny how people don't read Chomsky's lesser evil argument to its end).

My argument is there are always alternatives and it's best we work to wipe the Labour Party off the electoral map as it is now a century-long failed experiment against the establishment.

1322921873135554566 2020-11-01 23:22:07 +0800 <epiplexis_> @sjwrenlewis @Mc_Heckin_Duff Simon, was all the death and racism from New Labour a price worth paying for Sure Start centres and reducing child poverty for a few years?

1322920274828865537 2020-11-01 23:15:46 +0800 <epiplexis_> @sjwrenlewis @Mc_Heckin_Duff So, criminalising asylum seekers, migrants, Muslims and Black people, plus all the death abroad, *was* a price worth paying for New Labour reducing child poverty and opening Sure Start centres.

1322916807762726913 2020-11-01 23:02:00 +0800 <epiplexis_> @sjwrenlewis @Mc_Heckin_Duff But was it worth it, even in hindsight?

1322911916789026817 2020-11-01 22:42:34 +0800 <epiplexis_> @sjwrenlewis @Mc_Heckin_Duff Ok, what's the criteria, Simon.

YOU said a Lab govt is better than a Tory govt even acknowledging a Lab can be harmful to certain groups of people.  Therefore, there must be criteria you can define at which even a Lab govt does too much racism.  What is that criteria?

And then they can thank Liberals for "One Rule For Them" once the Tory press machine gets going on Kieth's time at the CPS.

1321228862068609024 2020-10-28 07:14:42 +0800 <epiplexis_> These people were fine with 'Labour' when Labour set about criminalising and humiliating asylum seekers, refugees, Muslims, the poor, teenagers, Black people.

1318699342488887308 2020-10-21 07:43:18 +0800 <epiplexis_> @shirleymush Burnham would abstain/vote for all the Bad Things, peddle Legitimate Concerns, and occasionally catch the government making procedural errors.  Yes, he's just another Yvette Cooper.

But he appears to have no strategic interest in the US Imperial War Machine. He just wants to "win" deals.  That's what really infuriates his domestic opponents. He says things he's not meant to.
1317130413295493124 2020-10-16 23:48:56 +0800 <epiplexis_> @SchlatterTom @dsquareddigest @Dr_Memory I mean previous US presidents started coups and wars all over the world, from Santiago to Jakarta.

1316508703110189065 2020-10-15 06:38:29 +0800 <epiplexis_> @TwoPabloAngel He's always had some bad views, but now last year is a bad memory it's time to cut people like him loose and treat them as being no different to any other publicity-hungry media freak.

1313006750552010752 2020-10-05 14:42:58 +0800 <epiplexis_> Hi @DrRosena, you made a big deal of pretending your abstention on the Make War Crimes Legal Bill would mean it gets meaningfully ammended later.  Do you plan to do the same here, and if so, what specific crimes do you hope are "amended in the third reading" and what should pass?
1313004108580823040 2020-10-05 14:32:28 +0800 <epiplexis_> @alexdobs91 @Johannisnotcool @ChrisCorney1 @Aiannucci @MattHancock So, no; there's no such thing as a "community leader" who represents everyone who may self-identify or be part of a particular ethnic or other group and a liberal democracy should not create a "millet system" of approved community bodies that speak for everyone in that community.
1313003643805872129 2020-10-05 14:30:37 +0800 <epiplexis_> @alexdobs91 @Johannisnotcool @ChrisCorney1 @Aiannucci @MattHancock And other communities such as British Palestinians deserve the same, but when they do so they are called antisemites.  There's also no such thing as a single community of anything. Communities have their own internal dynamics.

If you want to do that, it works for all such "communities".  The Tory manifesto had quite literal fascism in and all of Corbyn's loudest critics said nothing.

1312548366837047297 2020-10-04 08:21:31 +0800 <epiplexis_> A tip for white people who are "proud" to vote for parties that legislate racist deportation and citizenship laws: don't assume every person you're interacting with is also white. That comes across a little... 'racist'.

Thankfully, there's at least one Lib Dem who is ashamed of what his party did.  You, otoh, seem to suggest the laws that enabled the deportation of Black Britons to their deaths isn't racist.  https://t.co/cIvWMES0pX

Hopefully, he'll be along to correct me and help me put the two pieces together - voting for racist deportation laws but also being "anti-racist".

1312541276236132353 2020-10-04 07:53:20 +0800 <epiplexis_> In case anyone comes across this guy, he's "proud" he voted for the Lib Dems, despite them being part of the coalition that made the 2014 Immigration Act. This act made the Windrush deportations possible and lets a HomeSec remove citizenship from anyone with 'foreign' origins.

This led to the infamous Windrush deportations and allows a Home Secretary to strip citizenship from anyone deemed to have 'foreign' heritage.

I know people like me will be on the receiving end.  But what's Labour going to do about it anyway? Abstain in parliament? Declare their allegiance to Queen and country?
1308884821570187265 2020-09-24 05:43:54 +0800 <epiplexis_> @dsquareddigest Such as? Racism? Endless wars? Torture? War crimes? Corruption?

He'll support whatever war is coming too.

A massive con, which it must be said the Labour left fell for hook, line and sinker.

If it's a question of class, then BME voters who see themselves as middle class and upwardly mobile vote Tory not Lib Dem.
1303820601874931712 2020-09-10 06:20:29 +0800 <epiplexis_> @cymrurouge Yep, but also with regard to that specific claim: why would identifiable groups of people who have historically favoured Labour and specifically favoured the leader at the time have chosen a party which has limited appeal among said groups.

1301562456188358658 2020-09-04 00:47:26 +0800 <epiplexis_> The Times was right-wing when @PhilipJCollins1 started working there. Indeed, he was there for that very reason.  Now it's moving far-right.  And once again, it's important to note that @DAaronovitch is completely quiet about this.
1301513352913530884 2020-09-03 21:32:18 +0800 <epiplexis_> @DurstApologist @lmartods I've worked in different workplaces: offshore; site offices; "proper" corporate offices as an employee and a contractor; for myself in my own office/home office.  You're not missing much.

1301444027166883840 2020-09-03 16:56:50 +0800 <epiplexis_> "Labour are listening - the Govt are asleep at the wheel."  If the government are sleeping at the wheel, then all Labour is doing is "listening" to them crash the vehicle and kill loads of people.  Stupid careerist hack.

1301215759163707393 2020-09-03 01:49:47 +0800 <epiplexis_> @joolsd One of the weirdest and bleak things I discovered when reading up on the US police was civil asset forfeiture. It's utterly corrupt by most accounts and I suspect hatred of the police even in the US is more widespread than many stereotypes anticipate.
1301214811745812486 2020-09-03 01:46:01 +0800 <epiplexis_> @gem_ste And then there's the Worboys stuff they'll outsource to certain muckraking websites.

1301209846398808067 2020-09-03 01:26:17 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Philgebunts @cymrurouge There is an element of that: my main interest is that stuff like MMT shows it has always been about brute power, not "hard work" or "sensible economics", but as you note the chance for taking that power has evaporated in recent months.
1301207112425648131 2020-09-03 01:15:25 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Philgebunts @cymrurouge I'm only a layman here, but on the technicalities I think MMT is sort of post-Keynes, so you're not wrong to say it has a lot of stuff is familiar, but it reworks it in a different way ("print" rather than "borrow" in my layman's understanding).
1301206490183880704 2020-09-03 01:12:57 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Philgebunts @cymrurouge We have two broad options: use whatever we have now to get to a world beyond capitalism, or have a (violent) revolution where we completely change the way we think about a political economy.  I see heterodox economics like MMT in the former category.
1301201648132534273 2020-09-03 00:53:42 +0800 <epiplexis_> @cymrurouge @Philgebunts We've just seen two events either side of the last decade which shows that "making money and giving it to people" can work when there's the political will. It's always been a question of equity, not mathematics.
1301200866498748418 2020-09-03 00:50:36 +0800 <epiplexis_> They only need to put a photo of John Worboys next to Kieth QC and the rest will be history.

1301118598577094660 2020-09-02 19:23:42 +0800 <epiplexis_> @willdizard Imo, his main personal failing was to be too reconciliatory with his internal Labour enemies and try to convince them they had a common cause against the other side. He should have been a mean bastard, but then that's not why he won the leadership in the first place.
1301117947050688513 2020-09-02 19:21:06 +0800 <epiplexis_> @willdizard The same (yes complicated) multifarious reasons Bernie Sanders didn't win. Institutional, historical, party factionalism, sociological, pushback from the establishment across-the-board, how our version of machine politics works, and the British specific one: Brexit.
1301115747918376960 2020-09-02 19:12:22 +0800 <epiplexis_> @willdizard The day after the Manchester bombings (in which the perpetrators have a murky background linked to British foreign policy in Libya...), Corbyn spoke explicitly on foreign policy and terrorism... and subsequent opinion polls agreed with him.  https://t.co/1bWBkus14x
1301114839146942465 2020-09-02 19:08:45 +0800 <epiplexis_> @willdizard What did for Corbyn was caving in on Brexit. That's on him for sure, but his instincts (get it over with, make a public stand to respect the EU referendum) were correct.
1301114163595485186 2020-09-02 19:06:04 +0800 <epiplexis_> Barmy take, but not surprising given the "source" of the facts being presented.
1301114025942683650 2020-09-02 19:05:31 +0800 <epiplexis_> @willdizard No, it's not. It's a stupid article by a clueless fool.  Name a time Hillary Clinton said she'd rather go to jail in suppot of a popular protest and riots then pay a hated tax introduced by a sitting government.
