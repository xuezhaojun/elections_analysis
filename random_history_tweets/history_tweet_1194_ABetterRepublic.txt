1339977766767382528 2020-12-19 00:56:09 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Anyone else surprised Trump isn’t strutting around selfgrandizing himself with the COVID vaccine? Guess he’s still moping with his epic election loss.

1339257576119209990 2020-12-17 01:14:23 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Lots of editorials in the paper today that Dems aren’t giving Trump credit for Warp Speed.  This one thing he did, but we haven’t forgotten him neglecting the pandemic for so long, the high infection &amp; death rates.   It’s surprising he did anything at all, really. So unlike him.  https://t.co/JnMxG67lWy

The rest of the states are winner takes all, which hardly seems fair for those who vote for the minority candidate.

These Pennsylvania votes came from... New York. 3. The USPS is now the villain even after pulling mailboxes and sorting machines.

Talk about ‘illegal’ votes...
1328517794867126272 2020-11-17 09:58:19 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> @CREWcrew Trump - “It’s only rigged if I lose.” Graham - “Let’s rig it so you win.”
1328504334594797574 2020-11-17 09:04:50 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> A Catholic, a woman of color, a teacher, and a Jew all enter the White House with 4 Rescue Dogs.   No punchline.  Just an amazing truth.
1328492956949635073 2020-11-17 08:19:37 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Buh bye.  https://t.co/zciZpIVsDM
1328370823799975936 2020-11-17 00:14:18 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump I thought you went to Harvard. The number is closer to 20,000. That's 20,000 more than there should be, but that what we get when we have an administration that specializes in alternative facts and conspiracy theories.
1328363577468661762 2020-11-16 23:45:31 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Twitter is tired of you.

1328125642622251024 2020-11-16 08:00:03 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> This guy is Trump’s final hope. Doesn’t look promising.

1328088055400566785 2020-11-16 05:30:41 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Trump lawyers have abruptly dropped core claims, been admonished in court for lack of candor and even been forced to admit they had no evidence of fraud.  https://t.co/4dZKHEhmZP
1328086827803217921 2020-11-16 05:25:49 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> The Trump ‘2-Week Plan’ that never was:  1. “Full and complete" health care plan.  2. Minimum wage plan 3. Pandemic plan - “They'll be down within two weeks, they're figuring." 4. Infrastructure plan 5. ISIS plan 6. Labor plan 7. Prescription plan 8. Stimulus package plan

1328026990574702594 2020-11-16 01:28:02 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> So the endgame is Trump cannot cheat his way into another term when his own party will not refuse the corporate hand that feeds them. That or perhaps they relocated the balls they lost 4 years ago.
1328026989396189189 2020-11-16 01:28:02 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> THE GOP IS LISTENING. State GOP lawmakers in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin have said they will NOT intervene in the selection of electors. Several noted that such a move would violate state law and “a vote of the people.”

1328018705360547842 2020-11-16 00:55:07 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> AP article -  24 Fortune 500 CEOs agreed to tolerate Trump’s legal battles. HOWEVER,  if he tries to undo the legal process or redirect electoral college votes away from Biden, they threaten to stop donations to PACs or relocate their corporate HQs.
1327998315330490379 2020-11-15 23:34:06 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Yes we will.
1327997144536641536 2020-11-15 23:29:26 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Trump is golfing today. Such a busy man.

Still, his credibility and relevance is as low as you. We find it amusingly pathetic that all you have left is Rudy. Good luck with that.
1327991405889925120 2020-11-15 23:06:38 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> @Schumann786 Oh, we’re not done.  1. Level the Senate - support Georgia Dems 2. We SORELY need campaign &amp; election reform 3. Find a way to hold representatives accountable for their actions or inaction.  4. Make politicians, social media &amp; fringe news outlets accountable for misinformation

1327778885023494144 2020-11-15 09:02:09 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Well, what do you know. We actually agree on something.
1327777035217989633 2020-11-15 08:54:48 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> It was a million if you count who showed up and then count them again 9 more times. You know, kind of like what they want to do with the PA Trump vote.

PLEASE!! Something has got to stick!
1327770385119637506 2020-11-15 08:28:23 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> @realDonaldTrump plans to sue the Million MAGA March because 900,000 didn’t show up. 🤣
1327696218340913152 2020-11-15 03:33:40 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> #MillionMoronMarch  MAGA rallies seem to equate to unschooled-man-child-get-togethers. On the bright side, I'm sure their abused spouses are happy they are out of the trailer home for the day.
1327687264063938569 2020-11-15 02:58:05 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> I guess they're no good at math either.

You said this about the GOP primaries, popular vote in 2016, 2018 elections, and now this. Never, ever provided us with any valid evidence.   You are a sore loser and a pathological liar.

1327045478299602944 2020-11-13 08:27:51 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> GOP lawyers and enablers are fawning over the lawsuit they won today over a handful of ballots. As if that will make any difference.
1327043425384927233 2020-11-13 08:19:42 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> @alibreland @chrislhayes 1. Baseless conspiracy theory is posted anonymously.  2. Right-wing blogger cites it.  3. Conservative news outlet picks it up.  4. President of the United States (devoid of rational thought) spreads it as supposed fact.
1327040128783708161 2020-11-13 08:06:36 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> @CNN I see this going two ways -  1. Trump skirts future prosecution. Starts another 4-year round of truth-free adulation rallies. Slanders his way into another primary.  2. Trump cannot escape all prosecution. Revelations continue to surface. Reputation too tarnished for a viable run

1327027378024046592 2020-11-13 07:15:56 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> @senatemajldr Let me rephrase that-  It is sad to see leading Republicans including the Senate Majority Leader treat the election like a fraud. Some things must be bigger than politics.  Leaders should be cheering the president l-elect, not baselessly undermining our democracy.
1326977119222640647 2020-11-13 03:56:13 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Retired General Barry McCaffrey compared Trump's pattern of behavior to that of a Third World dictator and said "the strongman's trying to take over the country and defy an election." - RR 🔵 Cartoon by Rob Rogers for Counterpoint  https://t.co/N2xvvBfdeN

1326969603537444865 2020-11-13 03:26:22 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Biden has every right to claim his mandate at this point. Whatever Pompeo says to the contrary, whatever unreality Republican lawmakers are living in, Biden will take office on January 20, 2021. As for Donald Trump, he has finished the 2020 election as a loser. - @NicholsUprising  https://t.co/5UFRecL0Vx
1326968782968025088 2020-11-13 03:23:06 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> @realDonaldTrump @ChanelRion @OANN Fun Fact:  Biden will likely finish with a better Electoral College percentage than a dozen presidents who were elected over the past 231 years, including John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and our current man-child pumpkin.

1326710640392761346 2020-11-12 10:17:20 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> This is what I find unnerving -  1. Trump’s legal team gets court orders to delay vote certification in critical states  2. This positions Republican-controlled state legislatures to appoint pro-Trump electors  3. Pro-Trump electors swing the Electoral College in his favor.
1326707680870887424 2020-11-12 10:05:34 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> @atrupar This would be an act of treason. If they do this, the House can contest this and stop it. They should know this.

1326640000453238784 2020-11-12 05:36:38 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> @Jim_Jordan The reason why "so many Trump voters believe there is something not right with the 2020 Election vote count" is because of people like Jim Jordan.  BTW - the article says Trump should run AGAIN in 2020. I think you mean 2024, but he'll be in jail by then.

1326570423232892928 2020-11-12 01:00:10 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Dec. 8 is a big day - That is the deadline for resolving election disputes at the state level. All state recounts and court contests over presidential election results HAVE to be completed by this date.  Expect a lot of noise until then.
1326568901015195650 2020-11-12 00:54:07 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Claim: “WATCH FOR MASSIVE BALLOT COUNTING ABUSE AND, JUST LIKE THE EARLY VACCINE, REMEMBER I TOLD YOU SO!” - Trump on election night  Fact: Election officials from both parties stated publicly the election went well and international observers confirmed no serious irregularities.
1326568391939928065 2020-11-12 00:52:05 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> “Pennsylvania prevented us from watching much of the Ballot count. Unthinkable and illegal in this country.”  - Trump on Monday  Fact: Trump’s lawyers admitted in court that their campaign had observers in the room — “a non-zero” number of them, as they put it.
1326567821577515009 2020-11-12 00:49:49 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Claim: “Georgia will be a big presidential win, as it was the night of the Election!” - Trump on Monday  Fact: Ballots counted after Election Day in Georgia and 20 other states is explicitly allowed, and the Supreme Court did not stand in the way of it.
1326567086647291904 2020-11-12 00:46:54 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Claim: "Thanks to the public-private partnership forged by President @realDonaldTrump, @pfizer announced its Coronavirus Vaccine trial is EFFECTIVE."

1324791800691937285 2020-11-07 03:12:33 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> This is the Trump we knew was lying in wait for us at the end of his misbegotten adventure as president. This is the authoritarian we knew would shred the last vestige of the rule of law in an animal panic, and hope for disorder if the American people rejected him. @TomNichols02

1323026757793046534 2020-11-02 06:18:54 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> All of these alleged crimes occurred before Trump took office. That means no claims of executive privilege would apply and the alleged offenses took place less than six years ago, within the statute of limitation for fraud in New York.
1323026756987662336 2020-11-02 06:18:54 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> State laws aren’t subject to presidential pardons. Manhattan D.A. Cyrus Vance  Jr. is looking into “extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization,” potentially involving bank fraud, tax fraud, and insurance fraud.
1323026756215939074 2020-11-02 06:18:53 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Scholars are divided on whether a self-pardon is constitutional, so it is likely this case would almost certainly wind up getting litigated all the way to the Supreme Court. Yet another reason why the GOP has been so keen on packing the court in his favor.
1323026755351908368 2020-11-02 06:18:53 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> From Jeff Wise, New Yorker Before Trump leaves office, don't be surprised if he issues a broad, sweeping pardon for any U.S. citizen who was a subject, a target, or a person of interest of the Mueller investigation, including himself.

1321925319654297601 2020-10-30 05:22:11 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> It is for this reason you see blatantly false negative political ads, especially on cable, that often run without repercussions. The other candidate may cry foul, but it’s up to the candidate running the negative ad to pull it, (which they often do from the bad publicity.)
1321925318756716544 2020-10-30 05:22:10 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> A federal candidate who runs profane and potentially libelous ads cannot be censored by the station unless the content violates federal criminal law. Since the station has no choice but to run the spot, it is exempt from liability.
1321925317875978248 2020-10-30 05:22:10 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Third-party ads from PACs (political action committees), interest groups or from anyone other than a federal office candidate and his/her committee never qualify for equal time.
1321925317037096966 2020-10-30 05:22:10 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Legally qualified candidates for federal offices have a right to “reasonable access” to broadcast time. Candidates for state or local offices have no such right under the Communications Act.
1321925315980070920 2020-10-30 05:22:10 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Cable TV content is not regulated because cable does not use the “public” airwaves. Cable can do whatever it wants.
1321925314302349314 2020-10-30 05:22:09 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> A primer on political ads -  If a broadcast station or radio station sells ad time or offers free time to a candidate for an office, it has to offer similar access to other qualified candidates.

1317641721396822018 2020-10-18 09:40:41 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Trump on Friday said he would blame Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis if he lost Florida and quipped about firing him.

1316770837089996800 2020-10-16 00:00:06 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> In Florida, 850,000 Democrats have already returned their mail-in ballots (me included) compared to 480,000 Republicans.   If Biden is ahead on election night by even 1%, the only ballots left to count will be military, overseas, &amp; provisional which favor Biden anyway.
1316768820527280131 2020-10-15 23:52:05 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan cannot open and start counting mail-in ballots until Election Day. We’re talking millions of ballots.   How stupid is that?
1316763704323723264 2020-10-15 23:31:46 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is allowing all sports stadiums to open at full capacity.

A ‘smoking gun’ would verify that the meeting took place. There was no meeting. As Trump Jr. so aptly puts it, “It’s a nothing burger.”
1316469419015634949 2020-10-15 04:02:22 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> @DonaldJTrumpJr To think that 34,000 people liked this debunked pile of steaming misinformation, knowing this has been investigated with nothing to show for it, or as you like to call, a 'nothing burger.'

1316192885864312837 2020-10-14 09:43:32 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> At his first campaign rally since being hospitalized for the virus, Trump told a Florida crowd on Monday that Biden has “a lot of bad days coming.” Yea, he does -- cleaning up another GOP mess.

1315104897075941376 2020-10-11 09:40:15 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> 5. Trump defended interrupting of Joe Biden during the debate, saying Biden’s mind is “gone” and would have eventually started talking about the “birds and the bees” if the president had let him speak. Trump also claimed that Biden doesn’t know what social security is.
1315104896295862274 2020-10-11 09:40:15 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> 3. Trump claims a “very smart” friend of his told him that he “must be the most honest guy in the world.” 4. Trump whined about Hillary Clinton’s emails and demanded that she be imprisoned

1311379901853978629 2020-10-01 02:58:27 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> When Wallace asked Trump why he packed campaign events while Biden held smaller gatherings, Trump said, “Because nobody will show up.

1311338208945467392 2020-10-01 00:12:47 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> TRUMP, on the prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process, “It’s a rigged election.”  THE FACTS: Experts have repeatedly said there are no signs of widespread fraud in mail balloting.
1311338207632556038 2020-10-01 00:12:46 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> TRUMP, addressing Biden: “You didn’t do very well on the swine flu. H1N1. You were a disaster.”  THE FACTS: The N1H1 pandemic killed far fewer people and Biden wasn’t in charge. And that response was faster out of the gate than when COVID-19 came to the U.S.
1311338206298808323 2020-10-01 00:12:46 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> But that changed as the highly contagious nature of the coronavirus became clear. Fauci, Redfield, and Birx all agree on the importance of wearing masks and practicing social distancing.
1311338204868550657 2020-10-01 00:12:46 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> TRUMP: Dr. Anthony Fauci “said very strongly, ‘masks are not good.’ Then he changed his mind, he said, ‘masks, good.’”  THE FACTS: Early on in the outbreak, public health officials urged everyday people not to use masks, fearing short supplies of personal protective equipment.
1311338203224440833 2020-10-01 00:12:45 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> TRUMP: “Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%.”  THE FACTS: Trump has been unable to get legislation to lower drug prices through Congress. The latest data from Aug. 2020, drug prices went up 3.6%, according to an analysis by economist Paul Hughes-Cromwick
1311317854692798471 2020-09-30 22:51:54 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> TRUMP: “The (Portland, Oregon) sheriff just came out today and he said I support President Trump.”  THE FACTS: That is false.

1311141850409992196 2020-09-30 11:12:31 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> 3. Three strikes, you’re out. If any candidate is warned 3 times for breaking the rules, they must leave the stage. The remainder of time is then given to the other candidate.
1311141113915494401 2020-09-30 11:09:36 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Well, he should have. He’s the moderator. He’s in charge, not Trump, not Biden. Follow the rules or get off the stage.
1311140256855490566 2020-09-30 11:06:11 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> In summary -
1311137333744472065 2020-09-30 10:54:34 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> If we do these two other debates, it’s clear we must: 1. Turn on only the microphone of the person who is supposed to speak.  2. Further the distance between the candidates so they cannot be heard on the other’s mike.
1311135458915758082 2020-09-30 10:47:07 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> @matthewamiller @LOLGOP NBC is currently making this point.
1311134694256398338 2020-09-30 10:44:05 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> @GOPChairwoman If 82% of Americans make over $400,000.   Since 82% don’t, you just need to shut the fuck up.
1311130720874762241 2020-09-30 10:28:18 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> @megynkelly Not his job, you pathetic twit. That’s the moderator’s job. Fact is, no one, not you, not Wallace , not the Constitution, can control this Psychopath-in-Chief.
1311130140114653190 2020-09-30 10:25:59 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> @NikkiHaley Pretty sure no has done as much damage as your Dear Leader in 47 months.
1311128223661649921 2020-09-30 10:18:22 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> I think Pelosi was right.  You can’t debate a blowhard.
1311123492042092544 2020-09-30 09:59:34 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> “We believe in law and order.” - Trump  I guess if you believe gassing peaceful protesters is law and order, than sure.
1311119672486445057 2020-09-30 09:44:24 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> “I was a private business people.” - Trump
1311114363575689217 2020-09-30 09:23:18 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Chris Wallace is rattled. The only way I see this going forward is turning off microphones until it’s their turn to talk.
1311112270034939905 2020-09-30 09:14:59 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> This debate is a clusterfuck. Wallace needs to take control.

1311092101023662081 2020-09-30 07:54:50 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> This debate will go down in history because the GOP releases the debate results BEFORE the debate.

She’s hot, right?” - Calls Ivanka “voluptuous” - Described her as “a piece of ass” - “I've said if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her." - When asked what were their favorite things, Trump answered, “I was going to say sex.”  https://t.co/4IEz67ZkRJ

1310620721190760448 2020-09-29 00:41:44 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> @realDonaldTrump “Very little debt” if you believe $450 million is little. We look forward to seeing you in court for tax fraud.
1310619481279016965 2020-09-29 00:36:49 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> However, do you really believe a person with a clear record of racism, who tells black representatives to “go back where you came from” and white nationalists “are fine people,”would follow through on a such a promise made just weeks before election?
1310619480381427713 2020-09-29 00:36:48 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Trump proposed plan aims to increase access to capital in black communities by @ $500 billion, diversity training for police, increased access to grants for Black entrepreneurs, and a proposal to make Juneteenth a holiday. These are all good things.
1310605316397174785 2020-09-28 23:40:31 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Biden’s team has been aggressively preparing to take on the president at the upcoming debate.   Trump has decided to skip any formal preparation. But then, when you have the attention span of a gnat, what would you expect?
1310603423625236480 2020-09-28 23:33:00 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Imagine that. Atlas, who has no experience in infectious disease, is feeding misinformation to the president.   https://t.co/bdNfPTad79

1310397807463985155 2020-09-28 09:55:57 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> @realDonaldTrump For someone known for his unparalleled failure, laughable intellect, lack of credentials, and unyielding disloyalty to the Constitution, this must have been an awkward moment for you.
1310389423490596864 2020-09-28 09:22:39 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Exactly. It’s not so much he running for re-election (other than pure hubris) than he’s running away from something else.

1310386273849352192 2020-09-28 09:10:08 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> @donwinslow Might also mention that in 10 of the last 15 years Trump paid no federal income tax. None. Zero. While living in opulence.
1310383399291453441 2020-09-28 08:58:42 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Trump has personally guaranteed hundreds of millions of dollars in loans, a decision that led his lenders to threaten to force him into personal bankruptcy. He is personally responsible for loans and other debts totaling $421 million, with most of it coming due within four years.  https://t.co/asL0nSk8kM
1310383386960121857 2020-09-28 08:58:39 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka Trump are longtime employees of the Trump Organization. The tax records show that the three siblings had each drawn a salary from their father’s company — roughly $480,000 a year, jumping to about $2 million after Mr. Trump became president.  https://t.co/LXslgSJGuB
1310383378903031808 2020-09-28 08:58:37 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Ivanka Trump reported receiving payments from a consulting company she co-owned, totaling $747,622, that exactly matched consulting fees claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization.  https://t.co/oy2tuZcgFQ
1310383370761900034 2020-09-28 08:58:35 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Mr. Trump has an established track record of stiffing his lenders. But the tax returns reveal that he has failed to pay back far more money than previously known: a total of $287 million since 2010.  https://t.co/2l3Iw6f3sg
1310383363484774401 2020-09-28 08:58:34 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Most of Mr. Trump’s core enterprises — from his constellation of golf courses to his conservative-magnet hotel in Washington — report losing millions, if not tens of millions, of dollars year after year.  https://t.co/R3elbC8haX
1310383354353782784 2020-09-28 08:58:32 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> In 2018, Mr. Trump announced in his disclosure that he had made at least $434.9 million. The tax records deliver a very different portrait of his bottom line: $47.4 million in losses.  https://t.co/sSw5Yn2mjJ
1310383346527211520 2020-09-28 08:58:30 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> A brief summary from the NYT report as told by gifs: - Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency.  - In his first year in the White House, he paid another $750.  - He had paid NO income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years.  https://t.co/ub9RvcFIYq
1310323965827710978 2020-09-28 05:02:32 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Barrett thought it was a bad idea to fill a SCOTUS seat on an election year in 2016.  The hypocrisy of the GOP is inexcusable.

Trump has been so hammering on Biden's cognitive abilities, that Trumpers expect Biden to be an unprepared babbling idiot. If we have live fact-checking, the shoe will be on the other foot.

1308774334169784320 2020-09-23 22:24:51 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Trump said it was “a shame” the U.S. reached 200,000 deaths but claimed the toll could have been much worse. “I think if we didn’t do it properly and do it right, you’d have 2.5 million deaths.”  But he’s still hoping.  https://t.co/DCvBIbhC8J

1302297265533521930 2020-09-06 01:27:18 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> QAnon conspiracy theorist &amp; Georgia GOP pick Marjorie Greene posted a photo holding an assault rifle with the ‘squad’ Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib and Ayanna Presley. She also proudly posed a photo with former Ku Klux Klan leader Chester Doles.  WTF is wrong with Georgia?  https://t.co/u8vOi1hGj9

1302050089205202944 2020-09-05 09:05:06 +0800 <ABetterRepublic> Trump denies this. When lying come as natural as breathing, it’s what you do. If you still believe anything this psychopath says, you’re an idiot.
