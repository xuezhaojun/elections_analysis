Even brunettes sicilians (you know, there are blonde sicilians too). Maybe you mean slightly dark than pink, but if you have actual brown nipples, you come frome other parts of the world.

There are accounts who are way more controversial who are still up cause they don't have white in their name. If you have it, you are an easy target: you considered a naked "white supremacist" according to twitter laws
