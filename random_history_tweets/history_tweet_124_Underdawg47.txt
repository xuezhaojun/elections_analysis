1338986898748919808 2020-12-16 07:18:48 +0800 <Underdawg47> @DonaldMBraden Good, I hope they do get blamed. People on the far left are the ones that will cheer for her courage. The left are the ones who got her elected, not the centrists
1338985886759849984 2020-12-16 07:14:47 +0800 <Underdawg47> @DonaldMBraden Exactly, this should not be a bluff. They MUST be willing to deny Pelosi the Speaker position.
1338985613664559104 2020-12-16 07:13:42 +0800 <Underdawg47> 6. There is no great loss if Pelosi actually loses the Speaker of the House position. Tell me how that corrupt women is any different than having a Republican as Speaker of the House.
1338985227998261251 2020-12-16 07:12:10 +0800 <Underdawg47> 5. AOC and Bernie begged people to vote for Biden saying they were going to push back hard on day one. Well now is the time to rock the damned boat. No more waiting, or doing crap out of fear. She needs to prove that she is more than a sheepdog.
1338984577071648768 2020-12-16 07:09:34 +0800 <Underdawg47> 4. AOC promised she would do EVERYTHING in her power to push for Medicare for All. This is her opportunity and she is not there to make friends.
1338984153463701504 2020-12-16 07:07:53 +0800 <Underdawg47> 3. The reason people voted for the squad was not because they were compliant, but because they were defiant and antagonized centrists. AOC will only get more support if she pushes hard for progressive policies and takes risks.
1338983566085029888 2020-12-16 07:05:33 +0800 <Underdawg47> 2. Being able to say no is a position of power, not weakness. Being that Democrats have a slim majority means that they NEED the squad's votes to get anything done.
1338983014001307649 2020-12-16 07:03:22 +0800 <Underdawg47> Why I think the squad needs to withhold a vote for Pelosi unless she calls for a vote on medicare For All.  1. Now is the time when the squad has the most power. If Nancy really wants the Speaker of the House position, she will be forced to bring medicare up for a vote, if not...

Aiming at the squad is the right move because they are still on our side, they must be steered in the right direction because the rest of the clowns in congress have already been corrupted and can't be moved.
1338967348624035840 2020-12-16 06:01:07 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Dmilliganspeaks @swissch33z @RealTimBlack I suppose they could vote no twice
1338966612603412481 2020-12-16 05:58:11 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RealTimBlack I still will follow you and  think you are a great guy, but I think ANYTHING the squad will do will be used against them. I think a direct attack against Pelosi is a good thing and being able to say no is a position of power. The Tea Party used this tactic and it worked.
1338963752125779969 2020-12-16 05:46:49 +0800 <Underdawg47> @proviewsusa @DNC Nope, I'm not wasting my time or money again when we know they will cheat. I will be supporting a 3rd party
1338962654954602496 2020-12-16 05:42:28 +0800 <Underdawg47> @swissch33z @RealTimBlack I agree. How would a Republican as Speaker of the House be any different than having Pelosi? She is the queen of rotten.
1338961360848187393 2020-12-16 05:37:19 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RealTimBlack I actually think this is a battle that can work. Being able to say no is a position of power. It shows Democrats that you are capable of not voting along with other Democrats and have to be listened to in the future. Plus denying Pelosi the speaker position is no great loss.

If she doesn't, she should absolutely lose the Speaker of the House seat. She isn't any better than a Republican anyway, so no great loss.

1338350824620085250 2020-12-14 13:11:16 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JadedMang @MNosdivad @TheWordofDon @AOC AOC doesn't have to vote for Pelosi. She is not there to be a career politician or make friends. She is supposed to use what little leverage she has to get policy we want, not tell us there aren't enough votes, we already know that   We should mutiny and protest.
1338349615104462848 2020-12-14 13:06:28 +0800 <Underdawg47> @SetJulianFree @SAVoltolin I don't worship AOC, nor do I think she will really try to help in the Democratic Party. She herself ran on Medicare For All and it is our job to call her out on her shit.

1338247933548847104 2020-12-14 06:22:25 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheWordofDon @AOC Sounds like you are waiting your time trying to budge that fat corporate party. AOC was supposed to be the progressive hope to change the party from within, but all I see is a slow merging with the establishment. I think it is better to abandon the Democratic Party entirely.
1338246903255855105 2020-12-14 06:18:19 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheWordofDon @AOC What mandate did you get?
1338246557485813760 2020-12-14 06:16:57 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheWordofDon @AOC You haven't gotten Democrats to stop voting for military budgets, wars, or voting along with Republicans on fiscal issues
1338246174248079360 2020-12-14 06:15:26 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheWordofDon @AOC So what have you gotten establishment Dems to do?
1338245939916464128 2020-12-14 06:14:30 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheWordofDon @AOC You mean like Bernie running around the country with Tom Perez pretending to be doing reforms to the Democratic Party that never happened? I have not been a fan of Bernie's strategies regarding the DNC
1338244447960633344 2020-12-14 06:08:34 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheWordofDon @AOC You sound like an establishment Democrat
1338244264455675907 2020-12-14 06:07:50 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheWordofDon @AOC Yes, secure in her seat. The key word is secure. You act as if politicians should not be called out for not using everything in their power to make change
1338243628234203136 2020-12-14 06:05:18 +0800 <Underdawg47> @CJCv90 @CTPatriot2006 @ZBooksTX @BenjaminPDixon @AOC Well, right now I have nothing being unemployed, no healthcare, and living off of savings.

1338242518148771840 2020-12-14 06:00:54 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheWordofDon @AOC Yeah, this means she depends upon more than just her district to remain in office without taking corporate cash.

1338240177207009280 2020-12-14 05:51:36 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheWordofDon @AOC And yet she was begging for money from those outside her district

Medicare for all is just a bare minimum of what they should be demanding. She was begging voters to vote for Biden out of fear and I'm tired of politicians acting out of fear.

1338238384129540096 2020-12-14 05:44:28 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheWordofDon @AOC I didn't say it was easy. She decided that she would take the job and ALL the responsibilities that come with it. It is her job to represent the wishes of the people and to vote accordingly  I am not a public speaker, nor do I seek public office
1338236566750326784 2020-12-14 05:37:15 +0800 <Underdawg47> @CJCv90 @CTPatriot2006 @ZBooksTX @BenjaminPDixon @AOC I think AOC and the other squad members should use their position to deny any Democrat positions of power with their vote if certain demands are not met.
1338235913063698433 2020-12-14 05:34:39 +0800 <Underdawg47> @CJCv90 @CTPatriot2006 @ZBooksTX @BenjaminPDixon @AOC No, I don't trust them. Medicare For All should be on the table now whether they have the votes or not.
1338235272232759296 2020-12-14 05:32:06 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheWordofDon @AOC I don't give a crap how old she is. She is there to do a job. She has political leverage now before the 3rd session starts. Before the speak of the house is voted upon.
1338234764235472897 2020-12-14 05:30:05 +0800 <Underdawg47> @HeickVirginia @SAVoltolin Yes, I totally agree
1338234593380425728 2020-12-14 05:29:24 +0800 <Underdawg47> @CJCv90 @CTPatriot2006 @ZBooksTX @BenjaminPDixon @AOC Biden and Pelosi have already said they would support 15. We need much more than just 15 and hour. It doesn't matter if they don't have the votes for Medicare For All. It puts pressure on the rest of them.
1338234074431811586 2020-12-14 05:27:21 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheWordofDon @AOC AOC should be held to higher standards. Her job is not supposed to be easy. It is not toxic to demand certain things from our politicians. We should be doing this to all of our elected officials. Most politicians start off with good intension but become corrupted along the way.
1338232714659418114 2020-12-14 05:21:56 +0800 <Underdawg47> @SAVoltolin I really hate seeing pictures of progressives cozying up to Corporate stooges like Pelosi. AOC is not in congress to make friends.
1338231901597749248 2020-12-14 05:18:43 +0800 <Underdawg47> @CJCv90 @CTPatriot2006 @ZBooksTX @BenjaminPDixon @AOC But why would she even vote for Pelosi in the first place? Why not use her position to threaten to not vote for Pelosi for something in  return? It shows power.
1338231207763398656 2020-12-14 05:15:57 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RogerRinaldi1 It sounds like you pay a lot for the unknown.

1338225737564745728 2020-12-14 04:54:13 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ZBooksTX @CTPatriot2006 @BenjaminPDixon @AOC @jimmy_dore I think holding politicians responsible on social media is very important. A politician's job should be difficult and they should be called out in public when they aren't doing everything in their power to push for policies that they were elected to vote for.
1338224635427520512 2020-12-14 04:49:50 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ZBooksTX @CTPatriot2006 @BenjaminPDixon @AOC Tell you what. I will hold politicians accountable. It should be a job that nobody wants to have. Politicians get paid very well and they should have to face scrutiny by the public.
1338223052404924416 2020-12-14 04:43:33 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheMarieFonseca I don't like it when people elevate politicians to celebrity status. They are supposed to be public servants who were put there to do a specific job. It is our job to make sure they are doing it right and to criticize them when they are falling short.

1338221126367887360 2020-12-14 04:35:54 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JENFL23 AOC is not the enemy, but she was also put in congress to use her political power. It is always important for us as citizens to hold their feet to the fire and expect certain things of them. They are supposed to be working for us with their votes.
1338220456495595520 2020-12-14 04:33:14 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TeamPelosi Without Medicare For All, who can really afford crappy Obamacare? We don't want healthcare run by, "for profit"  insurance companies.
1338219841430245376 2020-12-14 04:30:47 +0800 <Underdawg47> @djhutch74 I don't think it is negative. I think it is important for politicians like AOC's feet to be held to the fire now than later. This is the point where even the most well intentioned politicians tend to stray from their elected purpose and fall in line with the establishment.
1338217977917841408 2020-12-14 04:23:23 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ZBooksTX @CTPatriot2006 @BenjaminPDixon @AOC I think AOC and other progressives should be criticized always. They were put in congress to push for progressive policies and use what little bargaining power they have, not to just roll over and vote along with the establishment or work on their career.

1338210274780712960 2020-12-14 03:52:46 +0800 <Underdawg47> @AnaKasparian @AOC AOC should be held accountable. She should be fighting for progressive policies and not just voting for Pelosi with nothing in return. That is why AOC was put there in the first place. A progressive without action is just another corporate tool.

AOC and the squad are their to PUSH for progressive policies whether it can pass or not. They can use their power to gain public support. They can threaten Pelosi from her Speaker of the House position
1337963964446076930 2020-12-13 11:34:01 +0800 <Underdawg47> @BenjaminPDixon Jimmy Dore is holding politicians accountable for their actions or lack of action, isn't that what we are supposed to do as good citizens?  I think Jimmy Dore makes excellent sense. AOC should be using everything in her power to work for us.
1337961262441873409 2020-12-13 11:23:17 +0800 <Underdawg47> @AOC @matthewstoller I think you should threaten to withhold your vote for Pelosi unless she she answers to at least a demand for a vote on Medicare For All. Why would you not do this? Isn't this why you were sent to congress in the first place?
1337960525611692032 2020-12-13 11:20:22 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RWCombsJr2 Why doesn't AOC threaten to not vote for Pelosi as Speaker of the House unless she promises to have a vote on Medicare For All?

1336744373803859969 2020-12-10 02:47:48 +0800 <Underdawg47> @29squirrels @Ibrahimpols You call that video "Pushing Biden?"  That is a damned lame attempt. We don't need politeness or sugar coating when dealing with Biden.
1336742532483489793 2020-12-10 02:40:29 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MatthewVenus_ Biden is already picking his cabinet. Day one of Biden's inauguration is actually too late
1336741963043749889 2020-12-10 02:38:14 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TreeOnaCloud @Ibrahimpols I agree
1336741810064957440 2020-12-10 02:37:37 +0800 <Underdawg47> @njy_ny @Ibrahimpols No, but he is already choosing his cabinet
1336741721309245440 2020-12-10 02:37:16 +0800 <Underdawg47> @njy_ny @Ibrahimpols I was mad at Bernie long before this. I hated his stupid sheep dogging for Hillary and Biden.

1336739223139803141 2020-12-10 02:27:20 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden If you had any sense, you would push for medicare for all, but you are driven by your corporate donors.

1336468962645737473 2020-12-09 08:33:25 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Susokukan @Ibrahimpols yeah, unfortunately that is true.
1336467885292539907 2020-12-09 08:29:08 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Ibrahimpols Bernie also said he was gonna push Biden left on day one. I don't see much pushing or criticizing of the Biden administration coming from Bernie
1336466329717489665 2020-12-09 08:22:58 +0800 <Underdawg47> @AOC You need to tell Pelosi you will not vote for her unless she gives us something in writing. Stop pretending to be progressive and actually do constructive things that prove you are.

1335460158504280065 2020-12-06 13:44:48 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RogerRinaldi1 I agree that the government has turned us against one another, they always want to use social issues to hide the fact that both parties are robbing from its citizens.
1335459054034903044 2020-12-06 13:40:24 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RogerRinaldi1 we don't have to force the market, but we can make sure that the rules that corporations play by are fair, both to the corporation AND the workers.   I have enjoyed this conversation. You enjoy your night too.
1335458466563981318 2020-12-06 13:38:04 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RogerRinaldi1 Seems like we agree on many things. You have a good night
1335457008640782336 2020-12-06 13:32:17 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RogerRinaldi1 I'd like to see medicare for all as a basic standard for all of us. and Colleges shouldn't be expensive, they've become a greedy money making organizations that really aren't there to help students.  I think that all corporations should be forced to pay their workers a FAIR wage
1335455400628350979 2020-12-06 13:25:53 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RogerRinaldi1 Are you sure you aren't a progressive leftist? I totally agree with what you just said.
1335455109367513089 2020-12-06 13:24:44 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RogerRinaldi1 I'm sure that most working class people, both left &amp; right, share many things in common, being that most of us are victims of a corrupt corporate controlled government that doesn't give a shit about the working class. Both parties suck.
1335453731970695168 2020-12-06 13:19:15 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RogerRinaldi1 So do you support medicare for all, free college, forgive college debt, a living wage?  I hate govt wasting money on corporate welfare, and a bloated military budget. We could spend that money better on working people.
1335452022057791494 2020-12-06 13:12:28 +0800 <Underdawg47> @StephanieKelton @Landorcan Most politicians don't seem to care one bit about the deficit when it comes to the military or corporations, but strangely, they have no money to help actual citizens. They even want to take our all ready paid for Social security from us &amp; pretend as if it were some Govt charity

Even when Biden is POTUS they will not help anyone other than their corporate donors.
1335448781840498690 2020-12-06 12:59:35 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RogerRinaldi1 I will agree with you that pulling troops out is a good thing that Trump planned to do.   I disagree that 60's anarchists are in control of the Democratic party now. We have establishment, corporate backed neo-liberal war hawks in charge, and they are not the far left.

Democrats have been bitching about foreign countries interfering in our business and here is Joe doing it to other countries.

1321624850100707328 2020-10-29 09:28:13 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MarksMus1ngs @AOC Biden just helps make people like Trump possible. Biden is already too much like Trump. I'm voting for better policies and not for corrupt corporate bribed criminals.
1321622587907084288 2020-10-29 09:19:14 +0800 <Underdawg47> @EllePole22 @RealSteveCox @constabletlj But we don't want to help Biden win, that's the point, because it isn't winning with either Biden or Trump.
1321618273062957056 2020-10-29 09:02:05 +0800 <Underdawg47> @BernieSanders @MarkRuffalo As if Biden is going to stop fracking. Biden only listens to his corporate donors. You know this, Bernie and yet you beg us to vote for your corporate stooge friend.
1321617743150395399 2020-10-29 08:59:59 +0800 <Underdawg47> @blackangelband2 Its true. Bernie had good policies but he turned around and begged his followers to vote for the very corruption that he spoke out against, because of fear of Trump and foolishly thinking he can push Biden left. Not gonna happen. He did this sheep dogging crap twice.
1321614759922331648 2020-10-29 08:48:07 +0800 <Underdawg47> @allan_crawshaw It is sickening to see these huge trees being cut down
1321611909548797952 2020-10-29 08:36:48 +0800 <Underdawg47> @blackangelband2 That is Bernie's problem. He has good policies, terrible plans.
1321609193321738240 2020-10-29 08:26:00 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MarksMus1ngs @AOC I don't know. I don't vote on popularity contests, I vote on policy.
1321609005240758273 2020-10-29 08:25:15 +0800 <Underdawg47> @michaelg0428 @thehill and the media gave her over 90% chance of winning. She spent 1.2 billion bucks and still she lost to the orange clown.
1321608089976463361 2020-10-29 08:21:37 +0800 <Underdawg47> @realDonaldTrump well voting for either one of you will be a disaster. Offer people good policy and you would be ahead of Biden, but you offer nothing just like Biden.
1321607552954630145 2020-10-29 08:19:29 +0800 <Underdawg47> @DraftTulsi another corrupt corporate stooge.
1321607427473637376 2020-10-29 08:18:59 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RealSteveCox I agree. I wasn't gonna waste my vote on a corporate backed stooge that offered nothing in policy.
1321607092839460864 2020-10-29 08:17:39 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MarksMus1ngs @AOC The Green party offers these things and if people would vote for them, they would be viable.
1321606757106348033 2020-10-29 08:16:19 +0800 <Underdawg47> @michaelg0428 @thehill But she didn't become POTUS
1321606134214524928 2020-10-29 08:13:51 +0800 <Underdawg47> @DraftTulsi corruption
1321590573719932928 2020-10-29 07:12:01 +0800 <Underdawg47> @jocquebrawn @AOC He came right out and said on TV that he would
1321587070482014208 2020-10-29 06:58:06 +0800 <Underdawg47> @jocquebrawn @AOC Biden said he would veto medicare for all if it came across his desk. Biden also said he wanted regime change in Venezuela. I'm not voting for that crap.
1321586501835091968 2020-10-29 06:55:50 +0800 <Underdawg47> @thehill They gave Hillary a huge lead also right before the election and guess what?
1321586197882232832 2020-10-29 06:54:38 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LovesTheWords @TheDemocrats Democrats don't believe in Democracy when they remove 3rd parties from the ballots.

1321583117816061952 2020-10-29 06:42:23 +0800 <Underdawg47> @AOC yet Biden doesn't offer those things and you are pushing people to vote for him.
1321582106120646656 2020-10-29 06:38:22 +0800 <Underdawg47> @SAVoltolin Not, me either. I was fooled twice into thinking you could run a progressive in the corrupt Democratic Party for POTUS and discovered that you can't. I will put my energy and resources into a 3rd party in future elections. Bernie is welcome to move to a 3rd party, but he won't.
1321579981009379330 2020-10-29 06:29:55 +0800 <Underdawg47> @magabbqgirl @JoeBiden I don't like ACA at all. I think we should scrap it. Medicare for all is nothing like the unaffordable, for profit Obamacare.

1321549358270083072 2020-10-29 04:28:14 +0800 <Underdawg47> @aHeatherSalerno @JoeBiden I agree. We need medicare for all
1321540641730351104 2020-10-29 03:53:36 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TekshowPlays @JoeBiden it is not medicare for all and he wants to force that crappy mandate upon us again.
1321540417259630593 2020-10-29 03:52:43 +0800 <Underdawg47> @bdhunter5 @JoeBiden Biden wants to force expensive corporate crap upon us and Trump offers nothing. I didn't vote for either of those stooges.
1321538001407631360 2020-10-29 03:43:07 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Krose7315 @JoeBiden schools do not keep children out of school depending upon the employment of their parents. The fire department doesn't refuse to put out a fire depending upon whether someone is working our not. Our healthcare should be like Canada.
1321528925768486912 2020-10-29 03:07:03 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Krose7315 @JoeBiden Our health care shouldn't be depend upon our working status. This should come from taxes
1321526773570433044 2020-10-29 02:58:30 +0800 <Underdawg47> @magabbqgirl @JoeBiden So not being able to afford a doctor is lucky? I don't think that is being lucky
1321526168646901760 2020-10-29 02:56:06 +0800 <Underdawg47> @cleanaturalady @thehill Thinking that Biden is kind or a good man.

1321515554763538432 2020-10-29 02:13:55 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden access huh? Medicare for all is affordable, but Obamacare is expensive and lines the pockets of health insurance companies and leaves the rest of us in debt if we seek health care.
1321514629365854209 2020-10-29 02:10:14 +0800 <Underdawg47> @djhutch74 No, and neither is voting for Trump. They are both indebted to the fossil fuel industries.
1321513601283223552 2020-10-29 02:06:09 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden You think expensive health insurance companies should be forced upon us.
1321292577551851520 2020-10-28 11:27:53 +0800 <Underdawg47> @NicholeAnnLiv @PepperOceanna And why would he suspend his campaign because of Obama? Obama is not a progressive. Bernie doesn't have to campaign for these corporate stooges.

1321241101534064640 2020-10-28 08:03:20 +0800 <Underdawg47> @PepperOceanna No, Bernie has proven himself not to be a fighter and caves too easily to the establishment. Right now he is just sheep dogging for the corporate establishment and I'm not wasting my time with Democrats for POTUS ever again.

Obama didn't even fight for his supreme court pick. But here you are blaming Susan Sarandon. Shame on you.
1321163679413329920 2020-10-28 02:55:41 +0800 <Underdawg47> @KnolesMichael I think it comes down to fear and apathy. Most of us know what we really want and what needs to be done, but fear of something worse stands in our way. Nothing good in life is ever accomplished without risk of failure.

1320818238444302336 2020-10-27 04:03:02 +0800 <Underdawg47> @BernieSanders @MaryShulika Biden might understand these things, but his corporate donors tells him to do otherwise. Bernie, you look foolish trying to peddle your corporate stooge friend to the rest of us.
1320810308366073856 2020-10-27 03:31:31 +0800 <Underdawg47> @joshfoxfilm @GreenPartyUS @GOP Biden is the true destructive egomaniac liar, but you know this already. You, the "antifranking" guy has gone corporate, huh?
1320805347028733953 2020-10-27 03:11:48 +0800 <Underdawg47> @AskMeWhatIWant I've done everything on this list except get suspended from college. I stole a cabbage from a garden and got arrested for sleeping in a cemetery while being homeless.
1320801689289453568 2020-10-27 02:57:16 +0800 <Underdawg47> @SarcasmStardust The Biden clowns vs the Trump clowns don't have meaningful policies, just costumes, dance routines and platitudes.
1320801071560716290 2020-10-27 02:54:49 +0800 <Underdawg47> @erintothemax Maybe if RBG had just retired safely under Obama when she discovered she had cancer we wouldn't have this problem, or maybe if Obama had just fought harder for his supreme court pick things would be different, but Democrats are LAME. I don't think they really care.
1320799756768014341 2020-10-27 02:49:35 +0800 <Underdawg47> @WahidSakaKhan If we had socialized medicare care like the rest of the civilized world things would probably be different. Many people just can't afford our crappy healthcare in this country.

1320797086158262272 2020-10-27 02:38:59 +0800 <Underdawg47> @magabbqgirl @JoeBiden No, it will be like Canada healthcare. Most people like their healthcare in Canada. They don't have insurance companies as the middleman.
1320796250678067200 2020-10-27 02:35:40 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Inmate_9653 @JENFL23 It is no different. There is a huge wealth gap between the richest people and the poor in this country. This is a result of corporate bribery of our politicians
1320795480767410178 2020-10-27 02:32:36 +0800 <Underdawg47> @WahidSakaKhan That is true. Many of us are having to go to primitive medicines because we can't afford to see a doctor to get a regular prescription and treat our symptoms with herbal medicines. We also are just guessing on our illness with Dr Google.
1320793819751706625 2020-10-27 02:26:00 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JD_West2006 yeah, but it just sounds strange to have your name on the ballot twice when Greens have been kept off the ballots in other states.

1320557655291691008 2020-10-26 10:47:34 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden @BarackObama Only because he is tall, but not to be admired. His administration was very disappointing and criminal.

1320526917095702528 2020-10-26 08:45:25 +0800 <Underdawg47> @kevin_esque @SHdonttweet I can see Biden's contempt for gays as he answers this question. I don't want this fool being POTUS.
1320524906115649538 2020-10-26 08:37:26 +0800 <Underdawg47> @conureCC @QueenInYeIIow The Green party does support Ranked Choice Voting AND they are running a candidate for POTUS, what is wrong with that? I like having an option to vote for in this election. I certainly didn't vote for Biden or Trump

1320522378443509762 2020-10-26 08:27:23 +0800 <Underdawg47> @daviddoel I know that you want people to vote for Biden out of fear of Trump, but don't go shitting on the Green party  because they tend to be the underdog. They do have the better policies and are not taking corporate bribe money. I voted Green because I'm sick of the corporate crap.
1320520990388940802 2020-10-26 08:21:52 +0800 <Underdawg47> @daviddoel lately Bernie and AOC has been busy sheep dogging for the oligarchy.

1320512564002836480 2020-10-26 07:48:23 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden What you mean is that you will never give up on your corporate donors.
1320512092412112896 2020-10-26 07:46:31 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden Obamacare needs to be replaced with medicare for all. It is too expensive and we don't need insurance companies running health care.

1320133584666071040 2020-10-25 06:42:28 +0800 <Underdawg47> @flowerpetalnz @thehill Exactly and Trump too. That is why I voted Green.  https://t.co/MoutjzokBL

1320131194437005313 2020-10-25 06:32:58 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChildressPierre Maybe so. I'm voting Green because that is the party of the left now.

1320076587899842560 2020-10-25 02:55:59 +0800 <Underdawg47> What are the chances of people who say, "wait and vote 3rd party in 2024," of actually being brave enough to do that?   If they aren't brave enough to do that now, then when?   As we've seen from experience, Republicans just keep getting worse.

People talked about a new 3rd party in 2015, but instead tried to reform the Democrats. If you're voting out of fear now, what makes you think you will be braver in the future?

Now what would be a waste is if people try to run another progressive in the Democratic party again. I certainly won't be wasting my time or money with the DNC.
1319063349221421056 2020-10-22 07:49:44 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBuscaino So apparently you didn't give enough help, or else these people wouldn't be in the streets and then you blame the rest of them for not getting the help by making an ordinance that gives police the power to harass and make them move.

1317236511075569664 2020-10-17 06:50:31 +0800 <Underdawg47> @theZatchery @Roots_Action @joshfoxfilm I think that centrists allow more Trumps to happen in the future. I'm voting Green because I'm not about to support the oligarchy anymore.
1317232185171083264 2020-10-17 06:33:20 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RobletoFire Glad I'm voting Green
1317229813191487488 2020-10-17 06:23:55 +0800 <Underdawg47> @FordFischer So would a black man be allowed the same right to be armed and walk up to the chief of police in the same way this white man was? I don't think so.
1317227016152702978 2020-10-17 06:12:48 +0800 <Underdawg47> @CaraKorte I'm in WA state and I thought ballots were to be sent out on Wednesday. Still waiting for mine.
1317226614858469376 2020-10-17 06:11:12 +0800 <Underdawg47> @NettiePearl01 @ZackKopplin indeed, they might even go so far as to label him a terrorist for speaking against the empire.
1317226188222337024 2020-10-17 06:09:30 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Roots_Action @theZatchery @joshfoxfilm I disagree. Biden can't be pushed left anymore than Trump can be reasoned with. I'm voting Green
1317225289714298880 2020-10-17 06:05:56 +0800 <Underdawg47> @jvgraz @BadJohnBrown Obama was certainly involved, perhaps Perez. Bernie was afraid to rock the establishment boat.
1317223872068952065 2020-10-17 06:00:18 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ProudSocialist @GavinNewsom That is horrible. Ranked Choice Voting should be the law of the land.
1317223209813430272 2020-10-17 05:57:40 +0800 <Underdawg47> @IssyHG @ArcherRush having pot legalized feels so civil. No shame, or sneaking around.
1317222105637736449 2020-10-17 05:53:17 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ZackKopplin I suppose if Jesus were actually alive and walking around in our cities today, he would be harassed by police, shunned by Christians, or arrested for feeding the homeless.
1317220729897668608 2020-10-17 05:47:49 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ArcherRush If it were legal to grow our own, I would plant it in my garden.
1317220508883058688 2020-10-17 05:46:56 +0800 <Underdawg47> @dolphin_Striker @davidsirota yeah, but it is his choice. He hasn't done any vote shaming that I can tell, and I respect that.
1317216749599612928 2020-10-17 05:32:00 +0800 <Underdawg47> @davidsirota Biden and Trump both lied in this way.
1317215295350534144 2020-10-17 05:26:13 +0800 <Underdawg47> @StanMugford @torstrick I believe people can change for the better.
1317214629940977664 2020-10-17 05:23:35 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ArcherRush yeah, I'm lucky to live in a state where pot is legal. Pot should be legal everywhere.
1317213766157627392 2020-10-17 05:20:09 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ONEBIGUNION1 yes
1317213217387552769 2020-10-17 05:17:58 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ComptonMadeMe @flowermusickids I will be too as soon as I get my ballot.
1317211580371595264 2020-10-17 05:11:28 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ArcherRush Also good when there is a pot store just down the street.
1317211284769628160 2020-10-17 05:10:17 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden How can you heal the nation when you don't offer any meaningful policies that would actually help? You don't support medicare for all, you still support fracking, you don't support legalizing pot, et. What are you good for?
1317208941542060032 2020-10-17 05:00:58 +0800 <Underdawg47> @BernieSanders @yesthatCarlo And how many Billionaires are supporting your candidate, Bernie? You can't point fingers at the other party when your candidate is doing the exact same thing.
1317208114278531072 2020-10-17 04:57:41 +0800 <Underdawg47> @kthalps I think it it encourages people to check out what is all the secrecy about.

1317207386944282624 2020-10-17 04:54:48 +0800 <Underdawg47> @grumpybirdieS me, and I plan to vote Green
1317206978737754112 2020-10-17 04:53:10 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TimOnTheTractor I got you, Babe.
1317205559007793153 2020-10-17 04:47:32 +0800 <Underdawg47> @krunk84 The Democrats will.
1317205426031665155 2020-10-17 04:47:00 +0800 <Underdawg47> @AD1968F The Green party
1317204958698106881 2020-10-17 04:45:09 +0800 <Underdawg47> @thehill Why does it matter? The rich can go anytime they want, plus if either Biden or Trump wins, they still don't pay much in taxes. The oligarchy loves the rich.
1317202945570525184 2020-10-17 04:37:09 +0800 <Underdawg47> @thehill Yeah, he seems very passionate about this crime bill that he claims is a mistake.  https://t.co/9mWKxpWzS7
1317201607650496512 2020-10-17 04:31:50 +0800 <Underdawg47> @SenSanders @LittleBirdSteph Sounds like an oligarchy, Bernie. Here you are trying to sell the corporate stooge to the rest of us. You are willingly part of this oligarchy.
1317200403432304640 2020-10-17 04:27:03 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LaurenBrillante I have problems with this also. When people start telling you to vote for the corporate oligarchy, who support fracking and fossil fuel companies, I tend to not trust them.
1317196934340177921 2020-10-17 04:13:16 +0800 <Underdawg47> @charlamanesbane @LaurenBrillante I am voting Green AND want to overthrow the oligarchy.
1317195124284092416 2020-10-17 04:06:04 +0800 <Underdawg47> @disco_socialist @SteeOne If you're exclusively attracted to the opposite sex, then by definition, you're heterosexual.  Up until 30 years ago, I pretended to be straight because I could have been discharged from the army,  was afraid of losing friends &amp; family for being gay. Strange how gay is a fad now.

1317182038819045381 2020-10-17 03:14:04 +0800 <Underdawg47> @XanderhalTV Voting Green here for POTUS. No shame felt at all.
1317180803944574976 2020-10-17 03:09:10 +0800 <Underdawg47> @PageSix waaaah, cry some crocodile tears. Most people who go to prison might die if not freed, why is Harvey so special?
1317180122248540165 2020-10-17 03:06:27 +0800 <Underdawg47> @PricerMad @paladinette @nprpolitics Yeah, Trump could win. Polls really mean nothing.
1317179715338133504 2020-10-17 03:04:50 +0800 <Underdawg47> @bearon8 My vote helps the Green party. If Bernie or Tulsi was the nominee I would be voting Blue, but they are not the nominee. I was ONLY willing to vote blue for the policies. Biden doesn't have the policies I want, so I moved to the Green party.
1317178759393415168 2020-10-17 03:01:02 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LucianoBuciano @Grtmooglie In the meantime, I will vote Green

1317175868502888449 2020-10-17 02:49:33 +0800 <Underdawg47> @nprpolitics I remember that Hillary led in the polls at this time 4 years ago and look how that turned out.

I'm voting Green because I want something better than the crap the 2 major parties are shoving in our face.

1316825739367387136 2020-10-16 03:38:16 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Grtmooglie Does it matter? The outcome is the same. I'd rather be sick and have a chance at medicare for all under the Green Party

1316558021447749633 2020-10-15 09:54:27 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LivesKuato I guess this is a lying contest between Biden and Trump. Biden might have Trump beat in that area.  https://t.co/XjOsGZwTXp
1316556350361497600 2020-10-15 09:47:49 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MJBondNashville @5Missy3 the facts are that Biden takes corporate bribe money. He voted for many things I find despicable and he refuses to have progressive policies. That is all I need to know.
1316555140850089985 2020-10-15 09:43:00 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden Yeah, well your grassroots supporters are mostly corporations and Billionaires.
1316532901958180865 2020-10-15 08:14:38 +0800 <Underdawg47> @philly_bernie @shipman96 Biden is also a friend of the Saudis
1316532761998454784 2020-10-15 08:14:05 +0800 <Underdawg47> @philly_bernie @shipman96 Biden voted for the damned Iraq War. He voted for the damned Patriot Act. I don't reward criminals with my vote
1316532567286276096 2020-10-15 08:13:18 +0800 <Underdawg47> @philly_bernie @shipman96 No, but hell no. I'm not voting for Biden. I'm voting Green. Biden is just another corporate stooge
1316532029169623040 2020-10-15 08:11:10 +0800 <Underdawg47> @philly_bernie @shipman96 Biden doesn't care either. He is a war monger
1316531923531960322 2020-10-15 08:10:45 +0800 <Underdawg47> @philly_bernie @shipman96 You can kiss my ass
1316531816715542528 2020-10-15 08:10:19 +0800 <Underdawg47> @philly_bernie @shipman96 I am voting for better policies. It is not throwing my vote away
1316531556463198208 2020-10-15 08:09:17 +0800 <Underdawg47> @philly_bernie @shipman96 And this is where Biden and Trump are alike and why I will not vote for the fool
1316531363927846912 2020-10-15 08:08:31 +0800 <Underdawg47> @philly_bernie @shipman96 Biden will never enact progressive policies. Biden is a Republican
1316531170658508800 2020-10-15 08:07:45 +0800 <Underdawg47> @philly_bernie @shipman96 Biden hasn't done shit to earn our votes.
1316531028190617600 2020-10-15 08:07:11 +0800 <Underdawg47> @philly_bernie @shipman96 Biden bragged that he defeated Socialism and that he wants regime change in Venezuela I don't want that crap
1316530715089989632 2020-10-15 08:05:57 +0800 <Underdawg47> @philly_bernie @shipman96 Biden is not progressive. He is bought by his corporate donors. The Green party has the most progressive platform.
1316530398684307456 2020-10-15 08:04:41 +0800 <Underdawg47> @philly_bernie @shipman96 That is why I'm voting Green
1316527314381856768 2020-10-15 07:52:26 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Suavebones @BenjaminPDixon @pacmanface8 Then what is the point of Progressives telling people to vote Biden and then push him left after he wins? There is NO point in voting for Biden. I'm voting Green.

1316520005660340224 2020-10-15 07:23:23 +0800 <Underdawg47> @shipman96 @philly_bernie oh dead, let me correct that mistake
1316517031357767681 2020-10-15 07:11:34 +0800 <Underdawg47> @shipman96 @philly_bernie That was my fault. I has misread that tweet when I retweeted. I do not approve of vote shaming and I most certainly am voting Green
1316516329097060352 2020-10-15 07:08:47 +0800 <Underdawg47> @philly_bernie The Bernie or Busters are carrying on Bernie's policies. Bernie has abandoned his Revolution
1316515893275287552 2020-10-15 07:07:03 +0800 <Underdawg47> @SomeGuyOnTheIn So? This does negate Biden's corruption it just means that BOTH Biden and Trump are corrupt.

1316505915806240768 2020-10-15 06:27:24 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MJBondNashville @5Missy3 The explanation is that Biden answers only to his donors.

1316491340964741120 2020-10-15 05:29:29 +0800 <Underdawg47> @BrieBrie1990 @JoeBiden Yes, but I just won't be voting for your candidate.
1316490168094785536 2020-10-15 05:24:49 +0800 <Underdawg47> @rebeinstein well I'm not voting for either of those corporate clowns. I am voting Green
1316489895167225856 2020-10-15 05:23:44 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ItsTimeToFITE no, the crooked duopoly treats ex presidents like this.  https://t.co/cir7nSmZ9R

1316488333690724352 2020-10-15 05:17:32 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden I will be voting Green
1316486307653152768 2020-10-15 05:09:29 +0800 <Underdawg47> @EdMarkey another clown show between corporate stooges.
1316485488333647872 2020-10-15 05:06:14 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MJBondNashville @5Missy3 and yet he is still supporting fracking elsewhere.

1316482496607920128 2020-10-15 04:54:20 +0800 <Underdawg47> @kerrywashington I will be voting Green
1316480180689334272 2020-10-15 04:45:08 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RealKaylaJames @LZatYT I plan to vote Green as soon as I get my ballot and feeling no shame.

1316459767674490880 2020-10-15 03:24:01 +0800 <Underdawg47> @bigmoneysucks This is a good time to vote Green
1316457258889355264 2020-10-15 03:14:03 +0800 <Underdawg47> @djhutch74 Because the two corporate parties want to do everything in their power to retain their monopoly

1316456577096851456 2020-10-15 03:11:21 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Deiloh I don't like either one of them, so yeah.

1316253534745059329 2020-10-14 13:44:32 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MindfulObserve1 I like the Green party's policies. A Green New Deal, Medicare For All, ending regime change wars, legalizing pot, not taking corporate bribe money, forgiving student debt, raising minimum wage
1316252414295511040 2020-10-14 13:40:05 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MindfulObserve1 @LoseyLaurice Vote shaming is complaining about someone else's vote other than your own. It is fine to criticize a candidate or tell people why you won't vote for them, but telling people that they are wrong simply because they won't vote for your candidate, is a pretty shitty thing to do.

1316235971931717632 2020-10-14 12:34:44 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MindfulObserve1 This election is no different, because both the candidates this year are just as bad as the candidates we had in 2016. I'm voting Green because they have the better policies.
1316230483177402370 2020-10-14 12:12:56 +0800 <Underdawg47> @bearon8 I am voting for policy I want. I don't care if Greens win or not. I don't want to help Biden or Trump win with my vote
1316230090921930752 2020-10-14 12:11:22 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TinaDuryea yeah, I blame Obama and Democrats for not fighting for their pick. They were using their pick to get Hillary elected and lost that bet.

They have Bernie's policies  and they support Assange, not into regime change wars, and want Medicare For All.

1316171898535858181 2020-10-14 08:20:08 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Alyssa_Milano Why would the youth vote for someone who only works for his corporate donors, doesn't support the Green New Deal, or Medicare For All, and supports regime change wars? Biden doesn't even want to legalize pot, or forgive student debt, or free college. I'm voting Green.
1316170374501920768 2020-10-14 08:14:05 +0800 <Underdawg47> @lat_gigi @discgolf19th But that will leave us with the corporate creep Biden. I hate him also. That is why I'm voting Green.

I'm voting Green because I like the Green's policy. I don't care if Biden loses because he has terrible policies and will only serve his corporate donors
1316097170987048960 2020-10-14 03:23:12 +0800 <Underdawg47> @nikolay_steve at least I'm voting for something I want as opposed to crap that I don't want.

1315102278215299072 2020-10-11 09:29:51 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden Dude, you are taking corporate money and told the working class if they don't like your corporate policies they should vote for Trump. You have told numerous citizens this BS.
1315101845711331329 2020-10-11 09:28:08 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden Then why are you taking billionaire and corporate bribe money? You are working for those privileged few and have no policies that would help the working class you faker.
1315101427312685056 2020-10-11 09:26:28 +0800 <Underdawg47> @AnnAnne700 @thehill You seem to be fooled by the Corporate Democrats BNMW crowd

1315095024892141568 2020-10-11 09:01:01 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Born7QThink @Frisbeetarian I'm voting Green
1315094291924967424 2020-10-11 08:58:07 +0800 <Underdawg47> @thehill rolls my eyes. Even Greta likes slightly lesser evil

1315090579517173760 2020-10-11 08:43:22 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MikeLabonte2 @Stonekettle i think they endorse Trump because he was talking about pulling troops out of their country.
1315090376907079680 2020-10-11 08:42:33 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Comrade_Waluigi @phyllisdyllis Because Green Party is an actual threat to the Democrat's existence. Democrats are closer to Republicans in policy and corruption.
1315090024904286208 2020-10-11 08:41:09 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Stonekettle @MikeLabonte2 Actually I want the US out of Afghanistan. We have absolutely no reason to be there.

1315088760619499520 2020-10-11 08:36:08 +0800 <Underdawg47> @KamalaHarris Not when we vote for corporate bribed politicians. The only change we get with those crooks are more misery.
1315088379839561728 2020-10-11 08:34:37 +0800 <Underdawg47> @PalmerReport @RobRobbEdwards Actually, I want us out of Afghanistan. Pulling out of that country is something good. We have no good reason to be there.
1315087699829694464 2020-10-11 08:31:55 +0800 <Underdawg47> @jhsutherland2 @jonnyboyca Yeah I see it. The Democrats are holding us hostage by using Trump as a weapon. They don't offer us anything other than you don't have any choice. Well yes we do have other choices. I'm not playing this BS hostage game.

1315086159458885632 2020-10-11 08:25:48 +0800 <Underdawg47> @jhsutherland2 @jonnyboyca Might not be anything left with Biden either. Biden has no plans to stop wars, stop fracking or giving us medicare for all.

1315057397723852801 2020-10-11 06:31:30 +0800 <Underdawg47> @fras99 Democrats would need to think of another reason why people should vote for Biden because he is a terrible candidate with terrible policies.
1315055698619768832 2020-10-11 06:24:45 +0800 <Underdawg47> @jhsutherland2 @jonnyboyca It means Greens could get govt funding if they reach 5%. That is something worth voting for. I lose with both Biden and Trump
1315054267955249158 2020-10-11 06:19:04 +0800 <Underdawg47> @jhsutherland2 @jonnyboyca It is not the Green's fault if Russia tries to get people to vote for them to help Trump. I'm voting Green for the policies. Screw the Democrats and Republicans.
1315049159926321152 2020-10-11 05:58:46 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Moron4TheWorld I am voting Green to legalize pot.
1315048819768266752 2020-10-11 05:57:25 +0800 <Underdawg47> @iskandrah Actually, getting the US out of a worthless war in Afghanistan is a good thing. That was what Obama was supposed to do when we voted for him.
1315048034963652608 2020-10-11 05:54:18 +0800 <Underdawg47> @jhsutherland2 @jonnyboyca The traitors are those candidates that take corporate bribe money and don't work for the people that have elected them.
1315047766519738368 2020-10-11 05:53:14 +0800 <Underdawg47> @The_Acumen That's right in the preamble to the US constitution its says "To promote the general welfare" of US citizens.
1315047045854490624 2020-10-11 05:50:22 +0800 <Underdawg47> @queeersocialist And most of the ones that has Obamacare can't afford to use it without going into debt.
1315046656920883200 2020-10-11 05:48:50 +0800 <Underdawg47> @GoodPoliticGuy Greens for me
1315046432596926464 2020-10-11 05:47:56 +0800 <Underdawg47> @jhsutherland2 @jonnyboyca Green party has every right to run for POTUS as those 2 corporate clowns. I don't care if Russia promotes Greens. I think it would be great if Green actually won and Russia helped them.
1315044384761475072 2020-10-11 05:39:48 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden The best? You have made so maybe terrible policy decisions, I don't trust you to make any good ones, especially since you take so much corporate bribe money.
1315043356360105984 2020-10-11 05:35:43 +0800 <Underdawg47> @jhsutherland2 @jonnyboyca If Russia wants Americans to have the things that Greens propose then I support Russia, however I know better. If Democrats really wanted to win, they wouldn't have chosen Biden. Biden was only used to stop progressives. Dems and Repubs share the same donors.
1315040664023822336 2020-10-11 05:25:01 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Zz1pp @werefairywool @SocialistMMA The Democrats will go right because of their corporate donors. It has nothing to do with me.
1315039560678559744 2020-10-11 05:20:38 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Zz1pp @werefairywool @SocialistMMA Yeah, I wish everyone would vote Green, i wish we could consolidate around one leftist party that is not bought by corporations, but I'm not going to tell people how to vote.
1315038801249464321 2020-10-11 05:17:37 +0800 <Underdawg47> @jhsutherland2 @jonnyboyca I am not fine with either Trump or Biden. I think they are both absolutely rotten. I am voting Green because I actually want them to be in the debates someday.
1315038404598394880 2020-10-11 05:16:02 +0800 <Underdawg47> @jwhyrock maybe it should be corporate vs non corporate
1315032671957860352 2020-10-11 04:53:15 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Questionwhatis1 @ConsiderThis1 We know that God doesn't interact with humans these days, and Trump has been incompetent. Biden only works for his corporate donors, so we are basically screwed.
1315032064882741249 2020-10-11 04:50:51 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoshuaPotash @wildwestpie yep, not voting for Trump. Biden is not good either so not voting for him. I will be voting Green.

1314763056493150210 2020-10-10 11:01:54 +0800 <Underdawg47> @KamalaHarris Maybe he should just raise taxes of the rich.

How dare the poor to have the audacity to vote for policies that would make their lives better than to vote for the corporate stooge that won't help them at all.
1314705250545090560 2020-10-10 07:12:12 +0800 <Underdawg47> @jonnyboyca All those people that say the Green party doesn't stand a chance are probably afraid that maybe they do have a chance or they wouldn't be saying it in the first place.

1314312549211357185 2020-10-09 05:11:45 +0800 <Underdawg47> @heartpotatos Well, if Democrats actually wanted to win, they wouldn't have chosen such a lame, weak, corporate candidate to go against Trump. I think it is far better to vote Green even in a swing state rather than justify the BS coming from the DNC.

1314305261192896512 2020-10-09 04:42:47 +0800 <Underdawg47> @heartpotatos So when nearly half the country refuses to vote, which candidate does their non vote go to?   My vote for Green has nothing to do with Biden or Trump. I hate both of those candidates equally.

1314301756302524417 2020-10-09 04:28:51 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MJBondNashville @rontkim @TheDemocrats He doesn't need to win these states by having Republican policies. He will most certainly not be getting my vote.
1314292028595818496 2020-10-09 03:50:12 +0800 <Underdawg47> @rontkim @TheDemocrats Biden is trying to win the Republican vote. That is why I'm not voting for the clown.
1314291443351994368 2020-10-09 03:47:53 +0800 <Underdawg47> @GavinNewsom Then why does Biden still support fracking?

1314279216729321472 2020-10-09 02:59:18 +0800 <Underdawg47> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden So what makes you think this is a reason to vote for you and Biden? I want a candidate that will BAN FRACKING. I will be voting for the Green Party.

1314268838217740288 2020-10-09 02:18:03 +0800 <Underdawg47> @IfOurOceansDie Yeah, but the more votes that the Green party gets, the closer to 5% and govt funding.

He did nothing to stop the DAPL pipeline or help those trying to preserve their water. I will vote Green for a much better plan

Maybe the rest of the country doesn't have the opportunity to hear the Greens in the debate, but I know their policies and I plan to vote for them.

Probably Biden because he has over 40 years of terrible policies, lies, and he is part of the organization dedicated to stopping progressives. But Trump is god awful in a much different way.

1313614457424105472 2020-10-07 06:57:47 +0800 <Underdawg47> @jocquebrawn thanks
1313613854857859072 2020-10-07 06:55:23 +0800 <Underdawg47> @A_J_Diamond Maybe not, but still better than voting for corporate stooges
1313613741418672129 2020-10-07 06:54:56 +0800 <Underdawg47> @jocquebrawn The Greens probably won't win, but it is far better to vote Green than to leave the space for POTUS blank
1313611609336549376 2020-10-07 06:46:28 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Mookierat71 That is a nice color

1313610836536033280 2020-10-07 06:43:23 +0800 <Underdawg47> @A_J_Diamond You are assuming that my vote was already yours to begin with. My vote is going to the Green party, not the Democrats and not the Republicans.
1313609734176468992 2020-10-07 06:39:00 +0800 <Underdawg47> @stilljumping @teJanaLupita I'm willing to bet that you place your hope in candidates just because they have a D in front of the name and not because of voting history or policy.
1313609383163523072 2020-10-07 06:37:37 +0800 <Underdawg47> @WebbStation Thanks, I know it is a difficult decision to make. You do what you think is best and i will do the same.
1313609146931896320 2020-10-07 06:36:40 +0800 <Underdawg47> @A_J_Diamond The country is already fucked up with Biden or Trump as POTUS
1313609008540909569 2020-10-07 06:36:07 +0800 <Underdawg47> @stilljumping @teJanaLupita Biden will do nothing to help the Earth. He will talk about change but his corporate donors say no. He does support fracking.
1313607668884336640 2020-10-07 06:30:48 +0800 <Underdawg47> @stilljumping @teJanaLupita It will never be better the longer people keep voting for the same corporate clowns
1313607110106644480 2020-10-07 06:28:35 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MuffukinMilkman It has value to me
1313607041731100672 2020-10-07 06:28:19 +0800 <Underdawg47> @lfmichaelbazan @proviewsusa well that is your choice to make. I will vote Green.
1313606908473868291 2020-10-07 06:27:47 +0800 <Underdawg47> @stilljumping @teJanaLupita and you think I'm any better off? I have been unemployed for months and never had healthcare. Biden will not help me and neither will Trump.
1313606493539835904 2020-10-07 06:26:08 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MrBrownBison @stilljumping Well to me Biden is just as rotten as Trump. I don't like either of those corporate tools.
1313606312949813248 2020-10-07 06:25:25 +0800 <Underdawg47> @EllisM3 Maybe it doesn't make sense to you, but it does to me.
1313606207018475520 2020-10-07 06:25:00 +0800 <Underdawg47> @jocquebrawn Yeah, that is what you guys always say. I dare to vote for something better for my life rather than be bullied to vote for the rich corporate stooge.
1313603008412827649 2020-10-07 06:12:17 +0800 <Underdawg47> @cognizantenigma thank you
1313602859221483520 2020-10-07 06:11:41 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MuffukinMilkman @BAPBrandi My vote actually does represent me. It is the only voice I have and not wasting it on rich corporate bought stooges.
1313602650714206210 2020-10-07 06:10:52 +0800 <Underdawg47> @teJanaLupita @stilljumping entitled is the word they use to make you feel as if you have some sort of power you don't deserve. Well As a poor person I use the power of my vote to actually vote for policies that would make my life better instead of being bullied to vote for the rich corporate stooges.
1313602119442722818 2020-10-07 06:08:45 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MuffukinMilkman It is my vote to "waste" on policies I actually want instead of corporate crap that I don't want.
1313601431706849280 2020-10-07 06:06:01 +0800 <Underdawg47> @PhiSteveO you are right, We don't need regime change wars, we need cooperation with socialist countries instead of exploitation.
1313599918682955776 2020-10-07 06:00:00 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheFBX @M4ACalifornia If Putin wants us to have progressive policies, then I'm with Putin.
1313599757785292801 2020-10-07 05:59:22 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma Bernie can vote for the candidate he wants. The rest of us can chose for ourselves.
1313599411671363585 2020-10-07 05:57:59 +0800 <Underdawg47> @truth2soul So how is voting against your principles and policies you want, the wise thing to do? I don't think Jesus would ever tell people to vote for the lesser evil.
1313598938176319488 2020-10-07 05:56:07 +0800 <Underdawg47> @cognizantenigma And look what the Democrats did. They selected another lame corporate Democrat to run against Trump. It is as if they don't want to win. Their goal was only to stop progressives. Progressives make the mistake of trying to reform the Democrats.
1313590072512372737 2020-10-07 05:20:53 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheFBX @M4ACalifornia Yeah, I have no regrets
1313589960763604993 2020-10-07 05:20:26 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma That's why I don't listen to Bernie now. He is going against his own principles because he is afraid of Trump.
1313589567425921025 2020-10-07 05:18:52 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheFBX @M4ACalifornia sure, I've heard this BS before.

1313585653163016192 2020-10-07 05:03:19 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma I roll my eyes when you claim to be a Bernie supporter. What Bernie supporter turns into a corporate vote shamer?
1313585446945873921 2020-10-07 05:02:30 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma I don't want Biden's experience at taking corporate money or voting for Republican policies. That is not the competence I want. Bernie sold out and is now just sheep dogging for the establishment Democrats
1313583987906863104 2020-10-07 04:56:42 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma Yeah, he wins votes from centrists. The other votes he gets is because people feel they have no other choice. They don't vote for Biden because they like him. They are settling for crap
1313583313957736448 2020-10-07 04:54:01 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JohnSenescent Thanks❤️❤️❤️

1313581719216250880 2020-10-07 04:47:41 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma I didn't say that no one will vote for Biden. I just said I will not vote for Biden.
1313581133641084928 2020-10-07 04:45:22 +0800 <Underdawg47> @HisBasePaysMore @Sue70241 @Bezeeboy @BAPBrandi Gotta start somewhere. I'm starting with something I can control. My own vote. I vote Green because I can. And if more people like me vote Green, we could actually see a change.
1313580701736816640 2020-10-07 04:43:39 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma polling is never accurate.
1313579895260241920 2020-10-07 04:40:26 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma I remember the night of the election. News people were saying that Hillary had over 90% chance of winning. Their confidence was high and it was amazing to see her lose.
1313578630023266304 2020-10-07 04:35:25 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma As I remember Hillary was polling in the 90% range and still lost to Trump.
1313578121384214528 2020-10-07 04:33:23 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma waaaa, Biden has done nothing to win votes and you bitching at Green voters haven't won any voters either.
1313577462127685633 2020-10-07 04:30:46 +0800 <Underdawg47> @commie54321 That really sounds like the Biden people today who bitch about me not voting for their corporate stooge.
1313576420258451456 2020-10-07 04:26:38 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma And you are acting like a whining child because someone isn't voting your way. Go phone bank for your stooge
1313576049427374080 2020-10-07 04:25:09 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma decent is not a word that describes Biden
1313575789825159169 2020-10-07 04:24:08 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma I have listened to your nagging for a while today
1313575582827900929 2020-10-07 04:23:18 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma yeah, but I have over 40 years of hearing about Biden and his terrible policies
1313575433493856256 2020-10-07 04:22:43 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma Go ahead and try to defend Biden
1313574877639532544 2020-10-07 04:20:30 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma ooh now you resort to name calling. that is usually a sign of defeat
1313574693346000896 2020-10-07 04:19:46 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma I like my candidate enough to vote for him. I like his policies.
1313574244953989120 2020-10-07 04:17:59 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma If you are worried about my vote, perhaps you should go phone banking to Republican voters who Biden is actually trying to win over.
1313573741842980864 2020-10-07 04:15:59 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma Yeah, they chose Biden and if Biden loses, they made the mistake of picking a losing candidate. They must live with their choice.
1313573222659485697 2020-10-07 04:13:55 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma Yeah, and they make bets that their candidate is electable and sometimes they lose those bets when they pick terrible candidates that others won't vote for.
1313572926403174400 2020-10-07 04:12:45 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma I did to, but I don't support corporate stooges.
1313572736208314368 2020-10-07 04:11:59 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma Yes, they keep pushing more corporate stooges every election cycle thinking they have a winning strategy. And when they lose they blame everyone else but themselves. Those who thought Biden was so electable deserve Trump.
1313571605977550849 2020-10-07 04:07:30 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mhcrna94 @nytimes People vote according to what they want. I respect your right to vote for the candidate of your choice.
1313570386718543872 2020-10-07 04:02:39 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma and you seem to be smugly trying to shame people for not voting for your candidate
1313570182908977152 2020-10-07 04:01:51 +0800 <Underdawg47> @rjdomos @nytimes If I were voting vote Trump, I would say so, and Trump would actually get an actual vote, but I'm not.
1313568600192557058 2020-10-07 03:55:33 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma How dare a poor person to have the audacity to vote for policies that would make their lives better instead of falling in line to support the corporate backed stooge.
1313568276245479424 2020-10-07 03:54:16 +0800 <Underdawg47> @HisBasePaysMore @Sue70241 @Bezeeboy @BAPBrandi It might not exist, but if everyone vowed not to vote for a corporate bribed candidate, we wouldn't have them.
1313563338580742144 2020-10-07 03:34:39 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma bye!
1313563277490753536 2020-10-07 03:34:24 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma I think Democrats need to suffer through another 4 years of Trump. They didn't learn a damned thing about 2016 and pushed for another lame corporate stooge who will do nothing but bring about more people like Trump in the future.
1313562778850848768 2020-10-07 03:32:25 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma Neither of them are better.
1313562633228828672 2020-10-07 03:31:51 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RBReich @UWDawgFan88 the ACA is a Republican health care plan that needs to be scrapped. We need medicare for all
1313561499772678144 2020-10-07 03:27:20 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma He still brags about the Patriot Act, and how he wants regime change in Venezuela. He still lied on stage when he said he didn't try to cut social security 4 times. Biden has not changed and he is taking more Billionaire bribe money than Trump.
1313560806651387904 2020-10-07 03:24:35 +0800 <Underdawg47> @stilljumping Biden has not learned from his mistakes. He couldn't even admit that he tried to cut social security 4 times. Biden still brags about the Patriot Act. Biden still pushes for regime change wars like Venezuela.
1313560333353578496 2020-10-07 03:22:42 +0800 <Underdawg47> @HisBasePaysMore @Sue70241 @Bezeeboy @BAPBrandi I don't want any candidate who takes corporate bribe money and vow to never vote for one of them.
1313559703335526401 2020-10-07 03:20:12 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ThePoliticalPug @HowieHawkins I will too, as soon as I get my ballot.
1313559395360337920 2020-10-07 03:18:59 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma This is a cool story.  https://t.co/XjOsGZwTXp
1313559040329302017 2020-10-07 03:17:34 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma thanks, I will vote for the candidate I want rather than be bullied into voting for another corporate stooge.
1313558846040805377 2020-10-07 03:16:48 +0800 <Underdawg47> @stilljumping No it isn't. Progressives are not bought out by corporate donors and billionaires. Biden's policies are no where near the policies of Bernie or the Green party.
1313558157147291648 2020-10-07 03:14:04 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma Biden said he wants regime change in Venezuela, he voted for the Iraq War, and Patriot Act. I don't forgive him for these terrible things.
1313557825679814657 2020-10-07 03:12:45 +0800 <Underdawg47> @stilljumping You are right. Nothing you can say will change my mind. Biden voted for the Iraq War and the Patriot Act. That alone disqualifies him.
1313557438616883200 2020-10-07 03:11:12 +0800 <Underdawg47> @HisBasePaysMore @Sue70241 @Bezeeboy @BAPBrandi NO, Harris is terrible. She takes corporate money also. She was an early favorite for the Democratic establishment.
1313557191677239296 2020-10-07 03:10:13 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma I won't vote for a candidate that takes us further to the right and deeper into the hands of a corporate controlled America.
1313556862126579713 2020-10-07 03:08:55 +0800 <Underdawg47> @stilljumping I'm not voting for any candidate that pulls the country further to the right.
1313556646673612800 2020-10-07 03:08:03 +0800 <Underdawg47> @stilljumping I think Democrats deserve another 4 years of Trump. They had 4 years to pick a better candidate and gave us another hated stooge with Biden who does NOTHING to earn votes.
1313556290564571136 2020-10-07 03:06:39 +0800 <Underdawg47> @stilljumping Biden isn't even a choice for me. He isn't a progressive and should be a Republican
1313556039057375232 2020-10-07 03:05:39 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma you go right ahead and vote the way you want. I will vote my way
1313555869825593345 2020-10-07 03:04:58 +0800 <Underdawg47> @stilljumping The fact is. I can't stand Biden or Trump. Their policies such, they both lie, both accused of sexual assault and both are racists and both think it is cool to get their relatives cushy jobs through nepotism. I hate that crap.
1313554885653090304 2020-10-07 03:01:04 +0800 <Underdawg47> @stilljumping It may be a drop in the bucket, or maybe there are a lot more people like me who will vote Green also
1313554599056351232 2020-10-07 02:59:55 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma Yes, I did read it and still don't want it.
1313553826234859520 2020-10-07 02:56:51 +0800 <Underdawg47> @politico Obama was a huge disappointment. He turned out to be a corporate stooge. I don't trust Biden and I hate his corporate policies. I will be voting Green
1313552295833944064 2020-10-07 02:50:46 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mondtezuma I don't want insurance company run health care based upon a person's employment. I want medicare for all.
1313551015979831296 2020-10-07 02:45:41 +0800 <Underdawg47> @stilljumping I don't vote out of fear. I don't vote to jump on band wagons. I don't vote for lesser evil. I vote for policies I want.

1313545880704741376 2020-10-07 02:25:17 +0800 <Underdawg47> @debbiedonothing @BAPBrandi Well I do have a choice. Greens are on the ballot.

1313545453774884864 2020-10-07 02:23:35 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ThomasBunink @nytimes I vote for policies that is best for me, not some corporate stooge who will do nothing but push for policies his corporate donors want.
1313545130146557952 2020-10-07 02:22:18 +0800 <Underdawg47> @1aceras Voting for Biden or Trump accomplishes nothing but getting more corporate control over our lives.

1313543576450600960 2020-10-07 02:16:07 +0800 <Underdawg47> @HisBasePaysMore Greens may do more harm if you are part of the billionaire class or a corporate CEO. but Greens have policies I want.
1313543018180304896 2020-10-07 02:13:54 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ba_0830 No, its not too late. That is why I'm voting Green
1313542832225841152 2020-10-07 02:13:10 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Bezeeboy @BAPBrandi I don't want the ACA to be saved. It is a terribly expensive "for profit" health care run by crooked insurance companies. It should die. I want medicare for all.

1313540975608823814 2020-10-07 02:05:47 +0800 <Underdawg47> @nytimes I plan to vote Green. Neither Biden or Trump offer any good policy to change things for the better.
1313539889548333056 2020-10-07 02:01:28 +0800 <Underdawg47> @debbiedonothing @BAPBrandi It is better to vote for what you want rather than stuff you don't want, whether you get it or not.
1313539683402444801 2020-10-07 02:00:39 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Bezeeboy @BAPBrandi The Greens do have policies closer to what I want. Neither Biden or Trump have any of those policies.
1313539483405410304 2020-10-07 01:59:51 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Lauri5074 It is my vote to do what I want with it. The Greens are the better option than the 2 corporate stooges.

1313534131989483521 2020-10-07 01:38:36 +0800 <Underdawg47> #ImVotingFor The Green Party because Biden and Trump do not represent me. The Greens support medicare for all, a Green New Deal and do not support regime change wars.

If you support regime change wars, the death penalty, or police killing innocent citizens, you can't call yourself Pro life.

1313210791298908161 2020-10-06 04:13:45 +0800 <Underdawg47> @CRLady2016 Bad Republican policy is a result of taking corporate bribe money, not a stutter. Forgetting things and misspeaking is not a stutter, it is a sign of senility.
1313195568865263616 2020-10-06 03:13:16 +0800 <Underdawg47> @realDonaldTrump You mean that YOU have the best health care that money can buy, yet the rest of us will not be so lucky if and when we were to catch Covid. Even with the best treatment, you could have a relapse, so don't be bragging so soon. You're not out of the woods yet.
1312928439343570945 2020-10-05 09:31:47 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden No thanks. I don't want your Republican policies. You care more about your corporate donors than citizens

1312872446559625216 2020-10-05 05:49:17 +0800 <Underdawg47> @tink_240 @JoeBiden Well voting Green is moving to the left. Democrats unfortunately are moving right.

I most certainly will not be voting for Biden or Trump. I will be voting for the candidate that most closely has the policies I want, Howie Hawkins. You are now cheering for the corporate candidate.
1312859387975753728 2020-10-05 04:57:24 +0800 <Underdawg47> @leeeeeeeesssa33 @BernieSanders Yeah, I thought you were one of those uneducated fools that think a Green vote is a vote for Trump. Learn some math before you speak.
1312858936924463104 2020-10-05 04:55:36 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden As an American I will be voting for the candidate that supports progressive policies, Howie Hawkins. You're policies are Republican

1312854698051870720 2020-10-05 04:38:46 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LukeNoPic @JoeBiden No, all lobbying should be abolished
1312854539230355458 2020-10-05 04:38:08 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LukeNoPic @JoeBiden Indeed, and I will not vote for the other ones either
1312854424935571456 2020-10-05 04:37:41 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LukeNoPic @JoeBiden true, but I can start with me, and not vote for any politician that takes corporate money.

1312153846781603841 2020-10-03 06:13:50 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LukeNoPic @JoeBiden Yeah, and if everyone would vow to never knowingly vote for a corporate backed candidate again, things would change.
1312153545475387392 2020-10-03 06:12:38 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LukeNoPic @JoeBiden Well Biden is not committed to anything except his corporate donors. I really can't believe a thing he says.

1312152227172106241 2020-10-03 06:07:24 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LukeNoPic @JoeBiden The point is, Democrats  are not on the left anymore. I don't care if the two Republican parties are split.
1312149372872716288 2020-10-03 05:56:03 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LukeNoPic @JoeBiden I think ALL lobbying should be illegal

1312148450239082496 2020-10-03 05:52:23 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LukeNoPic @JoeBiden I will vote Green this year, but maybe next time you can vote Green if you want.

1312145114404327425 2020-10-03 05:39:08 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LukeNoPic @JoeBiden Maybe not, but it tells the other corporate party that we are not just falling in line anymore. The more people that vote Green encourages others to do the same next time.
1312144554070474752 2020-10-03 05:36:54 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LukeNoPic @JoeBiden One step at a time. One vote at a time. One brave act at a time. I am voting Green and encourage everyone to take that brave step
1312143311147212801 2020-10-03 05:31:58 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LukeNoPic @JoeBiden I think people are getting braver all the time. Especially after suffering under both of these corrupt parties that make their lives miserable

1312140827079012355 2020-10-03 05:22:06 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LukeNoPic @JoeBiden If enough of us actually vote Green, even under the 2 party system, we could actually win. But most people in this country are not brave.

1311979176086265856 2020-10-02 18:39:45 +0800 <Underdawg47> So if Covid kills Biden and Trump, does this mean that the Green Party has a chance to win?
1311978259970576385 2020-10-02 18:36:07 +0800 <Underdawg47> @NormOrnstein @CitizenKayS So exciting. I wonder if Covid will win?  This is the first time that I'm glad the Green party candidate didn't attend the debate.

1311963846932799490 2020-10-02 17:38:50 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ef3078 @RealSteveCox No, because they certainly don't give a rat's ass about the rest of us dying. All they care about is their corporate donors.
1311958695585013761 2020-10-02 17:18:22 +0800 <Underdawg47> @tga_tgoodfellow yeah, and the polls said she had over 90% chance of winning

1311937807007453184 2020-10-02 15:55:22 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ourscreatif @diddymcc Biden will be surrounded by corporate  and Billionaire donors, wall street, and lobbyists. He is all about the money. I will be voting Green

1311916033259651072 2020-10-02 14:28:51 +0800 <Underdawg47> @theritz @BernieSanders No, I don't think so.

1311881043968843777 2020-10-02 12:09:49 +0800 <Underdawg47> @tomselliott @FrankFigliuzzi1 That is interesting because it was Hillary, the DNC and the media that propped up Trump in the 2016 primaries as a Pied Piper Candidate supposedly to make it easier for Hillary to win against someone as rotten as Trump. But Hillary was seen as more rotten and it backfired.
1311866187626639361 2020-10-02 11:10:47 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LegacyZeroYT Now if Covid also got rid of Biden and his campaign the same way, that would be awesome!

It is a Republican plan. His crappy environmental program is not the Green New Deal and he still supports FRACKING. That is not good for the environment.
1311863958609879041 2020-10-02 11:01:55 +0800 <Underdawg47> @spatial_anomaly I hope there will be things we can say to make you feel better

1311862708606701569 2020-10-02 10:56:57 +0800 <Underdawg47> @philly_bernie @SocialStyleGal @leslieghuber @MolotovsEtc @theredshift11 I'm disappointed in Bernie for dropping out of the race and immediately supporting Biden, then campaigning for him and disgusted in Bernie for being a corporate sheepdog and demanding we vote for Biden. I'm actually over Bernie and moved to the Green Party

He really does seem to want those Republican voters though. He certainly won't be getting my vote

1311786690424442880 2020-10-02 05:54:53 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Sklz711 Well, since I don't want either Biden or Trump to win, it would be funny if Biden were to lose the same way Hillary lost because he couldn't bring himself to actually try to win those votes. Biden is doing nothing to win those votes other than vote shame &amp; say Trump is bad.

I can't vote for Biden because of 47 years of terrible policies, getting us into regime change wars &amp; taking all that corporate bribe money. Both corporate parties are horrible. I'm voting Green because it's the right thing for me
1311755923086426112 2020-10-02 03:52:37 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TomAad @BernieSanders Well, I can't stand Biden or Trump. Seeing Biden or Trump makes me want to see someone punch them in the face. Instead of just leaving the space blank. I can actually vote for a party and policies I want with the Green Party.

1311747123642212352 2020-10-02 03:17:40 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TakeAShape @BernieSanders I don't expect Greens to win, but I am hoping they will get over 5% and get government funding. But if you want more Biden votes, I suggest you go phone bank in Republican areas. That is the demographic that Biden is trying to win.

I don't think Biden is budging an inch. But Greens don't have to be pushed, they already have the policies I want.
1311744791219064832 2020-10-02 03:08:23 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Fishbreath3 @BuddhaBumble @BernieSanders Thanks, and we have many other races voting Green as well. We came for the policies.
1311744158634180608 2020-10-02 03:05:53 +0800 <Underdawg47> @The_Big_Nothin So go vote for the party you want them. I'm not stopping you. Greens are the party I'm voting for whether you like it or not.
1311742224686669824 2020-10-02 02:58:12 +0800 <Underdawg47> @liberalforeverX @anthonypfarda yes, I like the sound of that. A ordinary people like us instead of a privileged stooge born with a silver spoon stuck up their ass.
1311741785262104576 2020-10-02 02:56:27 +0800 <Underdawg47> @KatieCVFowler @Carlene_Meyers Candidates are supposed to earn our votes. And here you are bitching at me for being selfish. Shouldn't you be bitching at your candidate for not trying to win votes? Biden is seeking Republican voters. Maybe you should ask them to vote for Biden instead of me.
1311740391373201408 2020-10-02 02:50:54 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Robloxtrains1 @BernieSanders It is my vote to be used on the candidate that best represents me. If you don't like it, tough shit. Go phone bank for your candidate instead of complaining about other's votes.
1311739985100509184 2020-10-02 02:49:18 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TomAad @BernieSanders waaaa waaa waaa. Sounds like a you have doubts your candidate might not win. You guys had 4 years to pick a better candidate and failed
1311739564696858624 2020-10-02 02:47:37 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Robloxtrains1 @kayladenver @BernieSanders I encourage you to kiss my ass
1311739458803261441 2020-10-02 02:47:12 +0800 <Underdawg47> @suremeanttosay @BuddhaBumble @BernieSanders The Proud boys are closer to Biden's racist policies of the past than my candidate.
1311739182444802048 2020-10-02 02:46:06 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ourscreatif @diddymcc We have been sliding further right each election because Democrats are becoming Republican. Biden wants baby steps and still supports fracking. This is not a move in the right direction. I'm voting Green
1311738471426318336 2020-10-02 02:43:17 +0800 <Underdawg47> @curious_corn @amandarachell20 @baijorcro @BernieSanders I think Democrats gifted the orange man when they picked Biden to run against him.
1311738274302500864 2020-10-02 02:42:30 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ResistingAlison @BernieSanders It isn't your if you think a vote for Green = a vote for Trump
1311738132635631617 2020-10-02 02:41:56 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ResistingAlison @amandarachell20 @baijorcro @BernieSanders Democrats don't want it either.
1311738052323098624 2020-10-02 02:41:37 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ResistingAlison @curious_corn @amandarachell20 @baijorcro @BernieSanders Yes, you are right. I don't jump on corporate bandwagons, or believe all the propaganda  that corporate news  offers us. I vote on policies and research the histories of the clowns the 2 parties offers us.
1311737421373947904 2020-10-02 02:39:06 +0800 <Underdawg47> @psu_82 @BernieSanders I won't be complaining. I voted for Jill Stein in 2016 and have no regrets
1311737187910610944 2020-10-02 02:38:11 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LukeNoPic @JoeBiden Well, I'm not voting for Trump either. I'm voting Green
1311736928102875136 2020-10-02 02:37:09 +0800 <Underdawg47> @unclesamspad2 @RodneyE34641593 But Biden was that crappy mechanic that people have been complaining about for the last 47 years. Yet his boss kept him on because he was family.
1311736344595505152 2020-10-02 02:34:50 +0800 <Underdawg47> @FeliesMadretsma @BernieSanders Ok Karen
1311736094916968448 2020-10-02 02:33:50 +0800 <Underdawg47> @FeliesMadretsma @BuddhaBumble @BernieSanders I think Biden and Trump are both a pile of shit. They won't be getting my vote no matter how much nagging Karens flap in my face.
1311735686643380224 2020-10-02 02:32:13 +0800 <Underdawg47> @bernierockson exactly!  practical means to abandon your principles, do the "safe" thing and follow the herd.
1311734995199770624 2020-10-02 02:29:28 +0800 <Underdawg47> @FeliesMadretsma @kayladenver @BernieSanders Apparently it is or else you guys wouldn't be harassing people for voting Green. It makes you sound desperate as if Biden wasn't such an "electable" candidate that you guys claimed he was.
1311734037342347264 2020-10-02 02:25:39 +0800 <Underdawg47> @4eva1984 @BernieSanders Good, stop wasting your time and phone bank for your clown then
1311733860774735872 2020-10-02 02:24:57 +0800 <Underdawg47> @theritz @BernieSanders I don't like either Biden or Trump. We lose whether we get either one of those clowns.
1311733568171728896 2020-10-02 02:23:48 +0800 <Underdawg47> @PaddydubPatrick @PFC_Discord If it was, Trump would actually be getting one more vote. But he isn't, the Green party is.
1311733291637043200 2020-10-02 02:22:42 +0800 <Underdawg47> @4eva1984 @BuddhaBumble @BernieSanders I don't work like a circus pony for likes.
1311732986623127552 2020-10-02 02:21:29 +0800 <Underdawg47> @flints1963 the Green party has nothing to do with Trump. Biden has policies closer to that of Trump and many Democrats vote for Trumps policies in congress.
1311732390478245888 2020-10-02 02:19:07 +0800 <Underdawg47> @psu_82 @BernieSanders I won't be complaining. I am voting for the candidate with the better policies. I won't have a shitty taste in my mouth voting for Green like those voting for Biden or Trump.
1311731392061927425 2020-10-02 02:15:09 +0800 <Underdawg47> @usaf__vet @UPP_Polls I think the Democrats are just as guilty, they corrupt things in different ways.
1311730865290899456 2020-10-02 02:13:03 +0800 <Underdawg47> @anon_et @BernieSanders it is my vote to "waste"
1311730741890359296 2020-10-02 02:12:34 +0800 <Underdawg47> @anon_et @BuddhaBumble @BernieSanders I haven't seen any evidence that would convince me differently.
1311730483412131840 2020-10-02 02:11:32 +0800 <Underdawg47> @awakeby2020 @gerberianshepsk I guess my Green vote will just have to go to Trump, what ever that means. My vote never belonged to the Democrats in the first place. We told Democrats right at the beginning of the primary that progressive policies were the only thing to sway us to vote blue.
1311729224307236865 2020-10-02 02:06:32 +0800 <Underdawg47> @OdiumCritz @BernsteinCamryn @BernieSanders Well maybe if Democrats would select someone we would want to vote for, maybe we would vote along with Democrats, but you selected another terrible corporate stooge. My best option is to vote Green
1311728848258494465 2020-10-02 02:05:02 +0800 <Underdawg47> @tga_tgoodfellow That is your choice. You do what you think is best. For me voting Green is my best option. I would have voted Democrat if Bernie or Tulsi were the candidate, but that isn't happening.
1311727886995349504 2020-10-02 02:01:13 +0800 <Underdawg47> @scat69pac @BernieSanders Oh, but I will. I will vote Green
1311727730895933440 2020-10-02 02:00:36 +0800 <Underdawg47> @SchMieke @BernieSanders yeah, keep spouting your corporate BS. Tell that to Biden who refuses to enact any progressive policy. I'm not voting for corporate tools that offer us nothing.
1311726948666626048 2020-10-02 01:57:29 +0800 <Underdawg47> @CyntLandrum @efonekpo @awakeby2020 @gerberianshepsk The problem is the monopoly of 2 corporate parties.
1311726736959139840 2020-10-02 01:56:39 +0800 <Underdawg47> @BendeVos1 @amandarachell20 @BernieSanders I'll take my chances with the Greens. I know the BS I'll be getting with Biden or Trump
1311725792032747520 2020-10-02 01:52:54 +0800 <Underdawg47> @realitybypamela No, Biden said he doesn't support Medicare for all or the Green New Deal. I'm not voting for terrible policies in either party. I'm voting Green
1311725378025615361 2020-10-02 01:51:15 +0800 <Underdawg47> @may_kergen @BernieSanders Well Democrats knew how bad this president was and yet picked the worst candidate to go against him once again. You had 4 years to do stuff yet blew it. I'm voting Green because that is the better choice.
1311723668829990918 2020-10-02 01:44:27 +0800 <Underdawg47> @doctoralexa I have heard this same exact BS my entire life. "This is a special case. Wait until the next election to vote Green, Blah blah blah. You guys knew how bad Trump was and let picked another terrible stooge to run against Trump. No, this is your fault. I'm voting Green.
1311722391765020672 2020-10-02 01:39:23 +0800 <Underdawg47> @svnrings2 @BernieSanders I can show you countless reason why I will not vote for Biden
1311508487189405696 2020-10-01 11:29:24 +0800 <Underdawg47> @HarryF42069 @RestingPaper I'll have to check it out
1311508334713819136 2020-10-01 11:28:48 +0800 <Underdawg47> @BenjaminFMcAdoo @BernieSanders I don't want either Biden or Trump. Both of them are terrible clowns and neither deserve the presidency.  But instead of leaving the spot blank, I'm voting Green
1311507561548455938 2020-10-01 11:25:43 +0800 <Underdawg47> @kayladenver @BernieSanders You vote your way and I'll vote Green
1311507341402013698 2020-10-01 11:24:51 +0800 <Underdawg47> @subliminal_cat Greens are much better and no, they don't exist to help Trump no more than the Libertarian party exists to help Biden.
1311506816140898304 2020-10-01 11:22:46 +0800 <Underdawg47> @amandarachell20 @baijorcro @BernieSanders I'm not waiting for Ranked Choice Voting, but I will be happy when it does arrive, but that is a long way off since the corporate duopoly will fight it tooth and nail.
1311506232537092097 2020-10-01 11:20:27 +0800 <Underdawg47> @BenjaminFMcAdoo @BernieSanders Clearly you don't understand that people have the right to vote for whoever they want whether it benefits you or not.
1311506038877687809 2020-10-01 11:19:40 +0800 <Underdawg47> @momofbaybry @NoFascistLies well my vote means something to me whether you like it or not.

1311504304969146368 2020-10-01 11:12:47 +0800 <Underdawg47> @kburton40 I think so
1311485344643125248 2020-10-01 09:57:27 +0800 <Underdawg47> @BuddhaBumble @BernieSanders Well it is my choice. I dare to vote for something better than the 2 corporate stooges.
1311484624854372353 2020-10-01 09:54:35 +0800 <Underdawg47> @treasurethecat @BernieSanders and you can kiss my ass
1311483983318802432 2020-10-01 09:52:02 +0800 <Underdawg47> People keep telling me to be practical and vote Biden. But if I had listened to everyone that told me to do the practical thing, I would never have left my hometown, or never have dared to ride my bicycle across the country. I dare to vote for something better. I'm voting Green.
1311483242109784070 2020-10-01 09:49:05 +0800 <Underdawg47> @kayladenver @BernieSanders We are growing in number.  I encourage everyone to vote Green
1311483074912219137 2020-10-01 09:48:25 +0800 <Underdawg47> @BuddhaBumble @BernieSanders Sorry, but I'm not voting for Biden or Trump. I'm not voting for evil, or for crappy Republican policies. The Green party has the policies I want
1311482216044613632 2020-10-01 09:45:01 +0800 <Underdawg47> @amandarachell20 @BernieSanders Interesting that people call it privilege when the poor have the audacity to vote for their better interests rather than the corporate stooge that they are being bullied to vote for.

1311479821323522049 2020-10-01 09:35:30 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheView @BernieSanders No, Biden doesn't share the same views on healthcare. Biden doesn't support medicare for all.  Bernie is just sheepdogging at this point.
1311479438412972032 2020-10-01 09:33:58 +0800 <Underdawg47> @timtation123 It just makes me laugh. Trump knows that Biden is not the radical left, but he says that just for his uninformed base.
1311477848675250177 2020-10-01 09:27:39 +0800 <Underdawg47> @BuddhaBumble @BernieSanders We are already there. Biden is just the same except he hides it better.

1311463063950770176 2020-10-01 08:28:54 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden No you aren't. You are doing nothing to win people's votes, because you are unable to offer us anything but what your corporate donors allow you to offer, which is nothing.
1311462325375778816 2020-10-01 08:25:58 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ClayHartedGhoul 5, 4, and neither. I don't drink coffee
1311461512121208838 2020-10-01 08:22:44 +0800 <Underdawg47> @WalkerBragman thats ok, I don't care how other people vote, but when they attack me for voting Green, that is when I will unfollow people.
1311456116035842049 2020-10-01 08:01:18 +0800 <Underdawg47> @SportsF68477575 @JoeBiden I am, I'm voting Green
1311455981969186816 2020-10-01 08:00:46 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ladymlee1 @JoeBiden Sharp? That is funny. I'm not voting for either of those corporate clowns I watched on the debate last night. I will be voting Green
1311455336763588608 2020-10-01 07:58:12 +0800 <Underdawg47> @BernieSanders I'm voting Green. If enough people vote Green we would win, unlikely, but better than voting for a corporate stooge.

1311453063484301312 2020-10-01 07:49:10 +0800 <Underdawg47> @philly_bernie No whining on my part. I'm happy to be voting Green
1311452774773608448 2020-10-01 07:48:01 +0800 <Underdawg47> @philly_bernie Thanks for your approval as if I needed it
1311452532099563520 2020-10-01 07:47:03 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden I'm not getting on that train wreck with a senile driver at the wheel
1311442335763361792 2020-10-01 07:06:32 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MJBondNashville @DefensorPacis4 @Nudiustertian2 @Bradshaw2020 Well you can believe that crap if you want, but I'm voting Green. They have better policies and don't take corporate bribe money
1311441797004943360 2020-10-01 07:04:24 +0800 <Underdawg47> @philly_bernie Maybe this time they will do better. With these 2 rotten clowns to choose from, the Greens are looking like the better choice to more and more people.
1311441180085743618 2020-10-01 07:01:57 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Chasten @HillaryClinton Yes, I saw one of her stupid tweets earlier. That turd keeps popping to the surface.
1311440875092803585 2020-10-01 07:00:44 +0800 <Underdawg47> @kenzietoday Yeah, I'm sure it is true. Biden has pretended to care about the left, but most of us already know he is a corporate tool.
1311440029051285504 2020-10-01 06:57:22 +0800 <Underdawg47> @philly_bernie It would be great if the Green party actually won.
1311438119099539457 2020-10-01 06:49:47 +0800 <Underdawg47> @K84UnitedLeft Ewwwww, I'm gay, but I would never be attracted to elderly corporate stooges in any party.
1311436854525190145 2020-10-01 06:44:46 +0800 <Underdawg47> @HillaryClinton @JoeBiden Boo, no one should listen to a sore loser who blames everyone for their loss except themselves. No voting for another stooge like you.
1311434805448372224 2020-10-01 06:36:37 +0800 <Underdawg47> @BarackObama Biden serves his corporate donors like you did. I will be voting Green

1311433165546819584 2020-10-01 06:30:06 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MJBondNashville @DefensorPacis4 @Nudiustertian2 @Bradshaw2020 We certainly disagree. The Greens are in no way like Republicans, but Democrats have policies just like Republicans
1311432361276444673 2020-10-01 06:26:54 +0800 <Underdawg47> @joshfoxfilm Interesting that you claim to be the anti fracking guy, and yet you are voting for the candidate that supports fracking. That is not being very radical or leftist. I'm voting for the party that actually wants to ban fracking, the Green Party.
1311425284462186496 2020-10-01 05:58:47 +0800 <Underdawg47> @joshfoxfilm I don't think you would be considered radical left

1311424707506311169 2020-10-01 05:56:30 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden We should ignore voting for you as well.
1311416214233677824 2020-10-01 05:22:45 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Savion @Landorcan Thanks, more people in swing states should have your courage of conviction. I'm voting Green and would do the same if I were in a swing state.

1311410506528223232 2020-10-01 05:00:04 +0800 <Underdawg47> @stephnbrookss @ProudSocialist @JoeBiden No, you are wrong. You are assuming that my vote is owned by the Democrats. My vote will go to the Green party

1311409825696284672 2020-10-01 04:57:21 +0800 <Underdawg47> @stephnbrookss @ProudSocialist @JoeBiden No, but if I did I would still vote Green

1311407778418683905 2020-10-01 04:49:13 +0800 <Underdawg47> @stephnbrookss @ProudSocialist @JoeBiden If I don't vote Green or 3rd party, I will simply leave the POTUS spot blank. No way in hell will I vote for either of those corporate clowns.
1311407516979322880 2020-10-01 04:48:11 +0800 <Underdawg47> @stephnbrookss @ProudSocialist @JoeBiden You can settle for crap, but I'm not.
1311407398561607680 2020-10-01 04:47:43 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RicardoDonato9 @IAmKravenJames @PolCLITical @DovahFem Last night made me more determined to vote Green. Biden is a corporate clown
1311406889909936129 2020-10-01 04:45:41 +0800 <Underdawg47> @VetrepreneurOne @DrJillStein No way are Greens going to support a corporate party. If the Democrats want Green votes they would have to earn the votes with progressive policy which they will not do.
1311404916150157312 2020-10-01 04:37:51 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Kassern1 @ProudSocialist @JoeBiden Biden said he doesn't support a Green New Deal, or Medicare For All and supports the police. I'm not voting for either clown I saw on that stage. I'll be voting Green
1311404399843962881 2020-10-01 04:35:48 +0800 <Underdawg47> @funinthesunner @ProudSocialist @JoeBiden I will be voting Green. The debate was a clown show between two corporate clowns.

1311402946261737472 2020-10-01 04:30:01 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ProudSocialist @JoeBiden I will be voting Green. It would be great if we all voted Green in record numbers.
1311398188822097920 2020-10-01 04:11:07 +0800 <Underdawg47> @subliminal_cat @TweetyMctwat That was the point. Biden was pushed through the primaries only to keep progressives from the nomination. Democrats don't really care if they lose against Trump as seen last night with Biden's dumb performance.
1311397434715643904 2020-10-01 04:08:07 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MJBondNashville @DefensorPacis4 @Nudiustertian2 @Bradshaw2020 Biden showed to me last night that he is a true corporate stooge and is not progressive in the least bit. I will be voting Green
1311395265023148032 2020-10-01 03:59:30 +0800 <Underdawg47> @anarcanon Oh hell no, I'm not voting for either of those clowns I saw in the debate last night. I will be voting Green
1311393745955205121 2020-10-01 03:53:28 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ComptonMadeMe If they each had called the other a clown, both of them would have been right. I watched a clown show last night between two corporate clowns.
1311392156259545088 2020-10-01 03:47:09 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RussianBot3002 I actually liked that they ignored the moderator. It was a clown show. Through the uncivil behavior, they both got exposed for how terrible they both are.
1311387858326880256 2020-10-01 03:30:04 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Ilhan Agreed, and Biden is a senile corporate tool. I'm not voting for either of those clowns.
1311386979586596864 2020-10-01 03:26:34 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Hector_E_Alcala We don't need a Democratic Party either
1311380747744280577 2020-10-01 03:01:49 +0800 <Underdawg47> @grumpybirdieS I am voting for the Green Party. I couldn't stand to vote for either of those 2 clowns I saw on the debate last night. Biden bragging how he beat Bernie disgusted me.

1311378737145896961 2020-10-01 02:53:49 +0800 <Underdawg47> @BoKnowsNews @CBSNews Neither of those clowns won. It was embarrassing. America has already lost to these clowns.
1311377971798700033 2020-10-01 02:50:47 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ASterling @WarsARacket none of the above. Voting Green here.
1311376532024090625 2020-10-01 02:45:04 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JimmyKimmelLive @BernieSanders Biden showed us that he certainly doesn't support the Green New Deal or Medicare For All. I will not be voting for either of those clowns. I will be voting Green.
1311372916185989122 2020-10-01 02:30:42 +0800 <Underdawg47> @cobradimond @MMFlint @LittleBirdSteph yes, I do.
1311372510626082816 2020-10-01 02:29:05 +0800 <Underdawg47> @BradleyWhitford @JoeBiden I watched a clown show between two clowns.
1311372288718065664 2020-10-01 02:28:12 +0800 <Underdawg47> @realDonaldTrump You are an idiot. All the stuff you could have hit Biden on and it certainly isn't far left. Biden is much closer to you than you pretend he is.
1311371807778205697 2020-10-01 02:26:17 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden After seeing both of you in that clown show last night. You certainly made it clear that you have no intensions of putting forth any progressive policies. I will be voting Green
1311371335596040192 2020-10-01 02:24:25 +0800 <Underdawg47> @cobradimond @MMFlint @LittleBirdSteph I am, that is why I am voting Green.
1311371019106414592 2020-10-01 02:23:09 +0800 <Underdawg47> @OrtegaZak @antiwarmisfit Thanks, too bad that the Greens and Libertarians couldn't be the 2 major parties. I can live with either of those choices.

1311370171760562176 2020-10-01 02:19:47 +0800 <Underdawg47> @OrtegaZak @antiwarmisfit That is a much better choice than Trump or Biden
1311368586603032577 2020-10-01 02:13:29 +0800 <Underdawg47> @thehill an onslaught of platitudes and Gibberish.

1311367100154343425 2020-10-01 02:07:35 +0800 <Underdawg47> @cobradimond @MMFlint @LittleBirdSteph What is in everyone's best interest to to rid this country of corporate bought stooges. You can't do that by always voting for them. I'm voting Green for POTUS and progressives down ballot.
1311365842794237953 2020-10-01 02:02:35 +0800 <Underdawg47> @AmericanAndGay @JoeBiden That is your choice. I can't vote for either Biden or Trump. I can't stand either candidate. I will be voting Green
1311365172901023745 2020-10-01 01:59:55 +0800 <Underdawg47> @cobradimond @MMFlint @LittleBirdSteph What you really mean is how dare poor people like me to have the audacity to vote for policies we want instead of the corporate candidate
1311363922461487104 2020-10-01 01:54:57 +0800 <Underdawg47> @VictorRousseau9 Yes, I think it would be funny to see Rogan make fun of both of those clowns. Biden doesn't have a speech impediment, he is senile and loses his train of thought and says nonsense crap.
1311362726707355650 2020-10-01 01:50:12 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MJBondNashville @DefensorPacis4 @Nudiustertian2 @Bradshaw2020 Go for it. I'm voting for the Green Party. Biden proved last night that he hates progressives.
1311362324263890944 2020-10-01 01:48:36 +0800 <Underdawg47> @johncusack @JoshuaPotash Biden is part of that group and he wrote that horrible Patriot Act. I can't vote for that crap.
1311361532555489281 2020-10-01 01:45:27 +0800 <Underdawg47> @casofdist He also got Biden to show that Biden hates progressives by saying he is not for the Green New Deal, Medicare For All. I am not voting for either of those clowns I saw in the debate last night. I am voting Green

1311145812831789056 2020-09-30 11:28:16 +0800 <Underdawg47> @AmericanAndGay @JoeBiden I'm voting for something better. Medicare for All with the Green Party. I don't like having insurance companies running health care.

I won't vote for Biden because of his crappy policies, his taking corporate bribe money, voting for regime change wars, the Patriot Act. His sexual assault accusations, and his lies. No, Biden is not worth voting for.

1311068910116978688 2020-09-30 06:22:41 +0800 <Underdawg47> @AmericanAndGay @JoeBiden Sorry, but I don't want that corporate for profit crap. My Bf had ACA and couldn't afford to use it. Now they tell him to buy COBRA crap that he can't afford after losing his job.  I will be voting Green. They have Medicare for All.

Surly they know the chances of rich people seeing the Kingdom of Heaven  being like a camel trying to fit through the eye of a needle. Trump is the epitome of Mammon, but so is Biden

1311057125804634112 2020-09-30 05:35:51 +0800 <Underdawg47> @EdMarkey @neolibtarded Unfortunately, Obama didn't fight for his supreme court pick and used it as a bargaining chip to get people to vote for Hillary. It back fired. RBG could have safely retired under Obama yet somehow she decided to wait in the hope that Hillary would win, and bet wrong.

I don't give a rat's ass about your imaginary $10m, the Greens offer real policies that would actually help. Take your BS and find some other sucker who would buy your crappy candidate.
1310263035806715906 2020-09-28 01:00:25 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MJBondNashville @DefensorPacis4 @Nudiustertian2 @Bradshaw2020 The Green party is legit party and if the Republican party assists to get them on the ballot, then good. People deserve other choices. If Democrats want our votes, they need to earn them by giving us better policy, but they don't. They are courting Republican voters.

1309949938298740738 2020-09-27 04:16:17 +0800 <Underdawg47> @marwilliamson @DianeRichards77 Yes, vote Green or for progressives down ballot. Biden or Trump doesn't offer anything of substance

I won't vote for this crap

1309931783475965952 2020-09-27 03:04:09 +0800 <Underdawg47> @raising_hill @DrJillStein Okay Karen

1309931078157611008 2020-09-27 03:01:21 +0800 <Underdawg47> @raising_hill @DrJillStein Greens are right for me.

1309928847161266176 2020-09-27 02:52:29 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ViragoX @raising_hill @DrJillStein I didn't feel dirty after casting my vote and I saw Hillary lose, so that was good.
1309928596853514242 2020-09-27 02:51:29 +0800 <Underdawg47> @tastey_b @1damnedatheist @ReallyAmerican1 so you bring up this privilege thing. I suppose I am privileged to have been homeless and to know how to survive without many resources. Yes, indeed I vote for things that would improve my life. Never had healthcare, or a job that paid more than 20k a year. Greens would help me.
1309926718732251137 2020-09-27 02:44:01 +0800 <Underdawg47> @raising_hill @DrJillStein Jill Stein had far better policies than Hillary or Trump. No way was I going to vote for either of those clowns. Jill Stein was the logical choice after Bernie.
1309926331690356737 2020-09-27 02:42:29 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LL_LJL @atrupar That is true. I would have voted for anyone other than Hillary or Trump, or left the spot blank.
1309926059761000448 2020-09-27 02:41:24 +0800 <Underdawg47> @pathofex Democrats never want to blame themselves for choosing a candidate so hated that people would rather vote for the orange clown over her. They knew that Hillary was a crappy candidate but chose her anyway.
1309925551734366208 2020-09-27 02:39:23 +0800 <Underdawg47> @GarlandSculptor exactly, if I didn't have the Green party to vote for, I would have simply picked another 3rd party. Neither Hillary or Trump would have gotten my vote. If there was no 3rd party i would have simply left the POTUS spot blank.
1309925054189248514 2020-09-27 02:37:24 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ColYou Democrats don't really care if they win or not, they just came to blame others for their loss because some people refused to vote for their crappy candidate who had nothing to offer.
1309923498135941120 2020-09-27 02:31:13 +0800 <Underdawg47> @tastey_b @1damnedatheist @ReallyAmerican1 I don't care if it doesn't have the best chance of winning. I'm not winning anything if I vote for either Biden or Trump. I lose whether either one of them wins.
1309922920207060992 2020-09-27 02:28:56 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Outkick Maybe Rogan should just go some independent route and stay uncensored.
1309922517943898112 2020-09-27 02:27:20 +0800 <Underdawg47> @KatiePhang @EmmaVigeland Unfortunately Obama could have fought for his supreme court pick, but instead opted to use it as a bargaining chip to vote for Hillary and lost. Same thing with RBG, she could have safely retired under Obama when Democrats had control of the house and senate.
1309920293008277505 2020-09-27 02:18:29 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ProjectLincoln Nah, We can actually vote for 3rd parties. Nether Biden or Trump offer us anything but more misery.
1309919874714537990 2020-09-27 02:16:49 +0800 <Underdawg47> @tastey_b @1damnedatheist @ReallyAmerican1 Neither Biden or Trump offer people anything of importance. Both of them are terrible choices. I don't vote based upon whether someone will win or not. I vote based upon the policies I want for the country.
1309918516246581248 2020-09-27 02:11:26 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Scepticdust Wow that is so funny.
1309917827923542016 2020-09-27 02:08:41 +0800 <Underdawg47> @atrupar @krystalball Maybe RBG should have safely retired under Obama when Democrats had control of the house and senate, but they used her as a bargaining chip to force people to vote for Hillary. That stupid bet backfired and that is how Trump got this seat.
1309917104552902656 2020-09-27 02:05:49 +0800 <Underdawg47> @atrupar @krystalball So you don't think the Democrats should be blamed for selecting a corrupt scandal ridden Hillary who was so hated that people held their nose to vote for?   Now they did it once again by selecting a senile old clown with 40 years of terrible policy who is just as bad as Hillary
1309915832542060544 2020-09-27 02:00:46 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TurncoatD Smug Bill Maher up to his classic BS vote shaming again
1309914590889742336 2020-09-27 01:55:50 +0800 <Underdawg47> @pinkladyfoxx I agree. If Jill Stein voters are that powerful, maybe we should actually for the Green Party. They have better policies, don't take corporate bribe money, and you don't have to hold your nose to vote for them.
1309912453426290688 2020-09-27 01:47:20 +0800 <Underdawg47> @KarenChowdhury @joe01880 @mmpadellan If Democrats really wanted progressive votes they would have chosen Bernie. However they decided to go with the corporate clown instead. I vote for policies, not clowns who take corporate bribe money. If Biden loses, it is their fault entirely.
1309911221525594112 2020-09-27 01:42:26 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MJBondNashville @DefensorPacis4 @Nudiustertian2 @Bradshaw2020 They had all the right things to get on the ballot. And Greens have absolutely nothing to do with Republicans, and have the same right as both those corporate Parties to run a candidate for POTUS.
1309910594468761600 2020-09-27 01:39:57 +0800 <Underdawg47> @tastey_b @1damnedatheist @ReallyAmerican1 Better to vote for something I want and lose, than to vote for something I absolutely hate and be certain not to get it. Also, I don't care which one of those clowns win, we already lost with either one of them. They are both evil.
1309910057455214592 2020-09-27 01:37:49 +0800 <Underdawg47> @PalmerReport No, but hell no. I voted for Jill Stein and intend to vote for Howie Hawkins. Not our fault Democrats picked another corrupt, lame corporate stooge that people hate so much that they have to hold their noses to vote for.
1309908924955459584 2020-09-27 01:33:19 +0800 <Underdawg47> @banalplay RBG could have safely retired under Obama. Obama didn't even try and fight for his Supreme Court pick because he arrogantly assumed Hillary would win. They used RBG as a means to get people to vote Hillary and LOST.

I don't trust either Republicans or Democrats. And no, Greens are not some plot by Republicans. They are an actual progressive party with policies I want

It is not a crime to be different or act strangely. It is not okay for police to be looking for trouble when no trouble exists.

He'd rather continue taking corporate donor money and tell people they don't have any other choice. Democrats had said that they'd rather have Trump than Bernie which tells me mission complete.

1308560074084761600 2020-09-23 08:13:28 +0800 <Underdawg47> @gwoodle I suppose we see things much differently. I can see that you don't believe in protesting unless someone tries to take your guns away or you are marching against abortions, am I right? But you would claim that you were being "peaceful."

1308544374842650624 2020-09-23 07:11:05 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden Not voting for an old grifter like you Joe. You need to earn people's votes, but you are more concerned about your corporate donors wishes.

1308115633939259393 2020-09-22 02:47:25 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Bootsismagic @nc_boomer @The_Pale_H0rse @chipfranklin @JoeBiden It was becoming one under Obama as well. Obama crushed the Occupy movement, prosecuted whistle blowers for exposing government corruption, the Democratic party cheated and rigged the primary for Hillary and it was proven by Wikileaks.

1307710205086449665 2020-09-20 23:56:23 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Bootsismagic @nc_boomer @The_Pale_H0rse @chipfranklin @JoeBiden The reason Biden is the nominee is because Obama stepped in and asked all the other candidates to drop out. The establishment putting its foot on the scales to give us the clown we have now. It was all about stopping Bernie. The donors don't really care about Trump

1307589611514986499 2020-09-20 15:57:11 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Bootsismagic @nc_boomer @The_Pale_H0rse @chipfranklin @JoeBiden Well apparently Democrats didn't learn anything from 2016. They need to hit rock bottom before they change and I guess we haven't gotten there yet. We probably need everyone in the streets before it is over.
1307584856759574529 2020-09-20 15:38:18 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Bootsismagic @nc_boomer @The_Pale_H0rse @chipfranklin @JoeBiden The thing is, I do care. I care enough to stop voting for the very evil that has destroyed this country. You seem to think the Democrats are somehow better, but they allow the evil on the other side to flourish. They are the other side of the same evil coin.
1307584097737306113 2020-09-20 15:35:17 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Bootsismagic @nc_boomer @The_Pale_H0rse @chipfranklin @JoeBiden I know our government sucks. Both parties are evil. They are both complicit in crimes against humanity and I refuse to vote for either of those evil toads. You can vote for that same evil but count me out.
1307515034822615041 2020-09-20 11:00:51 +0800 <Underdawg47> @sammythemc @HMccrotch @Putins_Bitch @briebriejoy Yes, the Green Party is for medicare for all, a Green New deal, forgiving student debt, against regime change wars, legalizing marijuana and even further to the left of Bernie.
1307509243797331968 2020-09-20 10:37:50 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LeftistFun @automatonomega No, they should suffer.
1307508646562074624 2020-09-20 10:35:28 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RealTrevorReese @SoapBoxinCA Yeah, and his followers won't know the difference. They don't seem to care about policy as long as a D is in front of it.
1307508188825100289 2020-09-20 10:33:39 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Putins_Bitch @briebriejoy That doesn't matter. You are accusing voters of being privileged for trying to vote for policies that would actually help them. but you want to vote shame those into voting for a candidate that has no intention of doing anything other than pleasing their corporate donors.
1307507309342416896 2020-09-20 10:30:09 +0800 <Underdawg47> @AngryBlackLady Yeah, she should have retired when she was in an Obama presidency with Democrats in control of both the house and the senate, especially after being diagnosed with cancer. She knew the risks that her remaining on the bench posed.
1307482449123766272 2020-09-20 08:51:22 +0800 <Underdawg47> @lisaquinninc @bigmoneysucks Voting Green in WA state
1307482287219433472 2020-09-20 08:50:43 +0800 <Underdawg47> @posadist_trapgd Its not like they didn't see it coming. Having cancer and being in her 90s is not the picture of health.
1307477929836703744 2020-09-20 08:33:24 +0800 <Underdawg47> @FOGOAL1776 I am also aware that Obama could have actually fought for his supreme court pick, but decided to use it a hostage situation to force people to vote for Hillary, and that stupid plan backfired because people really hated Hillary.
1307477197880307712 2020-09-20 08:30:30 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Bootsismagic @nc_boomer @The_Pale_H0rse @chipfranklin @JoeBiden I haven't been convinced that I am wrong. You seem to  to complain about the fact that you can't convince me to vote your way. Even better, you know your candidate is shitty, yet instead of asking your candidate to try to win over votes with better policy, you blame the voter.
1307475866067247104 2020-09-20 08:25:12 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Bootsismagic @nc_boomer @The_Pale_H0rse @chipfranklin @JoeBiden Bernie has a right to support any candidate he wants. I also have that same right. I support the Greens. We are allowed to have other parties than just the two corporate ones.
1307474965176881152 2020-09-20 08:21:38 +0800 <Underdawg47> @HMccrotch @Putins_Bitch @briebriejoy Yeah, but Biden doesn't offer better policies. The Green Party does though
1307474220784300032 2020-09-20 08:18:40 +0800 <Underdawg47> @marwilliamson Yep, Trump is terrible for sure, but Biden is not a better choice by default. I will be voting Green. Maybe you should teach people to be brave and vote for better things instead of settling for crappy policies out of fear.
1307473605815541760 2020-09-20 08:16:13 +0800 <Underdawg47> @thehill @TheHillOpinion Michelle would be a terrible supreme court nominee.
1307472973264158720 2020-09-20 08:13:43 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Putins_Bitch @briebriejoy I thought the privileged ones were those rich snooty people with a silver spoon stuck up their ass, but now even the poor are seen to be privileged to have the audacity not to vote for corporate criminals.
1307465301420769280 2020-09-20 07:43:14 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden Why? What do you have to offer us?
1307465112991612929 2020-09-20 07:42:29 +0800 <Underdawg47> @critic_swedish His Republican policies and terrible voting history.
1307423106466603008 2020-09-20 04:55:33 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike and in the meantime we could simply refuse to vote for any candidate taking corporate money.
1307422957828857856 2020-09-20 04:54:58 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike exactly, that is why I refuse to vote for any candidate taking corporate money.
1307422756871446530 2020-09-20 04:54:10 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike yeah, about that. I think lobbyists should be illegal
1307422295288238080 2020-09-20 04:52:20 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ewarren Democrats are not known for fighting or even trying to fight for something important. They are far more concerned with the corporate donors. Am I right, Liz?
1307421573821808642 2020-09-20 04:49:28 +0800 <Underdawg47> @thehill @TheHillOpinion rolls my eyes at the thought
1307421029585756160 2020-09-20 04:47:18 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RepJerryNadler @SenateGOP If the Republicans can do that, it only shows how little the Democrats are willing to fight for anything.
1307420423999483904 2020-09-20 04:44:54 +0800 <Underdawg47> @BreatheNewWinds @ShaunasOpinions I will be voting for the Green Party unless I can vote for Jesse Ventura
1307419993420697600 2020-09-20 04:43:11 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheStagmania Is privilege code for, "I don't like that you are not voting my way?"
1307417208969076737 2020-09-20 04:32:07 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike that is true. For too long we have been told me must vote for one of the 2 corporate parties that offer us very little if anything. I refuse to be a part of that and actually vote for policies I want.
1307416698325147648 2020-09-20 04:30:06 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike I don't think the government  has insurance companies.
1307416311815761920 2020-09-20 04:28:34 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Jok80275217 @johncusack @logonorblastoff medicare for all would be affordable. Obamacare requires that you pay a premium, then when you actually want to use it, you must come up with co-pays, deductibles and you still get an extremely expensive bill.
1307415836588609536 2020-09-20 04:26:40 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike the money comes through taxes, not payments to insurance companies.
1307415595109900289 2020-09-20 04:25:43 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike yeah, and it is unaffordable to many Americans
1307415441510334465 2020-09-20 04:25:06 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike That is not what Medicare for all is. health insurance companies are not involved.  https://t.co/MI2jL3Isez
1307414633506992128 2020-09-20 04:21:53 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike Well, that is why I am not voting for Biden or Trump. They are both crooks.
1307414459074265088 2020-09-20 04:21:12 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike When people go to Canada or Mexico, they don't get covered either, but what they do charge is by far more cheaper than here in the US.
1307414102382227457 2020-09-20 04:19:47 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike No, Obamacare is actually a Republican version called Romneycare.
1307413932139708416 2020-09-20 04:19:06 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike Under medicare for all, there are no health care insurance companies involved.
1307413780930805760 2020-09-20 04:18:30 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike There are no premiums under medicare for all, just taxes.
1307413648759861253 2020-09-20 04:17:59 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike medicare should be for all of us.
1307413568065736704 2020-09-20 04:17:39 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike No, I disagree. Having a middle man that is a for profit organization is far more costly.
1307412874352975872 2020-09-20 04:14:54 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RBReich Apparently so. Obama didn't really fight for his constitutional right to select a replacement and caved to the Republicans betting that Hillary would win if they used this as a means of shaming Democrats into voting for her.
1307412209702584320 2020-09-20 04:12:15 +0800 <Underdawg47> @iskandrah True, but she knew that she had cancer and was in her 90s. She could have safely retired under the Obama administration, but she took the bet that that Hillary would win but instead lost. This foolish decision cost the left another seat.
1307410777574223872 2020-09-20 04:06:34 +0800 <Underdawg47> @rodsbackup Democrats are not fighters &amp; will probably give Trump his pick before the election.
1307410420408496128 2020-09-20 04:05:09 +0800 <Underdawg47> @TheMarieFonseca RBG could have retired under the Obama administration and been replaced back then, but she decided to hang on, putting her hopes on Hillary and using this, in a sense, to black mail us into voting for Hillary. The lame plan backfired and this is where we are now.
1307409528971960320 2020-09-20 04:01:36 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike No it won't. Corporate Insurance companies will not be a part of medicare for all
1307407573008568320 2020-09-20 03:53:50 +0800 <Underdawg47> @KenWebsterII RBG could have chosen to retire safely under the Obama administration, but chose to stay hoping that Hillary would win. That seems a bit irresponsible to me.
1307406761310089216 2020-09-20 03:50:36 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RealSteveCox RBG could have retired under Obama and he could have replaced her with someone just as liberal, but they took the bet that Hillary would win. Just like Obama didn't fight for his other supreme court pick and used this as a hostage situation to force people to vote for Hillary
1307403661379657728 2020-09-20 03:38:17 +0800 <Underdawg47> @eyemsimone @WalkerBragman @LegacyZeroYT And this is why I am voting Green
1307402590733254656 2020-09-20 03:34:02 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike Lazy people like Biden and Melonia will cheat to get ahead. But Bernie didn't plagiarize others speeches or cheat in college, or lie that he was at the top of his class when he wasn't. Biden has a long history of lying.  https://t.co/x81LoeZVPr
1307400520592572416 2020-09-20 03:25:49 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike Obamacare forced people to buy health insurance from companies that charged high premiums, co-pays, and deductibles that was too expensive to use. Medicare for all comes out of taxes. the difference is that one is a public service paid through taxes vs being forced to pay a corp
1307398177302040576 2020-09-20 03:16:30 +0800 <Underdawg47> @WalkerBragman @LegacyZeroYT Biden wants regime change in Venezuela.
1307397992035483648 2020-09-20 03:15:46 +0800 <Underdawg47> @WalkerBragman @inovajon I think the Greens are much better. I can't vote for cheating Democrats after they took Greens off the ballots in Wisconsin and PA.
1307396196240031745 2020-09-20 03:08:38 +0800 <Underdawg47> @CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump As if you care what happens to a baby after it is born, the parents that live in poverty for the crappy system that makes it difficult to feed an extra mouth, the lack of affordable health care, or lack of college opportunities without going into extreme debt.
1307394843358801920 2020-09-20 03:03:15 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Smoove_1090 AOC being the sheep herder for Biden buy selling fear of Trump. I hate Biden just as much if not more.
1307394498117296128 2020-09-20 03:01:53 +0800 <Underdawg47> @kburton40 Sorry AOC, not buying this shit about voting for Biden. Every single presidential election is a special case to vote for corporate Democrats. We have no real democracy if the Democrats can just kick another party off the ballots. I'll not be part of that shit or their corruption.
1307390495262302208 2020-09-20 02:45:58 +0800 <Underdawg47> @johncusack @logonorblastoff Obamacare is not affordable and neither Biden or Trump offer us anything that is meaningful.
1307389692896182272 2020-09-20 02:42:47 +0800 <Underdawg47> @yogagirlmab @genxgmom I love Jimmy's passion. He tells it like it is.
1307387925743591424 2020-09-20 02:35:46 +0800 <Underdawg47> @SAVoltolin @EclecticRadical I think many people cave and move to the other side out of fear. We are not a country of the land of the free and home of the brave, most of us are scared sheep afraid to take a chance and vote against the 2 major parties.
1307387093811826688 2020-09-20 02:32:27 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike I don't know many Bernie supporters who align themselves with Trump supporters or their policies. We hate Biden for completely different reasons. Trump could actually beat Biden if he attacked Biden on his past policy decisions or lying, but Trump would be exposing his own crimes
1307385925924651008 2020-09-20 02:27:49 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike The Democrats will lose because of corporate Democrats not having good policy. Medicare for all is widely popular, Biden has a long history of lying, and having terrible policies.
1307385341976875008 2020-09-20 02:25:30 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ChosenOneMike They filed the right paper work, It was the Democrats who decided it just wasn't good enough.   And yes, I have no regrets about my choices.

1307032918871736326 2020-09-19 03:05:06 +0800 <Underdawg47> @critic_swedish @kindredsoul_1 I wish the Greens would win. but that is unlikely. I wish Biden and Trump would lose. Maybe a miracle will happen and they will both get sick with the Covid virus and rid the world of them both.

I won't vote for either one of those clowns. No apathy here, but maybe you are too late in sounding your alarm. You should have fought just as hard to stop Biden.
1307031196094754816 2020-09-19 02:58:15 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Sally_Albrigh You do know that Biden is probably their last choice and you will be now encouraging people to look elsewhere to place their vote like the Libertarian party or perhaps even a vote for Trump in a swing state. Trump thanks you!

1306353076769447936 2020-09-17 06:03:39 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MattJonesRadio I agree. Kentucky wants policy that would help their lives. You can't win over people when they can't tell Republican policy from the Democrat's policy.
1306352586849529856 2020-09-17 06:01:42 +0800 <Underdawg47> @IChotiner Money can't guy you love or votes without good polices.
1306352397434810369 2020-09-17 06:00:57 +0800 <Underdawg47> @AmyJenson95 The DNC pushed for the lame corporate Democrat over the very popular Booker. This is what is wrong with the DNC. I don't think they really want to win, they are just the gatekeepers to keep real progressives from gaining power.

1306350878366904320 2020-09-17 05:54:54 +0800 <Underdawg47> @joshcrunchy @krystalball Biden is not a viable option when he himself supports fracking.

1306324761895555072 2020-09-17 04:11:08 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ichbinnothing @meginator1000 I think you are willfully ignoring the blatant cheating that Democrats have done to stop progressives in the primaries and even now are blocking Greens from the general ballot. Both Democrats and Republicans use voter suppression and cheat in different ways
1306323798644277248 2020-09-17 04:07:18 +0800 <Underdawg47> @misgunception @JakeAlfaro80 The name liberal has been taken over by the moderate right, corporate side of the Democratic party. They have more Republican policies that are fiscally right and lean socially left, but have been moving slowing to the right in every election. They have little to do with the left
1306302232095195137 2020-09-17 02:41:36 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ichbinnothing @meginator1000 Democrats and Republicans are so much alike in the way they cheat, they just have different methods.
1306301536738238464 2020-09-17 02:38:50 +0800 <Underdawg47> @runiharagaming @JakeAlfaro80 I agree. They make Biden out to be on the far right, but he is so much like the Republicans that I can't tell the difference between the two.
1306299619006058501 2020-09-17 02:31:13 +0800 <Underdawg47> @SenSanders How can we afford to vote for either Biden or Trump when they both are terrible against climate change legislation.
1306297497141223424 2020-09-17 02:22:47 +0800 <Underdawg47> @grumpybirdieS Because he will make other moderators look stupid in comparison.
1306296174698094593 2020-09-17 02:17:32 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ichbinnothing @meginator1000 You make it sound like denying Greens access to the ballot is simply not an issue. I realize their are other forms of voter repression, but when you deny everyone a vote to the left of the 2 corporate powers you take away the rights of everyone to be represented.
1306291961226129408 2020-09-17 02:00:47 +0800 <Underdawg47> @sarahmucha another cringe moment for Biden. All about platitudes and performance but no policy.
1306290280308510720 2020-09-17 01:54:07 +0800 <Underdawg47> @pilatesgirl333 yes if enough people vote for them, but more likely the two major parties would rig the elections.
1306288694135930880 2020-09-17 01:47:49 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JakeAlfaro80 I think the definition changes as the Democrats take over the name pretending to be on the left.

1305977308059115520 2020-09-16 05:10:28 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MindPublic @joshfoxfilm There is no splitting the Democrat vote when Greens were never Democrat to begin with.
1305977127381000194 2020-09-16 05:09:45 +0800 <Underdawg47> @MindPublic @joshfoxfilm but you assume that the Green vote would go to Democrats if the Greens didn't exist. Not true.
1305975346387275777 2020-09-16 05:02:41 +0800 <Underdawg47> @joshfoxfilm @GreenPartyUS How is that? How do Greens deny the majority vote? Just by being on the ballot people may rather vote Green than Biden? That is what democracy is all about.
1305974807440154624 2020-09-16 05:00:32 +0800 <Underdawg47> @joshfoxfilm And why shouldn't Greens be on the ballot? Are you supporting fascism by giving people less choices by eliminating the competition?
1305972840391294976 2020-09-16 04:52:43 +0800 <Underdawg47> @dilanpcook @DianeRichards77 I guess I will have to read ingredients more closely. I don't want food or drinks that will drug me into complacency.
1305972070036062208 2020-09-16 04:49:39 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ichbinnothing @meginator1000 When Greens are kept off the ballot that is real voter suppression. The two major parties don't have to be Democrat or Republican. If enough people vote Green, Democrats would become a 3rd party.
1305971520439644160 2020-09-16 04:47:28 +0800 <Underdawg47> @owain_wn14 @meginator1000 So taking the Greens off the ballot is stopping fascism? No, it is fascism and if I were in that state I would vote for any of the other 3rd parties, or not vote at all before I would vote for Biden
1305968982432702465 2020-09-16 04:37:23 +0800 <Underdawg47> @AdyBarkan So you think that by denying others the chance to vote Green is a good thing? They might be pissed off enough to vote Trump for having their voice taken away. Did you think about that?
1305966485005766656 2020-09-16 04:27:28 +0800 <Underdawg47> @SarcasmStardust @GenZForJesseV @joerogan I would love for Rogan to ask them about Assange also. The corporate media would never ask that question.
1305966176648847360 2020-09-16 04:26:14 +0800 <Underdawg47> @sahilkapur And so the Democrats fear competition by keeping Greens off the ballot as if that will make Greens vote for Biden by default? I don't think so, it may persuade them to vote Trump instead. But maybe that is the plan Democrats would rather have Trump over Greens.
1305964402630295552 2020-09-16 04:19:11 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Benaskren @joerogan very slim chance
1305964036006109184 2020-09-16 04:17:44 +0800 <Underdawg47> @LovesTheBern @GotBeachGlass Fear or covid, Trump, and fear of getting in trouble with his corporate Democrat friends who will accuse him of not playing by their corrupt rules.
1305962353196847104 2020-09-16 04:11:03 +0800 <Underdawg47> @GlacierValleyHW @WisDems I agree Democrats have gone too far. They will flood the primary with corporate stooges to stop progressives, but they can't stand competition when 3rd parties want to get on the ballots in the general election. They are hypocrites and cheaters.
1305959114753802240 2020-09-16 03:58:11 +0800 <Underdawg47> @jord4n313 @HunterGaming76 @RainbowRoses20 @krystalball I tend to do the "do unto others as you would have them do unto you approach." I would be a hypocrite if I blamed others for their vote choices while accusing them of vote shaming me. Even though they vote shame me, I will not go down that path.

Someone said they was mad at meddling Democrats who kept Greens of the ballot in their state &amp; said they would now vote for Trump. I said, "I don't blame you." I'm not vote shaming anyone for their choices. I plan to vote Green and wish everyone would too.

1305644095398797312 2020-09-15 07:06:24 +0800 <Underdawg47> @KnolesMichael @EYSP9377 I was trying to look up the definition of fea. What is that?

1305642790613737472 2020-09-15 07:01:13 +0800 <Underdawg47> @rowyourbot @BenSpielberg Thats right. Bernie can tell us to vote for Biden till he is red in the face. We only came for the policies. Biden offers us nothing.
1305642222520422400 2020-09-15 06:58:58 +0800 <Underdawg47> @BenSpielberg I have asked to be taken off any email that promotes Biden or any other corporate Democrat.
1305639511947317250 2020-09-15 06:48:11 +0800 <Underdawg47> @patrickdmarley I guess this means that people who don't want to vote for Biden will either..  1. Vote another 3rd party 2. Write in a candidate 3. Vote for Trump  4. Just refuse to vote at all.
1305638919581515776 2020-09-15 06:45:50 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Mrtonytig Not me, I choose to vote Green!!!

1305633445129773056 2020-09-15 06:24:05 +0800 <Underdawg47> hey, @joerogan if you happen to host the debates, it would be great to have the Libertarian and Green Party candidates on there as well.
1305632299606712320 2020-09-15 06:19:32 +0800 <Underdawg47> @chipfranklin @JoeBiden I'm not
1305632000791830528 2020-09-15 06:18:21 +0800 <Underdawg47> @djhutch74 absolutely not.
1305629424616759297 2020-09-15 06:08:06 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Mediaite @siciliantaurus I would love to see this debate! I think Rogan would ask the tough questions, unlike our corporate lame media.

1305627578364039168 2020-09-15 06:00:46 +0800 <Underdawg47> @AmyEGardner The Green party should be on every state ballot whether a major party helps them or not. We need more options beside the 2 corrupt corporate parties.

1305595642262159360 2020-09-15 03:53:52 +0800 <Underdawg47> @kilonova_gold @BernieSanders You just sold yourself on Biden, but no sale here. Go try and sell your clown elsewhere.

1305593470392778756 2020-09-15 03:45:14 +0800 <Underdawg47> @kilonova_gold @BernieSanders No it didn't. The public option just weakens the chance of getting medicare for all. Biden taking health insurance money insures that we will have expensive health care.

If there was Ranked Choice Voting, I would vote 1. Green 2. 3rd party 3. 3rd party 4. 3rd party, or not vote at all, because neither Trump or Biden will get my vote
1305578455522709504 2020-09-15 02:45:34 +0800 <Underdawg47> @amatxis @BernieSanders Biden refuses to support medicare for all because his health insurance donors tell him not to.
1305577960825450497 2020-09-15 02:43:36 +0800 <Underdawg47> @sexyspoonie I am voting for a Party that has policies that will actually help disabled. Biden doesn't offer much.

1305575042755903488 2020-09-15 02:32:01 +0800 <Underdawg47> @HillaryClinton That wouldn't be Biden or Trump. You aren't a caring person either, just a greedy bitter old rich lady who can't accept losing with grace.

1305232652170006528 2020-09-14 03:51:28 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden You used 911 as a tool to go to war in Iraq and to take away our 4th amendment rights under the crappy Patriot Act.
1305232116804796416 2020-09-14 03:49:21 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden and yet you support the TPP, and pushed NAFTA, which took jobs over seas

1305231003695243264 2020-09-14 03:44:55 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden And yet you can't support medicare for all, or forgive student debt. Can't even give up fracking. And you want to increase the police funding and the military? WTF.
1305230494519287809 2020-09-14 03:42:54 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden And how are you any different that Trump? What policies do you have to offer that will make our lives better. We don't want things to stay the same which you support.

He does not support medicare for all. He doesn't forgive student debt. He wants regime change in Venezuela. He said 4 times he wants to cut social security. He voted for the Iraq War and Patriot Act

1304958562628632578 2020-09-13 09:42:20 +0800 <Underdawg47> @neolibtarded I think the polls were fake and made to appear that more people liked Hillary than really existed.
1304958055642091520 2020-09-13 09:40:20 +0800 <Underdawg47> @KnolesMichael Sounds like your father had the sin of being a child abuser.
1304957537440071680 2020-09-13 09:38:16 +0800 <Underdawg47> @KnolesMichael Some people like you father, are not fit to be a parent.

I would just ignore the POTUS spot and vote progressives and greens down ballot, but instead of leaving it blank, I do have another option to vote Green

If Democrats really wanted to win, you had 4 years to chose a candidate that most people wanted to vote for, not another stooge.

You have a terribly flawed candidate and you are having problems trying to sell him and are getting mad at the customer because he points out your product's flaws.
1304859622600105984 2020-09-13 03:09:11 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ProfJulie616 @PrettyProgress1 @JamesMa96163439 @JoeBiden ok Karen,
1304859531357290496 2020-09-13 03:08:50 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JemezStargazer @PrettyProgress1 @JamesMa96163439 @JoeBiden So are you helping fascism by vote shaming people instead of trying to actually sell your candidate?  You already have a hard sell because your candidate has a long history of terrible policies, lies and accusations of sexual assault.
1304858682975350784 2020-09-13 03:05:27 +0800 <Underdawg47> @FuckarooBanzai @PrettyProgress1 @JamesMa96163439 @JoeBiden according to your logic. So if I don't vote for Trump, that is a vote for Biden by default. According to your logic does that give both Trump AND Biden an actual vote, or do they cancel each other out?
1304857463380877317 2020-09-13 03:00:37 +0800 <Underdawg47> @CMay17 @PrettyProgress1 @JamesMa96163439 @JoeBiden You have convinced yourself of that, but you haven't convinced the rest of us.

I am voting Green and that is not a wasted vote for me. If you want votes, try to actually sell your candidate on his merits if he has any.

1304852695920959488 2020-09-13 02:41:40 +0800 <Underdawg47> @callmyownshots Another BS word from those who are too lazy to campaign for their crappy candidate. Maybe you should push your candidate to try to actually win votes instead of sitting on his senile ass demanding votes because he isn't Trump

They are both terrible corporate candidates each with terrible policies. I'd rather vote for something I want &amp; lose rather than vote for something I certainly don't want and have zero chance of policies I want.
1304850560454029312 2020-09-13 02:33:11 +0800 <Underdawg47> @ProfJulie616 @PrettyProgress1 @JamesMa96163439 @JoeBiden another, "you've got privilege BS." We all have the same right to vote for the candidate who we believe will make our lives better. Neither Biden or Trump offer us any policies that will make our lives better.
1304849940192002048 2020-09-13 02:30:43 +0800 <Underdawg47> @1a51492ae4f84a5 @PrettyProgress1 @JamesMa96163439 @JoeBiden No, because the DNC put their foot on the scale. They even said that they would do everything they could to defeat Bernie because they would rather have Trump over Bernie.

"Don't vote 3rd party, the Republican is dangerous. Wait till the next election." This is the next election and the Republicans always get worse, but so do the Democrats.
1304848068576124929 2020-09-13 02:23:17 +0800 <Underdawg47> @FuckarooBanzai @PrettyProgress1 @JamesMa96163439 @JoeBiden You also have poor reading skills. I said I was voting Green. If I were voting for Trump he would actually be getting a vote.
1304847767471226880 2020-09-13 02:22:05 +0800 <Underdawg47> @Phaedrus08 @PrettyProgress1 @JamesMa96163439 @JoeBiden Bernie is not my leader, or my boss. I only came for the policies he offered. Neither Biden or Trump offers anything that would make our lives better, but the Green party does. If Biden wants votes he needs to earn them instead of saying he isn't Trump. Not good enough.
1304846790638747648 2020-09-13 02:18:12 +0800 <Underdawg47> @mizmoo54 @PrettyProgress1 @JamesMa96163439 @JoeBiden It is much better than voting for those who were intent on making sure progressives never came to power. Democrats are the greater threat to progressives. The DNC would rather Trump remain in power rather than us having a progressive POTUS.
1304846062629216256 2020-09-13 02:15:18 +0800 <Underdawg47> @SehzadeSoroush @PrettyProgress1 @JamesMa96163439 @JoeBiden If voting for a corporate candidate with Republican policies is your idea of liberal or progressive, then I suppose I am not. Greens offer medicare for all, Green new Deal, forgiving student debt, etc which Biden or Trump do not.

In the past 3rd parties rose to power under our system when enough people decided to vote for them.

1304841887442903041 2020-09-13 01:58:43 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris That is already a lie, because if you really wanted to make people's lives better you would support medicare for all, but you support a for profit health care that is run by your insurance company donors.
1304729454086778881 2020-09-12 18:31:57 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JoeBiden And yet you voted for the illegal Iraq war built upon the fear of 911.

1304539236134129664 2020-09-12 05:56:05 +0800 <Underdawg47> @JamesMa96163439 So who do you suggest people vote for? I don't see many viable options left, unless you know of some.

1302680514952740864 2020-09-07 02:50:12 +0800 <Underdawg47> @McCrayMadeline @KeyDecision1 I find it truly insulting that he would hold his dead son over ours heads as if he were the only one to lose a loved one. I never could afford health insurance and yet he said he would veto it if it ever came across his desk. truly disgusting.

1301656934882226177 2020-09-04 07:02:51 +0800 <Underdawg47> @jjbrainstorm @anderson_corri @moirarose2020 @BreeNewsome I vote Green because they have the better policies and don't take corporate money. But you are fine with either corporate party, so enjoy.
1301656096285757441 2020-09-04 06:59:31 +0800 <Underdawg47> @realDonaldTrump @Anarcodroid @RussVought45 Maybe things would be better if we didn't have idiot presidents that didn't address the problem of corrupt cops and understood the constitution better, huh Mr idiot President?

1301654591440785409 2020-09-04 06:53:32 +0800 <Underdawg47> @anderson_corri @jjbrainstorm @moirarose2020 @BreeNewsome I guess we disagree then. That is why I will be voting Green
1301654407449255936 2020-09-04 06:52:48 +0800 <Underdawg47> @davidkrugII @RexChapman People are gonna vote according to what they think is best for them, no judgement from me. I think voting Green is better for me than not voting at all. I can't vote for those two corporate candidates
1301652280874156037 2020-09-04 06:44:21 +0800 <Underdawg47> @anderson_corri @jjbrainstorm @moirarose2020 @BreeNewsome I certainly would have voted for Tulsi or Bernie if they were the nominee. I think they would have beaten Trump. Not sure about the other rotten apples.
1301651452998217729 2020-09-04 06:41:04 +0800 <Underdawg47> @davidkrugII @RexChapman So who was the dumbass that that thought Biden was such a good choice? I'm not voting for Trump or Biden and Democrats should have considered this before picking such a loser as Biden.
1301651090874576897 2020-09-04 06:39:38 +0800 <Underdawg47> @anderson_corri @jjbrainstorm @moirarose2020 @BreeNewsome Then if Biden appeals to so many folks, go right ahead and vote for him. I'm not. But it seems to me that you chose another candidate so lame that even Trump could beat him.
1301650714310057984 2020-09-04 06:38:08 +0800 <Underdawg47> @joshuadolim @CocoaEyebrows @moirarose2020 @BreeNewsome Where have I heard this stupid logic before?

1301630246316244992 2020-09-04 05:16:48 +0800 <Underdawg47> @davidkrugII @RexChapman Well the difference is that Bernie would actually propose policies that would help, Biden proposes only policies approved by his corporate donors.
1301625290838343680 2020-09-04 04:57:07 +0800 <Underdawg47> @RexChapman @davidkrugII I think about how Biden uses victims as photo ops yet doesn't propose policies that will actually help. Biden doesn't plan to defund the police.

I vote Green because they are farther left. They have the policies I want which neither Trump or Biden have.

Yet this time you bought into the fear mongering. If you want Biden voters go out and try to sell him to republicans or people who don't know any better.

They would rather have Trump than Bernie. Both parties serve the same corporate donors.

Democrats chose Biden because he was SO electable, but apparently you guys made a huge mistake. Vote shaming 3rd parties because losing looks like a possibility, huh?

1300841603737645056 2020-09-02 01:03:01 +0800 <Underdawg47> So the Biden campaign can't offer meaningful policies, but it can waste its time with useless Animal Crossing yard signs, That is pathetic.
