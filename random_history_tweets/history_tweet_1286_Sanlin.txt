1332592633915424768 2020-11-28 15:50:16 +0800 <Sanlin> @TotalZackWard .My heart is with you. My grandmother had dementia. My Dad's mental faculties declined before he passed. My Mom had vascular dementia from a stroke, but her mental faculties were already in decline. We kept her in her home of 44 years... but it was tough, especially near the end.
1332592146751184901 2020-11-28 15:48:20 +0800 <Sanlin> @erinbiba . Funny you should say that... I've used that comparison, for years. Fibromyalgia truly does make a person's skin and body that hypersensitive. I have nights where I can't stand the touch of a bed or sheet against my skin. I had my 'tender points' tested once and was in agony.
1332591437582458882 2020-11-28 15:45:31 +0800 <Sanlin> @WalshFreedom Tell that to the parents of the children that would have contracted COVID-19 and died. Tell that to the kids that would have been robbed of their lives and futures. Look at what happened when they opened colleges.
1332590512834920448 2020-11-28 15:41:51 +0800 <Sanlin> @JayHulmePoet . I worry about my hearing, sometimes... but, auditory processing issues makes a lot of sense. I tend to hyper focus on visual stimulation like TV, too. People can talk to me and I won't even hear them, if I'm absorbed in an activity like watching TV.
1332587765498740737 2020-11-28 15:30:56 +0800 <Sanlin> @georgiastraight . Some people are really fucking stupid and problematic. Wearing masks protects and saves lives.

1332465347996258305 2020-11-28 07:24:29 +0800 <Sanlin> @SickNotWeak . I was bounced into a psych ward for two weeks, without my permission. I already had depression, anxiety and untreated PTSD, but being trapped against my will by a bunch of overpaid kool-aid drinkers was particularly scarring. It’s like a suburb of Hell. All to push meds.

He should never have had security clearance, along with his criminal family members and toadies. I’ve read volumes about his involvement with the Russians and countries such as the UAE, Saudis, Israel, Turkey, Egypt and Bahrain. He is a traitor.
1332462368584994817 2020-11-28 07:12:39 +0800 <Sanlin> @tribelaw . Part of moving on has to be holding Trump, his family and his posse criminally accountable for their crimes and the horrors they have perpetrated... including genocide and mass murder.

1332445063503249408 2020-11-28 06:03:53 +0800 <Sanlin> @Stands . Between chaotic good and chaotic neutral. If I’m telling the truth.... *muah ha ha ha haaaaa* I’m running a covert anti-paladin on a platform that doesn’t have that as a character choice. My henchman is called Chaos and I have a Hell-mobile that I scream around in. 🔥🔥🔥
1332426833296461824 2020-11-28 04:51:27 +0800 <Sanlin> @Asher_Wolf . I have my IBS routine with a hot pack, massage and expelling everything from my system. It’s like I have a constricted part in my bowels that makes it hard for things to pass through, unassisted. Certain foods are triggers. Stress can be a trigger... even weather.

1329910607701635072 2020-11-21 06:12:52 +0800 <Sanlin> @monaeltahawy I didn't bother telling them they are not as safe as they prefer to believe they are... and, I could have ended my life, inside their facility, with its rules, but I chose not to, at that point. I am *almost* that stubborn.
1329910201399484417 2020-11-21 06:11:15 +0800 <Sanlin> @monaeltahawy Before I left, I took the coloring book they have available for patients and colored columns of serpents and demon masks. I hope when they saw that, they shuddered and thought twice about having had me in their ward. They stage in a central cage and the animals are around them.
1329909608693972993 2020-11-21 06:08:53 +0800 <Sanlin> @monaeltahawy At night, I have to reassure myself that it is dark, quiet and I have my stuffies for comfort. Psych wards are always brightly lit and noisy. There are cameras, everywhere. And you have no say about when or if you'll ever get out and return to 'normal' life. Trapped.
1329909106216321025 2020-11-21 06:06:54 +0800 <Sanlin> @monaeltahawy I do not think I will ever completely recover from the experience. I am scarred and traumatized... and I still have PTSD. I take pills for my depression and anxiety. I live with my PTSD. I am fighting for joy and goodness in my life. It is an unending struggle.
1329908472889020416 2020-11-21 06:04:23 +0800 <Sanlin> @monaeltahawy ...in a psych ward. That was not fun. Each day, literally, felt like a century, in the state I was in. I slept, a lot, and did some of the 'activities' inside the ward. I had zero control over anything. I was committed by my family doctor and a psychiatrist.
1329908029286879232 2020-11-21 06:02:37 +0800 <Sanlin> @monaeltahawy I landed in the trauma ward. Insulin breaks down in the body over about 24 hours. Even so, the doctor said that I would have to be a "medical anomaly" to do what I really did do and survive. I told them that, yes, I deliberately attempted to take my life... and spent two weeks...
1329907507695742976 2020-11-21 06:00:32 +0800 <Sanlin> @monaeltahawy I am a Type II Diabetic and I took a super overdose of my insulin. After being in a death sweat for five hours without going into a diabetic coma, I changed my mind, drank cans of pop and ate sweets, then dialed 911.
1329907153822367745 2020-11-21 05:59:08 +0800 <Sanlin> @monaeltahawy At the time, I was living with the sociopath and my Mother... Mom was descending into cognitive issues... and then she had a stroke that caused vascular dementia. I was her caregiver. Sociopath had a job. With my depression, anxiety and untreated PTSD, I reached a breaking point.
1329906561494315008 2020-11-21 05:56:47 +0800 <Sanlin> @monaeltahawy . That is what I call myself. A survivor. I've survived attempted murder and attempted massacre by an ex-family member... a textbook sociopath. I have survived armed robbery and the PTSD it triggered in me. I've survived the attempt I made on my own life, in a 'death spiral.'

If you are any kind of "disabled," there are a million invisible, backhanded little ways the system will snub and reject you... often without you being even aware. Ableism won't come at us, directly, so it stabs us in the back.

I am not a violent Bird, I’m peaceful, so that was never an issue. I was polite, as ever, but had no choices or weight to what I said.

It keeps me from panicking. Because it is never fully dark, it’s noisy and there are cameras, everywhere, in a psych ward. It’s sealed.

I am a Free Bird, so I will have trauma for years.

I had no say in the matter. Once I was committed, they could do whatever they wanted via meds, treatment, everything.
1328502738271887360 2020-11-17 08:58:29 +0800 <Sanlin> @debbbrindley @realDonaldTrump Pardons are 100% in the cards, already. I'd go "all in" on that one.
1328502541349339136 2020-11-17 08:57:42 +0800 <Sanlin> @debbbrindley @realDonaldTrump . I suspect that's in their plans, already, anyway, near the end of the time. A plethora of pardons for all criminals. I'm thinking about humanity and our planet. Plus, it would remove Trump from having to deal with anything else now that he knows he has truly lost the election.

We couldn’t ‘manhandle’ her around. We also got a walker for her and used it more like a wheelchair.

That’s how my sociopath ex-brother robbed her, the fucker.

She got out of hospital after about 10 days, due to a fall. She was home that night, in her own bed, the way she wished, and I found her, gone, the next morning. She died as she chose.

1328447696269496322 2020-11-17 05:19:46 +0800 <Sanlin> @michaelharriot . I am too far ahead of the current times... but I am here to hoot and flap my beak about what kinds of things are possible, if we permit ourselves to break free of the current corrupt system and embrace new paradigms of behavior. We can make better choices and embrace humanity.
1328447156194197504 2020-11-17 05:17:38 +0800 <Sanlin> @michaelharriot . I know that enormous amount of money and resources sunk into debt for banks and billionaires would much better serve regular people in areas like education, housing, healthcare, food security, small businesses, transportation, renewable energy, fighting climate change, etc.
1328446516420243459 2020-11-17 05:15:05 +0800 <Sanlin> @michaelharriot . I'm a Bird that went outside the box with my own form of "magic circle" thinking. I create the circle and only let in love. I've advocated for forgiveness of ALL debt and eradication of debt as a notion in our 21st Century society. But, that's too forward-thinking for many.
1328445987216506881 2020-11-17 05:12:59 +0800 <Sanlin> @michaelharriot Canceling debt and working towards free education, as some nations already have, is a WONDERFUL idea. Education has a plethora of cascading benefits in society, especially for POC and LGBTQ students, but, really, all students, everywhere.
1328445610106572800 2020-11-17 05:11:29 +0800 <Sanlin> @michaelharriot I've heard about students not just living with their parents, but out of a *car.* I'm sure many are homeless or couch-surfing. They come out with their degrees, but crippling, predatory debts... what kind of thing is that to do to some of our youngest, brightest minds?
1328445301280047105 2020-11-17 05:10:15 +0800 <Sanlin> @michaelharriot I did it and no one can take that away. I am one of very few Canadians with a First Class Honours Humanities BA. I specialized in English and Creative Writing. But, it was a heavy course load... too heavy. It broke my health. Nowadays, it is the financial burden on students.
1328444815499956224 2020-11-17 05:08:19 +0800 <Sanlin> @michaelharriot If I'd had free education, I'd probably have a master's degree or PhD, by now. I would have been able to tackle classes at my own speed, rather than being forced to endure a full curriculum, which was too much for my system. I was nearly dead after completing my BA.
1328444436343230465 2020-11-17 05:06:49 +0800 <Sanlin> @michaelharriot I'm in Canada. My loan was back in the early 1990s. I had to declare bankruptcy... which you can't do, anymore, but I was able to, at the time. My health had tanked and I was unemployed. I wasn't 'scamming' off the system. I needed relief and, fortunately, it was available.

1328426839283384320 2020-11-17 03:56:54 +0800 <Sanlin> I like to meditate with some of my stones. Certain ones have that vibe. It’s not hard for me to ascertain when I’ve found a good match because I feel the emotional and physical warmth of stones that are suited to me. It’s like cuddling with cats... some of them almost purr.
1328426163421626368 2020-11-17 03:54:12 +0800 <Sanlin> I am sensitive to stones. Although I love the colour blue in real life, I am often attracted to green-coloured stones. I love malachite. Amethyst is another stone I find particularly attractive. I’m drawn to it. Crystals are interesting... I get a lot of energy from them, too.
1328425227513065472 2020-11-17 03:50:29 +0800 <Sanlin> I don’t know what variety of stone this is, but it feels so good in my right wing, like it was made exactly to fit. It radiates peace and healing vibes. It’s hard for me to put down, once I pick it up... it feels so “right.”  https://t.co/wkGcPzobhK

1327944351620612096 2020-11-15 19:59:40 +0800 <Sanlin> @s8nstan If our job is to sin, can you at least collect a few of the most putrid humans up here and start punishing them? And make it Pay Per View? Thanks! \ ^v^ 😈💜

1327938304428314625 2020-11-15 19:35:38 +0800 <Sanlin> @ChefGruel @joeydegraw Rich people and major corporations are making out like bandits. They LOVE the 'Rona. It's working out *great* for them. They don't care about anyone else... they never have and never will. It's about power, influence and money, not safety issues or concerns about sanitation.
1327937845038772224 2020-11-15 19:33:48 +0800 <Sanlin> @ChefGruel @joeydegraw Not safer. Richer. They have shitloads of money... and restaurants do not. So Walmart and other big corporate operations are open, while small businesses are being wiped off the map. Not only that, they're getting huge handouts from the Trump regime, while ordinary people do not.

1327936059385102336 2020-11-15 19:26:43 +0800 <Sanlin> Don't turn me into an Angry Bird. You won't like me as an Angry Bird. ~v~
1327935446458920960 2020-11-15 19:24:16 +0800 <Sanlin> So follow the simple rules, especially about wearing masks and not bunching up like fucking lemmings ready to plunge over the nearest cliff and we can beat this shit and get back to a better-than-old kind of normalcy. Or keep doing stupid shit and more people will die. Got it?
1327934963975503872 2020-11-15 19:22:21 +0800 <Sanlin> Look, I have 'preexisting conditions.' I've been stuck in my Roost for months, to stay safe. It's worth it. I've listened to people that have had the 'Rona and survived... and it is some bad-assed stuff. You do not want it. You don't want your family to get it... or anyone else.
1327934542053707777 2020-11-15 19:20:41 +0800 <Sanlin> If Uncle Joe has to shut anything down to stop the 'Rona, it's for everyone's good... okay? This is not political or a personal attack upon your rights and freedoms. It's a global pandemic that most of the world is attempting to get its shit together over... and the US must, too.
1327934075605114880 2020-11-15 19:18:50 +0800 <Sanlin> This would be an extremely opportune time to stop listening to the Orange Monster and start listening to Uncle Joe and Auntie Kamala, USA. Wear your fucking masks, social distance, wash your hands and DO NOT gather together, especially not for Thanksgiving or Christmas.
1327901187434115072 2020-11-15 17:08:08 +0800 <Sanlin> @WipeHomophobia So I had no pain treatment for raw nerve pain for two solid weeks. Exceeded even the time I had a stress headache for 5 solid days. /~v- Fibromyalgia pain is sneaky and vicious... and IBS pain is like swallowing a hive of hornets and then being stabbed in the side.
1327900733539196928 2020-11-15 17:06:20 +0800 <Sanlin> @WipeHomophobia Please don't remind me of all the times 'pain killers' have fizzled. /~v~ Most fun one was raw, exposed nerves in my teeth and they gave me Tylenol III... which, it turns out, requires the addition of something... I believe it was caffeine, ironically... to work. I didn't know.

1327896717417594881 2020-11-15 16:50:23 +0800 <Sanlin> @Ul2ravioletUk Funny, I have a photo from about the same age of me with a homemade bow and arrows. I was a baby Viking. I made my own armor and sword. I also placed traps, everywhere... some of which were very successful. Like when I trapped my entire bedroom, linked to opening the door.
1327896173051473931 2020-11-15 16:48:13 +0800 <Sanlin> @drvox @GreatDismal It's not bad enough being in jail. Now inmates have to do corpse removal, for basically nothing. Treated as disposable by the system to do its dirty work.
1327894968422211585 2020-11-15 16:43:26 +0800 <Sanlin> @ClaraJeffery @GreatDismal I expect a lot of that will be going around. That's what I've been saying. Good luck ordering out or getting a cup of coffee.
1327894488400887809 2020-11-15 16:41:31 +0800 <Sanlin> @JeremiahBirkett True. Also, Democrats have a history of playing 'nice' to Republicans when they do win, while Republicans are down and dirty... more so, than ever, under the Orange Monster. The Dems need to learn to go for the jugular, instead of 'mending fences.'

1326943440370720770 2020-11-13 01:42:24 +0800 <Sanlin> @mhdksafa They tote around guns because they’re frail and terrified of self-raised spectres and believe it makes them strong. They believe they’re advancing their lives by hating and railing against innocent strangers. They don’t acknowledge their Leader and his followers are kleptocrats.
1326942478897872898 2020-11-13 01:38:35 +0800 <Sanlin> @mhdksafa They believe every lie their Leader spouts and are full of hatred, resentment and falsehoods. Their god is a god of hatred and intolerance. Many of them are as uneducated and dumb as fuck... and they bask in ignorance. They don’t think for themselves. What Leader says, goes.

1326229959581466624 2020-11-11 02:27:17 +0800 <Sanlin> @WalpurgaMueller @smell3roses @ProjectLincoln Arrest the repugnant bitch and throw her in jail. Then, let's get on with the legal transition. I know Joe and Kamala can do some things, in the interim, but it is against the law for this Republican ugly bitch to refuse to proceed with the transition.

You've blocked everything since you've had a stranglehold on the Senate... but your time is fading. You are going to have to swallow Democratic victory after victory.

My room is a nice, dark cave without light to bother her eyes. Then my brother's room has the best "Cat TV" window to see the back yard.

Still a lot of counting and checking to do South of the border. I'd been wishing for much more of a blowout, but let's see what the final tally is... will take time.

1322801620820746240 2020-11-01 15:24:17 +0800 <Sanlin> @c_denine @WajahatAli Noooooo thank you. We are keeping the border closed, for the foreseeable future. I'm hoping Joe will get in and fix things up, down South. Too crazy under Trumplandia.
1322801165323497475 2020-11-01 15:22:28 +0800 <Sanlin> @c_denine @WajahatAli I make sure to take a few extra minutes to get my balance. I've watched programs about 'sleep eating.' Some people will nom down cans of raw spaghetti sauce and all kinds of things. Yes, no sleep driving!

There are many sites available to help people get all the information they need to vote. This is not the election to sit out, spoil ballots or vote third party. We need a resounding blue wave. 💙💙💙
1322557428357947392 2020-10-31 23:13:57 +0800 <Sanlin> Don’t leave a single ballot on the table... VOTE! No election has mattered as much as this one, in our lifetime. Keep going, young voters, POC and everyone... from new voters to seasoned veterans. We need all of you to participate in this election. Defend your Democracy. 🇺🇸
1322556545683607552 2020-10-31 23:10:27 +0800 <Sanlin> We are getting down to it with the election. Don’t vote twice, that is illegal, but if you track your ballot and it’s stuck in the sabotaged mail, you can ask for that mail-in ballot to be spoiled and vote in person. Don’t let anyone take your vote from you!
1322555641727078401 2020-10-31 23:06:51 +0800 <Sanlin> Happy Halloween 🎃! I know this is usually a big holiday for lots of people. It will look different this year, but we’ll manage to have fun while staying safe. I’m putting out candy for the kids, socially distanced. I have a wee pumpkin 🎃 to carve and a few decorations. 👻

Trump may attempt a coup or to seize power as a dictator, if the election results are close. He has already demonstrated that he will use unidentified troops against peaceful protestors. Barr has been going around speaking to police.
1322309771848941568 2020-10-31 06:49:51 +0800 <Sanlin> Do not be intimidated or put off, threatened or silenced... get out and VOTE. Then get your friends, family and acquaintances to VOTE. Make it a bloodbath for Trumpism. Make it a victory for democracy and liberty.
1322309227012972544 2020-10-31 06:47:41 +0800 <Sanlin> If you voted by mail, make sure it gets counted and isn’t sitting around sabotaged in the postal service. Don’t vote twice, that’s illegal, but track your ballot and make sure no fuckery is going down.
1322308813223964672 2020-10-31 06:46:03 +0800 <Sanlin> A lot of people have scars... and worse... from 2016, when everyone oh-so-politely let the Orange Monster steal that election. 4 years of misery and death later, in 2020 we cannot leave room for any doubt. VOTE and create a blue tsunami. Make sure your vote gets counted!

She literally peed on their carpet and took off, until appearing on our doorstep. Never betray a woman. 🐈  https://t.co/vcV3IoWAiB

1302448804906450945 2020-09-06 11:29:28 +0800 <Sanlin> @LaurieRosenbau3 I take two different kinds of antidepressants. Evicting a sociopath from my life did wonders, too. I find joy in the little things, get lots of rest and naps, do my best to get some sunshine and fresh air, eat chocolate. Chat online with my friends. Eat veggies and real food.
