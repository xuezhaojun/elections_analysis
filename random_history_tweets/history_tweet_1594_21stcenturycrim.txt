1328727542199627778 2020-11-17 23:51:47 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @RealMattCouch @Therealbp65 Exactly, they had him "paused" before the election at 88.3 million and suddenly after the election President @realDonaldTrump jumped to 88.9 then frozen again. I have watched for some time and he grows by 100,000 about every 2-3 days. #Censorship is alive at Twitter.

1328724725703569414 2020-11-17 23:40:35 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @RepDanCrenshaw Great respect to you &amp; your service for our country and our safety. However disagree it has been 19 Years, are we just supposed to stay forever? What do we get for that, quite sure the CIA is in every corner from USA to around the world listening to everyone.
1328572412108091394 2020-11-17 13:35:21 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @KayaJones @starrtraveler29 If you flip from POTUS to House in CA, MI, WI for example you will see it. Now take TX, OK, NC they match with very little difference. CA is really interesting and doesn‚Äôt make logic. Erie PA blue POTUS, Red house.
1328570752208080896 2020-11-17 13:28:45 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> I think the media is getting concerned that all their disinformation is being turned off. When news stations parrot the exact same talking points for the day, safe to say it‚Äôs fake.

This is becoming asinine, I have given up on anyone coming to the rescue of the American people. The DOJ is nowhere to be found as these states &amp; cities impose laws that are unconstitutional.

When millions of people see the same events on election night. Safe to say Fox News was attempting to deceive its viewing audience.

1328354537963462658 2020-11-16 23:09:36 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> The media like @NBCNews &amp; others interfered in the election. They actually used a virus vaccine as a political weapon!

1328157503910146048 2020-11-16 10:06:39 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @KurtSchlichter Much too late for @FoxNews they lost all credibility election night, when they tried to convince us all that stopping counting was all normal. Days following were just too much for me.
1328157054855417857 2020-11-16 10:04:52 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> I don‚Äôt understand how all these Governors are being allowed to lock down people! How are they supposed to feed their families or pay bills? We are close to being out of money this has just about killed our business even living in Texas (fracking). Where is Barr?

1325262047517548544 2020-11-08 10:21:08 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> My guess what happens over the next day or so PA is an audit or complete re-do -20 Joe Az goes to Trump -11 JB, then Trump picks up AK, NC and GA so the count will go to 259/259 then we still have to look at MI and WI is an audit. The #FakeNews is lying to you! #FightBack

PA at worst will re full audit at best re-count -20 Joe, Trump likely takes AK, AZ, GA &amp; NC that leaves the race at 259 to 259. Very far from decided, all of the count and glitches still going right now. Make them STOP!

1325249001516654592 2020-11-08 09:29:18 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> You are all guilty of playing a very dangerous game. You don't decide elections the American people do. The count is still going on. PA will likely have to be at worst re-vote at the least an audit -20. AZ, AK, GA, NC are going to Trump so that = 259 and 259!  #FightBack
1325246364461232128 2020-11-08 09:18:49 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @realDonaldTrump @kevin9359 Thank you so very much for fighting for us. We truly love you!
1325246079013695491 2020-11-08 09:17:41 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @mkraju You don't decide the election we do. you are playing a very dangerous game the election isn't decided and this isn't right.
1325245734258663425 2020-11-08 09:16:19 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @BernardKerik @Hasexce44 What they are doing tonight is very dangerous. I realized in 2016 when President Trump won, he wasn't supposed to. We voted but never really decided the outcome now we do. And this is very dangerous and divides any already very divided country. They don't realize we #FightBack
1325245096678154240 2020-11-08 09:13:47 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @greta What they are doing is very dangerous and very unfair to the actual citizens of this country. This isn't okay because the "elite" have decided this is the way it is going to be. Not right the people choose the President this causes nothing but divide.
1325244767622623232 2020-11-08 09:12:29 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> In 2016 President Trump was never supposed to win, but he did because we voted. The "elite" in Washington have been furious since, realized we didn't choose the President the elite did. And they are taking this to a whole new level tonight, this is very dangerous.
1325242410796978177 2020-11-08 09:03:07 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> This fake out by the Fake News is easy to figure out as it stands AK, GA, AZ, NC is going to President Trump = 259. You take AZ &amp; PA away from GB = 259 The election outcome will come down to PA audit. That is the FAKE OUT by the media. @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr #MAGA
1325239183393366017 2020-11-08 08:50:17 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @greta Secretary of State the "media" does not run our elections!

1324961650978525185 2020-11-07 14:27:28 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> The Rino side must pay really well. I just can‚Äôt believe so few of these guys are actually who we think they are. We really need to start vetting our #MAGA crew for 2022 right after we finish this current fight for the soul of the United States.
1324960877729165312 2020-11-07 14:24:24 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @DanCrenshawTX Well when you get cheated out of the next election we will all just say ‚Äúoh well‚Äù. What a disappointment, not who I thought you were. Sure we can find a better fit in 2022 for your district.
1324960384550367232 2020-11-07 14:22:26 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @realDanMoran @AbbyJohnson @BrockTheFree @DanCrenshawTX @Jim_Jordan @mattgaetz @RepMattGaetz @RepGosar has been phenomenal on Arizona
1324957625205788672 2020-11-07 14:11:29 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @MagaKarma1 It‚Äôs like they are physically filling out ballots at this point. They say we have 150,000 votes left but only have 5,000 every 24 hours? Or are they afraid to keep manipulating the count? And all the media talking points are always ‚Äúheavily blue district‚Äù Trump won‚Äôt get enough.
1324955893667074048 2020-11-07 14:04:36 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @JRubinBlogger Sure you will have no problem with the recounts and audits if everything is on the up and up what‚Äôs the harm? Everyone seems a little upset...
1324948258729439232 2020-11-07 13:34:15 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @JackPosobiec Why is a vendor uploading anything during an election? That is fraud in itself and should not be done. That‚Äôs like me building on a website and someone updating the website at the same time! The two aren‚Äôt compatible.
1324946459075244033 2020-11-07 13:27:06 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @codeofvets I can only imagine, we don‚Äôt carry the wounds they do and I am a total wreck scared my family will lose our business and what will happen to so many. God just can‚Äôt let this happen üôè

1324924264462561280 2020-11-07 11:58:55 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> Someone tell Joe Biden that he might get with AOC &amp; others working up a hit list to lock up anyone that doesn‚Äôt think like them! President @realDonaldTrump is my President period full stop!
1324910373393330177 2020-11-07 11:03:43 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @kylegriffin1 @MSNBC It does order them to separate those counts and remove them from the current count! And it also orders them to respond they have done so by tomorrow.

We can be assured it won‚Äôt cover any wrongdoing by the ruling political machine in Washington that is grifting millions from other countries &amp; selling out USA. We know it will cover Russia bad, Russia did it, Russia causes all problems.

In his basement he isn‚Äôt our speaking to the people he isn‚Äôt out trying to earn any ones vote no he‚Äôs hiding that is where Joe Biden is!
1318325165655265283 2020-10-20 06:56:27 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @Sen_JoeManchin Sounds like it might be time for Dr Fauci to retire. The man has said one thing to only change it midcourse and still have time to do every media show possible.
1318316555869052929 2020-10-20 06:22:14 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @ASavageNation Shame on you!

1318313534460203008 2020-10-20 06:10:14 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> That‚Äôs frustrating omg your whole party has a party the leader has sold out the American jobs to China! Why won‚Äôt he say if any of the emails from Hunter are true or not!
1318311604900028417 2020-10-20 06:02:34 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Really you are such a dishonest politician! in this clip POTUS says that this is a hypothetical that he refuses to do because he's not corrupt like Joe Biden.
1318311101373816834 2020-10-20 06:00:34 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @HKrassenstein Even for you this is completely without context! He literally says in this clip that this is a hypothetical that he refuses to do because he's not corrupt like Joe Biden.
1318310885622939648 2020-10-20 05:59:42 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @atrupar Even for you this is dishonest! He literally says in this clip that this is a hypothetical that he refuses to do because he's not corrupt like Joe Biden.
1318302479172440066 2020-10-20 05:26:18 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> Got to watch @seanhannity tonight on Fox he is having our fan favorite @kirstiealley on the show!
1318296248563191809 2020-10-20 05:01:33 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> All of this means that it doesn‚Äôt matter what we say, what we attempt to trend it won‚Äôt! Simply put we are tweeting to ourselves! That is election interference @GOP
1318295911827709954 2020-10-20 05:00:12 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> Have you checked to see if you are being shadow banned? I just did and they have me throttled are hiding my replies and more! Why? Because I support the President.  https://t.co/tAGm3yd7uv
1318293609356152832 2020-10-20 04:51:03 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> Stories of actual Russian collusion with Biden‚Äôs and let‚Äôs bet the @CNN @MSNBC etc won‚Äôt even cover this! No they will their candidate to hide in a basement while they avoid the topic!

1318244364154527745 2020-10-20 01:35:22 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @JoeBiden You have spent 47 years using your family for wealth all to the detriment of the country you pretended to be backing! You sold out the United States of America to China you gave away all of our jobs to China!
1318237703901745152 2020-10-20 01:08:54 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @JoeBiden can‚Äôt be bothered to speak to the American people yet he can go interview with softball questions from 60 Minutes! Where is Hunter? Joe did you sell out America to China?
1318234071756120064 2020-10-20 00:54:28 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @RealMattCouch ++10 ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fired‚Äù

1318180257476718592 2020-10-19 21:20:38 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> This is what the thought police @TheDemocrats have achieved using the ‚Äúidea‚Äù group of Antifa thugs to carry it out.
1318178955137028097 2020-10-19 21:15:28 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @FedEx is this how your drivers treat customer merchandise? Or is it only those customers who don‚Äôt align in thought with your drivers?
1318169563851329537 2020-10-19 20:38:09 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> Quick someone tell Twitter that the Biden laptop &amp; emails is not part of Russia disinformation! Then tell Twitter that suppression of a media outlet is against everything we stand for in the US! Free @nypost this the United States of America not communist China!
1318167981667528704 2020-10-19 20:31:51 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> Where‚Äôs Joe Biden? He hasn‚Äôt spoken to these allegations in detailed emails about China! Does he have a national security issue?
1318046741502038017 2020-10-19 12:30:05 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @thetoyman1 @realDonaldTrump Going Monday! Most of my family has already voted NM and TX all in for POTUS! #MAGA2020

1318031816738115584 2020-10-19 11:30:47 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> Oh, so you mean to say President @realDonaldTrump has been correct when saying ‚Äúyou must manage the forest‚Äù? ü§î
1318029345202540546 2020-10-19 11:20:58 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @RobertJohnDavi @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow @RudyGiuliani It came on at 9est and Mark Levin sent out a tweet. Also @OANN is running a 3 part on emails from business partner that is in jail right now.
1318027578976931841 2020-10-19 11:13:57 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @ksorbs they canceled Americans today for simply telling their story of being beaten in Washington DC &amp; San Francisco simply because they lean right and believe in free speech! No more I don‚Äôt care! If they suspend me so be it I went down standing up for freedom &amp; POTUS @realDonaldTrump
1318026563179499520 2020-10-19 11:09:55 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @JennaEllisEsq Absolutely most frightening to watch as Americans are suspended for sharing story of being beaten in San Francisco &amp; Washington DC yesterday! Something is very wrong, sadly people don‚Äôt realize tomorrow you might say something big tech doesn‚Äôt agree with and cancel you!
1318024457726906368 2020-10-19 11:01:33 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @CharriseLane @realDonaldTrump God Bless You! Every vote matters...

1317988872488452097 2020-10-19 08:40:08 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @kirstiealley You have a following! Head up and ignore the haters... we love seeing your posts...
1317988547442429952 2020-10-19 08:38:51 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @atrupar Really @TheDemocrats Governors have cancelled Halloween üéÉ NM Governor is urging residents to snitch on neighbors for having gatherings over 5, Fauci is saying no large gatherings for Thanksgiving, so yeah it is fact!
1317980772335296512 2020-10-19 08:07:57 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @SenTomCotton @SenHawleyPress @tedcruz this is out of control! Twitter has locked Charlie Kirk out of his twitter account!
1317979646600818688 2020-10-19 08:03:29 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @TulsiGabbard Tulsi you really need to consider switching parties. (that is meant is a complement)

My guess exactly and shocked no one ‚Äúmedia‚Äù related has said the same. Look at the month of April 2019 Ukraine Pres elected Joe Biden announces and Hunter Biden takes a computer with ‚Äúwater damage‚Äù to a computer shop in Delaware?
1317896351993266176 2020-10-19 02:32:30 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> I want to thank @Twitter for once again not allowing me to express my opinion via the ‚Äúlike‚Äù button! @HawleyMO
1317879707162054658 2020-10-19 01:26:21 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @GregGschecher @mikeandersonsr Someone from @JoeBiden campaign just now refuses to answer nor will she deny if the emails are Hunter Biden‚Äôs? We all know the laptop belongs to Hunter and ‚ÄúThe Big Guy‚Äù is Joe Biden taking money from China, Russia &amp; Ukraine!

1317514020895793152 2020-10-18 01:13:15 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> So @CNN @MSNBC &amp; @TheDemocrats why is Hunter Biden‚Äôs lawyer asking the computer shop for fake Russia emails? Why is Hunter Biden‚Äôs lawyer asking for Hunters laptop? These two can‚Äôt coincide with one another! Joe Biden is a crook and sold out the United States to China!
1317513308065456129 2020-10-18 01:10:25 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @brhodes So let me get this... the Russians dropped of Hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop in Delaware Computer Shop December 2019 and then the Russians got Hunters ex business partner in jail to contact reporters and lie for wait the Russians?

1301148032457748480 2020-09-02 21:20:39 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @KamalaHarris No it‚Äôs actually only in @TheDemocrats run states that oppressing shutdowns are occurring. But @SpeakerPelosi &amp; others live with the motto rules for you not for thee.
1301004518507905025 2020-09-02 11:50:23 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> #MAGA you know what to do

1300962203844083713 2020-09-02 09:02:14 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @MichaelCohen212 @doj @POTUS @FoxNews How is the Taxi Medallion business going?
1300950911158714369 2020-09-02 08:17:22 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @ReaIdonaadtrump @VASweetTea Prayers
1300940015040696320 2020-09-02 07:34:04 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @JackPosobiec Are they going to help him back up as well?
1300934024865681411 2020-09-02 07:10:16 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> So @SpeakerPelosi doesn‚Äôt know the pain San Francisco people are in? She doesn‚Äôt know the owner of the Hair Salon is forbidden from making a living?
1300929106960408583 2020-09-02 06:50:43 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @cmarinucci And that is the hard hitting news you get from this? The speaker of the house for the United States of America breaking the law in San Francisco, showing voters the rules aren‚Äôt for the connected just the ‚Äúlittle people‚Äù! That is what I see!
1300863057539854337 2020-09-02 02:28:16 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> Hey @CNN @nytimes quit allowing guests to tell blatant lies!
1300855501241102338 2020-09-02 01:58:14 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @canadiangirlbc1 @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump One would think a candidate running for President of the United States would disavow  https://t.co/6sbj4rQvas which redirects to Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign?
1300836775548653568 2020-09-02 00:43:50 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @LAYS OMG üò± this is the coolest! How do I order for my grandchildren?
1300832075432554498 2020-09-02 00:25:09 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> Again today a candidate for President of the United States @JoeBiden is linked to a violent domestic terrorist group  https://t.co/6sbj4rQvas this redirect has been going on for weeks!
1300802262797877249 2020-09-01 22:26:41 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @MrAndyNgo @tedwheeler Imagine the people that have to live in that building?
1300781657256071169 2020-09-01 21:04:49 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @Acosta Oh Jim I highly doubt it‚Äôs a conspiracy! Someone is funding travel, high dollar motel rooms, lasers, pallets of bricks, armor, etc.
1300630339895930881 2020-09-01 11:03:32 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @CNN you might look back on Joe Biden‚Äôs statements on banning fracking! The President isn‚Äôt dreaming this up neither are we!
1300628822145015810 2020-09-01 10:57:30 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @HillaryClinton Separation of Federal &amp; State thankfully the President honors that. As to riots Trump has offered Portland has refused, plain and simple!
1300613318604881923 2020-09-01 09:55:54 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @SpeakerPelosi 6%
1300611014237605888 2020-09-01 09:46:44 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @GregAbbott_TX Praise the Lord! We have to be given our lives back. 15 days is now going into 6 months!
1300601848647294977 2020-09-01 09:10:19 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @ChrisJansing Seriously, Democrat party has made all this fair game with the years lies and twists of what the President says.
1300600887602221061 2020-09-01 09:06:30 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @hrkbenowen Not really they along with MLB are dead to my family!
1300600630977978373 2020-09-01 09:05:29 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> @are_washington In a New York minute!
1300591506991001600 2020-09-01 08:29:13 +0800 <21stcenturycrim> Some one please tell me how after days  https://t.co/6sbj4rQvas is still going to Joe Biden / Act Blue? This is a candidate running for the President of the United States affiliated with a terrorist operation!
