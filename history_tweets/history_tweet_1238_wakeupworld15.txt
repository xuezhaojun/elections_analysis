The Islands are a Lordship with Norway as its feudal superior, Lothian is an English kingdom and Galloway is a lawless bandit's lair.

1300701420707024896 2020-09-01 15:45:59 +0800 <wakeupworld15> @RUNWITHSCIZSORS Good luck. Surely you can invoke the "extreme distress" clause permitting you not to wear a mask?

If the Indians had invented these things, they would have had no qualms about conquering Europe.

Would a Black man have contributed to elevator design in a non-White environment? B. Would the same innovation have likely been innovated at some point by a White person? C. Was the elevator part of an evolving continuing process?
