1343628198320467968 2020-12-29 02:41:40 +0800 <Annabel__always> @RufusTSuperfly @dariodoubleL I agree.  I tried to exercise too soon and it put me back weeks.  Really hard especially if like me you use exercise to balance mood, it's hard to rest or get into the habit of rest.  Heal well x
1343542408949223425 2020-12-28 21:00:46 +0800 <Annabel__always> This is a good reminder, you're allowed to do things you enjoy and be happy doing them, whether expert or not.  You don't need permission, those who say you do have other motives  https://t.co/EZDRtf06i7

Then 2 men come into your house and explain why this may be a poor choice, also board up cupboards and test you
1342935918152462337 2020-12-27 04:50:48 +0800 <Annabel__always> @ItsEddyBaker @joan_parsons This year Mama G made sprouts roasted with a scant smatter or cream and crumbled stilton, like a super christmassy mini brassica take on cauli cheese and whatever the contested nature of CC as xmas canon I can tell you sproutsy cheese is 100% tradition in our house from now on.
1342929533733908481 2020-12-27 04:25:25 +0800 <Annabel__always> @thatsnogreg Heartwarming/dystopian hysteria at the insanity of relying on giant food warehouses for your family's survival, mitigate these fears by making home made kebabs and saving up for a holiday
1342929182985224196 2020-12-27 04:24:02 +0800 <Annabel__always> @thatsnogreg I feel this way about Eat Well for Less

1342042384222318593 2020-12-24 17:40:12 +0800 <Annabel__always> I liked this film a lot, precisely for its lack of glamour.  Sometimes it takes a fiction to show you truth of the thing.

1341987313413283841 2020-12-24 14:01:23 +0800 <Annabel__always> Designing cities for kids instead of cars, investors, is designing for grandparents, parents, and yes, child free adults, too. A shift in thinking that would change so much, for so many.

1341710861375852545 2020-12-23 19:42:51 +0800 <Annabel__always> @drneilfox I kept looking around my room for other non existent audiences to see how they were reacting with me.  I am a sucker for bad art in good movies too, somebody commission an Inside Cinema on that, stat, pls
1341709871654330368 2020-12-23 19:38:55 +0800 <Annabel__always> How did I sleep on the 40 Year Old Version - it's so perfect, so real.  Add to yr holiday watching list now, watch on the big telly and make noises as if in a cinema.  One I would dearly have loved to watch with an audience.  (on netflix now)

1340964406826590211 2020-12-21 18:16:43 +0800 <Annabel__always> @mant_a_tangi @MarthaPShearer Truly a trash fire year for freelancers.  All that work adds up though, spins on a dime etc.  The hustle will win in the end, is practice others are neglecting  ü§û
1340963812544016385 2020-12-21 18:14:21 +0800 <Annabel__always> Same with the outfit for what you're planning to wear on the plane (such times we lived in)
1340963292198658048 2020-12-21 18:12:17 +0800 <Annabel__always> Is it just me who has to time the washing with military precision for holidays - it just isn't Christmas if you don't have the choice of every single item in wardrobe

1340944395986722816 2020-12-21 16:57:12 +0800 <Annabel__always> I mean, maybe we are doing the rest of the voting world a service by showing what not to do in various scenarios.

1340728577646596097 2020-12-21 02:39:37 +0800 <Annabel__always> These countries also don't have such high prevalence that the virus is mutating locally.  The stupidity at play in UK strategy is mind boggling, short sighted, and cruel.
1340727655503675398 2020-12-21 02:35:57 +0800 <Annabel__always> BFI article also doesn't have a full list - though they do update lists of awards in general so this may come out there...or not, as it's treasury not lottery money.  CRF is confusing as devolved differently in Nations too!
1340727122030190592 2020-12-21 02:33:50 +0800 <Annabel__always> Sorry, yes, you're right...I have Sunday brain.  Different things. I think BFI have an article somewhere...will look again

1340606837993955330 2020-12-20 18:35:52 +0800 <Annabel__always> I spent 3 Christmasses away from family when I lived in Australia.  Every single one of them was beautiful, w found family and the point being sharing your self, food and love that day.  All of them really different too.  Love the ones you're with, even if that's just you.

I can't really speak for distributors...you're right it would be helpful to them to know whether UK at 'threshold' for different types of releases.

Difficult as people expect universal solutions, but indies don't have universal or collective budget

The pace of this year and living online is weird - we are going through crisis and everything changes but doesn't. Feels like if you're not being radical and new every day you're over, but that's not a real cycle.  Easy to get lost.
1334900707808382985 2020-12-05 00:41:44 +0800 <Annabel__always> Mama G's spidey sense went off and she came to drag me round the cold park, breathing outside air to warm brain

1334503420045234179 2020-12-03 22:23:03 +0800 <Annabel__always> Watching peers tweet about equality and collaboration when your own experience of that this year has been utterly frustrated ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Makes me confront that I prob have my own, similar, blind spots.

1334444386076270593 2020-12-03 18:28:29 +0800 <Annabel__always> @FailSpaceProj I would say the parameters set by funders plays a part - resource stretch means effort goes into catching / reporting set kpis which can miss other impact or progress, a self defeating circle.

Clothes are: friends, memories, confidence, comfort, disguise, home.  Many of us have too much but the answer is to care more about what you already have, maybe.

1332286410636845056 2020-11-27 19:33:27 +0800 <Annabel__always> If you do two things, then second on the list is to own your feelings, feel them, talk about them, don't be ashamed.  You're allowed to have them.  They help you understand other people.  Be vulnerable, it'll make you stronger.
1332283815931359233 2020-11-27 19:23:09 +0800 <Annabel__always> Honestly if you do one thing to survive this awful Winter buy a pair of 100% wool socks.  Expensive, but also, magic.
1332237781205213184 2020-11-27 16:20:13 +0800 <Annabel__always> Good advice here.  I utterly fail on the clothing front and do eat birds but 4 out 6 better than 0 out of 6

I used to say the trickle down was a fantasy, didn't work but obviously, it does if you replace wealth distribution with abandoned standards of behaviour, bullying, corruption.  Everyone breaking small rules to maintain advantage.  I hate it.
1329706251081617408 2020-11-20 16:40:49 +0800 <Annabel__always> Sheffield marketing and campaign folk, with interest in Green futures, strong democracy and supporting grass roots action - paid gig here with a growing, diverse and ambitious gang of committed councillors, activists.  Get involved! #SheffieldIsSuper #Sheffieldjob #PoliticalJob
1329702876969644032 2020-11-20 16:27:25 +0800 <Annabel__always> @v4biha @jasonhickel ...we could learn a lot from them.  Many also implemented strong measures and *isolation* of positive cases early on to control spread.  I don't think its as simple as size of country as if that were true exponential rates would be consistent across countries and they aren't.
1329702213309124609 2020-11-20 16:24:46 +0800 <Annabel__always> @v4biha @jasonhickel I should have added S Korea, which is 60m people, comparable to UK
1329701779114762240 2020-11-20 16:23:03 +0800 <Annabel__always> @v4biha @jasonhickel New Zealand, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Denmark, Finland, Australia all have good results and sub 1000 deaths total.  I think on the whole African countries have also done a good job controlling spread compared to European countries.
1329420041612374019 2020-11-19 21:43:32 +0800 <Annabel__always> Can relate
1329365667540328450 2020-11-19 18:07:28 +0800 <Annabel__always> It has also been a mind shift from often directing activity to needing to listen more.  I hope there is growth somewhere in all of this for everyone
1329365666277842945 2020-11-19 18:07:27 +0800 <Annabel__always> This year has felt very lonely professionally, switching from a role where a lot of my work was bringing people together to more self directed desk based stuff like many others. Am grateful for informal peer networks incl @BirdsEyeViewFF @cinemanation + slack/whatsapp hangouts.
1329338079698690048 2020-11-19 16:17:50 +0800 <Annabel__always> Can only assume this is because we have very stupid arrogant people running the show.  Lack of emotional intelligence is a severe skills deficit.
1329101388589260802 2020-11-19 00:37:19 +0800 <Annabel__always> I keep cutting my hands this week.  Starting to feel symbolic.
1329003843397496832 2020-11-18 18:09:42 +0800 <Annabel__always> @BeccadT @markcousinsfilm Yep.  A framework, a plan, a timeline would make room for this.  We will get there.  Also I look forward to spontaneously and affectionately touching you again one day üòÜüòò
1329000090606956546 2020-11-18 17:54:47 +0800 <Annabel__always> Love to start my day talking w friends in Australia, listen to background screaming dinosaur sounds of cockatoos, imagine living somewhere where 1000 c19 deaths is too many, a tragedy.  Also forgot the offhand term 'dog park' which I love.
1328633855599726592 2020-11-17 17:39:30 +0800 <Annabel__always> This is a lovely exercise.  In the deeps of depression a few years ago I used Instagram this way, to have to take a picture of something lovely, every day.  Added bonus was it meant leaving the house, usually.  Beauty is out there, in us, when we give it space.
1328615279887265792 2020-11-17 16:25:41 +0800 <Annabel__always> Sweet deal here if you're bored of Mando, completed the Crown, and hunger for unique film visions, voices, ponderous alternatives to collective myth making üëá
1328603967128031232 2020-11-17 15:40:44 +0800 <Annabel__always> More on Festival 2022.  Is it a canny way to get cash + new voices into arts which sorely needs some hope RN, or an exercise in whitewashing divisive policy?  Is the pay off worth it?  In 2020 the Q how do we survive has overriden the why for many.  Is this conceding or adapting?
1328359467667361799 2020-11-16 23:29:11 +0800 <Annabel__always> @LizCBlack @NoreenMasud Yes! Rolling is definitely joyful faff - googlr give me this, unless you have a tried and true to recommend  https://t.co/1blPpyy635
1328358399852023809 2020-11-16 23:24:56 +0800 <Annabel__always> @charliechar No worries... I think it an op Ed piece from a fairly major US outlet...but Google is obviously full of election related results when I search, and this piece was broader.  Thanks for reply :-)
1328356806314307585 2020-11-16 23:18:36 +0800 <Annabel__always> @charliechar?
1328356695396016128 2020-11-16 23:18:10 +0800 <Annabel__always> Long shot but does anyone on here remember an article about US presidential approval ratings stabilising over time, linking to tribalism, disengagement? My sense of time is broken and it may be a few months or a few years old
1328334685483765762 2020-11-16 21:50:42 +0800 <Annabel__always> @HingleyTheory @NoreenMasud Oh my, family cheese trail competition, I love this
1328325100748333056 2020-11-16 21:12:37 +0800 <Annabel__always> @NoreenMasud Faff time multiplier is an important factor
1328323894395219969 2020-11-16 21:07:50 +0800 <Annabel__always> @NoreenMasud I do have a heated pet pad thing that I have seen repurposed by others to assist w proving though...
1328323466857164800 2020-11-16 21:06:08 +0800 <Annabel__always> @NoreenMasud good idea.  Yeast though...not my forte.  I keep a cold house, good for pastry.  Maybe that's a thing - cold hearted patissiers, warm friendly bakers.  Twirls mustache
1328322509587013632 2020-11-16 21:02:19 +0800 <Annabel__always> @NoreenMasud Noreen, my mum has claimed the Christmas cake baking task for herself, what do I do?  Two is too many.
1328321994211942401 2020-11-16 21:00:17 +0800 <Annabel__always> @SimonEllisFilms I feel like this about Star Trek Discovery.  It introduces shiny things w world building and then spends an hour on exposition for later plot.  Hoping payoff will be worth it.
1328319991368835073 2020-11-16 20:52:19 +0800 <Annabel__always> @Ed_Richardson What needs to be chopped down, Ed?
1328284441253474304 2020-11-16 18:31:03 +0800 <Annabel__always> Anyway, gonna make another cake today - probably a tart tatin, deal with the seemingly endless flow of apples in food box and neighbourly generosity
1328283346129068032 2020-11-16 18:26:42 +0800 <Annabel__always> Complaining as an outlet for anger - not helpful.  Overly forgiving stance on institutional failure - equally unhelpful.  Feels like both have been weaponised.  The way through this isn't to call it a war, a fight, I think.
1328282891273515008 2020-11-16 18:24:54 +0800 <Annabel__always> I get that the positive side of this is realising, acknowledging, leaning into our interconnectedness.  But it's still been extraordinarily fucking difficult, continues to be so.  Trying to navigate your own and other's needs and decisions, accepting you cant fix it all yourself.
1328282379706888200 2020-11-16 18:22:52 +0800 <Annabel__always> I do think one of the hardest things this year has been how polarising and callous our institutional response to crisis has been.  It has felt like whatever you do, you're part of the problem - either by complicity or adding noise.  It's hard to live this way.
1328273536117600256 2020-11-16 17:47:43 +0800 <Annabel__always> @TashCurly I mean, it is perfect.  Classical comedy

1328268705197862912 2020-11-16 17:28:32 +0800 <Annabel__always> @TashCurly Total banger.  It doesn't put a foot wrong
1328262630503571457 2020-11-16 17:04:23 +0800 <Annabel__always> Festival 2022 teams announced - good to see lots of film gang represented but have to admit being most excited to see @KateRaworth Doughnut Lab on the longlist -  https://t.co/G5eSCVrA4Z

1327679210467586055 2020-11-15 02:26:05 +0800 <Annabel__always> People got so excited about BOYHOOD but Greys Anatomy is right there, will never end  https://t.co/odq18q0QwK

1327577742242680832 2020-11-14 19:42:53 +0800 <Annabel__always> Rainy grey day so going to spend it finessing the chicken mole recipe which I got from @nellienorus as it is so good, warm, comforting, and slow.
1327322231731523584 2020-11-14 02:47:35 +0800 <Annabel__always> @jourdayen If you've not discovered it yet, @gracesimone runs an insta called #fatinfilm celebrating all that is curvy and soft on celluloid, and it is so gently healing and adoring, normalising.  100% recommend
1327249040229212161 2020-11-13 21:56:44 +0800 <Annabel__always> I like this thread.  It makes me check myself of my own toxic behaviours as well as dream of positive structural futures:
1327186846024151040 2020-11-13 17:49:36 +0800 <Annabel__always> I see it's another news day dominated by the criminal exploits of horrible men
1327186442955714560 2020-11-13 17:48:00 +0800 <Annabel__always> Making a tart citron today, house perfumed with the scent of lemons.  Orange cake tomorrow for the lucky Scorpions in my neighbourhood üçãüçäüçãüçäü¶Ç
1326968521587388417 2020-11-13 03:22:04 +0800 <Annabel__always> We are masters of yeast though, if you know what you're looking for
1326968307703013382 2020-11-13 03:21:13 +0800 <Annabel__always> Instead, we must content ourselves with soft bread and hard cheese, beer and a fine layer of invisible mould on our lives November - February.
1326967838259769356 2020-11-13 03:19:21 +0800 <Annabel__always> Is it shallow to admit this is in my top 5 things I miss from living in Australia.  Will never understand UK not getting on the cherry train  https://t.co/het3wSqh8f
1326886579051311104 2020-11-12 21:56:27 +0800 <Annabel__always> @CasparSalmon This is what happens when the information provided by official sources is inconsistent, confusing, changeable and definitively un-linked to practical information about transmission and risk.  Innit.
1326822205934743552 2020-11-12 17:40:39 +0800 <Annabel__always> And, lazy men won't want to do it
1326821811170979840 2020-11-12 17:39:05 +0800 <Annabel__always> Rethink leadership as power to leadership as custody, care, responsibility.  Then we'll get more Jacindas, infrastructure.
1326801639387385860 2020-11-12 16:18:56 +0800 <Annabel__always> @SorceressOfFilm Let's have a phone call some time, I will message you xx
1326800703763996672 2020-11-12 16:15:13 +0800 <Annabel__always> @SorceressOfFilm I mean, any debate limited to a few characters is not going to go far.  But the effect of the echo chamber on instinctive doubling down, defensiveness, is impeding critical thought in many spheres.  Hope you're good xxx
1326797869085577216 2020-11-12 16:03:57 +0800 <Annabel__always> Now we have platforms to say anything at all, but with no agreed rules, standards, so much degenerates into individual policing.  Criticism banned in case it doesn't align w current policy.  Discourse pretty fucked with.  Loud voices, tribalism. One sided conversations. Endlessly
1326793589934989316 2020-11-12 15:46:57 +0800 <Annabel__always> @RiotBadger also reframes work as privilege - not you know, labour.
1326587235379146754 2020-11-12 02:06:58 +0800 <Annabel__always> @Such_Mayer @fringefilmfest @CipherPress I say wear the patterned thing hut have an extravagant shawl or serape on hand to sweep over it if people experience the glitches.  Even better would be some sort of heirloom fox fur, vintage cycling cape, that sort of thing.
1326443232813854722 2020-11-11 16:34:45 +0800 <Annabel__always> All of this, and of course, the inverse, too
1326295078772609024 2020-11-11 06:46:02 +0800 <Annabel__always> UBI...worries me. I just don't believe it's robust in the face of inflation, corruption, watering down.  It isn't a replacement for human rights from which stem stronger, equal rights to shelter, health, aid.  It has to be additional not a replacement.
1326224844602675200 2020-11-11 02:06:57 +0800 <Annabel__always> At the level of lockdown where my voice notes are now just sounds of my cat miaowing
1326224416859156482 2020-11-11 02:05:15 +0800 <Annabel__always> @charliechar @cj_carney I found that ritualising by plugging my laptop into the big telly helped a lot with ignoring other distractions
1326224153461067778 2020-11-11 02:04:12 +0800 <Annabel__always> @charliechar @MichaelJLeader It's really difficult.  With LFF at first I liked that the sessions were scheduled so you had to block out time for them, but then thought a 2 hr film should maybe have a 14hr window as things do get in the way.  I find if sessions are 'static' it's harder to find time
1325713402145214464 2020-11-09 16:14:40 +0800 <Annabel__always> Good morning to all my fellow MHers who have spent so long living life entirely as a coping, containing strategy they don't know what or how to want things.  Hope is a scary thing and you have to co-build it.  I suspect this is also worth it.
1325544530012155907 2020-11-09 05:03:38 +0800 <Annabel__always> Fine line tho, innit
1325544463352139778 2020-11-09 05:03:22 +0800 <Annabel__always> When you take away the money and the military it's literally just a bunch of dudes in a carpark blindly demanding, declaiming their dominance   A lot of the joy is the fact that right now they're sad instead of dangerous
1325543759656996864 2020-11-09 05:00:34 +0800 <Annabel__always> Four Seasons Total Landscaping is the sublime antidote to 4 years of gaslighting cruelty.    The ultimate emperors new clothes, writ large in campaign posters hastily plastered onto a garage door.  Inject it into my veins, and all who ever had their capability, ethics, undermined
1325457936920010753 2020-11-08 23:19:32 +0800 <Annabel__always> @lpoolcouncil @louiseckenny Can you opt out of DNA being logged?
1325440710498082816 2020-11-08 22:11:05 +0800 <Annabel__always> @Nuala_OS "She wasn't mad, she was furious"  What an epitaph
1325337873814614017 2020-11-08 15:22:27 +0800 <Annabel__always> Interesting seismic shifts from Tories this week: 1. Furlough extension and raise cap to 80% 2. Civil service 'agency' to stem flow of cash to private sector 3. U turn on FSM and poverty alleviation All good, pragmatic, but pretty different to only 2 weeks ago.  Due to BoE funds?
1325148442859982848 2020-11-08 02:49:43 +0800 <Annabel__always> Same
1325137870508601344 2020-11-08 02:07:42 +0800 <Annabel__always> It's getting worse...
1325127157153103876 2020-11-08 01:25:08 +0800 <Annabel__always> Tangible reason to be cheerful.  Without the US at the front of tackling climate catastrophe things looked a lot more bleak.
1325026770492518400 2020-11-07 18:46:14 +0800 <Annabel__always> AE is so dear to my heart - delivering real change for 100s of talented young people w/o family, school etc connections or routes to creative jobs.  This is real change democratising and strengthening our creative industries, worth supporting
1325015739309371392 2020-11-07 18:02:24 +0800 <Annabel__always> This this this this.  The not knowingness, the lack of information, the well meant comments from others you must be recovering now, you look fine etc.  We need protection for people suffering through this and education on broader risk than deaths.
1324846456608641032 2020-11-07 06:49:44 +0800 <Annabel__always> Just in time for second lockdown, a host of exquisitely curated gems, v helpful if you already completed netflix, etc
1324794219194683392 2020-11-07 03:22:09 +0800 <Annabel__always> All kicking off in my 'anti echo chamber' whatsapp group today (and every day, ofc).
1324724747062681602 2020-11-06 22:46:06 +0800 <Annabel__always> If there is a conscious creator, I'd like to take this moment to thank her for perfectly ripe mango.  Same joy as catching a wave, shooting a hoop, and other trickery.
1324317438478065664 2020-11-05 19:47:36 +0800 <Annabel__always> No more linguistic doilies, give me ecstasy, facts or pain.
1324317032813395969 2020-11-05 19:45:59 +0800 <Annabel__always> When I am Queen I will ban all jaunty language from everything - newsletters, adverts, conference programmes - all of it.  It doesn't even tap into feeling, just smugness or denial.  Bah Humbug.

1324138412513918979 2020-11-05 07:56:13 +0800 <Annabel__always> Signal boosting this.  Been shocked at how invisible union and HSE voices have been in conversations about 'recovery' so far.

1323909961785769985 2020-11-04 16:48:26 +0800 <Annabel__always> Anyway, it takes a muscle to fall in love
1323907496671649792 2020-11-04 16:38:38 +0800 <Annabel__always> Even if the alternative is hopeful lies and false projections
1323907495107170305 2020-11-04 16:38:38 +0800 <Annabel__always> Obvi there is a lot more to the debate than this, but the toxicity of spending years saying everyone who voted for something you disagree with is stupid, evil or wrong won't ever reach those people or inform debate, swing or progress
1323907493853073408 2020-11-04 16:38:38 +0800 <Annabel__always> Lab /dem / left do a lot of assuming their position is correct, and that everyone else is wrong.  This is unappealing, and also tribal.
1323907491898531842 2020-11-04 16:38:37 +0800 <Annabel__always> As usual, people really need to look at what motivates huge numbers to vote republican / Conservative - if you're on board, the message is a lot more hopeful than "ugh not that guy".  People vote for what they find hopeful, it's a wish on a future.
1323905318661824512 2020-11-04 16:29:59 +0800 <Annabel__always> Working with the bullies is only ever a short term plan. X
1323706920956559360 2020-11-04 03:21:37 +0800 <Annabel__always> Worth remembering in the middle of this week that while we lend a lot of collective power to gov and institutions, collectivism works at home and locally too, they aren't mutually exclusive.  Lots of change made this year by direct, needed, action.
1323619175395459072 2020-11-03 21:32:57 +0800 <Annabel__always> Stakes get higher every day, just like the averaged global temperature
1323566068959510534 2020-11-03 18:01:56 +0800 <Annabel__always> I feel like this would be a v good lockdown rewatch - endurance, survival, boom and bust, history, preservation, dreams.  If you have a @mubiuk subscription, give it a go.
1323350565527691266 2020-11-03 03:45:36 +0800 <Annabel__always> I'm not a fan, but I wish people would learn it is spelled Keir.  Everything is stressful enough already.
1323190424035598341 2020-11-02 17:09:15 +0800 <Annabel__always> What is the plan. Seriously, what is it.  Genuinely can't work out if we're now in denial of incompetence or sowing chaos to tighten grip on civil liberty.  Even with the latter though, this position is unsustainable.  Unless wrecking lives is an end game?

1322837186937573376 2020-11-01 17:45:37 +0800 <Annabel__always> This is what helps me through all the noise.  The virus doesn't care about ideology, or tweets.  Evidence based, iterative applications of medical and social intervention is what gets you through, eventually. How long it takes and how difficult it is, is up to policy.
1322627721613234183 2020-11-01 03:53:16 +0800 <Annabel__always> Oh dear, it's a mess isn't it.  You're still a fully human person though, with dreams and love and madness and all of it.  The best way out is through, not numb.
1322598776884875267 2020-11-01 01:58:15 +0800 <Annabel__always> @BeccadT All I can think of is that bit in The Stand (book) where people are going mad inventing a deathly game show in an abandoned studio.  The unraveling of it all.  Unnecessary unraveling.

1322467330887163905 2020-10-31 17:15:56 +0800 <Annabel__always> Truly staggering how the essential *isolate* part of test and trace has been so poorly addressed in UK.  Instead we had gov bribing people to congregate, to push containment out of reach.
1322466415966887936 2020-10-31 17:12:18 +0800 <Annabel__always> @Bertaroo I'm having similar thoughts but sort of reverse, do I YOLO my time and resources on a 'useless' creative MA or continue to grind to pay a small percentage of gains into investments, ad infinitum
1322465893729841152 2020-10-31 17:10:13 +0800 <Annabel__always> @Bertaroo Would they bring equivalent joy / are they equivalent in value.  I YOLOd money I could afford to lose on stocks and it turned out well, but I'm still glad I didn't bet more...
1322452488939884545 2020-10-31 16:16:57 +0800 <Annabel__always> If you're lucky enough to have a cinema open and showing this near you, and you feel comfortable to visit it, don't sleep on this unique and moving film - it's really special.  A chance to get inside one of those deeply felt personal stories, inside a big screen.
1322447129768566784 2020-10-31 15:55:40 +0800 <Annabel__always> This is so well deserved - @weareparable changing the game with fun, exquisitely high production values and audience in mind, always.  üéâü•Ç
1322426546112573440 2020-10-31 14:33:52 +0800 <Annabel__always> Not suppressing the virus damages the economy.  The economy is people.

1322118168966553601 2020-10-30 18:08:29 +0800 <Annabel__always> I hope everyone finds some happiness somewhere in their day today.
1322117777239494657 2020-10-30 18:06:56 +0800 <Annabel__always> Compassion isn't a dirty word.  Looking after yourself isn't letting the side down.  Doubt is OK.  We aren't on this earth just to generate business.  You are still allowed to want things.  It's difficult but finding joy is also OK.  Grieving for things you miss is also OK.
1322116328346521600 2020-10-30 18:01:11 +0800 <Annabel__always> Panic makes us selfish, panic makes us narrow our priorities, to help us survive.  There's been a lot of stiff upper lip mentality, but guess what, you can still fix things, and work, and have feelings at the same time.
1322115479272624133 2020-10-30 17:57:48 +0800 <Annabel__always> There is so much that has been hard for so many this year.  I have struggled with having so many aspects of work - a huge part of my identity, cultural life, inspiration - just fall away.  I think it's OK to acknowledge that while also recognising bigger problems come first.
1322102030924697600 2020-10-30 17:04:22 +0800 <Annabel__always> All of this.  It has felt so hard to be generative about anything, especially when you feel like options to build anything are predicated on politics you can't get behind.  You end up like a rabbit in headlights.  Or you energy goes into rage.  Sustaining hope is the long game.

1320281212292923392 2020-10-25 16:29:05 +0800 <Annabel__always> It is so hard to fight the years of conditioning that you need to be the best at things instead of good at them for it to count.  The latter though, prob more helpful for everyone.  Excellence isn't the same as Best.

1320096549699977217 2020-10-25 04:15:18 +0800 <Annabel__always> Friends. Putting the note "Hungry, mad, can't sleep?" as a recurring monthly calendar reminder, is a life changing act.  Knowing the doom feelings will end, also checking on doom feelings that aren't on schedule, both v useful.

1319688597193240578 2020-10-24 01:14:14 +0800 <Annabel__always> @NoreenMasud Bonus, add a slice of cucumber to the resulting G+T

1319654718004744192 2020-10-23 22:59:37 +0800 <Annabel__always> Another great audience/community role going with an acely talented, committed and supportive gang.  Also love that power of film to reach, inspire, connect community not just 'audiences'. Apply apply
1319603910273830913 2020-10-23 19:37:43 +0800 <Annabel__always> Reminder in 2011 @jrf_uk did a forecasting study on the effect of coalition gov policy, tax reforms, on child poverty. Conclusion - likely increase, also a 'buoyant' labour market doesn't = decreased poverty b/c inequality.  We're not here by accident.  https://t.co/RrXh3t9aEf  https://t.co/eWOGs5CPfJ
1319560382520897536 2020-10-23 16:44:46 +0800 <Annabel__always> Full time programme/audiences role going in Sheffield for an ambitious and creative soul, it's a small team so hard work but room to make your mark too.  This org has great people in it, needs more, like you maybe
1319369590149963776 2020-10-23 04:06:37 +0800 <Annabel__always> Direct correlation between my MH and #s of twitter followers.  Worse=more, what a metric.

1319303266690367488 2020-10-22 23:43:04 +0800 <Annabel__always> @clarisselou I have high hopes for it as what they've done to make the garden extra magic feels more in keeping than other plot faithful adaptations.  Enjoy the lovely goodies either way
1319301466784473089 2020-10-22 23:35:55 +0800 <Annabel__always> @clarisselou I got so excited thinking they sent you the book but on second look I don't think it is.  I love it so, FHB mistress of magic
1319291322960736256 2020-10-22 22:55:37 +0800 <Annabel__always> @Devilligan I had to look it up and the Costume Designer also did Bho Rap so can only conclude the target audience is not the likes of me.  Hard to watch a film while winceing though, isn't it

1319255109965107201 2020-10-22 20:31:43 +0800 <Annabel__always> I bawled at Mogul Mowgli and then @rizwanahmed drops this on Instagram - reminding us that all that loss, pain, anger, &amp; yeah, hope, determination, isn't something to squash, is real - can even be beautiful -  https://t.co/cmFy21Wk75
1319204365199200256 2020-10-22 17:10:04 +0800 <Annabel__always> @Floragmenz @nellienorus Another thing you can do is find your local foodbank (there will be one, sadly) and organise a local collection or drop off.  We've been doing this with my mutual aid group since lockdown started, a weekly drop into boxes outside someone's house (who has a car) + then they drop

1319004020883804164 2020-10-22 03:53:59 +0800 <Annabel__always> @sonjahenrici @SarahMosses Some days exercise, some days junk food.  I try to recognise the value and addictive properties of both.  And baths, so many baths.  Somehow the bathroom = clear mental space.  You need to rest, take it, you can't fix everything all at once x
1318996143062343680 2020-10-22 03:22:40 +0800 <Annabel__always> @RuwaydaMustafah @OwenJones84 It also literally does solve the problem posited in the second sentence.  Problem: parents unable to feed kids, solution, state assists

1318991279578021890 2020-10-22 03:03:21 +0800 <Annabel__always> @RuwaydaMustafah @PaawaaaKawa But we don't have that, so you are happy to let children suffer now, through crisis, for your ideology
1318990683101945862 2020-10-22 03:00:59 +0800 <Annabel__always> @RuwaydaMustafah @PaawaaaKawa Then why would you not support feeding them

1318566698505699334 2020-10-20 22:56:13 +0800 <Annabel__always> üëá a great thread that I encourage colleagues working in commissioning/funding roles, or recruiting to take a look at. I've clearly been guilty of some of the bad examples in my time, or haven't explained the why of them well; that doesn't mean it's not worth a try to be better
1318521048481005568 2020-10-20 19:54:49 +0800 <Annabel__always> I feel like the question to ask is why aren't school meals free and for everyone already.  The benefits of that sort of policy would be huge, from engagement to attendance to health.  How about investing in hope, young-uns, the idea we look after them.

1317415960190615552 2020-10-17 18:43:35 +0800 <Annabel__always> @lisa_brook @rhidiandavis We had to rethink 'values' with first round of fan resilience - supporting commercial independents who programme fairly mainstream but are the only show in town, reach 5pk people for example
1317415692703092736 2020-10-17 18:42:32 +0800 <Annabel__always> @lisa_brook @rhidiandavis I would guess the business model involved taking on huge costs to recoup with the big shebang, they operate at huge scale.  But I havent seen the receipts.  Lots to unpick re value and also commercials not supported but my main point is abt snobbery -

1317413109871640576 2020-10-17 18:32:16 +0800 <Annabel__always> Hi @BBC6Music re news just now - NZ Labour winning with a landslide lets them GOVERN comfortably, not 'rule' (your words).  wtf.
1317389062773288960 2020-10-17 16:56:43 +0800 <Annabel__always> This is what's so worrying about the abuses of trust and process in parliament - it opens the door to similar behaviour at local and institutional level.
1317380774404984832 2020-10-17 16:23:47 +0800 <Annabel__always> And, stop buying into there not being enough to go round.  Two ends of the same piece of string.
1317379879436955648 2020-10-17 16:20:13 +0800 <Annabel__always> Attacking a successful commercial co for receiving arts funding support just shows your snooty ass imho.  Attack poor Labour practices, yes, but perhaps check yourself on the rest.  Culture is for everyone.

1316095392921124867 2020-10-14 03:16:08 +0800 <Annabel__always> This talk should be available online in the next couple of days - well worth yr time to hear from broad range of those working across all facets of cinema exhibition/distribution
1316087136882487298 2020-10-14 02:43:19 +0800 <Annabel__always> @nowolvesplease I feel like unions are a potential answer, measure, maybe encouragement/incentive on funded orgs to recognise unions, make room for them as part of operating environment.  Part of onboarding, like pension
1316078767677353986 2020-10-14 02:10:04 +0800 <Annabel__always> @melimOi @nowolvesplease Or, imagine if management was defined differently, even as a pastoral, development role with performance or outcomes looked at against a broader business plan.  That might change the game.  There probably isn't one single solution.
1316032668727992320 2020-10-13 23:06:53 +0800 <Annabel__always> V soul healing to hear so many articulate, expert women rounding out discourse on film exhibition in today's @BirdsEyeViewFF #LFF2020  session.  What a joy to hear beyond the echo chamber of my own anxiety + known dominant voices.  Also to hear from workers, the ones doing it.
1315958714348773379 2020-10-13 18:13:01 +0800 <Annabel__always> Apparently it's Tuesday.  My insomnia begs to differ.

1315546945562251264 2020-10-12 14:56:48 +0800 <Annabel__always> Feels like there has to be case against pricing penalties for those w/o digital access.  Mindful of this too, when we talk about working with online tools to increase access.  It can and does, but not for everyone

1314458836493836289 2020-10-09 14:53:02 +0800 <Annabel__always> This is not an elegant, forward looking solution, it's another form of discrimination.  This rhetoric of vulnerable people - whether age, disability, comordbidities, caring responsibility - as being adjacent to economy, society is abhorrent.

1314128147626029056 2020-10-08 16:59:00 +0800 <Annabel__always> Jane Fonda hailed in current press pieces as 'ageless', 'ageing flawlessly'.  How about 'distinguished' 'accomplished' 'persistent' 'lifelong advocate for liberty, human rights', 'creative comic powerhouse', and style icon.  There is power in age.

1313792098123087873 2020-10-07 18:43:39 +0800 <Annabel__always> @AmandaJNolen @tomaspueyo Also, a reticence or possessiveness around defined skillsets, when actually people have varied aptitudes, and resource around learning being limited, or unproven often the bigger barrier
1313788681589796865 2020-10-07 18:30:05 +0800 <Annabel__always> Also like @jwoodfilm says, the platform is bangin.  Nothing can replace cinema experience but you can see commitment to showing in best condition possible online üëç
1313788052574175233 2020-10-07 18:27:35 +0800 <Annabel__always> Finally carved out time for my first #LFF2020 p&amp;i screening - cannot over emphasise how much better access is with these online for those delegates not based in London.  We used to pay the same pass fee w/o 3 weeks access to these that others got if in the city. Please keep this!
1313717334750752768 2020-10-07 13:46:34 +0800 <Annabel__always> @mollyv1991 @tomaspueyo you also need to determine a timescale - innovation results operate on a different scale to sales for example
1313716843618676737 2020-10-07 13:44:37 +0800 <Annabel__always> @tomaspueyo @mollyv1991 There is already quite a lot of data around women, minority pay gaps but less action on these issues.  Prejudice persists even when you can see it, even when there is data showing these workers add value.

1313429695262863361 2020-10-06 18:43:36 +0800 <Annabel__always> Not to mention, this is yet more shifting of responsibility.  If tracing and testing actually worked, so many audience facing jobs would be 'viable'.  This is an egregious abdication of responsibility and a foolishly short term view.
1313352360023003136 2020-10-06 13:36:18 +0800 <Annabel__always> I cannot fathom why anyone would allow this bill to pass, kudos to @_OliviaBlake @HackneyAbbott @NadiaWhittomeMP and the 17 others defying the whip to stand for something much more important.

1312670540616826880 2020-10-04 16:26:59 +0800 <Annabel__always> @pixieglas There is such opportunity too, to look at localism, access. Thinking abt what happened in communities in crisis and with people having time to help. Target furlough over deeming entire sectors unviable because of flubbed response to public health. People need culture, each other.
1312665710502514695 2020-10-04 16:07:48 +0800 <Annabel__always> @GreenPartyMolly Skimmed your replies and interesting to see few people talking about aspirations, just negative feels abt tax.  There's a strong rhetoric around supporting hard work, small businesses, own your house, money in your pocket, opoprtunity. Even if reality is v different to the dream.

The UK and US have been absolutely chaotic with unsettling crisis points and extremely confusing changing rules and messaging. None of this instils confidence, no matter how hard cinemas try
1312520585574903810 2020-10-04 06:31:07 +0800 <Annabel__always> @patrickvons @damian_keena @robbiereviews There are a lot of countries that went down a suppression route and are reopening with sustained success - mostly E Asia, where there is also domestic product.  Sweden is one model and simplistic to act as if the intervention was minimal when schools and universities pivoted
1312518220654342145 2020-10-04 06:21:43 +0800 <Annabel__always> @paullferrer @robbiereviews There was a plan, but it was a poor one - rush to reopen, unlinked to R, pretend everything fine.  I see now we'll be blaming studios or buying into cinema-as-unviable and not a colossal failure of government to protect lives and with them, jobs.
1312339062586572800 2020-10-03 18:29:49 +0800 <Annabel__always> @chordia22 But yes, we will see change and huge need for adaptive strategy now!  Indies still need some big ticket films to underwrite more risky offerings.
1312338663481774080 2020-10-03 18:28:14 +0800 <Annabel__always> @chordia22 I am concerned about a story being spun that studios are holding back recovery in the West rather than a failure of policy.  Domestic product succeeding in China, may also see US releases there, held back in US/EU to clear slate backlog, generate income  https://t.co/vfEqFQWD6s
1312333977211076608 2020-10-03 18:09:36 +0800 <Annabel__always> @chordia22 Worth noting that in countries with virus under control, restrictions have been easing for cinemas.  But yes while US and UK spiral the knock on effect will be severe.  Grants much less effective than virus suppression.

Imagine if a societal goal was safe happy kids, same for them when they grow up .  For clarity, not a policy of forced parenting.
1310654747213533186 2020-09-29 02:56:57 +0800 <Annabel__always> Standing, winning isn't just an exclusive pastime for privileged folks - PP events will give you a clear picture of work involved, realistic timelines and supportive environment to ask questions.

1310464194790203393 2020-09-28 14:19:45 +0800 <Annabel__always> Exactly this.  People need support to isolate, not criminalisation and punishment of those who are vulnerable.  Punitive policy is either designed for failure or signals gross incompetence.

1309408284663836672 2020-09-25 16:23:57 +0800 <Annabel__always> It's easy to focus on the immediate crisis, and not think about the bigger whys for being this culture game.

1305463504166629377 2020-09-14 19:08:48 +0800 <Annabel__always> @robinschlinkert @pjenkss @lewis_goodall @Keir_Starmer Thank you, that's a really helpful explanation.  I guess this is why we had scrutiny of bills and some sort of parliamentary process, but as you say, this is crumbling in front of us.  I still reject that that is OK if you have an 80 seat majority though.
1305444072316973056 2020-09-14 17:51:35 +0800 <Annabel__always> @keeforelli @stuartgt Same, except I was asked to by the KCL research project, so booked a test, took it, got results within 24 hr, 2 weeks ago.  Manufactured crisis, even if more people requesting tests as rate going up, that was easy to see coming and respond to.  Would also help curb rise.
1305429709774348289 2020-09-14 16:54:31 +0800 <Annabel__always> I understand we are getting better at treating this virus, that fatality rate is low. But the ideology behind forcing huge levels of risk onto people is test for future issues, incl climate change, future viruses. This path is quite dangerous now, and far more dangerous in future
1305426162898919424 2020-09-14 16:40:25 +0800 <Annabel__always> @pjenkss @lewis_goodall @Keir_Starmer This is not true.  Parliament is bound by law, despite consistent attempts from this government to change that.  A majority doesn't bypass scrutiny or law.  We shouldn't sit back and accept this fallacy.
1305420371542319104 2020-09-14 16:17:24 +0800 <Annabel__always> I miss the cinema so much.  But I think this is not the campaign to run when the R is over 1 and testing isn't working in the UK.  We need infrastructure to keep audiences safe, no matter how hard venues are working to comply with guidance.  https://t.co/GzljSzoXU0
1305417337881927680 2020-09-14 16:05:21 +0800 <Annabel__always> @CarolineLucas Drumming my fingers waiting for @PaulBlomfieldMP to make any sort of comment at all
1305164704147550209 2020-09-13 23:21:28 +0800 <Annabel__always> Feel much despair today.  Letting myself feel it so that I can try again tomorrow.  And the next day.  You very rarely win overnight.
1305087426713595907 2020-09-13 18:14:24 +0800 <Annabel__always> My lovely neighbours Foster kids with very limited mobility and yesterday somebody broke into and burned their van.  Awful but the community has raised nearly ¬£2500 in 24 hrs to help, as they're local legends and #Sheffieldissuper feel free to help here:  https://t.co/wGytmSX9lq
1305059940957073409 2020-09-13 16:25:11 +0800 <Annabel__always> Incroyable. Put it in the White Cube.
1305059004666777600 2020-09-13 16:21:28 +0800 <Annabel__always> @NoreenMasud I think I will buy sprinkles.  Need reminders of joy
1305056511991914497 2020-09-13 16:11:33 +0800 <Annabel__always> @NoreenMasud But how do you discipline yourself not to eat them directly every time you open fridge/cupboard
1305054170442067969 2020-09-13 16:02:15 +0800 <Annabel__always> @JeanieFinlay This is the coffee hazelnut recipe, I still dream about it, it was so good  https://t.co/n9z6xSQxYg
1305053611689414656 2020-09-13 16:00:02 +0800 <Annabel__always> @JeanieFinlay Yess!  I might have a go too.  Also pondering some sort of apple profiterole, apple cream in the middle, caramel on the outside.  I made them before, coffee hazelnut, think it could be adapted.  Hazelnut in the choux is a game changer. But its a faff when just me in my house üéªüéª

1304886242404958213 2020-09-13 04:54:58 +0800 <Annabel__always> I think now is the time for rewatch #3 of The Assassination of Gianni Versace.  I think it is actually perfect.  Darren Criss mesmeric in crisis and at peak sociopathic power.  And the clothes, the hair.  The Clothes and The Hair.
1304877630479642624 2020-09-13 04:20:45 +0800 <Annabel__always> @JeanieFinlay I think this could work...but either grate the apple so it melts into texture or you'd need to candy it first? Every year I try to make a kind of cinnamon, marzipan, apple chelsea bun which flavour wise is so good but I never get the dough right
1304864000593874945 2020-09-13 03:26:35 +0800 <Annabel__always> @JeanieFinlay Also vote for apple ice cream, or apple fool if you prefer not to freeze it.  Is calvados made from apples or is it brandy with apples?  I'm excited to see what you end up making
1304863073543557127 2020-09-13 03:22:54 +0800 <Annabel__always> @JeanieFinlay I wonder if apple can be snuck in to things, the way apricots can to moroccan stew.  Apple scones?  Have never grated and frozen, but have sliced and frozen.  Grating might make more sense given what freezing does to texture ü§î
1304862640959782913 2020-09-13 03:21:11 +0800 <Annabel__always> @JeanieFinlay I am also juicing and freezing, have 2 crumbles in freezer (investing in small oven dishes is a game changer btw) and whoever suggested mincemeat is a genius.  Dorset apple cake, apple tart good treats.  And I've got apple cider vinegar on the go from peel and cores.
1304823803541966850 2020-09-13 00:46:51 +0800 <Annabel__always> *mostly live.  Some will of course die
1304823623392407555 2020-09-13 00:46:08 +0800 <Annabel__always> And, getting transmission rate well below 1.0 would benefit venues, restaurants, sports, all of it, longer term.  This blind ambition to make us live with risk rather than actually tackle the problem is ghoulish and, basically, fucking stupid.
1304728059870941184 2020-09-12 18:26:24 +0800 <Annabel__always> @DrSextonGreen I feel you may have encouraged this behaviour with such an extravagant tower.  No bad thing.
1304716570887938048 2020-09-12 17:40:45 +0800 <Annabel__always> @pixieglas 1. Create a folder called 'optional' 2. Create filter that sends every email that contains the word unsubscribe to that folder instead of the inbox 3. Check the 'optional' folder as much or as little as you feel like  Xx
1304687380151009281 2020-09-12 15:44:46 +0800 <Annabel__always> Glad someone is saying it.  Also from 'remoaner' to 'traitor', a shorter line than you'd think.  There is an all out assault on civil liberty, democracy, we have to look at it and say no.
1304428122415271936 2020-09-11 22:34:34 +0800 <Annabel__always> Well, this is rad, ripper, on ya, etc üëç  https://t.co/FCSedtG4c4
1304119257878462475 2020-09-11 02:07:15 +0800 <Annabel__always> Dagger emoji is truly the best one üó°üó°üó° As satisfying as a cat pouncing on a piece of string
1303987709740974080 2020-09-10 17:24:31 +0800 <Annabel__always> Is the rule of 6 and covid marshals coming in just before extraordinary powers for covid expire?  Or did they already get extended.
1303977503426478080 2020-09-10 16:43:58 +0800 <Annabel__always> @pixieglas @meganwmglesga I felt like it was so unconscious and honestly coming from a good place, it made me laugh more than anything.  Politics needs all sorts of voices to be representative, so I'm sticking with it for now
1303946245300510720 2020-09-10 14:39:45 +0800 <Annabel__always> @meganwmglesga I really enjoyed attending a local meeting (on zoom) last night, being the only woman, and one member suggesting I would enjoy watching the recording of the meeting back, slowly, so I could keep up.  He honestly thought this was helpful üòπ
1303941093805961216 2020-09-10 14:19:17 +0800 <Annabel__always> @LyndseyStonebri I think he is vaguely gesturing toward Mariana Mazzucato, but am going to go ahead and assume he hasn't actually read her books
1303752084437729280 2020-09-10 01:48:14 +0800 <Annabel__always> @roshmcdaid @OdeonUnion @ODEONCinemas I dug around and went back through UKCA guidance and gov guidance on hospitality and it is correct - though local public health should be involved with over 2 cases, and HSE inspection recommended.  It's hard to find the info though.
1303751663015153664 2020-09-10 01:46:33 +0800 <Annabel__always> @RicoRKLJ @Cinema_UK this - says bars and restaurants but seems to be covering broader 'hospitality'  https://t.co/0aeiXKETkx
1303751417660833792 2020-09-10 01:45:35 +0800 <Annabel__always> @RicoRKLJ @Cinema_UK There is more guidance in a separate guidance doc from gov (not UKCA) around hospitality - more than 2 cases to be reported to local public health, which should trigger an inspection.  But it would be helpful for this info to be much more clearly signposted and understood.
1303608219466706949 2020-09-09 16:16:34 +0800 <Annabel__always> @mant_a_tangi @bfiben @BFI I do think there's sense in awards being more representative, as this links to track record, future funding, perceived risk.  One thing affects another.  Broader voting base is another intervention, which AMPAS have been working on, that needs to carry on.
1303606764366106625 2020-09-09 16:10:47 +0800 <Annabel__always> @mant_a_tangi @bfiben @BFI Agree, you can't make one change or publish standards and then think the work has been done...or needs no review. Film is such a long scramble for limited funds so need advocacy and support at many levels, to make change tangible.
1303604696502988805 2020-09-09 16:02:34 +0800 <Annabel__always> @mant_a_tangi @bfiben @BFI We are in an interesting time where 'success' in cinema  seems less defined than before - box office Nos don't make sense in a pandemic, standards for streaming don't exist, so good Qs to ask about attention and cultural impact, and who is setting the bar
1303604177097162755 2020-09-09 16:00:30 +0800 <Annabel__always> @mant_a_tangi @bfiben @BFI I think it's a long overdue move and good to see some scrutiny translating to awards - AMPAS and BAFTA - as hopefully harder to fudge than funding applications (things inevitably change in delivery), but essential that identified flaws are addressed for structural change
1303602618917367809 2020-09-09 15:54:18 +0800 <Annabel__always> @mant_a_tangi @bfiben @BFI Also, are there changes to the AMPAS criteria in light of  https://t.co/lltS6hQO7t
1303596673344700418 2020-09-09 15:30:41 +0800 <Annabel__always> Did more digging and according to  https://t.co/0aeiXKETkx more than 2 case should be reported to local PHE (p43) and ideally a HSE inspection is carried out.  So yes within guidance, but could be clearer
1303586258778763264 2020-09-09 14:49:18 +0800 <Annabel__always> The cinema says staying open is 'within guidance' which I guess is true when the @cinema_uk  guidance doesn't actually advise what to do if/when you have a case in venue.  Is it a local public health decision or just up to the company?  https://t.co/6bp0IOZCi9
1303578909716422657 2020-09-09 14:20:06 +0800 <Annabel__always> @roshmcdaid @OdeonUnion @ODEONCinemas plus when they actually have cases they stay open but it's OK as 'within guidance' and 'relevant staff' are tested  https://t.co/6bp0IOZCi9
1303430297594322944 2020-09-09 04:29:34 +0800 <Annabel__always> @iand62986733 @JMPSimor it doesn't put anyone above the law though.
1303408659066761224 2020-09-09 03:03:35 +0800 <Annabel__always> @bob_taylor4 @DavidLammy It doesn't though, absolute power is dictatorship not democracy, no matter the size of the majority.  They keep spinning this lie that majority = zero accountability and it is starting to come true.
1303396734152904705 2020-09-09 02:16:12 +0800 <Annabel__always> If you are still deluding yourself that we are living in a functioning democracy, explain this.  A majority, no matter how large, doesn't mean dictatorship, ignoring rule of law, rewriting previously voted on agreements.

1303271131751866368 2020-09-08 17:57:06 +0800 <Annabel__always> @charliechar @JeanieFinlay I am v interested to see if this improves press access too.  You could do a lot with young/regional press + programmers accessing previews, outside of London.
1303270230530154496 2020-09-08 17:53:31 +0800 <Annabel__always> @TimandraHarknes TBF we did just do a UK-wide musicals season #BFIMusicals Oct '19 - Jan '20.  And you're right, it was very successful!
1302715388015370243 2020-09-07 05:08:46 +0800 <Annabel__always> @TimonSingh the bar is low
1302663595705200641 2020-09-07 01:42:58 +0800 <Annabel__always> Came back on twitter for 2 days and so did the insomnia
1302550114964299776 2020-09-06 18:12:02 +0800 <Annabel__always> @mant_a_tangi I inhaled it in one weekend, I love it
1302540749934862336 2020-09-06 17:34:49 +0800 <Annabel__always> Today in 'freelance salary' is an oxymoron. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1302204191268638721 2020-09-05 19:17:27 +0800 <Annabel__always> Also note recent activity from gov re 'activist lawyers' (aka lawyers challenging their own criminal actions), judicial review and disbanding PHE to disrupt the paper trail.
1302092928798556160 2020-09-05 11:55:20 +0800 <Annabel__always> @jackbuck123 Same except I'm 40.  There are a some covid recovery groups on Facebook and slack that might help.  Also for me, finally, after 6 months I am making baby steps back toward fitness.  But you have to really rest for a long time to let yourself recover fully.  Good luck
1301581595451764740 2020-09-04 02:03:29 +0800 <Annabel__always> Tens across the board for this campaign
