1344070482144993280 2020-12-30 07:59:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA You lost, period.
1343987130255761411 2020-12-30 02:27:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JoshuaKarp @sendavidperdue Yep, he’s running scared.
1343986849937817604 2020-12-30 02:26:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help Ossoff and Warnock win their Georgia Senate races. Without them, Biden’s Presidency will be checkmated.
1343964728029278209 2020-12-30 00:58:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> Awesome commentary
1343964518314029056 2020-12-30 00:58:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, if you ever read the retweets to your posts, you would see just how many people know that you are a traitorous, lying narcissist who had no business ever being in public office.
1343881129435267073 2020-12-29 19:26:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> As Trump and his allies keep talking about election fraud these actions by the Trump Administration should be front and center. It’s being buried under false accusations and rumors.
1343831913807683584 2020-12-29 16:11:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SenSanders I’ll bet money, Mitch McConnell will not allow this legislation to see the light of day. Our only hope to avoid him blocking everything Biden tries to do is to win both Georgia Senate seats in January.
1343830853672165377 2020-12-29 16:06:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Too late Trump. You should brought that particular point up months ago. You are totally incompetent and look like a bumbling idiot. You might as well just stop your tweets now because you have no influence or bearing on anything Congress does going forward.
1343713462925590528 2020-12-29 08:20:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @marklevinshow I do not have any idea what you see in Trump but you are one messed up individual
1343707731895726087 2020-12-29 07:57:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @CP_Rouse This one tweet has shown me that you and other anti maskers could not find your way out of a paper bag, much less a pandemic. I think you are closet sociopaths as well.
1343705779472359428 2020-12-29 07:49:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> I am worried that Biden will give Trump and his cronies a pass in the name of unifying the country. First of all, hard core Trump supporters have no interest in unity and secondly this action will just encourage future corrupt demagogues.
1343640185934901250 2020-12-29 03:29:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich Please help Ossoff and Warnock with time and money in the special election in Georgia.
1343612338507816960 2020-12-29 01:38:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @davematt88 I live hear and everything you said was true. It’s been a Republican dominated state for decades.
1343612048631099393 2020-12-29 01:37:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> Vote Georgia and make history!
1343611880787636225 2020-12-29 01:36:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DWUhlfelderLaw @donwinslow To many politicians in this country are like Rubio. Personal gain and political power are their main goal.
1343504299343683584 2020-12-28 18:29:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help these two candidates. You could literally change history.
1343502551912747010 2020-12-28 18:22:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate The same people that donate money to his overturn the election money making scheme.
1343502035757506563 2020-12-28 18:20:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @realDonaldTrump You might fool your most hardcore supporters, but most people realize you have become powerless and irrelevant Trump. You are a one term President and a loser.
1343431023925874689 2020-12-28 13:38:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> Why didn’t every journalist come to this conclusion years ago?
1343429415200567297 2020-12-28 13:31:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is one of those situations where either way it’s bad. Mitch McConnell is a slithering snake in the grass, Trump is a 300 pound malevolent child and 40% of the American Electorate is fine with that.
1343362142326693890 2020-12-28 09:04:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> Marco is constantly prostituting himself. Why is that?
1343361892723666944 2020-12-28 09:03:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @sendavidperdue @KLoeffler Trump, they are supporters of yours do that makes them corrupt dirtbag politicians
1343238123535413249 2020-12-28 00:51:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @StanGott Why is little Marco still doing Trump’s bidding. I believe Trump has something on him and that something was probably furnished by the Kremlin.
1343106648441823232 2020-12-27 16:09:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You don’t speak for me Trump,  you never have and never will. You speak for the 40% of the Electorate that for some unfathomable reason thinks you are wonderful. Your BS never worked with me from the beginning. I knew you were a snake when I first heard you open your mouth.
1342991032082984961 2020-12-27 08:29:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow The only reason I can think of is that Trump is a Russian asset.
1342990824209084417 2020-12-27 08:28:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> Go Georgia. Make history by flipping the Senate.
1342978616850845696 2020-12-27 07:40:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AndrewYang These two Georgia Senators are scumbags without anything positive to say about themselves
1342977516961751041 2020-12-27 07:36:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mhdksafa Absolutely
1342977462003785728 2020-12-27 07:35:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> I agree completely. If people who have committed crimes are not held accountable, this will encourage others to do the same in the future.
1342966054860038148 2020-12-27 06:50:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Tyler_The_Wise @bblock29 @JohnCornyn No one said he couldn’t eat dinner with his family did they?
1342965663141425153 2020-12-27 06:48:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realconnorlynch @JohnCornyn I disagree. The Republican Party has completely failed the American people during this pandemic and people are going hungry in this country. The optics are terrible and the tweet suggests that Cornyn is tone deaf or just doesn’t give a damn.
1342963937327919105 2020-12-27 06:42:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JohnCornyn That’s nice Senator. You have a cushy job as a sitting Senator and the pay and benefits are great. As you look around at all you have, many of your fellow Americans are hungry or facing eviction and you and your fellow Republicans have totally failed them. You don’t care.
1342962762503360513 2020-12-27 06:37:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @kurtbardella @SallySellers54 Because Trump is a blow hard and a conman.
1342961699062743041 2020-12-27 06:33:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump No one is listening to you anymore because you are a has been and a loser Trump.
1342961371571507203 2020-12-27 06:31:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mmpadellan Along with the every one of the Republican Senators and Representatives
1342960974857457664 2020-12-27 06:30:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Sounds like some of your followers are as stupid as you are Trump. No wonder they like you so much.
1342960338547965955 2020-12-27 06:27:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @johnber03518271 @JackWPolitics @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump Just say it John. Business is more important than human life to you. If people would wear masks and social distance we would not have most of the lockdowns we see, and we not be listening to you bitch about it. The problem is, many people are stupid in this country.
1342918802892328965 2020-12-27 03:42:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You did nothing Trump and 333,000 Americans are dead. You ought to just keep that big mouth of yours shut and get out of the White House, you pathetic toad.
1342906876657283073 2020-12-27 02:55:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @HeatherAutumn42 @OctoberFerguson Then please accept my apologies.  If I would have researched you I would have realized that.
1342884486288207878 2020-12-27 01:26:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump Trump’s fat a**.
1342882851256152065 2020-12-27 01:19:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JWeber988 How nice of him. I hope people remember these Republicans during future elections.
1342882409994461185 2020-12-27 01:18:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump That’s because since you turned out to be a loser and are leaving office, they don’t need you anymore. I’ll bet they are as sick of you as the Democratic leadership is.
1342881855234830336 2020-12-27 01:15:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Blah, blah, blah Trump.
1342881655606882304 2020-12-27 01:15:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Since you are a pathological liar Trump, only your cult members believe your claims and conspiracy theories.
1342881223224532992 2020-12-27 01:13:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Who is they Trump? You can try to misdirect the American people to blame others, but the fact of the matter is that you and your family are totally corrupt and have run a criminal enterprise out of the White House.
1342880104368787456 2020-12-27 01:09:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump What you are is referred to as talking out your ass Trump. Just get the hell out of the White House and shut that big mouth of yours.
1342879399268462597 2020-12-27 01:06:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MarkFinchem I do not believe Trump has anything to do with God. You support him because he said he was against abortion, though no one knows if that is true or not. If you support him for racism, locking up immigrant children in cages and becoming a dictator I would say Jesus never knew you.
1342852200616366087 2020-12-26 23:18:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You could have pushed for this amount weeks ago Trump. You and the Republicans could have given Americans enough to live on for the last 9 months but you and your Republican allies wouldn’t. You don’t care about us, you are just having a temper tantrum because you lost.
1342798075585327104 2020-12-26 19:43:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> Remember this. The Republican Party is not your friend. If you still think they are, you are delusional
1342795321781473280 2020-12-26 19:32:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DebraBeier @donwinslow @be4727f52ece4ae Actually, I have read that it was 75% for Trump and 25% for the Republican Party.
1342672967369682944 2020-12-26 11:25:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BreitbartNews And who gives a rat’s ass about this anyway Breitbart?
1342672550292312064 2020-12-26 11:24:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> I truly believe that most members of Congress are there for the money, not because they want good government.
1342661868356333573 2020-12-26 10:41:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please read and help Georgia’s two Democratic Senate candidates Warnock and Ossoff.
1342660323275374592 2020-12-26 10:35:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @lori_dee2 @DavidKyaloM @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Sounds like what a cult member would say as he is literally screwing them over. You cannot believe a word the man says and if you do, you are an extremely gullible individual.
1342659294290980866 2020-12-26 10:31:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @xtobaba9 @DavidKyaloM @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS What would you know? He is not the leader of Nigeria. We know this man much better than you ever will. You are welcome to him after he does prison time.
1342658565790703620 2020-12-26 10:28:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Correction. The pandemic was your fault Trump.
1342658389151776768 2020-12-26 10:28:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Why didn’t you bring this up months ago Trump? You could have pushed McConnell but you didn’t. Now all of a sudden you act like you are a champion for the people. What hogwash. You have been and will always be a two bit conman. You don’t give a damn about the American people.
1342657030885142528 2020-12-26 10:22:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @OctoberFerguson Unless American voters wake up in the red states, we will always have a Mitch McConnell.
1342656677452120071 2020-12-26 10:21:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @HeatherAutumn42 @OctoberFerguson Let me put it this way Heather. McConnell DID THIS VERY THING during Obama’s second term, so forgive me if I strongly believe he did say it!
1342655881520050178 2020-12-26 10:18:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> To every voter in this country, I say to you that if you every feel that the Biden Administration never gets anything done, here is the reason. Same playbook as Obama’s second term. We must win the two Georgia Senate races!
1342654593893851140 2020-12-26 10:12:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> And the Republican Party relentlessly tries to limit American’s right to vote in what is supposed to be a democracy. Sounds insane, but in their view it’s the only way they can stay in power. Their hostility to it shows me that voting is still a very powerful tool for change.
1342629631288029188 2020-12-26 08:33:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I believe that deep inside you know you lost the election and you are just continuing this charade to keep your supporters donations flowing into your bank account.
1342483240154779649 2020-12-25 22:52:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Julius_Kim Yes we did, but the battle for the soul of this nation has just begun.
1342482467433967618 2020-12-25 22:48:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @dayomichael5 @donwinslow Or he may be the ultimate con artist, a classic narcissist who wants total power and doesn’t give a damn about his supporters or this country. I have been saying for a long time that a good portion of this country is ready for America’s first dictator.
1342451846917607425 2020-12-25 20:47:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump and his supporters will remain a threat to this country
1342451586933665794 2020-12-25 20:46:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @politicoalex There is always the possibility that Trump could be in a prison cell if he isn’t given a pass in pursuit of “unity”.
1342450128729354240 2020-12-25 20:40:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC Go to hell Trump.
1342450019119603715 2020-12-25 20:40:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> To all you Republicans out there. What political party is looking out for working Americans during this pandemic?
1342447232474341379 2020-12-25 20:28:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow Amen brother
1342446895487197187 2020-12-25 20:27:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @dayomichael5 @donwinslow I realize you believe you know the future, but I believe you are wrong about China. The threat was right in front of you the whole time but you ignored it and supported him. Maybe you are intelligent but just not wise. Trumpism is a cult and the worship of one man is dangerous.
1342436967141793792 2020-12-25 19:48:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> This comment sums up the state of the religious right in our country
1342436574798217217 2020-12-25 19:46:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @sarahnrogers Sounds like you suffered more than most. I am very sorry to hear that. Let’s all hope the future is brighter.
1342436171981479936 2020-12-25 19:44:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mmpadellan That was very cool. Hope it happens
1342435967165231104 2020-12-25 19:44:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> Very well said.
1342435295858454529 2020-12-25 19:41:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Phyl062870671 @dayomichael5 @donwinslow That’s right. I don’t like cults or cult members. Never will.
1342434531710742528 2020-12-25 19:38:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @dayomichael5 @donwinslow Does your butt still hurt from the election? I hope it does. You got it all wrong as most cult members do. Trump was leading us to an autocratic government. You belong to the cult of Trump and are a clear and present danger to this country.
1342433272765231104 2020-12-25 19:33:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow I am really glad you thought to thank all these Americans Don. I want to thank you because you were one of those people that led the charge
1342432667078434816 2020-12-25 19:31:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump could have brought up the $2000 figure long ago, but he did not. Too busy playing golf I guess. Now Americans including many of his supporters will suffer as they lose jobs and their homes and yet they will still worship the idiot. That is a cult.
1342431370149318656 2020-12-25 19:25:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump It will always be the Trump virus in this country you worthless POS.
1342431016842096640 2020-12-25 19:24:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Hilarious Trump. You sound like you actually thought these snakes in Congress were loyal to you. You truly are a complete moron. They used both you and your supporters because they are in Congress for their own political and monetary gain. Crooks and scum just like you Trump.
1342429602963193857 2020-12-25 19:18:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> When will Americans wake up?
1342429415725260802 2020-12-25 19:18:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Go away Trump. The country’s nightmare under your  Presidency is almost over. The clock is ticking and I want you to pay dearly for the damage you and your supporters have done to this country on January 20th, 2021.
1342428292465500160 2020-12-25 19:13:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> I agree completely. I just think that many Americans either believe that the whole thing is a hoax, or they don’t have the maturity or self discipline to stay home. Either way, they personally and we as a nation will live with the consequences of their stupidity.
1342425581762342912 2020-12-25 19:02:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump @RobWittman You just moved to examine how this country spends foreign aid. How convenient as you have spent billions on corporate welfare for decades. Don’t forget the 3.2 billion you spend on Israel every year McCarthy. You people are sick.
1342423128446824455 2020-12-25 18:53:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> To be clear, I believe mist of the people turning on Trump are doing so out of self interest.
1342287328048513025 2020-12-25 09:53:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> All Mitch cares about is political power and money. Nothing else.
1342235504331337728 2020-12-25 06:27:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Yan64212861 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump That really hurt Yan. Your acid wit is as sharp as a scalpel.
1342169590290391041 2020-12-25 02:05:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @tribelaw No one cares what Newt does or does not do.
1342156650099191808 2020-12-25 01:14:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Sadly, I predict that Trump will not veto the $600 Covid relief bill. I think it is all for show.
1342155504383107078 2020-12-25 01:09:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You lost a Trump. You are a failure as a President and as a human being. Time to face the truth. Biden will be sworn in in less than a month. Investigations will begin soon after.
1342017524934836224 2020-12-24 16:01:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> I hope you watch this video Donald. You need to face the truth.
1342016577521266688 2020-12-24 15:57:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> President Elect Biden. Is Trump and his cronies just going to walk away from all this? Is justice important anymore? What will be the consequences of this decision for the United States?
1342015599220838400 2020-12-24 15:53:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump and other members of this Administration must be held accountable for their actions. To not do so is a terrible mistake
1341892795175481345 2020-12-24 07:45:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> We have just begun a very long battle. Please get educated on the issues and keep voting.
1341891909875339264 2020-12-24 07:42:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TheRickyDavila Rick Scott made his money defrauding Medicare in Florida and then Floridians voted him Governor and then a Senator.
1341890363745832961 2020-12-24 07:36:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @dad_darius @donwinslow @realDonaldTrump I have wondered the same thing.
1341890129221332999 2020-12-24 07:35:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Doesn’t matter what you disagree with Trump. You lost the election and you are going to be kicked out of office into the waiting arms of Prosecutors on January 20th, 2021.

1341867073736232960 2020-12-24 06:03:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @FollowCN360 @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @GOP You are bluffing. You and your subscribers will never vote against Lindsey. I predict he will not take your threat seriously.
1341866126591012865 2020-12-24 05:59:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @To8Up @RepsForBiden @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump It’s going to politicians of both parties as payment for their vote. Congress is a disgrace.
1341865727024881665 2020-12-24 05:58:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Lindsey. You and I both know you have become Trump’s personal wh**e. What does he have on you Lindsey?
1341861526148423680 2020-12-24 05:41:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help us flip the Senate and vote for Ossoff and Warnock.

1341818538370224136 2020-12-24 02:50:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mmpadellan I hope it doesn’t go that way. I am getting numb to outrage.
1341731186633289728 2020-12-23 21:03:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @harrisonjaime He is a politician that will do anything to stay in office. I am sick of the these kinds of people that keep getting re-elected. What happened to “What’s good for America” instead of “What’s good for me and my constituents“. The current Covid bill is a good example of this.
1341687504781623297 2020-12-23 18:10:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LovePeace7711 @people4kam @Sensiablue @CNN The only reason I can think of is that it is too difficult to determine who is working and who isn’t. They could go through the states unemployment systems and disburse the money that way.

1341670355249885184 2020-12-23 17:01:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 It is amazing to me that you can say that after Trump has been able to launch a nuclear strike for four years. That shows how differently we view this same man. Trump is insane. Biden stutters.
1341668829815066624 2020-12-23 16:55:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 There were plenty of elections in Republican controlled states where Biden won. Georgia is a perfect example. What are you talking about?
1341668191798513664 2020-12-23 16:53:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Haven’t you been asked to donate money to his fight to expose voter election fraud and overturn the election? He has raked in well over $200 million dollars to date and it turns out that he gets 75% of it and the Republican Party gets the remainder. Trump is paying his debt off.
1341556604190208008 2020-12-23 09:29:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is a fact. Christie is a dirty politician trying to pivot away from Trump and stay relevant
1341556119223865344 2020-12-23 09:27:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> What a complete hypocrite
1341537458811449345 2020-12-23 08:13:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> Sounds like Trump is getting frantic. We will be lucky if this maniac does not declare martial law.
1341536880693809155 2020-12-23 08:11:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> Republicans, did it ever occur to you that McConnell and his Republican allies in Congress are not looking out for you?
1341536302894895106 2020-12-23 08:09:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You managed to cause 320,000 unnecessary American deaths Trump. It’s always about you isn’t it you worthless POS.
1341535814073901062 2020-12-23 08:07:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I am going to push that you are prosecuted to the full extent of the law Trump. A person like you that would destroy this country to stay in power has to be made an example of. This would deter other future autocrats that would obviously be more intelligent than you are.
1341534124310454273 2020-12-23 08:00:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 He had a slip of the tongue. If that is your idea of evidence, it is laughable.

1341533258379632642 2020-12-23 07:57:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 I saw some of the “evidence” you say was on the news. Seashell, you have no idea what you saw.
1341532863100010496 2020-12-23 07:55:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Don’t start misdirecting Sea Shell. That’s what people do when they don’t have an answer. You sound like a person that is so agitated by non existent perceived threats that they can’t think straight.
1341531743984246785 2020-12-23 07:51:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 If I had no evidence I would not be going to court making frivolous claims. I would not be listening to a con artist that fooled a lot of gullible people and ended up in the White House. All he wants to do is stay in power. He also wants you to give him money.
1341530202564923393 2020-12-23 07:44:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 And how did I do that Seashell? Trust our elections systems? Accepting  the results of a Presidential Election just like I did in 2016? Explain how I set any precedent.
1341468626755481603 2020-12-23 03:40:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 So if we oppose martial law(not Marshall) then you feel you have the right to loot and burn because your man lost the election. I guess the ball is on your court. Go for it.
1341309932042416129 2020-12-22 17:09:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump This large percentage of voters you speak of has been propagandized by Trump and people like you Johnson, all with the aim of keeping Trump in power. Biden will be sworn in on January 20th, 2021.

You are not a seeker of the truth. You are helping Trump destroy this country.
1341307323193671680 2020-12-22 16:59:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump You are the worst kind of politician Johnson. The kind that would say and do anything in pursuit of political power and the worship of one imperfect man. You are a purveyor of conspiracy theories without evidence and are damaging this country’s faith in our elections. Disgusting

You will cause Trump to “win” again and embolden his supporters who will never be brought into the fold. You will also encourage future autocrats to rise.

1341154720182886407 2020-12-22 06:52:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Von_SlimGFA @peterdaou I understand, but if you look at what Congress has given working Americans trying to survive the pandemic in the last 9 months, it is terrible. It averages out to less than $5 a day. Canada gives their citizens $2000 a month and that’s continues until this coming June.
1341152794267553793 2020-12-22 06:45:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @sahouraxo @donwinslow Pelosi, face it. $600 is an embarrassment. Now maybe you couldn’t get any more out of those dirt bag Republican politicians, but why you would crow about this is beyond me.
1341150573693972480 2020-12-22 06:36:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Jeanne_Mann @donwinslow Trump will always be known as a traitor to his own country as well as an incompetent fool.

1341149309908246535 2020-12-22 06:31:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help these two candidates take back the Senate!
1341147617359740929 2020-12-22 06:24:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> The Republicans are trying to please the racist portion of their base.
1341147234554023936 2020-12-22 06:23:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is a great video that shows Trump as the con artist and carnival barker that he is. I hope some of his supporters watch this and finally realize what a fool this President has made of them. I don’t expect many of them to see the light though. They are too invested in Trump.  https://t.co/MsI5R3tCFY
1341081704241491968 2020-12-22 02:02:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LindaZArtist @lawindsor Gee, I guess since a person named Linda said that a couple she knows voted in 2 states, we should overturn the election. Give me a break.
1340982635821223937 2020-12-21 19:29:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> There is no doubt in my mind that this needs to be done if we want to secure our present form of government
1340981480638599168 2020-12-21 19:24:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> Rand Paul has stated what the Republican Party has focused on for many years. They want to limit voting in a Democracy. Does this sound like an autocracy where the power is in the hands of a few?
1340964430994128897 2020-12-21 18:16:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RandFanshier @senatemajldr Why should I believe your conspiracy theory? For it to be true, there would have had to be collusion among many of the Republican and Democratic states elections supervisors and judges up to the Supreme Court. It’s more likely Trump hates losing and made unsubstantiated claims.
1340946731488436224 2020-12-21 17:06:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Elisa_freedom @senatemajldr You have no evidence of any of what you say. You are just another deluded supporter parroting what Donald Trump says. Trump is a symptom of the real problem which is American voters like you.
1340945952593629187 2020-12-21 17:03:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @truckster1 @senatemajldr You are delusional Truckster and only care about yourself. Now come out and admit you don’t give a damn about the 320,000 Americans who died from this virus. Grow up and wear a mask during a pandemic.
1340944517827072000 2020-12-21 16:57:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> Why do people vote him back into office? It’s something I will never understand.
1340944092142907398 2020-12-21 16:55:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> McConnell, you miserable SOB.
1340943752089792515 2020-12-21 16:54:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @senatemajldr McConnell, your words are empty and you have completely failed the American people in their hour of need. You will give billions to corporations and you have literally given nothing to the average working American. So far, you have given them around $5 a day. You bastard.
1340823271869132802 2020-12-21 08:55:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is a great question.
1340822529255075842 2020-12-21 08:52:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> Why do we keep voting these politicians back into office?

You have created a monster of disinformation, racism and authoritarianism and you are destroying our country. I know you don’t care because you only care for yourself.
1340808156943953923 2020-12-21 07:55:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Your the “dumbest” person in this country Trump. The proof? 320,000 American deaths from Covid and an economy in shambles. Worst President in American history and also a traitor to his own country.
1340806430526500869 2020-12-21 07:48:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump It was your fault Trump. Your incompetence, stupidity and selfishness caused 320,000 Americans to lose their lives and the nation’s economy to crash.
1340654749876678657 2020-12-20 21:46:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> When do people start being charged with sedition?
1340636718710607874 2020-12-20 20:34:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @miltsdad They believe they are a privileged class of Americans and we keep voting them in office.
1340601442541907973 2020-12-20 18:14:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Unless you give some compelling evidence that the election is being “stolen” it is just just irresponsible claims. If the shoe was on the other foot, as it was in 2016, you would demand evidence and so far you and the Trump team have utterly failed to do that.
1340595116038303744 2020-12-20 17:49:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 It’s not rioters that are a threat to this country. It’s people like you and the Proud Boys, because you want to overthrow a legitimately elected government and neither of you know what will come next. Americans will destroy their own country, it won’t be done from the outside.
1340584294029295616 2020-12-20 17:06:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Not when they are baseless. Trump’s lawyers were careful not to claim election fraud because they did not want to be disbarred
1340583758643290113 2020-12-20 17:04:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Yes, there were protests and riots over police killings. Does that mean the whole country rioted? No. I suspect the next unrest will come from Trump supporters trying to overturn an election, which you sound like you would support. What’s the difference?
1340583109125951490 2020-12-20 17:01:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 You sound like a lunatic screaming about burning cities, What do “burning cities” have to do with the election? Biden is a candidate,  not a usurper and you can thank the Republican Party and the Supreme Court for the obscene amount of money in our elections.
1340581891842469888 2020-12-20 16:56:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 If you are referring to election observers, you would be wrong.     https://t.co/TSCPej8P06
1340579126361677825 2020-12-20 16:45:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 You and I both know that you do not have direct knowledge or evidence of any of what you stated. So what do you and other Trump supporters plan to do with your suppositions and suspicions? Overthrow the government? The problem is not Trump. It’s his supporters.
1340463197632000001 2020-12-20 09:05:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is a very dangerous moment in our history. We have a mentally unstable President that actually thinks he won the election toying with the idea of martial law.
1340451602000474114 2020-12-20 08:19:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Biden sounds a lot more rational than Donald Trump. Trump actually believes that he won the election. Imagine that. I have more confidence in a cucumber as President than Donald Trump. The man is a mortal threat to this country and Trump World can’t see it.
1340448696593510400 2020-12-20 08:07:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 You know, it’s coincidental that Michael Flynn suggested the same thing to the President the other day. It wasn’t because of chaos in the streets though. It was to overturn the election. Both of you are toying with a civil war in this country.
1340447443738107904 2020-12-20 08:02:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Where is all this rioting and violence in the street? Where is your evidence that the fabric of our society is falling apart and we need to use a solution of last resort to save the country? I don’t believe you have any idea about the gravity of what you are suggesting.
1340445085511651330 2020-12-20 07:53:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 You are starting to sound like your dear leader. He said exactly the same thing and he is a pathological liar.
1340444801892806656 2020-12-20 07:51:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 I am not worried about that. I am worried about a sizable portion of the American Electorate throwing away our republic for a severally damaged human being with dreams of being a king.
1340431427234635781 2020-12-20 06:58:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump. A horrible human being.
1340410069779963908 2020-12-20 05:33:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @OANN Coming from a severely damaged human being and a pathological liar that’s pretty funny Trump.
1340355406347026439 2020-12-20 01:56:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You don’t have enough brains to even follow a briefing Trump. Most people realized a long time ago that you were a Russian asset so spare us the bullshit.
1340354805018062850 2020-12-20 01:54:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AZGOP I always thought he was known as private bonespurs. Face it. This bastard is a severely damaged human being who has done more damage to this country than any other president in US history. This all thanks to his brain dead supporters.
1340335569537294336 2020-12-20 00:37:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate Trumpism is a cult full of uninformed extremely gullible people who would make Trump a King over this country if they could. Trump is a symptom. This portion of the American electorate is the cause and a threat to the nation.
1340334247211651075 2020-12-20 00:32:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump They only way they will be weak fools is if they follow you Trump. These politicians and most other thinking people know you will be out of office and fighting charges against you in a month. Why would they hang on the cross with you. You are a delusional idiot.
1340333275001348097 2020-12-20 00:28:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @NYPostOpinion What do I care about the NY Post Opinion?

1340313022439501828 2020-12-19 23:08:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> Devin Nunes  is a good example of why this country is in the shape it’s in.
1340312020583919617 2020-12-19 23:04:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You and your Administration are a bad joke Trump, soon to be relegated to the trash bin of history.
1340311737426452480 2020-12-19 23:03:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @politico @realDonaldTrump It sounds like a bunch of fluff from the Trump Administration to try to show they actually accomplished something other than chaos.
1340266377316339713 2020-12-19 20:02:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @senatemajldr You are evil Mitch. To date you have sent out one series of $1200 checks to Americans suffering from job loss, eviction and hunger in the last 6 months and have given corporations billions. You have enabled this out of control President to run wild and delegitimized our elections
1340262111423959040 2020-12-19 19:46:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @maleknay @realDonaldTrump Because he is a narcissistic conman who lies constantly, allowed the pandemic to kill over 300,000 Americans and is causing many in this country to distrust our election system without any evidence. He is the most destructive President this country has ever known. I hate the man.
1340255702762332161 2020-12-19 19:20:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MerrillLynched @realDonaldTrump Means that he wants to start a civil war as he goes out the door. There is also the donations he is raking in.
1340255389691105281 2020-12-19 19:19:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @CrockyMcBeef @thebr0keb0i @realDonaldTrump You have been completely conned for four years Crocky. Wake up. Your man lost.
1340253890516840451 2020-12-19 19:13:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @kyungai @realDonaldTrump Is this supposed to be some type of evidence?
1340253192530083841 2020-12-19 19:10:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump will fail.
1340252983771230209 2020-12-19 19:09:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @kido730730 @realDonaldTrump Where are you from and do you have any say in an American Election?
1340251964358225921 2020-12-19 19:05:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @maleknay @realDonaldTrump What makes you think Trump had anything to do with any of it? Because he is President? He could be a squalling baby in a diaper and the government would have made it happen. The problem was, he did absolutely nothing and 320,000 Americans have died. He is unfit for office.
1340250686324420608 2020-12-19 19:00:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @calves990 @realDonaldTrump I have thought about doing that, but I have become addicted to telling Trump what a POS he is.
1340250137445212165 2020-12-19 18:58:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @skifflegirl @realDonaldTrump Noble words that mean absolutely nothing.
1340249773891350529 2020-12-19 18:57:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @sSky85 @realDonaldTrump And you know all of this how? I say you know nothing and are just parroting Trump. You supporters are bunch of mindless sheep following a conman who doesn’t give a damn about you. It’s a sad spectacle to watch.
1340248429839212544 2020-12-19 18:51:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TheOldeBallgame @realDonaldTrump I say God doesn’t care about your politics. He cares about how you treat your fellow man.
1340096626220802048 2020-12-19 08:48:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA You wouldn’t understand integrity in elections Trump. All you care about is money, power and being re-elected. You are out the door in a month sucker. There are some prosecutors that want to talk to you.
1340094010967384067 2020-12-19 08:38:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @kylegriffin1 The Republican run Senate is bunch of worthless politicians whose primary goal is to stay in office. The government we have is not working for the people under stress in this country. They are useless.
1340093269275979776 2020-12-19 08:35:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @oliverdarcy @svdate @LouDobbs Dobbs is a partisan hack, not a journalist
1340092535704829952 2020-12-19 08:32:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump’s actions since the impeachment trial confirms that the Republican Senate has been complicit with this President’s criminal behavior from the beginning.
1340084149428887552 2020-12-19 07:58:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AdrienneLaF @PeterAtlantic I am not buying it John Kelly. They knew what Trump was and the deaths he was causing by his refusal to address the pandemic. They knew he was contemptuous of the Constitution and they knew about the corruption in the White House. They should have resigned in mass.
1340075852222980096 2020-12-19 07:25:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Bevy63 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump He didn’t handle it at all. Said it would just disappear. Denied it was a problem. Downplayed it. No one could have done a worse job the Donald J Trump.
1340074744436174850 2020-12-19 07:21:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> I am disappointed that Trump has been a Russian asset for who knows how long.
1340071346404020224 2020-12-19 07:08:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> Amazing
1340070035763716101 2020-12-19 07:02:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Israel gets 3.2 Billion dollars in security aid annually. The only country that gets more than that from the taxpayers in this country is Afghanistan and there is a war going on there. Were you complaining about Israel or just any other country?
1340059382390935554 2020-12-19 06:20:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 The difference between you and me is that I give a damn about that 1%. It’s actually closer to 2%. It sounds like anti maskers and Trump supporters are sociopaths.
1340057770691862529 2020-12-19 06:14:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BeatriceofEste @Kenny_Sowellfan @realDonaldTrump Over 300,000 dead in this country. America shouldn’t have anything to say about other countries.
1340057051335110661 2020-12-19 06:11:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 That’s funny. He sure as hell isn’t letting Georgia run their own elections, is he?
1340056767586299904 2020-12-19 06:10:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 People were dying, there was no where to put the bodies and the dead were being buried in mass graves. What would you have done? Call for herd immunity?
1340056199690137601 2020-12-19 06:07:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 You have no idea what is essential or nonessential. You as nd your fellow supporters live in a fantasy world.
1340055906868981760 2020-12-19 06:06:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 He’s not my man, but he will be President on January 20th, 2021. It will be so nice to not have a narcissistic conman who lies constantly in the White House. I am sure a lot of Trump supporters are choking on that, but remember what you told us in 2016. “Get over it.”
1340055050329206785 2020-12-19 06:03:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Admit it. You believe in QANON and Santa Clause.
1340054730656116736 2020-12-19 06:01:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 So you are for implementing marshal law? Do you have any idea how that would turn out? Are you even sure we would have a Republic left? People like you are dangerous to a democracy because they would follow one imperfect man straight to hell.
1340053932765302784 2020-12-19 05:58:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 In the 2016 Presidential Election we basically had the same voting systems in the states. Democrats were aghast that so many Americans would vote in a complete conman and idiot, but they did not call our country’s entire election a fraud. What changed?
1339949755212963840 2020-12-18 23:04:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @odonmycoacoa @AnthonyFromLI @realDonaldTrump He may be talking about martial law. Some of our uneducated American citizens are calling for that.
1339949178752028673 2020-12-18 23:02:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @hcraig0062_h @realDonaldTrump You and Trump’s other supporters are  gullible, deluded and misinformed. That right there is the root of this nation’s problems.
1339948197129678849 2020-12-18 22:58:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Kenny_Sowellfan @realDonaldTrump Reagan was wrong. It works in Western Europe.
1339947906439278594 2020-12-18 22:57:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> Is this what our country has come to? We as a nation have lost our integrity, principles and values and this is the result. Getting rid of Trump is good but the root problem is still there.
1339944472688402434 2020-12-18 22:43:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BuckSexton @realDonaldTrump Just come out and say it. You want us to ignore a pandemic and act like everything is fine. It’s respiratory spread by droplets and there is plenty of evidence that masks do limit that. You couldn’t find your way out of a paper bag much less a pandemic.
1339942699420569600 2020-12-18 22:36:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BuckSexton The most dangerous people during a pandemic are people like you who are either incredibly stupid, don’t give a damn about their fellow citizens, or have a self serving agenda they are promoting. Which one are you Bucky, or is it all three?
1339941372296638464 2020-12-18 22:31:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr You are right about that at least Trump. Since you came on the scene and fooled a lot of extremely gullible people, the Republican Party has all but disappeared and has been replaced with Trumpism. Call it what it is you worthless POS.
1339940612750135299 2020-12-18 22:28:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Correction. In this country at least, it is known as the Trump virus.
1339940325809291265 2020-12-18 22:27:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Probably because he is not a conman and a criminal like you.
1339898992596037632 2020-12-18 19:43:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> It won’t be long before there will be no Republican politicians with any integrity. Trump is a symptom, not the source of the problem. The problem is our fellow Americans
1339876051770552320 2020-12-18 18:11:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SenTomCotton Hey Cotton. You are simply a partisan hack leading a group of right wing Seditionists. You are no patriot and politicians like you will ultimately lead us to an autocratic government.  There is obviously nothing more important to you than political power.
1339869427735605248 2020-12-18 17:45:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews It’s always amazing to hear you put down men like John McCain who loved his country, joined the military, was shot down and tortured for years in Vietnam and who became a US Senator with integrity. This from an entitled rich kid and a selfish coward who lies constantly. Pathetic
1339767694393008128 2020-12-18 11:01:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> Flynn is an American traitor walking free and promoting sedition. Let’s say you do institute martial law. Who will take and keep power? No one knows.
1339764088696676352 2020-12-18 10:47:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @GenFlynn Sedition.
1339763472113000448 2020-12-18 10:44:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You sound desperate Trump. Tuberville is not going to save you. You are done.
1339742765522046978 2020-12-18 09:22:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> Politicians like this are what is wrong with this country. There are not many statesmen left.
1339730402907475975 2020-12-18 08:33:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump We put up with the last election and did not claim voter fraud. Did our entire nation’s election systems become corrupt in four years Trump? Only your most brainwashed supporters would believe that.
1339698821270519815 2020-12-18 06:27:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> Your own words have come back to haunt you Rubio. Any Trump supporter that watches this and can’t see that you are a sniveling coward is a complete idiot.
1339697517466927104 2020-12-18 06:22:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @wutingzy @marcorubio Yes he will. January 20th, 2021.
1339697037378539531 2020-12-18 06:20:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mallen2010 @JRubinBlogger @marcorubio If healing and unity includes Trump going to prison I am all for it. Otherwise, to hell with it.
1339688163053334528 2020-12-18 05:45:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> Donald Trump and is Republican allies in Congress are American Traitors. May they rot in hell.
1339686558375538688 2020-12-18 05:39:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> For heaven’s sake, vote that woman out! All she cares about it money, not people.
1339686171132239872 2020-12-18 05:37:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> I would love to see it. Why do people vote these dirtbags into office?
1339683968610951168 2020-12-18 05:28:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MattGertz This is just a cynical attempt to exploit Trump’s lies about alleged election fraud to boost ratings and make money. People like this don’t give a damn about this country and are a disgusting group of people.
1339681401592004614 2020-12-18 05:18:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> Congress gave billions to large corporations and we received $1200 in June. That comes to somewhere around $6 a day. I say the Republicans in Congress don’t give a damn about average working Americans losing their homes, being evicted or even having enough food to eat.
1339654128356745219 2020-12-18 03:30:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @reversechapter @marcorubio He can’t stand up to anyone because he doesn’t have a spine.
1339647236930723841 2020-12-18 03:02:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @marcorubio Many are a bunch of f*****s Rubio including you. You would sell out this country and your own mother to keep your Senate seat. You have literally kissed Trump’s a** after he continually insulted you and other Republicans missing a backbone . You are a disgrace.
1339645929851416576 2020-12-18 02:57:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> Rubio is a farce in every sense of the word. He is also a sniveling coward
1339644855383945220 2020-12-18 02:53:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are an idiot Trump, but you are good at conning millions of Americans with your BS.
1339638540892827651 2020-12-18 02:28:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @nypost This tweet is pure click bait. It’s only meant for people that have no idea what defunding the police actually means and have no intention of researching the issue. Typical for the NY Post.
1339633033331163137 2020-12-18 02:06:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> Purdue and Loeffler are crooks. Vote them out!
1339631030077157380 2020-12-18 01:58:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RudyGiuliani Giuliani, you were once someone that people respected, but now you just look like a drunken clown in a cartoon.
1339563806725423105 2020-12-17 21:31:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 The states each have their own election laws. Every state handled the elections according to their own laws. To make a blanket statement that it wasn’t done the same way last time is very simplistic. I don’t believe you have any idea how it was handled in each state.
1339534212278476801 2020-12-17 19:33:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 You know who is spreading the virus? It’s not immigrants. It’s all the AMERICAN idiots in this country that refuse to wear a mask during a pandemic. Guess who else wouldn’t wear a mask? The POS we kicked out of the White House.
1339497718176223232 2020-12-17 17:08:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RyanOak11600803 @theblaze You don’t even know if anything happened. Courts did not see it. You have been programmed to believe everything that lying POS in the White House says.
1339497107724578819 2020-12-17 17:06:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @theblaze @realDonaldTrump You stupid MF’s lost. Then Trump starts telling you there was fraud. You were fine with the last election because your guy won, but all of a sudden your guy lost and the whole system is full of voter fraud. Like you said last time. GET OVER IT! Trump’s sorry ass is out 1-20-21.
1339495362160189441 2020-12-17 16:59:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @steelersrule13 @tcarroll77 @theblaze @realDonaldTrump Then take it to court. Oh yea. You have done that already and you got thrown out over 50 times.
1339494967291604992 2020-12-17 16:57:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @snowcrash395 @theblaze @realDonaldTrump Once you go to martial law, you can kiss the Republic goodbye. You nor anyone else has shown any court  evidence of meaningful voter fraud, but you believe it because Trump said it.I have always said that you and Trump World were ready for an autocratic government under Trump.
1339379142782054402 2020-12-17 09:17:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> Incredible
1339378670209802242 2020-12-17 09:15:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> This arrogant bastard
1339378421147774976 2020-12-17 09:14:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> Why in the world would people vote Republican?
1339357923932336130 2020-12-17 07:53:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GovChristie @jonathanvswan This is a good thing for educating Americans about this virus, but Christie is nothing but a political hack. He just realized the political winds changed for Trump early.
1339356765721415682 2020-12-17 07:48:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is frightening and shows that in reality, the battle for the soul of this country has just begun.
1339356016232820737 2020-12-17 07:45:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @donnabraziIe I will be glad when they put you in prison and take your phone away from you Trump.
1339344065788317696 2020-12-17 06:58:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help these two men take back the Senate.
1339339672959512577 2020-12-17 06:40:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Evidently you are a QANON follower reduced to accusing anyone they don’t agree with of being a pediphile. Trumpism is people getting duped by a loud mouthed conman. QANON is people believing some bizarre conspiracy from some nameless faceless individual out there in the WWW.
1339337106779480064 2020-12-17 06:30:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Well, getting rid of autocratic ruler who is contemptuous of the Constitution is a good start. If you want to see Democrat’s get something done, help us make Mitch McConnell a minority leader. He is going to block every single thing Biden wants to do just like he did to Obama.
1339207055522062338 2020-12-16 21:53:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> Some people have no fear.
1339206149590175750 2020-12-16 21:50:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @gzornick @AOC The entire Trump Administration is full of grifters and dirtbags.
1339204428360978432 2020-12-16 21:43:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GaSecofState What can you say about those idiots running for the US Senate.
1339171571274035200 2020-12-16 19:32:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> I agree completely. The question is, does the Democratic Leadership feel the same way?
1339138553423523841 2020-12-16 17:21:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 I believe Steven Miller,  the racist senior advisor to the President came up with the idea to separate kids from their families as a way to deter immigrants from trying to cross the border. Not many people actually believe it was to protect them from coyotes.
1339134330145271809 2020-12-16 17:04:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 I would say the people in New York like Democratic run governments better that Republicans. Maybe Chicago’s crime has nothing to do with who is in charge unless you like police states. I would also say that you never did answer my question, probably because you have no answer.
1339132653262540801 2020-12-16 16:57:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 We have poll workers and election officials count the votes like we always have. As a whole, they try to be apolitical to avoid what we are seeing right now. Georgia’s election officials happened to be Republicans who were viciously attacked by the President and his supporters.
1339016966267432960 2020-12-16 09:18:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @xoxoPatrioticRN @wesrap @realDonaldTrump Biden will be President on January 20th 2021. Doesn’t matter what Trump had in Texas.
1339016384509054976 2020-12-16 09:15:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You lost using every metric there is because you are a loser Trump.  You have been a loser your entire life.
1338954677757620225 2020-12-16 05:10:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> I am glad Acosta have her some truth to think about.
1338951485946793984 2020-12-16 04:58:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC Donald Trump. His whole life is a complete fraud
1338904516947795974 2020-12-16 01:51:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich He is going to stop any meaningful legislation that the Biden Administration President put’s forward unless we win the two Senate seats in Georgia.
1338902072641654784 2020-12-16 01:41:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JasonSCampbell Ben, you can support one of the worst examples of a human being there is, you can be arrogant and rude and still be from Harvard Law School. That is no measure of a person’s worth.
1338890498220699651 2020-12-16 00:55:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Explain why there was no election fraud in 2016 when Trump won and now there is rampant election fraud since Trump lost? The entire elections systems in this country were corrupted in four years? Just maybe voters got sick of Trump’s chaos and incompetence. Is that possible?
1338888435684286464 2020-12-16 00:47:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 I’m not burning anything down. I follow the laws. The country followed the election laws in each state and the results were certified. Over 50 lawsuits and Trump won only one. The only reason appreciable election fraud is an issue is because Trump told you it was.
1338861570378539020 2020-12-15 23:00:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RealMattCouch @realDonaldTrump Instead of putting this “evidence” on social media, why don’t these Trump supporters ever present it to the courts? And why when they do present their evidence, do they get thrown out of court? Makes you wonder if everything they say is total bullshit.
1338840957643579393 2020-12-15 21:38:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JRehling Way to go Koppel. It’s time he heard some truth from a real journalist.
1338790296570703872 2020-12-15 18:17:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KMCRadio @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Has this evidence has been presented in a court of law? If it hasn’t, why not? Is the only reason we see this in Social Media because it would not stand up in court?
1338772145439203328 2020-12-15 17:05:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 What is really odd is that you are a hard core Trump supporter, but you don’t like kids in cages. You are obviously for stopping illegal immigration, but it is bad when Obama does it, but good when Trump does it. Sounds like Trump World is a crazy mixed up place.
1338771060876079105 2020-12-15 17:01:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 You are wrong about the claim that the Obama Administration had a policy to put children in cages. That was all Trump and Trump did it to please people like you.                                             https://t.co/qnszvSU0ZS
1338651823658459138 2020-12-15 09:07:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 They say that same thing in every election and people fall for it. Do you realize how difficult it would be take all the millions of guns away in this country? Put children in cages? Trump’s already done that. You sound scared about many things that are not going to happen.
1338635563683995648 2020-12-15 08:02:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BalordaZdravko @PauletteParis1 @realDonaldTrump I and I am going to believe your bullshit why? Just another moron on Twitter.

1338633495049084928 2020-12-15 07:54:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump They don’t realize what you are Trump. A man who would destroy this country to remain President and who is a Russian asset and traitor. A man who could care less about his supporters and uses them to increase his wealth and power. Your days are numbered and the clock is ticking.
1338560104166273024 2020-12-15 03:02:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Scrappy_Pro @StanGott DeSantis is an arrogant little Trump mini me. Took no action on the Pandemic, his handling of the coronavirus relief payments was a disaster and this Governor and the Republican Legislature ignore any Amendments Floridians add to the State Constitution.

That reason does not include just because you do not agree with a election result. You can still vote and make a difference. We just saw that happen.
1338547611226284033 2020-12-15 02:13:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow Will we ever be told what the purpose of the purpose of the hack was? I doubt it.

1338545973602250758 2020-12-15 02:06:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @marcorubio I think you’re religion is fake Rubio. You would say and do anything to stay in office. Trump always did own you “little Rubio.”

Try intimidating the National Guard or the Army using live rounds using those tactics. Why don’t you just vote?
1338425897418887170 2020-12-14 18:09:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA We have seen the cowardly sycophants of yours try to subvert our Democratic systems so they do not alienate your supporters. Some Republicans are not prepared to do that for you Trump.
1338278669740089347 2020-12-14 08:24:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> These two US Senate candidates, Ossoff and Warnock from Georgia need your help to flip the Senate from Republican control. This is essential for the incoming Biden Administration. Please support them with your time and money. Thank you.
1338265561776709632 2020-12-14 07:32:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump The clock is ticking Trump and you will be escorted out of the White House on January 20th 2021. I predict you will be hounded by prosecutors and you will spend your time trying to stay out of prison. I will enjoy watching the show.
1338238567655628802 2020-12-14 05:45:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump lies as easily as he breathes.
1338238224989376514 2020-12-14 05:43:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 I voted for moderate Democrats. There is nothing radical about them. You keep saying Fascists and when I gave you the definition it was closer to where Trump was leading us than to Biden. It would be more accurate to call us communists or socialists and that is even inaccurate.
1338236964496175106 2020-12-14 05:38:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 I could say the same thing about the Proud Boys.
1338236585452703744 2020-12-14 05:37:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @atrupar You do not speak for over half the electorate and I would strongly dispute that Trump was a good President and there was enough voter fraud to change this election.
1338195215744704520 2020-12-14 02:52:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Here and you thought that by nominating two SCOTUS candidates they were going to be loyal to you. You are a fool Trump. You actually thought they would just roll over and lose any independence to support your hair brained scheme to stay in power?
1338177075140845571 2020-12-14 01:40:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> Remember what all you Trumpers said about BLM and their violence? But this ok right?
1338167407387533314 2020-12-14 01:02:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> As far as I am concerned, the Republican Party doesn’t exist anymore. It’s been replaced by Trumpism.
1338166005193904128 2020-12-14 00:56:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump The most corrupt Administration in US history.
1338044892870832133 2020-12-13 16:55:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> I believe Trump needs to be investigated, tried, convicted and imprisoned. This idea of healing the country by giving this President a pass is a monumental mistake. The gesture will be completely lost on his supporters and viewed as a sign of weakness.
1337903958078218242 2020-12-13 07:35:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @rmayemsinger Because he is a Trump hugger. No other reason
1337903532075331595 2020-12-13 07:33:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @bluestein @donwinslow @ossoff I blame the narcissist in chief and his incendiary comments on the election.
1337902856091938825 2020-12-13 07:31:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump Let’s try something new Jordan. Let’s take no action, let everyone die who dies from the virus and then pretend everything is fine. I forgot. You and Trump have already done that. You are either a blithering idiot, or a cold blooded sociopath. I think it is the latter.
1337894276370411520 2020-12-13 06:57:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 A fascist is someone who supports or promotes fascism—a system of government led by a dictator who typically rules by forcefully and often violently suppressing opposition and criticism, controlling all industry and commerce, and promoting nationalism and often racism.
1337892680668418048 2020-12-13 06:50:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Trump’s latest attempt to overturn the election failed just as I predicted. The Supreme Court refused to hear it because he didn’t have standing. This would have to be the greatest conspiracy in history involving hundreds of people for it to be fraudulent. Trump simply lost.
1337844060736909313 2020-12-13 03:37:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I see your still throwing hand grenades on the way out Trump. You are a worthless human being much less a worthless President.
1337839128495448070 2020-12-13 03:17:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @toddstarnes Barr is a dirtbag and will be out of a job in January. Who cares if he’s fired? Guess it’s time to watch Trump World start eating it’s own. It’s all good.
1337837802046754817 2020-12-13 03:12:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @britektire @TalbertSwan @realDonaldTrump I say you would not know if you were fighting for God or Satan. How could you? You are fighting for you. God has nothing to do with it.

1337831791277862918 2020-12-13 02:48:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @derekmaltz_sr @realDonaldTrump Face it. That lunatic in the White House lost. It would have to be the mother of all conspiracies to have jurists all the way up to the Supreme Court to find no appreciable voter fraud. I think Trump conned you like so many other Americans.
1337830408512212995 2020-12-13 02:43:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Renato57628755 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump You do realize Trump lost the election and was a complete failure as President. Right now there are teams of investigators and state attorneys ready to lower the hammer on Trump just after he leaves office. Jeff’s not crying, just waiting for that blessed day.
1337772869766483968 2020-12-12 22:54:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MoneyBags7777 @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump I would hate him anyway. I just can’t believe people are stupid enough to donate to Trump’s legal fund where 75% of the money goes to Trump himself. There are a lot of dumb gullible people in this country, that’s for sure.
1337772087818276871 2020-12-12 22:51:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You don’t have much more time to lie to your supporters, by telling them the money they are donating goes to legal action to overturn the election. Most people know 75% of it goes to you to pay off your $400 million dollar foreign debt. You are not really a millionaire are you?
1337750098617503745 2020-12-12 21:24:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews @BrianKempGA You are not a man Trump, you are a spoiled little child. It seems like Twitter will not let me tell you what a pathetic dirtbag you are so I will miss that, but I will be looking forward to seeing you in a prison cell in the future. Just remember that I will be thinking of you.
1337724558481248258 2020-12-12 19:42:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> It is incredible that over a third of our elected leaders in the House and Senate support this assault on our election systems because they fear being voted out of office. What does this tell you about their fitness for these national positions of leadership?
1337723284864036866 2020-12-12 19:37:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> Can’t wait.
1337723177045274625 2020-12-12 19:37:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @semperdiced I would not listen to that fool.
1337722456623247361 2020-12-12 19:34:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @stephjantzen Yes, the same thing happened to a good friend of my wife who was a senior nurse. She had asthma and was 55 years old. She was recovering from the virus and hoped to get out of the hospital in a couple days. Then we got word that she had died.
1337716723315773440 2020-12-12 19:11:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You knew there was no basis for your claim of voter fraud Trump. You are the type of demented human being who would destroy our system of elections by convincing your fellow citizens that it is fraudulent and then fleece your supporters for money.
1337707787376340992 2020-12-12 18:36:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump No thanks to you Trump.
1337707693033873410 2020-12-12 18:35:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump We know you are a charlatan and a pathological liar Trump. You only care about money and power. You are a sick, twisted human being. Go to hell.
1337706964256755712 2020-12-12 18:32:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @DanPatrick No Trump. It’s because there are still some politicians and Jurists that are not afraid of you or your millions of deluded followers. They know right from wrong, truth from lies and good from evil. So do the 80 million Americans that saved us from a Trump dictatorship. Go to hell
1337588975205289985 2020-12-12 10:43:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Since we have seen the rise of the cult called Trumpism, I believe this country is headed for an Autocracy unless the American people wake up. We are primed and ready for America’s first dictatorship. Biden  may have won the election but the Trump movement is not just going away.
1337568397186437120 2020-12-12 09:22:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> Why can’t we be more like Canada?
1337544320468082689 2020-12-12 07:46:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> I agree. I have lived in this state over 40 years. Can’t wait to get out.
1337543736750911493 2020-12-12 07:44:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> I knew this man was an arrogant dirtbag the first time I saw his Trump mini me political ads. He is a younger version of Donald Trump. Hopefully he is a one term Governor.
1337541853827248128 2020-12-12 07:36:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> This country is in trouble. How can an adult be this stupid? Multiply that by millions.
1337534121694859264 2020-12-12 07:05:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> My opinion is that we HAVE to investigate Trump and his entire Administration. Otherwise other political leaders will rise to this level of corruption without fear of consequences.
1337533022644613121 2020-12-12 07:01:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is an excellent read and describes exactly what we are up against during the next four years. Bottom line, we are just at the beginning of a titanic battle. Gear up.
1337531383036727299 2020-12-12 06:55:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> I still say Donald Trump is a Russian asset. Constitutionally that is treason.
1337531002974056450 2020-12-12 06:53:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @EnchantedTrifle We need more people in this world like your dad.

Both Republicans and Democratic Congressmen were united in opposition to Nixon’s crimes during the Watergate hearings. Nixon had no choice but to resign.
1337527370023133185 2020-12-12 06:39:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You and your Republican allies already did. Besides, you won’t be around to do anything about Trump.
1337471331265359875 2020-12-12 02:56:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 I predict that the Supreme Court will throw Trump’s case out due to lack of evidence. Trump thinks that just because he chose two of them as candidates they will be loyal to him, but that’s not the way it works. Get back with me when this last ditch effort fails.

1337432226280116224 2020-12-12 00:21:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump That’s laughable Trump. You are the God Father of scandals and corruption. Don’t ever assume that the majority of people in this country are as gullible as your followers have been. It’s past time for you to face your future Trump. Courtrooms and a prison cell.

Who does that besides a megalomaniac? You did nothing Trump. Even worse you played it down. A lot of people died because of your incompetence. Many very smart people made it happen. Not you,  idiot.
1337368719643832322 2020-12-11 20:08:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> I dare any Trump supporter to watch this. It’s all video so there should be no doubt if it is accurate or not.

Levin will fail, along with all the other Trump sycophants.
1337365690739793920 2020-12-11 19:56:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ItsMattAllen Biden will be inaugurated on January 20th, 2021. Obama and Hillary are not going to jail. Trump may yet see the inside of a prison cell. You and your fellow supporters have been conned by Trump for money. He had over $400 million in debt and you have paid off about half of that.
1337355854929141760 2020-12-11 19:17:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> This tells me that these elected leaders are part of the cult of Donald Trump and have no business serving in Congress. They will be threat to our form of government for many years to come.
1337354005589209090 2020-12-11 19:10:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> If the Supreme Court actually did rule to throw out everyone’s ballots, there would be mass pandemonium. I just can’t see them doing that for many reasons. I don’t believe Trump thinks it will happen either. It’s just part of his money making scheme to fleece his supporters.

1337233155590381569 2020-12-11 11:10:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump What a bunch of unmitigated BS. The ultra right wing system which portions of Fox News was a part of regularly promoted alternative facts, fear and lies to give Americans a false sense of reality leading to the rise of Trumpism.
1337230328910413825 2020-12-11 10:58:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> I see no evidence that the Americans who voted Trump into office are going anywhere. They are still there, living in a denial of reality perpetuated by alternative sources of information. These people, unknowingly, will continue to be a grave threat to our country.
1337228336775499777 2020-12-11 10:50:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> Yes. It is an insane situation.
1337227955798413328 2020-12-11 10:49:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Nothing you say means anything, Trump. I think you are just trying give your supporters hope so they continue to send you money. What kind of monster does that?
1337159858840358913 2020-12-11 06:18:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> If any conservatives would like someone to blame for the lack of Covid relief from Congress I have  the man right here. Mitch McConnell.
1337155842597117952 2020-12-11 06:02:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You don’t have much time left Trump. You will lose the protections afforded by the Presidency and the wolves will begin to circle. I hope to see you in prison.
1337155000338935810 2020-12-11 05:59:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> Do not forget the Postal Service America! Keep pressure on Biden and Congress. This should be a bipartisan issue.
1337153462023413760 2020-12-11 05:53:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump It’s all going to catch up with you and you are going to face justice one day Trump. You have done more to damage this country than any man in our history.
1337151634175119362 2020-12-11 05:46:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> I agree but I want to see that madman in prison as well.
1337150937564065797 2020-12-11 05:43:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> Isn’t that nice Rudy. I’ll bet you never have thought to all the people who died from this virus scared and alone. You are a disgusting creature.
1337150454082514946 2020-12-11 05:41:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> Cruz and Graham are two of the slimiest cowards I have ever seen. You would think a US Senator would have to have some integrity or principles, but not these two. Trump has something on them and they would sell their own country out to keep their jobs.
1337113209225043970 2020-12-11 03:13:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> They have become a group of people who would applaud American’s slide into an autocratic government under Trump because they care more for their status and power than they do for their own country. That is a traitor in my book and always will be.
1337090871624396801 2020-12-11 01:44:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC We take no action against the pandemic in this country and even deny it’s a problem under the Trump Administration. A large part of the American population won’t even follow simple CDC guidelines to try to limit the spread of the virus. And now we demand to get the vaccine first.
1337079377717288961 2020-12-11 00:59:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Pathetic Trump. Take it to court using your deluded supporters money.
1337078947339702272 2020-12-11 00:57:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @OANN No Trump. It was being stolen and now it’s not. The maniac’s reign of chaos is over.
1337078538864824322 2020-12-11 00:55:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump It is a dangerous period in our history Trump. The sooner you are forced out of office, tried, convicted and put in prison the better.
1337077545032962052 2020-12-11 00:51:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Are you listing character traits that you don’t have Trump?
1337076540362928129 2020-12-11 00:47:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> Everyone on this list should never have been voted into office. They are a bunch of traitors.
1337057545157046273 2020-12-10 23:32:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump needs brought to justice
1337056624477954053 2020-12-10 23:28:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @WajahatAli When will he be held accountable? I do not think going easy on Trump in the interest of national unity is the way to go. Trump supporters will not change their views either way and  not bringing Trump to justice will only encourage future autocratic governments.
1337053961145233415 2020-12-10 23:18:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> Help them out folks.
1337053479953715205 2020-12-10 23:16:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump That has nothing to do with you or your chaotic Administration Trump.
1336959660444831745 2020-12-10 17:03:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> The election results are clear. These state governments should br held accountable for these actions.
1336959120637915137 2020-12-10 17:01:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> It’s true. Trumpism is not going away just because Biden won.
1336957975026659329 2020-12-10 16:56:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @riotwomennn @donwinslow I’m from Florida. We don’t make good decisions either.
1336957148950093824 2020-12-10 16:53:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @nypost @TuckerCarlson Are you a man, or a spoiled little child Trump? By your words and deeds, I say the latter. You are a complete embarrassment to the United States of America.
1336842553346416641 2020-12-10 09:17:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You have lied for four years Trump. Why would anyone believe anything you say now?
1336842130422161415 2020-12-10 09:16:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump. You are a loser in every way a person could be. You will fail in your quest to remain President. On the other hand, maybe you are just play acting to continue to fleece your supporters.
1336841138125287424 2020-12-10 09:12:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> These Pennsylvania Senate leaders are miserable cowards that put their political futures above their own country. Everyone that signed that letter should resign. What a disgusting spectacle to watch.
1336831817421352960 2020-12-10 08:35:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump None of that means a damn thing Trump. You have been fired by the American people and your last day is January 20th.
1336798831053316097 2020-12-10 06:24:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> Why didn’t this same scenario happen in 2016? Because Democrats all knew it was a colossal mistake to vote Trump in, but respected our election system enough not to attempt to go to court over the outcome. TrumpWorld is fighting the results tooth and nail because they are a cult.
1336792164479676418 2020-12-10 05:57:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @GovRonDeSantis He is also incredibly arrogant and is a Trump junkie.
1336791954517090305 2020-12-10 05:56:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 When you take your “evidence” to an impartial court of law and get a judge to agree with you, then I will take you seriously. In over 40 cases, no judge has heard any evidence that supports the idea of enough voter fraud to change the election. Biden will be sworn in to office.
1336747183555686401 2020-12-10 02:58:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> I would have to say that these Pennsylvania lawmakers are a bunch of damn cowards. Resign now because you don’t have what it takes.
1336744621205053441 2020-12-10 02:48:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @CSpike69 @peaceful09 @ReallyAmerican1 Not even giving Obama’s SCOTUS pick a hearing a year before the 2016 election and ramming through Trump’s SCOTUS pick 3 weeks before this past election. Now Trump has been actively encouraging SCOTUS justices to rule for him on the election fraud issue. Trump is out of control.
1336634743593570309 2020-12-09 19:32:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help these two Georgia Senate candidates win their elections with your time and money in January and flip the Senate. Otherwise, McConnell will block everything Biden tries to do just like he did with Obama.
1336613470721232898 2020-12-09 18:07:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> We need to win back the Senate. Please support Ossoff and Warner in their Georgia special elections in January with your time and money.
1336597272730214402 2020-12-09 17:03:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump pardoned a traitor to this country and Trump himself is traitor to this country. Nothing to see here but this President’s continued corruption. His entire four years in office has been a disgrace.
1336595339751673857 2020-12-09 16:55:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Strandjunker I would like to know. Will it ever come out?
1336594981969072129 2020-12-09 16:54:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> He will be out of office in January 20th 2021. I hope people remember this disgrace in 2024 if he runs again.
1336488239687929858 2020-12-09 09:50:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MajorPatriot So what planet are you on major?
1336487167221260288 2020-12-09 09:45:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Acyn You used to speak your mind Lindsey. Now you appear to be Trump’s personal piss boy. He must really have some dirt on you and your buddy Cruz. You are a disgrace to your country, your office, and to yourself.
1336482492824621056 2020-12-09 09:27:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA You want to talk about losers Trump? You are down by over 7 million votes in November’s election. All you are is mouth, pride and stupidity. No wonder you got your ass handed to you.
1336481783588777985 2020-12-09 09:24:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate I guess we are supposed to believe what I guess is supposed to be your evidence? Don’t think so. Go to court with your paragraph and see what happens. What do you have to lose?
1336480334192513024 2020-12-09 09:18:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Jim_Jordan Did anyone ever explain to you that you are a complete moron Jordan? You could not find your way out of a paper bag, much less a National emergency.
1336455239780741123 2020-12-09 07:38:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate Who does that? A power hungry sociopath without a conscience who has no loyalty to the country of his birth or his fellow citizens. A real human monster.
1336453449446289408 2020-12-09 07:31:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help these two Democratic Senate candidates win their races in January. Without them flipping the Senate, we will never make the changes so desperately needed in this country.
1336451881900642304 2020-12-09 07:25:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GovKemp Governor Kemp. You did not succumb to pressure from Trump and his supporters to attempt to change the Presidential election outcome in your state, but why are you trying to suppress the vote in Democratic areas in Cobb County by allowing them to reduce polling stations there?
1336446390709448706 2020-12-09 07:03:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @berralaw @brithume I do not have any faith that Trump would have “gone big”. McConnell is good at shoveling money to big corporations but is miserly when sending direct payments to working Americans. $1200 in 9 months. As far as I know there are no direct payments in this latest Covid package.
1336444089701720064 2020-12-09 06:54:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @brithume @RPBradley1 We have an autocratic narcissist as President who let a pandemic run wild and who is now destroying people’s faith in our Democratic  institutions. Trump is fleecing his supporters and throwing hand grenades on his way out. Who do you think we should be watching Brit?
1336377751784353795 2020-12-09 02:30:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Poll numbers mean nothing Trump. Integrity means everything and it’s something you do not possess in any shape or form. You are a one term loser Trump and it had nothing to do with voter fraud. You lack every attribute needed to be a successful leader.
1336376210767695878 2020-12-09 02:24:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I have an idea Trump. Let’s put any bills off until your sorry *ss is out of office in January 20th 2021.
1336273056717803524 2020-12-08 19:34:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> I am pretty sure this is all to pay off Trump’s debt using his supporters donations to do it.
1336250403571310593 2020-12-08 18:04:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> This man here was the architect of confrontational partisan government in the 90’s along with the rise of Fox News. Politicians can make a country great or destroy it. As a nation, we have chosen the latter during the last 20 years.
1336248885078093826 2020-12-08 17:58:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA @GeoffDuncanGA @sendavidperdue @KLoeffler What President attacks his own country’s democratic institutions without any evidence and tries to interfere with state voting systems? That would be a narcissist who would say and do anything to stay in power and enrich himself using his own supporters to accomplish that.
1336121158429794307 2020-12-08 09:31:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> TheFems are not coming for your guns. It would be impossible to find them all. Besides, it would be much easier to stop the production or importation of ammunition than to hunt down your weapons. It would make your gun a lousy club.
1336119088108752896 2020-12-08 09:23:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> McConnell and many other Republican leaders are some of the most cold blooded people I have ever seen, and half the American Electorate keeps voting them back into office.
1336117845239926786 2020-12-08 09:18:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> I have become numb to this President’s selfish and sociopathic behavior because I have watched it for four years, but I am outraged that there are people in this country that view him as a great leader. Did your parents teach you nothing?
1336076161332342784 2020-12-08 06:32:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RadiumLovesIt @JAderholt @marklevinshow I live in Florida where Trump won and you don’t have Democrat’s going to court arguing he won because of massive voter fraud. During the 2016 election there was very few Democratic claims of fraud and Hillary conceded in a couple days. Do you see a pattern here? What changed?
1336002444430598144 2020-12-08 01:39:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RadiumLovesIt @JAderholt @marklevinshow It’s funny that supporters like you believe every word that comes out of Trump’s mouth just because he says it. If you haven’t found enough evidence after 40 court cases, I would say you that you don’t have any. Biden will be sworn in on January 20th.
1335909538575364096 2020-12-07 19:30:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> Yes. Why did they give her a pass?
1335874664334241793 2020-12-07 17:11:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @marklevinshow After all the noise, false claims and wild accusations, in 45 days Biden will be sworn into office and Trump will have paid off his outstanding debt. Trump World has been conned.
1335872569812152320 2020-12-07 17:03:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KatherineofAra2 @marklevinshow So you don’t like news sources that state facts? Trump World is a cult.
1335872284809105408 2020-12-07 17:02:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RadiumLovesIt @JAderholt @marklevinshow Why have you never been able to prove any voter fraud in court? It’s all allegations that the President made to get you poor deluded supporters to pay off his debts. Easy
1335759517922045952 2020-12-07 09:34:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LeadersMaster I could label you as a corrupt Trumper who main goal is to enrich herself.
1335758599356895235 2020-12-07 09:30:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Rothbard1776 Why do people like you put these ridiculous claims on social media? Because you never had any evidence to back up your allegations after 40 failures in the courts.
1335757979472322560 2020-12-07 09:28:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Rothbard1776 @SidneyPowell1 No one cares Sidney. You are a wacko.
1335757585656516608 2020-12-07 09:26:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BradshawforTN @KLoeffler @ReverendWarnock Have you ever had a job Katie or have you been wealthy all your life?
1335756761341550594 2020-12-07 09:23:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> Help these two men win their Senate races with your time and money. We MUST win back the Senate or McConnell will block everything Biden tries to accomplish.
1335756199594242052 2020-12-07 09:21:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RealMattCouch If you could have convinced the people around him to wear masks he might have avoided getting it in the first place.
1335755312637292545 2020-12-07 09:17:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AndreRivola @newsmax @bennyjohnson Just maybe the answer to these questions is that the system worked exactly as it should have. Maybe you should just step back and stop believing every word that comes out of Trump’s mouth. He is trying to pay off his 400 million dollar debt by fleecing his supporters.
1335733381175398400 2020-12-07 07:50:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> If this country was actually attacked by a foreign power, I believe we would not stand together to confront the threat. There would be conspiracy theories flying around social media, denial of the basic facts and protests and rioting in the streets. This is what we have become.
1335729365905252353 2020-12-07 07:34:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is what happens when you elect an irresponsible child with delusions of grandeur into the office of President. He cannot be gone soon enough.
1335721766476505088 2020-12-07 07:04:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @therecount After Trump as President there is nothing shocking, nothing out of bounds and no accountability for people that would say or do anything to stay in power.The pursuit of power has become more important than respecting our Democratic norms and our elections.
1335713535901528065 2020-12-07 06:31:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jrosen1033 @ScottAdamsSays Could it be because there hasn’t been any perhaps?
1335713273560363008 2020-12-07 06:30:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ScottAdamsSays Why do you go to social media begging the news media to investigate? The Justice Department found no evidence and Barr is Trump’s personal whore. Multiple recounts only added to Biden’s lead. Every court case except one has been thrown out. Go to court if you have evidence.
1335709715792338944 2020-12-07 06:16:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani He’s a drunk. You are not a good judge of character Trump. You actually think you are a great president.
1335709310840692739 2020-12-07 06:14:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls What is your answer Kellyanne? Act like everything is normal and watch more Americans die? We have tried that for the better part of a year under that dolt you call a President and everyone can see the virus is out of control.
1335708299434528769 2020-12-07 06:10:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well said.
1335645291538747392 2020-12-07 02:00:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> I want you Trump supporters to ponder this.
1335645101838790659 2020-12-07 01:59:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @FoxNews @SandalsResorts I certainly will. Same thing with Home Depot.
1335566127104208903 2020-12-06 20:45:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> And this is the witness that all Trump’s supporters are resting their hopes on to overturn the election? Figures
1335544276974006272 2020-12-06 19:19:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @marklevinshow You can’t really believe what you are putting out Mark. I believe you know what he is doing and that is raking in millions from his supporters. He knows he will never overturn this election and so do you. Not sure what you get out of the charade you are promoting.
1335541838057508864 2020-12-06 19:09:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Acosta I appreciate your willingness to talk truth to power.
1335541420623532032 2020-12-06 19:07:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is true, but if he owns the Senate, who will act? Please make sure you support Ossoff and Warnock as US Senate candidates from Georgia and take back the Senate
1335540733906989061 2020-12-06 19:04:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mmpadellan Perdue, what a pathetic loser. Vote him out Georgia!
1335538915982368768 2020-12-06 18:57:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ossoff Perdue, you are total disgrace as a sitting US Senator.  You  and people like you are why this country is such a mess.
1335537882090643459 2020-12-06 18:53:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MielcarekSherry @christina_bobb @realDonaldTrump He is there to encourage you to send him money. Nothing more. Why would a self made billionaire want to to send him money? It’s because he is deeply in debt and needs you to bail him out. The money goes to him and not the effort to prove voter fraud. Look it up yourself.

1335535697260912643 2020-12-06 18:44:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @marnes @christina_bobb @EJanesSeminole @realDonaldTrump When will you realize that he doesn’t care about you or anyone but himself. He is out their drumming up his election fraud claims so you and his supporters send him money, and it is working! He is a full blown narcissist and that is what he does.
1335534533970685952 2020-12-06 18:40:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @defundthebidens @KerriOberhauser @christina_bobb @realDonaldTrump Please get back with us on January 20th 2021 to give an update on Trump’s status.
1335533234814324736 2020-12-06 18:35:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Campaigning for what? The power hungry lunatic lost the election. What he is doing is repeating conspiracy theories about election fraud so his supporters will still send him money. 207 million so far. If he was a billionaire as he claims, why would he need your money?
1335398705395097600 2020-12-06 09:40:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is so true and it continues to completely astound me. With an electorate like this, I don’t have much confidence in our future as a nation.
1335397937543860224 2020-12-06 09:37:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> I would like to know how this President has avoided any penalties as he tries to subvert our election system. The Republican Party has completely failed the country by abdicating their responsibilities to the Constitution.
1335396141794516993 2020-12-06 09:30:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @Yahoo Trump equals Chaos.
1335341577494007808 2020-12-06 05:53:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ESnohjon @BrianKempGA How many times does Biden have to win before you realize Trump lost the election? Trump’s problem is that he is unable to make wise decisions. If he would have responded to the pandemic instead of downplaying it he would have easily won this election. He is his own worst enemy.
1335340380397719558 2020-12-06 05:48:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @OurFlagFlysUSA @BrianKempGA Trump lost, get over it. We did.
1335339855270866950 2020-12-06 05:46:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> Republican politicians are scared to death of Trump’s base. Just wait until the QANON crowd starts threatening them.
1335337659846307843 2020-12-06 05:38:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @4nerdworld @tedcruz Agreed, but if we hadn’t killed off all their natural predators, there would be no need for hunting.
1335336801226141696 2020-12-06 05:34:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @tedcruz You aren’t tough Senator. You are a spineless coward. Ask Trump, he will tell you he owns you.
1335336463337205760 2020-12-06 05:33:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You better hurry up and grift these people Trump. Your free flights are coming to an end very soon.
1335335955499245568 2020-12-06 05:31:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Still giving your supporters hope so they will continue to send you money Trump? I would hate to be a man like you. You are the worst excuse for a human being I have ever seen.
1335302312731025411 2020-12-06 03:17:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mmpadellan Absolutely. I’m not a whiney little child like some people. I say to them, grow the hell up!
1335301811792560129 2020-12-06 03:15:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> Help this man win his Georgia Senate race in January’s special election.
1335301282324770822 2020-12-06 03:13:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please donate your time or money to help Ossoff and Warnock flip the Senate. Biden will not get anything meaningful done unless we make McConnell a minority leader.
1335300370743103488 2020-12-06 03:09:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @nitagale @Amy_Siskind And jailed
1335299530619760642 2020-12-06 03:06:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please, all of you voters in Georgia. If you are tired of the corruption of your two current Senators please register and Vote Them Out!
1335298447583440899 2020-12-06 03:02:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump It shows that there are only 25 Representatives or Senators that have any integrity or credibility left. The rest are cowards because they fear you and your cult. This is a very clear example of why are country is such a mess. Our elected leaders love money and power over country
1335197105590251521 2020-12-05 20:19:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> What we are watching is Trump throwing hand grenades as he leaves office. This is what happens when Americans vote in a malevolent, petulant narcissist as President
1335193538460594177 2020-12-05 20:05:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> Great video. Pretty much sums up the corruption these two candidates have been engaged in with a festive touch.
1335192622365863938 2020-12-05 20:01:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> We have been so preoccupied with the very real threat of an autocratic government under Trump that it’s easy to forget all the other devious things that the Republicans have been doing over the years.
1335191495935221760 2020-12-05 19:57:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are not talking about Republicans anymore Trump. You killed them off remember? You are speaking to the cult of Trump and cults are never good. Ever.
1335189857765904386 2020-12-05 19:50:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @Yahoo Is Donald Trump stupid, or this a vendetta against establishment Republicans? Either way, even with the Biden win, this sizable portion of the American Electorate is not going away. They have been indoctrinated and propagandized to vote for a charismatic autocrat like Trump
1335184030724141056 2020-12-05 19:27:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow One supporter tweeted that he had given $8000 toward Trump’s latest fundraiser.
1335118171045580800 2020-12-05 15:05:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> There has to be a massive housecleaning done when Biden becomes a President to root out and fire these Trump holdovers
1335116796832210945 2020-12-05 15:00:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AOC In the early 70’s I lived at home, worked a part time job, went to a local college, and had no debt. I believe instead of being institutions of learning, colleges have become profit centers.
1335116045678424065 2020-12-05 14:57:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JuddPDeere45 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse It isn’t real. The whole Administration is a corrupt money making machine for the Trump family.
1335115343614922752 2020-12-05 14:54:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @therealsunbunny @donwinslow I have read that they set it up in a way that it it is legal.
1335112267210297344 2020-12-05 14:42:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich Why do so many people vote against their own self interests? Republicans will let them starve and become homeless through no fault of their own and they will still vote for them. It’s because they control the information they consume.
1335111199093121024 2020-12-05 14:38:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOPChairwoman @nypost Coming from an Administration that did literally nothing to stop the spread of the virus, this tweet is ridiculous. Having no vaccine, social distancing and wearing masks is all we can do. If people will not follow those guidelines, lockdowns will be required.
1335109324041904129 2020-12-05 14:30:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @benshapiro Yes there is Ben. Sounds like there are many people in Georgia that feel that Perdue and Loeffler are elitist and corrupt and therefore do not want to vote for them. Both you and the President have said the system of voting in Georgia is corrupt. Why vote then?
1335026892521529344 2020-12-05 09:03:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mhdksafa Yes.
1335021029756985350 2020-12-05 08:39:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @OANN How would they know if they were Biden or Trump ballots?
1335018914061950979 2020-12-05 08:31:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help this man flip the Senate.
1335017184091725828 2020-12-05 08:24:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @HawleyMO @realDonaldTrump Trump, I think you know that you have no chance in hell to overturn this election and a combination of ego, greed and a desire to fleece your supporters before leaving office is driving your denial of the results. You disgust me.
1335013363798118403 2020-12-05 08:09:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help Georgia Senate candidates Ossoff and Warnock win their races with your time and money. Change history.
1334907785138610209 2020-12-05 01:09:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Seanlucas69420 @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump Remember in 2016 when Trump supporters were telling Democrats, “Hillary lost, get over it”? Well, Trump lost and Trump supporters should get over it. There have been over 40 lawsuits and Trump won one of them. Hillary conceded one or two days after the election.
1334829834330116098 2020-12-04 20:00:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, you are a National Security threat because you are a Russian asset. Fortunately you won’t be much longer. Not much damage you can do in prison.
1334816192398319618 2020-12-04 19:05:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RepSwalwell Yes. When you lose a good friend or family member to this virus it really hits home.
1334815639232516096 2020-12-04 19:03:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> The word MAGA will always mean a dark stain in America’s history.
1334814680100048896 2020-12-04 18:59:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @rogertansey I am in and have been for 9 months.
1334679833046114308 2020-12-04 10:04:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mkraju @ChrisCuomo That’s cause she body slammed the little wimp during a Congressional hearing.
1334679373996290049 2020-12-04 10:02:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> What an awesome couple.
1334678743198146561 2020-12-04 09:59:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ConsWombat @PitifulWaltz @weatherornot13 @ABC You know what.If people in general would wear a mask and practice social distancing, we would not have Covid numbers going up. You may still have to limit indoor gatherings, but you would not see total lockdowns like we are seeing in California. People are their own worst enemies
1334677406528004098 2020-12-04 09:54:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ConsWombat @PitifulWaltz @weatherornot13 @ABC First thing that came to mind was Trump’s re-election rally’s. I can’t speak for the specific COVID rules in place in Staten Island and maybe some are draconian, but without a vaccine, you have to have some sort of controls to stop irresponsible people from spreading the virus.
1334672483237163009 2020-12-04 09:34:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> I’ll bet Trump’s supporters wouldn’t see anything unusual in that action by the President.
1334671708314365953 2020-12-04 09:31:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @girlsreallyrule @donwinslow I believe there are many compromised elected leaders in Washington DC.
1334670710439092227 2020-12-04 09:27:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is REAL voter fraud.
1334669942839517185 2020-12-04 09:24:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @dougducey You are trying to grift more money from your followers as you get kicked out of the White House Trump. The only people that don’t realize this are your followers.
1334668956033036288 2020-12-04 09:20:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ConsWombat @PitifulWaltz @weatherornot13 @ABC Also, the ban on serving food and drinks indoors on Staten Island is directly related to the increase in the risk of COVID transmission indoors involving groups of people. There is less risk of transmission in outdoor gatherings.
1334665825693933569 2020-12-04 09:08:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ConsWombat @PitifulWaltz @weatherornot13 @ABC No I did not miss your point. You want to equate BLM and whatever Biden rally you object to, to COVID lockdowns all over this country. If local governments ban gatherings of people over a certain number, those two things you mentioned are covered by that ban so what’s your point?
1334654445590892545 2020-12-04 08:23:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> Hey Trump supporters! Here is some real voter fraud.
1334654094049501184 2020-12-04 08:21:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> Good point!
1334653996250828802 2020-12-04 08:21:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> Very true.
1334653660517818370 2020-12-04 08:20:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> Vote Ossoff and Warnock. Send this bum home.
1334648296405688328 2020-12-04 07:58:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> How do these self serving criminals stay in office? Vote for Georgia Senate candidates Ossoff and Warnock and kick the bums out.
1334645095816114176 2020-12-04 07:46:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @CrownDoyal @JimBodyguardMil @ABC I agree with you about Congress. They could have appropriated enough money to keep businesses open and working Americans in their homes, but they didn’t. That way, people could survive lockdowns and businesses would avoid bankruptcy. Other countries have done it.
1334641801458814978 2020-12-04 07:32:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate Why do people vote for a party that is not only fleecing them, but does not care about the interests of working Americans.
1334637975775440904 2020-12-04 07:17:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ConsWombat @PitifulWaltz @weatherornot13 @ABC Maybe the people in Staten Island were not following mask and social distancing guidelines and their COVID cases went way up. The only way to slow it down is to enforce those guidelines. BLM? Let’s see. Black people getting killed and this crowd wants a beer. Biden? MAGA rally’s
1334626987479068673 2020-12-04 06:34:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mmpadellan Awesome Dad. You should be proud!
1334625319328894978 2020-12-04 06:27:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @WileyAugie @EdwardJHiggins @ABC If you want to blame someone, blame our elected officials in Washington DC. They could have helped businesses and working people to survive, but all they did was during the last 9 months send a $1200 check to working people. Small businesses did not get the support they needed.
1334623963675287552 2020-12-04 06:22:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JimBodyguardMil @ABC You might as well have said you don’t want any actions taken to limit the spread of this virus.
1334623608765894657 2020-12-04 06:20:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SandiBen_ @ABC This is where our government should have stepped in and supplied the money to allow business owners and working people to stay home. Other countries have done it. Why can’t we?
1334622655555792896 2020-12-04 06:16:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @PitifulWaltz @weatherornot13 @ABC That’s totally misguided during a pandemic without a vaccine. Sure, their businesses are open as the virus sweeps through the population unchecked. Give me a break.
1334622036619120649 2020-12-04 06:14:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @erin112580 @OneMargaretx @ABC If Congress would get off their ass, we could do what other countries have done and pay people to stay home, but oh no. That’s socialism
1334621486393520133 2020-12-04 06:12:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Septembers_Song @ABC I agree. Americans have lost the ability to self discipline and to work together to address a common enemy, which in this case is the virus. Some actually want to reach herd immunity by letting the virus run it’s course without limits killing who it will no matter how many die.
1334594210138370054 2020-12-04 04:23:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Still trying to grift money from your supporters Trump? You don’t have a snowballs chance in hell of overturning this election and they still send you money like you were Jesus coming down from heaven. Didn’t you say you were a billionaire? Why would you need money from them?
1334537783986302977 2020-12-04 00:39:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump They only were concerned about what you wanted when you were a threat to them. Now you are 50 days out to being an ex president and they really don’t care. I am hoping the Dems have some balls and put you in prison.
1334536835033419784 2020-12-04 00:35:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA You don’t get to tell the Governor what do do. I know you wanted the job of First Dictator of the United States, but we fired you in early November. Remember?
1334535296382345216 2020-12-04 00:29:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @CncPatriot @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump I don’t think anyone cares
1334480254547660804 2020-12-03 20:51:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> Help these men win their Senate seats. You can change history
1334480079422894082 2020-12-03 20:50:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> I believe Trump and any other President who breaks the law should be prosecuted. They are citizens of this country just like the rest of us and should be treated as such. Doing otherwise will encourage future leaders to have contempt for the law and ignore them.
1334469045933002752 2020-12-03 20:06:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is bizarre. These attorneys are telling people not to vote and Trump is campaigning for them. This is Trump at his best. A master strategist and tactician.
1334468027602100225 2020-12-03 20:02:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> Does Mnuchin have any idea how incredibly stupid he looks right now? I am so glad she slapped him down like the punk he is.
1334466827011952640 2020-12-03 19:57:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @covie_93 That is an excellent question
1334458022706507779 2020-12-03 19:22:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> Mnuchin is an arrogant little twit and I enjoyed watching him squirm as Porter eviscerated him.
1334451478761791490 2020-12-03 18:56:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> Pence is nothing more than a political opportunist who is not concerned with anything other than staying in public office. This is much too common among our elected leaders in this country
1334449296394117120 2020-12-03 18:47:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MojaveLibby @SallySellers54 @SethAbramson Unless we win both Georgia Senate runoff elections in January McConnell will block everything Biden tries to do which is exactly what he did to Obama.
1334423186864214019 2020-12-03 17:04:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> Since Trump lost the election, Fox News is pivoting away from mindlessly supporting Trump to damage control. These people at Fox and Friends are responsible for the damage Trump has done to our country and thousands of COVID deaths, all in the quest for money and ratings
1334419940426838017 2020-12-03 16:51:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SethAbramson Republicans are losing control of the beast.
1334419444735635456 2020-12-03 16:49:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SethAbramson Maybe this is what is coming. Why else would Flynn say this? Not saying it will work, but it would show people the lengths Trump would go to stay in power

1334414564688007169 2020-12-03 16:29:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump If people realized that you are a malignant narcissist they would know that everything you do is for yourself. You could care less about anyone else, and it is extremely dangerous to have such a damaged human being in the White House. You need to pay for your crimes, Trump.
1334412828300742656 2020-12-03 16:23:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> You know what this shows me? Trumpism is self destructive and a movement of ignorance and chaos. They would spread this virus all over this country and let it kill who it kills and they just don’t give a damn. They will be the destruction of this country.

1334291744754704385 2020-12-03 08:21:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I wonder if you will ever stop running your lying mouth Trump. I may get my wish if you end up in a prison cell.
1334289734596751366 2020-12-03 08:13:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump They are as corrupt as you are Trump. Your supporters are gullible and blind to your malevolence.
1334289203140702208 2020-12-03 08:11:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Have you realized you have been complete loser your entire life and not just as President?
1334288574838091776 2020-12-03 08:09:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MeidasTouch @PressSec Yes and she reminds me of Disney’s evil Cruella Deville.
1334251343498850307 2020-12-03 05:41:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> Many of us had long ago come to the conclusion that Flynn was a traitor working for the Russians and this confirms it. Trump pardoned an American traitor
1334211929548713998 2020-12-03 03:04:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Brian_Nwaneri @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump @SenTomCotton Did you ever consider the possibility that you are completely wrong about everything including Graham’s granddaughter? You are convinced that Biden will destroy the country when actually Trump is doing that right now. Evidently you are not infallible.
1334098577354858497 2020-12-02 19:34:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @bblock29 A corrupt narcissistic President
1334078329935327232 2020-12-02 18:13:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> Does ANYONE believe that that email was just an innocent mistake or was it a fig leaf for corrupt insider trading? It was a contrived scam for the purposes of deniability.
1334022022494556160 2020-12-02 14:30:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump That is another of the thousands of lies you have told Trump. There are court filings that state that is exactly what was reported. I believe very soon you will attempt to pardon yourself as well as your family and associates.
1333940080864604161 2020-12-02 09:04:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Scaramucci He will claim he won the election for the rest of his life.
1333939299021180933 2020-12-02 09:01:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @harrisonjaime @ossoff @ReverendWarnock I am supporting both candidates financially. We desperately need to win back the a Senate. It will literally change our country’s history.
1333938758064992257 2020-12-02 08:59:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @va_shiva @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden For such a self described genius, it seems odd that you support a blithering idiot for President though I have to admit he is one of the world’s greatest conmen.
1333931091405778944 2020-12-02 08:28:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @cliftyhunt @abbierenn @realDonaldTrump @RealDrGina @RealAmVoice Clifty, Do you realize how large a conspiracy would have to be over multiple states and localities to pull off a Biden win if Trump had actually won the election? The Biden campaign would also have had to convince 40 plus judges to be sure to rule against Trump. It’s impossible.
1333927938459377664 2020-12-02 08:16:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TrumpVoterWTF @realDonaldTrump @RealDrGina @RealAmVoice I take this as sarcasm at it’s finest.
1333927277785096193 2020-12-02 08:13:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump @RealDrGina @RealAmVoice It’s full of pathetic tweets and mindless Trump worship.
1333923117970956288 2020-12-02 07:57:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> Yes! Trump supporters, Trump’s Attorney General has found no widespread voter fraud in the Presidential Election. Now you can asked for a refund.
1333922470613684225 2020-12-02 07:54:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Networkinvegas The simplest explanation is not some wild conspiracy theory, but that we are going through a pandemic which has repeatedly happened throughout history. Was the 1918 Spanish Flu a conspiracy? I don’t think so.
1333920810076168192 2020-12-02 07:47:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump supporters are getting fleeced by Trump, but will never admit it. It’s a sad spectacle to watch
1333920053197230083 2020-12-02 07:44:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> If we do not win the two Georgia Senate seats in January nothing will be done in regards to the crimes committed by the Trump crime syndicate on the Federal level or preventing these excesses in the future. The Republican Senate will block all of it.
1333918488545669125 2020-12-02 07:38:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @bonzoid @donwinslow Yes it does imply a crime was committed. Good point.              The point will be lost on his hardcore supporters.
1333848158758187008 2020-12-02 02:59:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @dtempleton_smb @MsRethaJones @thebradfordfile @SarahDeRosnay Or not allowing a President to bring up a SCOTUS nominee  for a vote 10 months before an election. Excuse? They said let the voters decide. Then ram their own candidate through 3 weeks before the next election. I say you do not know what packing a court is.
1333846726315307012 2020-12-02 02:53:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @thebradfordfile But will they let him tweet from a prison cell?
1333845696261320704 2020-12-02 02:49:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @gtconway3d @VP @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump It’s because it’s not politically expedient to do so. He put his ambition before his ethics and morals.
1333715609356529666 2020-12-01 18:12:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I’ll bet you do not know a thing about statistics Trump. You are a bumbling baffoon.
1333715222062837760 2020-12-01 18:11:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @matthewjdowd I agree. They will use the same playbook as they used against Obama. Trump isn’t the only person destroying our government
1333700296065867776 2020-12-01 17:11:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @april01974 @catturd2 That would be you.
1333700118814597120 2020-12-01 17:11:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mitchfraker @catturd2 I can understand why you believed every word Trump uttered.
1333699661702574080 2020-12-01 17:09:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @catturd2 @realDonaldTrump Doesn’t matter if you fought hard or not. No one cares. Bottom line, Trump the maniac will be out of office on January 20th and headed for a courtroom somewhere. You are a deluded and gullible individual like so many others.
1333698882061135878 2020-12-01 17:06:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump You lost. Get over it. Actually, it doesn’t even matter if you get over it.
1333697934794387457 2020-12-01 17:02:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @catturd2 @realDonaldTrump Says who? Are you someone I should listen to? I say, you have no evidence and neither does Giuliani. Nothing, NADA. If you did, you would have had at least one judge agree with you. Trump must be getting desperate if he has been reduced to retweeting Catturd.
1333578758603857925 2020-12-01 09:08:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TheRickWilson Anger without a brain.
1333578060038344705 2020-12-01 09:06:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @OANN @dougducey I have an idea Trump. Why don’t you encourage Trump voters not to cast votes for these bad Republicans. That will teach them a lesson they will never forget.
1333576763419582465 2020-12-01 09:00:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump No matter how many times you cry like a baby about this election, YOU STILL LOST.
1333576430941298691 2020-12-01 08:59:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate Gaetz, you are a moron. Doesn’t matter if most people that voted in person voted for Trump. Many people predicted that for months. What matters is that Trump lost the election, no matter how hard you try to spin it. Politicians like you are why this country is in such a mess.
1333575079511416834 2020-12-01 08:54:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Face it Trump. You are a loser. When are you going to get that through your head?
1333574727789588481 2020-12-01 08:52:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Only your most hard core deluded followers would believe that BS Trump. You are a narcissist and it is always about you. You live, breathe and think about YOU every minute of every day. You actually think you can change the outcome of this election? That means you are a lunatic.
1333573174382956550 2020-12-01 08:46:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @OANN @FoxNews Because they know you are a corrupt power hungry autocrat that will do anything to stay in power. They have created a monster they can’t control.
1333572688347062272 2020-12-01 08:44:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> This shows me how they plan on “working” with Biden. Obstruct everything he tries to do. We MUST win the two Senate seats that are open in Georgia and take control of the Senate. This election is not over.
1333564886459305987 2020-12-01 08:13:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 This is what happens when you place your complete trust in one imperfect man. You believe everything he says without question. If he tells you that the election was rigged you believe him with no evidence. That is what Germany was like during the rise of Hitler.
1333524781015199746 2020-12-01 05:34:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please register and make history by voting for the two Senate Democratic candidates, Ossoff and Warnock. You can make history by helping them flip the Senate.
1333523189893373956 2020-12-01 05:27:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> Like Loeffler would know about waiting on a paycheck. What a joke.
1333522459513991176 2020-12-01 05:25:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> Americans voted McConnell and his Republicans back into control of the Senate and increased their number in the House so I figure they are ok with this travesty.
1333478332776771587 2020-12-01 02:29:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @angeltoeveryone @Politics_Polls @YouGovAmerica @TheEconomist How would you ever know these are fake BS polls?
1333476931988287488 2020-12-01 02:24:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> Help these two candidates. You could change history.
1333475049878204418 2020-12-01 02:16:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SouthPoint1000 @bluestein Trump stabbed himself in the back, by downplaying a deadly virus because he did not want it interfering with his re-election campaign. I believe if he had taken decisive action he would have easily won the election. Now is reduced to begging elected officials to help him.
1333472789517504516 2020-12-01 02:07:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> If you want Biden to have a chance at a successful Presidency, please support Ossoff and Warnock who are Georgia’s Democratic candidates for the US Senate. If they do not win their races, McConnell will block President Biden at every opportunity, just like he did with Obama.
1333471752089980930 2020-12-01 02:03:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is not a strategist, he’s just a narcissistic moron.
1333470662061592581 2020-12-01 01:59:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help Georgia’s two Democratic  US Senate candidates to win the special election in January with your time and money. They are Ossoff and Warnock. You can literally change the history of this country and the world.
1333469067676692485 2020-12-01 01:52:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You sound like someone who is trapped and are ordering everyone to help you but no one is listening.
1333466816987992069 2020-12-01 01:43:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Maybe it’s because he doesn’t want to be part of your criminal conspiracy to overturn a free and fair election in his state. Just maybe you cannot corrupt that man like you have done with so many others. Personally, if I were him, I would just tell you to go to hell.
1333466131961683968 2020-12-01 01:41:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @9NEWSNANCY @realDonaldTrump @RandPaul There are at least 80 million Americans that you cannot include in your statement. You and your fellow Trump supporters have no way of knowing he won. There would have to be a conspiracy involving multiple state election officials and state and federal judges. Trump lost. Period.
1333405129626750978 2020-11-30 21:38:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> Everyone. Please help Senate Democratic Senate candidates Ossoff and Warnock with your time and money and take back the Senate. You will be literally changing history if they win.
1333401182270873601 2020-11-30 21:23:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> They absolutely will. Please help our two Senate candidates in Georgia win their special elections and flip the Senate. Ossoff and Warnock
1333399779561377792 2020-11-30 21:17:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please make sure you register and vote. Georgians can change history in this country.
1333399341202083840 2020-11-30 21:15:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TheRickWilson You are history Trump. Get used to the idea.
1333374635082207234 2020-11-30 19:37:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> Yes, and I am not surprised. That is what full blown narcissists do. Everyone but themselves are expendable.
1333372912607375363 2020-11-30 19:30:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LizRNC @SenMastriano They want you to think that they are defending our democratic institutions, but in reality they would destroy them in a bid to hold onto power. Previous generations of America would be appalled. We are ripe for an authoritarian autocracy.
1333372008458051585 2020-11-30 19:27:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mrreactionary This reminds me of the relationship between Trump and his hardcore supporters
1333352824571387906 2020-11-30 18:11:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> A glimpse of the mentality of some Americans.
1333352371422892033 2020-11-30 18:09:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow Why would Twitter remove these tweets? Maybe the author deleted them.
1333218890357346305 2020-11-30 09:18:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> Outrageous. This ought to tell us something about future relations between President Biden and any Republican dominated Senate.
1333217183338549249 2020-11-30 09:12:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump No Trump. Everyone doesn’t know it was rigged. You will be gone soon enough and will be fighting to stay out of prison the rest of your life.
1333204407077527552 2020-11-30 08:21:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GuardDo54627481 @katieappleseed7 You have every right to your opinion sir. You may one day turn out to be right.
1333200835006910469 2020-11-30 08:07:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GuardDo54627481 @katieappleseed7 Then I don’t blame you.
1333192962474434567 2020-11-30 07:35:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GuardDo54627481 @katieappleseed7 The government has lied to the American people many times, and Vietnam was the first lie that I remember. That being said, not everything from the government is a lie. You could take this line of thought so far that you would not be able to react to a real national emergency.
1333190975175454720 2020-11-30 07:27:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> Not only that but she supported Trump as he downplayed this virus. She did not have the moral fortitude to stand up to him.
1333188362644189193 2020-11-30 07:17:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GuardDo54627481 @katieappleseed7 The simplest theory about all this is we had a pandemic, like we have had in the past. Nothing more. You may not be able to contract this virus, but many of your fellow countrymen have. Does that matter to you, or are you the kind of person that is only concerned with themselves.
1333186576571129857 2020-11-30 07:10:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GuardDo54627481 @katieappleseed7 Whatever you want to do is fine with me. No one is indestructible though.
1333183259040157698 2020-11-30 06:57:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GuardDo54627481 @katieappleseed7 No it wasn’t. Approximately 8.7 million Americans had contracted the virus as of 8 days ago. I know people who have died of this virus. If you and your other conspiracy theorists don’t believe it’s real, feel free to go out and contract it, though you may regret that decision.
1333179493817720837 2020-11-30 06:42:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GuardDo54627481 @katieappleseed7 I just go by the CDC numbers and I don’t attempt to spin them.
1333171594353668105 2020-11-30 06:10:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help our two Democratic Georgia Senate candidates Ossoff and Warnock win their elections and take control of the US Senate away from Mitch McConnell. Otherwise, Biden will not get anything substantial done.
1333167954075279361 2020-11-30 05:56:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> To all you hard core Trump supporters out there. What the video. You will learn something about yourself.
1333166750058360834 2020-11-30 05:51:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> Where were these miserable cowards during the four years of the Trump Administration? Just watch. After Trump spent money like a drunken sailor, they will want to cut SS and Medicare.
1333165758013202433 2020-11-30 05:47:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @tired_fighting @MSNBC I would have to say that you are not only delusional, but could not find your way out of paper bag, much less act responsibly during a National Emergency.
1333164499680063488 2020-11-30 05:42:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @OrvilleLloyd @MSNBC Unless we win both Georgia Senate seats in January, there will be nothing substantial done about Trumpism, limiting the Presidency or anything else. McConnell will block everything Biden wants to do, just like he did with Obama’s Administration
1333162404281266180 2020-11-30 05:34:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @katieappleseed7 @GuardDo54627481 I guess you have an explanation for the 265,000 Americans who have died unless that was a hoax also.
1333161710316883969 2020-11-30 05:31:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @previouslyGO372 @GuardDo54627481 Your whole tweet was what you think is happening, it’s not something you could ever know, so in the end it is just one man’s opinion among millions of others. Could be it’s just a pandemic, something people who study viruses have predicted for years.
1333159886486728705 2020-11-30 05:24:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GuardDo54627481 @smc429 @EricTrump Your comment tells me you do.

1333121427088809990 2020-11-30 02:51:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> We won this one thanks to the people being energized to vote. Commit to voting in every election and you will create a prosperous, fair and equitable society.
1333120346023714816 2020-11-30 02:47:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @prayfulpatriot @EricTrump You may know in your heart, but 37 judges did not find any evidence of widespread voter fraud in this election. I say you do not know.

1333118753895276544 2020-11-30 02:40:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @maryehatch @mmpadellan @EricTrump At least Biden is not a malevolent con artist and narcissist hell bent on amassing total power in this country. I would have voted for any candidate running against that megalomaniac.
1333117740664631309 2020-11-30 02:36:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @EricTrump Did you ever consider that 80 million people might have become disgusted watching the crime syndicate known as the Trump family causing chaos in the White House and the country? Maybe you would have to leave your entitled life for a while to understand Eric.
1333116053786865664 2020-11-30 02:30:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Trump has something on Dershowitz and Lindsey Graham.
1333095198830825477 2020-11-30 01:07:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @steve_vladeck Republicans who refuse to confront these baseless claims of voter fraud are lighting a match to our democratic processes that they will not be able to extinguish. This is where character and desire for the greater good should overcome selfishness and political gain.
1333093369095008264 2020-11-30 01:00:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JamesPatten04 @marklevinshow She got fired after making ridiculous conspiracy theories to the press. What headway?
1333092133327282176 2020-11-30 00:55:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @Yahoo Kind of like the evidence of widespread voter fraud, right Carlson?

Much like Trump you have no moral compass and will push revisionist history to further your agenda. Unfortunately there are many gullible people that will accept your narrative without question and without research.
1333089424406687746 2020-11-30 00:44:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump supporters. Read this.
1333088291411865601 2020-11-30 00:39:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> Fox News is slamming Loeffler on this video. Enjoyed watching it.
1332991834566569986 2020-11-29 18:16:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LoweV97 @RealRLimbaugh Maybe you should say the same thing about all the judges that have ruled against Trump. They did not see any evidence of widespread election fraud and neither has anyone else
1332991414150586373 2020-11-29 18:14:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @speedjunkie88 @RealRLimbaugh Just maybe it was a free and fair election and Trump lost. Not everyone is a fan of this President. 37 out of 38 judges seem to agree with that view.
1332990719108247553 2020-11-29 18:12:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Yoadie12 @RealRLimbaugh They are laughing at us because of how easy it is to lead Trump’s supporters by the nose to a conclusion without any evidence. That’s why Trump’s based is viewed by many as a full blown cult.
1332990011797606400 2020-11-29 18:09:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RealRLimbaugh Unless of course if it is a cynical attempt to cause people to question the results without evidence. Of course this President and his sycophants in Congress and the media would never do anything like that would they?
1332975391116578822 2020-11-29 17:11:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @nyttypos @nytimes @SangerNYT Who in the hell cares?
1332975123280891908 2020-11-29 17:10:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JCPeterson11 @nytimes How about 70 years of history. Would that mean anything to you?
1332974705243004928 2020-11-29 17:08:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @oriocookies @nytimes Is this your opinion or do you have facts to support your claim? As far as I am concerned, US conservative Administrations have blindly supported Israel over many years and have not been an impartial power broker. This will have consequences.
1332973007686561793 2020-11-29 17:01:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SenSanders To do this just over a month before this maniac leaves office is outrageous.
1332857862188642308 2020-11-29 09:24:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @tedcruz Cruz, for someone to believe your statement they would have to be utterly clueless of what goes on in our political system.
1332856982223671298 2020-11-29 09:20:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help this man win the special election race for Georgia’s Senator.
1332846844100161536 2020-11-29 08:40:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump As I always say Trump. Instead of putting your accusations on social media, take them to the courts. You and I both know that you are trying to destroy America’s institutions and faith in them as you leave office. Our Founding Fathers warned us about men like you.
1332844912706867201 2020-11-29 08:32:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @OANN @newsmax So what happened to your personal propaganda outlet any way? Did they finally realize that they had created a monster and had better abandon you? That was a wise choice in my opinion.
1332842501938548737 2020-11-29 08:23:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Our election laws and the Constitution worked exactly as they were supposed to. These institutions and that document do not need defended other than against those who would violate or undermine them.
1332840767472230402 2020-11-29 08:16:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Oh you are so wrong Trump. We have saved the country by voting you out of office. I am proud of all those that voted in record numbers for you and against you. I am also proud of our system of elections and the people that run them for their accuracy and fairness.
1332687924266196993 2020-11-28 22:08:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> Yes sir. You can be proud that you stood up for your country’s Democratic norms. Being blocked proves you were making a difference.
1332680568501309440 2020-11-28 21:39:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GenFlynn @SidneyPowell1 @LLinWood @marklevinshow @RealRLimbaugh @realDonaldTrump That is something coming from a traitor to his own country. I, Michael Flynn do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same...
1332650090985615361 2020-11-28 19:38:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help Georgia Senate candidates Ossoff and Warnock win their elections with your time and money and flip the Senate. McConnell will block everything that Biden proposes, just like he did with Obama, unless we get these two men into the Senate.
1332648579215855616 2020-11-28 19:32:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> It should never have gone this far and it may happen again in 2024 unless we find a way to stop the excesses of Trumpism.
1332647620913876992 2020-11-28 19:28:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> Mitch McConnell will block Biden at every turn and then state that it was a do nothing Administration in 2024. PLEASE help Georgia Senate candidates Ossoff and Warnock with your time and money and flip the Senate!
1332646495670181888 2020-11-28 19:24:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> How do cops get away with this?
1332645913597075457 2020-11-28 19:21:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> I’m thinking Trump’s supporters paid for this complete waste of money. He is fleecing them as he heads for the door.
1332645004167294978 2020-11-28 19:18:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RepMoBrooks Me thinks it’s politicians like you who are trying to steal this election. You will fail.
1332644090819842049 2020-11-28 19:14:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SenMastriano Donald Trump’s lawyers and sycophants like you have tried repeatedly to convince over 30 judges, some of them nominated by this President, of the merits of your case and only had one temporary win. I would say it is Trump’s loyalists who are trying to steal this election. RESIGN!
1332482839900811277 2020-11-28 08:34:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You lost the election. In 54 days you will be a nobody. Why would the news media cover a loser?
1332465706915557376 2020-11-28 07:25:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You lost just about every court case you have filed Trump. You and I both know that you are a LOSER and I know how much you hate being one but what can you do? Just eat it I guess.
1332460136296837120 2020-11-28 07:03:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @OANN Tell that to a judge Trump and see how quickly you get laughed out of court. Why your supporters believe you are intelligent is beyond me.
1332438070201884675 2020-11-28 05:36:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump That’s not the way it works Trump and just because you say it doesn’t make it so. I say Biden does not have to ANYTHING and on January 20th, 2021 you will be unceremoniously kicked out of the White House. You will probably be bawling like a baby but go you will.
1332435542252924931 2020-11-28 05:26:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> I wonder how Trump’s supporters explain this?
1332423791486640130 2020-11-28 04:39:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Kayleigh, Trump lies constantly, .has shown himself to be totally incompetent and that he only cares about himself. He has no problem watching hundreds of thousands of Americans die from the pandemic as he downplayed it. It doesn’t take a genius to see why he lost this election
1332421957455925251 2020-11-28 04:32:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @WalshFreedom Trump will never get any respect from me. There is nothing to respect.
1332421412590669825 2020-11-28 04:29:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> The agree.
1332421323130343424 2020-11-28 04:29:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Headlong42 @nytopinion @maureendowd I agree with you, but there has to be some way to get through to them. Because we make decisions based on information we are exposed to, I would like to see this country bring back the Fairness Doctrine, but we need a Democratic controlled Senate to make that happen.
1332300012408205317 2020-11-27 20:27:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @TrojanCondoms Trump’s parents remind me of something from the Adams family.
1332299346478501889 2020-11-27 20:24:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KMc_head @CBSNews No, I think they are just reporting the news.
1332297199112294404 2020-11-27 20:16:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TheRickyDavila @CNN I agree. Don’t care what he does.
1332167142591123456 2020-11-27 11:39:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @conorjrogers @madrid_mike Trump would be King over this country if he could. He is the real enemy of the people. Thankfully people in this country realized this and voted against him in record numbers.
1332166206820913153 2020-11-27 11:35:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Xycocb @EmeraldRobinson No. One election no matter how many tantrums Trump has.
1332165825852289028 2020-11-27 11:34:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @nasan_2020 @EmeraldRobinson You sound like you would be comfortable living under a dictator.
1332165376856223750 2020-11-27 11:32:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @EmeraldRobinson F**k them.
1332164090664542210 2020-11-27 11:27:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @kayleighmcenany Begone you ditzy blond.
1332163921210462213 2020-11-27 11:26:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Did you ever consider that the electorate in this country had become so disgusted with President’s Trump’s incompetence, chaos and corruption that they turned out in record numbers to make sure he was not re-elected? The lies, childishness and the insatiable quest for more power
1332136714161319937 2020-11-27 09:38:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @Yahoo DeSantis, a Trump wannabe, thought that aligning himself with the President was his ticket to the Senate. He is arrogant and had no statewide response to the pandemic in Florida. He blamed people that were unemployed by COVID for the failure of the state’s unemployment system.
1332133840383578114 2020-11-27 09:27:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help these men flip the Senate. You will literally change history.
1332131997364477955 2020-11-27 09:19:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BillRehkopf @svdate @jeffmason1 I have always been taught that respect is earned, not given. Trump has disrespected the Constitution, members of the a House and Senate and the laws of this country. He deserves no respect.
1332111475671003138 2020-11-27 07:58:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC Well Mitch, since you have become wealthy as a US politician I’ll bet you have a lot to be thankful for.
1332093463068893187 2020-11-27 06:46:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> I believe Donald Trump is trying to sabotage Biden’s Presidency by his recent foreign policy decisions in Somalia and Afghanistan. Trump is mentally unstable and is not fit to be POTUS.
1332090404808912896 2020-11-27 06:34:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> Why would anyone vote for someone who believed QANON was real or who used inside information to enrich himself?
1332088784721244162 2020-11-27 06:28:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DavidJHarrisJr @realDonaldTrump They ignored it because they know that you are just spreading unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and outright lies to hold onto power. I can’t wait to see you unceremoniously escorted from the White House to the courthouse.
1332087708722868224 2020-11-27 06:23:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> The
1332082800011436038 2020-11-27 06:04:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please support these two Democratic candidates. It’s the only way we can flip the Senate and help President Biden accomplish his goals.
1332078141741953025 2020-11-27 05:45:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> Let’s hope we can get our act back together. There has been a great deal of propaganda and hero worship going on for 4 years.
1332077038946095104 2020-11-27 05:41:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I will be so glad when I don’t see your blind, ignorant arrogance anymore Trump. Your shear stupidity is exhausting.
1332042880966406146 2020-11-27 03:25:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well said.
1332042557757517830 2020-11-27 03:24:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mschlapp Shlapp, you are a religious idiot. Why would any thinking person make it harder to control a pandemic and make it an issue of religious freedom. You are one of those “Christians” that could care less who they spread the virus to and who lives or dies.
1332020646931533828 2020-11-27 01:57:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ChuckGrassley I realize you and Trump’s other enablers are scared to death of his supporters, but you are defending traitors.
1332019697995411457 2020-11-27 01:53:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RedTheRaider @ABC The United States has done many things that have created enemies all over the world. That being said, you either help locals fight terrorists abroad or you will fight them here. Not every conflict is unnecessary.
1331992462085197830 2020-11-27 00:05:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @benpershing @svdate Flynn, a totally disgraced traitor.
1331992109575004163 2020-11-27 00:04:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RudyGiuliani You and that criminal enterprise in the White House are only concerned with staying in power, not anything to do with American’s rights.
1331991529716584451 2020-11-27 00:01:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You know what this ruling tells me? That the SCOTUS conservative majority will not even allow our State political leaders to properly respond to a national emergency like the pandemic we are facing now. Ridiculous.
1331990549319061505 2020-11-26 23:57:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Can’t wait till you are in a courtroom facing prison time and I don’t have to listen to your whining and lies
1331903940556894208 2020-11-26 18:13:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @maggieNYT Trump has disrespected the office of President for four years. He has disrespected the White House press pool. You want to blame someone for lack of decorum? Blame Trump.
1331903305421885442 2020-11-26 18:11:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> Cuomo, what is there to respect? I glad these reporters are taking a tougher tone with this President. I wished they had done it sooner.
1331901886484590592 2020-11-26 18:05:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> Of course he is afraid. Just another slime ball politician that Americans keep voting into office.
1331885446994030592 2020-11-26 17:00:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help this man win the Georgia special election Senate seat and flip the Senate.
1331884368952963073 2020-11-26 16:55:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JennaEllisEsq @realDonaldTrump You are delusional
1331770423726333953 2020-11-26 09:23:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump’s dystopia
1331770309737926656 2020-11-26 09:22:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JennaEllisEsq No one is panicking. You are just blowing smoke up everyones ass.
1331769933580144640 2020-11-26 09:21:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You lost the election. You can’t run for re-election when you have already lost the election. I personally think you are just taking advantage of your followers with this charade because you are broke and want their donations. You know your cult followers will do it.
1331768548415447048 2020-11-26 09:15:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @Yahoo What should have made Schroeder mad was a 17 year old with an AR shooting and killing two people.
1331768069950148609 2020-11-26 09:13:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I saw a video of a guy walking right through the bars of the wall.
1331767869403787265 2020-11-26 09:12:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump You are all part of a cult of one imperfect man. Always dangerous in human society throughout history.
1331767349951729667 2020-11-26 09:10:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GovRonDeSantis @realDonaldTrump We were leaderless in Florida during this pandemic Governor. You are responsible for many unnecessary deaths in this state and always put the economy before the lives of Floridians. People will not forget your handling of the unemployment fiasco last spring.
1331766209101111296 2020-11-26 09:06:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RepAndyBiggsAZ @realDonaldTrump All your statement shows me Biggs is that you and Trump are both sociopaths that could care less about American deaths from this pandemic. You nauseate me.
1331765705205837824 2020-11-26 09:04:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I am not surprised that you pardoned a fellow traitor to the Russian State Trump.
1331765123854295042 2020-11-26 09:02:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SenRickScott @realDonaldTrump You got that wrong Scott. We need men of good character to hold high office in the Senate and the Presidency and neither you or a Trump fits that description. You defrauded Medicare in Florida and somehow with your ill gotten gains was elected Governor. Trump is totally corrupt.
1331741829423886337 2020-11-26 07:29:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Jim_Jordan You are blessing an American traitor. I guess that is ok with lowlife politicians like you.
1331714968685785089 2020-11-26 05:42:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please support the two Democratic Senate nominees Ossoff and Warnock. President Biden’s job will be infinitely more difficult without these two men winning the two Georgia Senate seats.
1331714224566005762 2020-11-26 05:39:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn I can add pardoning traitors to your list of crimes Trump.
1331713924794880007 2020-11-26 05:38:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RandyRRQuaid @StephenMatey3 You belong to a cult Randy. Pure and simple.
1331639194259746818 2020-11-26 00:41:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @marcorubio You, by your silence on Trump’s lies, corruption and excesses are the author of America’s decline. It is little cowards like you, that allowed him to run amok in this country for four years because your main concern was to get re-elected and you feared his supporters.
1331629532265246722 2020-11-26 00:03:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jsolomonReports You can believe anything you want. Life after death, aliens or magic, but in the case of massive election fraud multiple across states, you have to have some kind of evidence that would stand up in court. That is unless you are willing to believe the word of one imperfect man.
1331628028611473412 2020-11-25 23:57:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jsolomonReports It’s odd that in the 2016 Presidential Election, which Trump won, it was a close election with no voter fraud at all and in 2020 there is massive fraud and corruption and therefore Trump lost. Isn’t the most plausible explanation is that Trump simply lost the election?
1331571224535773184 2020-11-25 20:11:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @madrid_mike I still do not see how we are going to deprogram the cult of Trump World.
1331570189520035842 2020-11-25 20:07:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jonathanvswan These things will always happen in the alternate reality of Trump World.
1331568305312849920 2020-11-25 19:59:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JDiamond1 What is the point of this if no meaningful evidence of extensive voter fraud has been presented and no matter what happens in any given State election count Trump still lost the election? I d not believe it has anything to do with principles, and everything to do with politics.
1331540539058122753 2020-11-25 18:09:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @PJStrikeForce @realDonaldTrump Don’t cry to me about it. Take it to court. Until then Trump lost and is leaving the White House.
1331521890771492871 2020-11-25 16:55:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @derekerwin @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/UT2SBUJgcR                                               It looks like Georgia Elections already do have a signature on file to validate a ballot just like a Florida so I don’t see the problem.
1331519665408004100 2020-11-25 16:46:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Browntruck1980 @Lrihendry Then why have they done so poorly in the courts? In Florida we have mail in voting and you have to have your signature match the one they have on file. Never have had a problem here and even Trump said it was a good system.
1331518753029361666 2020-11-25 16:43:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LetsGoWVPower @Lrihendry I think Trump is going to go out with a whimper and if you are going to make statements like winning in the Supreme Court, please have some evidence of what you claim. So far we haven’t seen any.
1331517453877338112 2020-11-25 16:37:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @intolerantape @Ima21846253 @Lrihendry Trump has convinced his hardcore supporters who always did believe every word he said that the election was fraudulent, but you do not speak for the American people and the majority of them voted for Biden. There is no reaching people like you.
1331516109456101379 2020-11-25 16:32:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump I hear you talking, but I don’t see you presenting any evidence of your accusations. Anyone can get on social media and spread rumors and conspiracy theories, but having enough evidence to go before a judge is a totally different matter. I have to conclude that you know nothing.
1331401568479010816 2020-11-25 08:57:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @montreche @madrid_mike Good point.
1331396132933668867 2020-11-25 08:35:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @GaSecofState Because the election is over and you lost you dolt!
1331356528847228936 2020-11-25 05:58:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> Amen brother
1331356023580450829 2020-11-25 05:56:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Timmah9 @pablo_honey1 @kayleighmcenany Trump made it clear no rules applied to him from the start and that is a very dangerous attitude to have as POTUS and no, I have no interest in getting to know the other side of a full blown narcissist who was a threat to a free society in this country.
1331354595201863683 2020-11-25 05:50:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @kayleighmcenany You were a pathetic Press Secretary. You had to lie as well as the President did and in that sense you were perfect for the job. Soon you will be finding another job, so no one really gives a damn what you think about Biden’s socks.
1331353295877787660 2020-11-25 05:45:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JennaEllisEsq No one cares what you think about it lady. You will be unemployed very soon.
1331352952695648257 2020-11-25 05:44:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You might as well skip the Press briefings Trump. Don’t need to listen to whatever lies you are putting out today or any day for that matter. It really is nice to to have to listen to an idiot that should never have even elected to that office.
1331302767328174080 2020-11-25 02:24:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump And we fired you Trump so don’t let the door hit you in the a**.
1331302377530544129 2020-11-25 02:23:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump That’s right. The American people have already decided and you are FIRED!
1331270740109352966 2020-11-25 00:17:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> Help these two men win their Georgia Senate seats and flip the Senate
1331236602094481411 2020-11-24 22:01:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> Help these two candidates take back the Senate!
1331236090041282563 2020-11-24 21:59:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @VicToensing @newsmax Show some proof to a judge Trump. Making accusations to Twitter is not going to help you. It will only cause people to lose faith in our system of Elections.
1331225924331839495 2020-11-24 21:19:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews I’ll give you this Trump. You are one of the world’s greatest conmen and grifter, but even as you try to destroy Americans faith in our election systems, you will be removed from office on January 20th, 2021.
1331224554392465408 2020-11-24 21:14:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I don’t know about that but I do know that Joe Biden will be sworn in as President on January 20th, 2021.
1331224195997593600 2020-11-24 21:12:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RandyRRQuaid You and his poor deluded hardcore supporters never did realize you were being conned by Trump from the beginning. He was a carnival barker who made grand promises but never delivered. How’s that big beautiful wall that he was going to have Mexico pay for going?
1331222635116638211 2020-11-24 21:06:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RandyRRQuaid You use the term “we” very loosely Randy. You do not speak for me or tens of millions of other Americans as well. Before you start spreading Trump’s self serving propaganda, maybe you should come up with some evidence of widespread election fraud first.
1331165073285517313 2020-11-24 17:17:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow This is a good example of an extremely low intelligence portion of the United States electorate. This right here is our problem. Trump is a symptom of this kind of American voter.
1331163570344759298 2020-11-24 17:11:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump needs to be actively investigated and prosecuted for his crimes. Not doing so in an attempt to unify the country will fail and only embolden other ambitious politicians to arise and attempt the same pursuit of total power.
1331162476759683073 2020-11-24 17:07:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @marcorubio You and other Republican “leaders” prostituted themselves before Donald Trump for political gain. Thanks to cowards like you Marco, we were moving toward an autocratic government until the American people came to our rescue. I will not forget. You need removed from office.
1331161466087632896 2020-11-24 17:03:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump If you are trying to defend your job performance as GOP chairwoman you failed miserably.  Nothing you say can change the election results.
1331160274036994055 2020-11-24 16:58:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You may never concede, but you will be out of office on January 20th 2021. Did anyone ever tell you that you are a 74 year old person that acts like a spoiled child? I can’t even refer to you as a man and can’t think of a single thing I respect about you. Not one thing.
1331045553841561600 2020-11-24 09:22:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are a liar Trump and you never in your entire life cared about the country, you only care for yourself.
1331044278810841088 2020-11-24 09:17:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> Good!
1331043355837542402 2020-11-24 09:14:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> Amen brother
1331043170306699265 2020-11-24 09:13:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @hughhewitt We have seen what Trump and his cowardly GOP enablers have done in four years. Winner takes all, breaking any semblance of honor and decency with the goal of packing the court and blocking every nominee and bill from the previous Democratic Administration. Don’t cry to me asshole
1331024475412893696 2020-11-24 07:58:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JohnCornyn Adults will be in charge Cornyn and not the spoiled petulant child who you enabled for four years. I hold politicians like you as responsible as Trump is for your attempted destruction of our democratic institutions.
1331023228438016000 2020-11-24 07:54:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I am going to fight for you to be held accountable for your treasonous acts while in office Trump. You must be made an example of so future despots will think twice before attempting to destroy our Republic.
1330982512890351616 2020-11-24 05:12:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> It’s sad that we get excited about something that we never used to worry about. That’s Trump’s America.
1330949227371958272 2020-11-24 02:59:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> Many Republicans are willing to ignore the virus, open up everything like it doesn’t exist, and then let it kill whoever it kills. I believe a good portion of the country are narcissists like their dear leader.
1330948188803575811 2020-11-24 02:55:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> It could be that the White House staff are a group of self serving cowards.
1330947616327294976 2020-11-24 02:53:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @StanGott If they haven’t spoken up against Trump’s excesses publicly, they are simply cowards, putting their political careers before the good of the country. They will not get any accolades from me.
1330888871266152450 2020-11-23 23:00:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> So as long as you are a Covid denying politician that flouts any CDC guidelines and contract COVID-19, the drug companies will approve experimental drugs to save your life and taxpayers cover all the cost. Must be nice. Why do we keep voting these clowns into office?
1330884659052503042 2020-11-23 22:43:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help both Warnock and Ossoff win their Georgia Senate seats. They are our only hope to win back control of the Senate.
1330855894150750213 2020-11-23 20:49:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> I believe this is true
1330798439244951552 2020-11-23 17:00:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> I believe it will get worse
1330798089251250193 2020-11-23 16:59:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @PreetBharara @donwinslow Can you imagine this worthless POS as a sitting Supreme Court Justice?
1330677312128512001 2020-11-23 08:59:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOP You had your 5 minutes of fame and you were talking really tough till you got fired. I’ll bet you still have a great deal of confidence in yourself though. Everyone else thinks you look like a fool.
1330676396067262465 2020-11-23 08:55:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MSNBC @NBCNewsTHINK These politicians abusing their power and damaging the country always seem to get a pass because of the desire for unity. That teaches every other dirt bag politician that they can do whatever they want with no consequences. Besides, I don’t think it will work with his supporters
1330639008741822466 2020-11-23 06:27:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> If you live in Georgia please read this.
1330635285777035268 2020-11-23 06:12:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AndyOstroy @donwinslow I will never forget that day. I was 7 years old and the shock, grief sadness was palpable all around me. I will probably go to my grave without really knowing the facts behind his assassination.
1330631333283033089 2020-11-23 05:56:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Jim_Jordan BS and generalizations. You should go back to being a wrestling coach.
1330629705440096261 2020-11-23 05:50:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @democracynow @nargesbajoghli This President will do literally anything to stay in power, even attack Iran. The problem is he waited too long and has already lost the election. Don’t know how he could avoid a transfer of power on January 20th.
1330572913003597831 2020-11-23 02:04:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jonathanvswan You are going to have to convince a sitting judge before you “blow up” anything lady.
1330572253445169157 2020-11-23 02:02:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JudyWoodruff @GovChristie @ThisWeekABC And Christie is the same guy that coached Trump to continually interrupt Biden to cause him to stutter in the first debate.
1330571893913563137 2020-11-23 02:00:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @StanGott @HuffPostPol Well Trump is an idiot so this does not surprise me.
1330531010371575816 2020-11-22 23:18:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please register to vote and help Ossoff and Warnock to win their Georgia Senate seats. It’s our only chance to take control of the Senate.
1330524448408162305 2020-11-22 22:52:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help these two candidates
1330524084615213059 2020-11-22 22:50:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is his support’s money. He fleecing them on the way out.
1330523710063775746 2020-11-22 22:49:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JennaEllisEsq Jenna, I would have to state right now that you do not know s**t. Either show us some evidence or shut the h*ll up.
1330503167990181888 2020-11-22 21:27:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump No one cares what you do now Trump.
1330502838863228931 2020-11-22 21:26:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump It doesn’t take a genius to know what you are trying to do here Trump. Too bad it’s not going to work and you will not know a moment’s peace after January 20th.
1330494433800949761 2020-11-22 20:52:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SecPompeo Pompeo, let’s get something straight. You threw the freely elected Afghan government under the bus and pulled our troops out for a photo op.
1330493956942159872 2020-11-22 20:50:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Pirro is a lunatic
1330493100553351170 2020-11-22 20:47:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls Running out of good news Kellyanne? In actual fact the President has nothing to do with the vaccine.
1330492671656415239 2020-11-22 20:45:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You will always be known as the President who ignored a national emergency because it was more important to him to win an election than try to stop needless suffering and death.
1330439716471263232 2020-11-22 17:15:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @marklevinshow Levin, you are not a journalist, but a cheerleader, much like Trump was not a President, but a spoiled rich kid with a penchant for manipulating the masses. He was only interested in amassing power and enriching himself, which would have ended in an autocratic government.
1330436672941658113 2020-11-22 17:03:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @WB4IUY @HorhayPiejoe @marklevinshow The shoe was on the other foot four years ago, or have you forgotten already. We had a close election and Hillary conceded without trashing our state vote counting systems and endless lawsuits. Where have you been?
1330325262823776256 2020-11-22 09:40:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump The clock is ticking Trump. Soon it will be time for you to face the music
1330300699809296390 2020-11-22 08:02:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow I believe there is a portion of the United States population that could are less if their fellow citizens live or die.
1330296347266867207 2020-11-22 07:45:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You lost Trump. You talk like you are still campaigning in spite of the fact that the election is over. No one cares about you congratulating yourself anymore. We are done with you. January 20th cannot come soon enough
1330295474344124420 2020-11-22 07:42:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump No they don’t Trump. You stating your opinion on anything does not make it true. After completely blowing the response to the pandemic for selfish reasons, you have no right to criticize anyone.
1330294651308412943 2020-11-22 07:38:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You have no redeeming qualities Trump, except that you are a good example of the worst of humanity. Every minute that goes by will bring you closer to the trials and tribulations that await you.
1330226995008049158 2020-11-22 03:10:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Are you sure that you are not just trying to get more money out of your supporters by continuing this charade? This way you can pay off your debts before leaving office. I realize you could care less about how much damage you will cause on your way out.
1330219601188286475 2020-11-22 02:40:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> That’s an amazing story and very cool.
1330219142998331394 2020-11-22 02:38:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @hellokittymaggi @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump Your dear leader is on his way out the door into the waiting arms of investigators and courtrooms. What is amazing is that he could have won this election if he had just showed some humanity. Instead all you saw was the full blown narcissist.
1330144979033972742 2020-11-21 21:44:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I never asked how the dirtbag was doing Trump.
1330138548209668101 2020-11-21 21:18:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews You act like you are still running for President, Trump. I hate to break the bad news to you, but you LOST already!
1330118133730996225 2020-11-21 19:57:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> I don’t think people realize how destructive this Administration is continuing to be to this country. Yet they still have millions of staunch supporters. I blame Fox and Alt Right News for this situation.
1330117028104040454 2020-11-21 19:53:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is the kind of partisan people in government that pave the way for autocratic government and believe in Party before the country as a whole.
1330115282627670016 2020-11-21 19:46:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump’s Press Secretary’s will always be known as people with the uncanny ability to lie to millions of people while half the Electorate has documented proof they are lying. It’s a gift that not everyone possesses.
1330113870787178500 2020-11-21 19:40:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is exactly how I feel.
1330113326492364801 2020-11-21 19:38:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> Damn right. If any SCOTUS Justices read this, as soon as Americans begin viewing you as a rubber stamp owned by a political party you become irrelevant.
1330111259656802305 2020-11-21 19:30:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @pdacosta Finally, an honest statement from a Trump Administration official
1330110772043788288 2020-11-21 19:28:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> Most of these Republican lawmakers are cowards and the type of people that only care about political power and remaining in their cushy taxpayer funded jobs. There isn’t an ounce of integrity or love of country between them.
1329999007859560449 2020-11-21 12:04:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RexChapman Yes, i’m sure that would have gone over well.
1329997528260091904 2020-11-21 11:58:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> Help these two candidates any way you can. Without Ossoff and Warnock winning these Georgia Senate seats, McConnell will block everything Biden tries to do, much like he did to Obama.
1329996854449369093 2020-11-21 11:55:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @stuartpstevens @donwinslow @kayleighmcenany It’s hard to tell if she just lies without thinking or does she really believe what she is saying. Either way, we won’t have to listen to her much longer.
1329996240608702466 2020-11-21 11:53:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @IngrahamAngle There is something very wrong with you Laura. Something in your past as made you a cold blooded liar or maybe there is always a certain portion of a human population that are full blooded sociopaths. I think you are going to miss Trump.
1329981649078120448 2020-11-21 10:55:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @idrealist1 Trump and his two sons remind me of Saddam Hussein and his two crazy sons.
1329972905954914310 2020-11-21 10:20:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please give whatever you can to the two Democratic Senate candidates in Georgia. We can change history and take back the Senate.
1329971219802755072 2020-11-21 10:13:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> Help these two Democratic candidates win their Senate seats in Georgia. It’s the only way we can turn this country around.
1329964674402693121 2020-11-21 09:47:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @charliekirk11 You are just a kid Charlie, who knows little but is so sure of himself.
1329963242224017408 2020-11-21 09:42:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate They are hoping all Trump’s supporters remain loyal to the cult.
1329960600202571778 2020-11-21 09:31:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Jim_Jordan Hey airhead Jordan. You should have remained a wrestling coach. Countries don’t normally let pandemics run amok and let the virus kill who it will. If Americans would not listen to you and instead follow simple guidelines, we wouldn’t have to shutdown businesses. You are an idiot
1329936061578014720 2020-11-21 07:54:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews They have always known you were an out of control lunatic Trump. They rode the your crazy train headed for the cliff as long as they could, but they know what your future holds.
1329912131098206208 2020-11-21 06:18:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> Wise words and so true.
1329911273367236614 2020-11-21 06:15:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> The question is, who is going to stand up to this corrupt President as he attempts to subvert the will of the majority of the American Electorate? If by these actions, he manages to stay in office, I predict there will be chaos in the streets in January 2021.
1329894408326696960 2020-11-21 05:08:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> I am all for uniting the country, but if this is true Mnuchin and others like Trump and DeJoy should do prison time.
1329893825821732866 2020-11-21 05:06:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @gtconway3d @realDonaldTrump What a stupid suggestion Geraldo. And for all these years I I thought you were an intelligent person.
1329893368785215488 2020-11-21 05:04:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jeffzeleny @svdate @fschouten And his supporters would give their life savings to the con artist.
1329893069202878467 2020-11-21 05:03:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @charliekirk11 Charlie Kirk. What a wise and insightful human being. The only problem is Charlie Kirk couldn’t find his way out of a paper bag. What if we had a national emergency, like a war perhaps, and the government issued an order to shelter in place? Would he counsel you to ignore it?
1329891715285741569 2020-11-21 04:57:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You lie constantly Trump. Why would you think we would believe you now as you desperately try to cling to power?
1329845294092201984 2020-11-21 01:53:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @catatkats @BayesianLeif @saraecook @svdate @kaitlancollins Wow. Awesome reply. I wish other correspondents would do the same.
1329809443777880067 2020-11-20 23:30:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JenGranholm @realDonaldTrump The problem is that I have read in the past is that there is not a law against an elector voting for the losing candidate in his state. Hope I am wrong about this.
1329740336835555334 2020-11-20 18:56:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOP Trump supporters would destroy this country’s system of elections because they worship one man. In all the elections we have had in the past, the integrity of our voting systems have never been questioned so widely. This is solely due to the efforts of one man. Donald J Trump.
1329606306357981197 2020-11-20 10:03:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> For these politicians to even attend shows how broken the Electoral College is right now. Any State can subvert the will of the electorate if they wish. We all should be calling our elected leaders in Congress and read them the riot act. Tell them it’s time to take a stand!
1329590988680142850 2020-11-20 09:02:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @StanGott I encourage everyone to call their elected leaders and tell them they had better step up and take a stand against Trump, or they will be viewed as collaborators in America’s first coup and a future autocratic government.
1329590164113469441 2020-11-20 08:59:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> Not to be an alarmist, but i believe that if Trump and his Republican allies go through with this illegal plan and succeed in installing Donald Trump as President for the next four years, it will be the beginning of a second American Civil War
1329496681252089856 2020-11-20 02:48:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jsolomonReports Take it to court and prove it. What good does it do putting this on Twitter?
1329495901505720320 2020-11-20 02:44:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @pudgenet @Reuters First of all, my statement specifically pertains to Trump and his efforts to prove he lost due to fraud so since it has nothing to do with earlier claims, it is not a lie. I don’t doubt that there have been earlier claims of fraud, just not enough to change a national election.
1329478413195894789 2020-11-20 01:35:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump These drugs do not absolve you of your criminal negligence in the deaths of 250,000 Americans.
1329478051969818624 2020-11-20 01:34:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @OANN Take it to court Trump and quit crying about it.
1329477618941440001 2020-11-20 01:32:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @justin_hart Take it to court Trump and quit crying like a toddler
1329477311566131202 2020-11-20 01:31:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> Awesome!
1329477007558766593 2020-11-20 01:29:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA You sound like a desperate con artist willing to say and do anything to avoid defeat.
1329475117685108736 2020-11-20 01:22:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @pudgenet @Reuters It’s not a lie and this is fact.            https://t.co/RHdTCcPqPr
1329387238153740294 2020-11-19 19:33:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @guypbenson Don’t care about your opinions
1329386906531098625 2020-11-19 19:31:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @iraLFOD You people couldn’t find your way out of a paper bag, much less a national emergency. What was your plan? Let it run rampant killing whoever it kills? Is this Sociopaths for Trump?
1329367718622015492 2020-11-19 18:15:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @iraLFOD @stepreb @Reuters She conceded soon after the election. There is videos of it. Anything else you want to say?
1329353038478389254 2020-11-19 17:17:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> We have always known that a Trump was a profoundly damaged human being and a narcissist. This is what narcissists do.
1329352602371452929 2020-11-19 17:15:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @johnddavidson @realDonaldTrump @FDRLST Why put this on Twitter? Take it to court if you are convinced that you have found verifiable voter fraud.
1329350727379144706 2020-11-19 17:08:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @RandPaul @OANN And Rand Paul is a politician with a motive to help Donald Trump sow doubt and suspicion about our voting systems. All I see is a statement with no evidence.
1329349183120285698 2020-11-19 17:01:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @pudgenet @Reuters Evidently, only one court in the 25 that Trump’s lawyers have presented their case to agrees with you. No one is saying that this election, or any election is perfect, only that the level of fraud or mistakes would not have had any effect on the outcome of an election.
1329230846499446785 2020-11-19 09:11:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaddCompani We need both Ossoff and Warnock to win to flip the Senate.
1329230515422044161 2020-11-19 09:10:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help these two men flip the Senate and change history. Time is running out.

1329223256591753217 2020-11-19 08:41:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @NeyClaudio2 @Reuters By and large, I remember that Dems generally accepted the results of the 2016 election even though they deeply disliked Trump. Just about everything they were afraid of came to pass. Trump supporters did not complain either. Now all of a sudden the whole election system is rigged
1329222112146575362 2020-11-19 08:37:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RafeCov @Reuters What was done wrong? What was done differently from the 2016 election when no one was saying the election was rigged? Trump saying this election was rigged is the only difference.
1329221308836700162 2020-11-19 08:33:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jayshee0325 @Reuters You did the polling?
1329220939842785281 2020-11-19 08:32:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @William42239351 @Reuters Do you need any evidence or do you just believe what Donald Trump tells you?
1329220630714126338 2020-11-19 08:31:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @meckenzieb @Reuters Be honest. Trump told you the election was rigged and you believed it. Since there is no evidence, Trump has lost 24 out of 25 court cases. Are all the judges controlled by the Democratic Party as well in a massive conspiracy? I sincerely doubt it.
1329219877169672194 2020-11-19 08:28:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @wallyx69 @KillmongerWidow @Reuters Who’s we? I could say the same thing about Republican politicians from Donald Trump on down.
1329219467818242050 2020-11-19 08:26:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @CoachRich_61 @Reuters Who told you that? Donald Trump?
1329219265103269891 2020-11-19 08:25:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Snugglygope @Reuters Americans have been convinced by Trump that the election was rigged, not by any evidence. He is a master manipulator. If he destroys Americans faith in our election system, what did he accomplish other than destroy our political systems and divide America?
1329217906689839105 2020-11-19 08:20:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Salmo301112 @Reuters @realDonaldTrump Long before the election, journalists were predicting Trump would be leading until mostly Democrat mail in ballots were counted and that’s what happened. It doesn’t mean there was fraud. Republicans even gained seats in the House. How would that happen if you were correct?
1329216424263475200 2020-11-19 08:14:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RealMetalMill @Reuters I would have to say you do not know very many Democrats. You, Trump or his lawyers have not produced any evidence of a stolen election after 25 tries in court. I believe Trump will be manipulating his supporters long after he leaves office.
1329215517303971843 2020-11-19 08:10:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @stepreb @Reuters Democrats by and large accepted the results in 2016 even though most despised Trump. There was no uproar to recount all the votes or accusations of fraud from either side. Hillary conceded. I believe Trump convinced you this election was rigged without any evidence.
1329214612689051654 2020-11-19 08:07:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @pudgenet @Reuters Was 2016 a mess? The big problem here is people are being convinced that our system to count votes is riddled with fraud when there has been no evidence of it. Trump’s lawyers have tried to prove that but the courts are not buying it.
1329213770447679488 2020-11-19 08:03:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @othoulrich @Reuters I think Trump, a master conman and manipulator of people convinced you of this, not evidence or facts. If you were correct, Trump would not have prevailed in 2016 and Republicans would not have increased House seats during this election.
1329213001203937280 2020-11-19 08:00:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KenMcCarthy @Reuters I don’t know you Ken, so forgive me if I do not take your word for this.
1329212502287192067 2020-11-19 07:58:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> I agree.
1329212382430842884 2020-11-19 07:58:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AdamInHTownTX @Reuters For months journalists were predicting Trump supporters would vote in person and Dems would vote by mail. Mail in ballots are usually counted last. That is why you saw Trump’s early leads evaporate as time went on.
1329211189545611265 2020-11-19 07:53:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You lost the election Trump. Face it. You will never be able to have enough votes tossed to change the outcome. I know you could care less about anyone but yourself, but you look like a toddler having a temper tantrum.
1329210345924288512 2020-11-19 07:50:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help Ossoff and Warnock win their Georgia Senate races and take back the Senate. If we don’t do that President elect Biden will have a difficult time getting anything done.
1329194832770818050 2020-11-19 06:48:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help Ossoff and Warnock win their Georgia Senate seats. Help Georgia flip the Senate and make history.
1329189176621850627 2020-11-19 06:26:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @perlmutations We need the Senate. Our hopes and dreams are up to Georgians.
1329185583856578572 2020-11-19 06:11:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich Let’s not forget the scumbags in Congress who have enabled this President.
1329185001506791428 2020-11-19 06:09:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @itsJeffTiedrich Something terrible has happened to the American Electorate. In 2016, maybe people decided to try a candidate who was not a “politician”. In 2020 after four years of corruption, an impeachment, non stop lies and 240,000 Americans dead there is no excuse. Trump is just a symptom.
1329166128002834434 2020-11-19 04:54:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @DarrellIssa Now I know Issa is a complete moron.
1329138675691745283 2020-11-19 03:05:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I had to laugh at that statement. Let’s get something straight Trump. YOU LOST! I should have known a worthless idiot like you would try to destroy our elections systems on the way out the door. Worst President in the history of the United States.
1329078806234107904 2020-11-18 23:07:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please vote Georgia. This country needs you to flip the Senate from Mitch McConnell. If you don’t live in Georgia, please support Ossoff and Warnock with your time or contributions.
1329077973710819335 2020-11-18 23:04:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump No Trump. You just can’t stand someone contradicting your lies and you have the emotional development of a two year old.
1329077442129010698 2020-11-18 23:02:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump That was awesome Trump, especially coming from a traitor and a Russian asset.
1329076896319959040 2020-11-18 22:59:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump The only reason I haven’t blocked your tweets Trump is because as much as I hate listening to what is supposed to be a man cry all the time, I do  enjoy telling you what a miserable excuse for a human being you are.
1329074957490429960 2020-11-18 22:52:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Timodc I personally did not see anything wrong with the aspirations listed in the tweet. Biden has already put many of them into his platform. Definitely not anything to get into a huff about.
1329072794101981186 2020-11-18 22:43:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @FieldPlaying @senatemajldr Lindsey Graham. The biggest hypocrite in the world and he  still won his Senate seat in South Carolina. There must have been fraud in the vote counting.
1329025430515572737 2020-11-18 19:35:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @senatemajldr You know what you have learned from Trump Mitch? You learned to spout propaganda and lies as easily as you breathe. Republicans sent the majority of last COVID relief funds to large corporations and you will do it again this time if you are not confronted.
1329004291374374913 2020-11-18 18:11:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> I believe we would have been well on our way to an authoritarian government if Americans had not voted in the members they did. Thank you America.
1328987485150605313 2020-11-18 17:04:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> And what will happen to Graham? Nothing. We must take control of the Senate. Support Georgia’s two Senate candidates in the Special Election there.
1328985773681614849 2020-11-18 16:57:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> And today I have no faith that any of these men will stand up to Trump. January 39tg Cabot come soon enough.
1328869989747716096 2020-11-18 09:17:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @tedcruz @SherrodBrown @DanSullivan_AK We can’t find many Republican politicians who are also adults to set an example for the rest of the country by wearing a mask during a pandemic. Ted Cruz has joined the rest of these idiots making a political statement out of something that should be common sense.
1328821549143646208 2020-11-18 06:05:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> It’s been obvious from the beginning that Trump is a bumbling idiot. Actually that’s good because if he were intelligent we could be headed for an autocratic government right now. Way to go Trump!
1328818877455851528 2020-11-18 05:54:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Well it’s too late for a redo Trump. Sucks to be you.
1328818590150242306 2020-11-18 05:53:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Great job Trump. I knew you could find something you were capable of not screwing completely up. Too bad you could handle a pandemic. Tens of thousands of Americans who died from COVID would be alive today.
1328717229047881730 2020-11-17 23:10:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> Sounds like Taylor is surrounded by snakes.
1328712317127815172 2020-11-17 22:51:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mmpadellan I am getting a feeling that all these people will get a pass on anything they have done. If we don’t win two Senate seats in Georgia, Biden will need to work with Republicans.
1328663070558871552 2020-11-17 19:35:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow He has NO business contacting any election official in another state. He is corrupt and Trump has some damaging information on him.
1328626110079389701 2020-11-17 17:08:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> Help Georgians change history
1328625823352549376 2020-11-17 17:07:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich It would be great if he had evidence of Graham’s corruption would stand up in court. I would love to see that worthless politician removed from the Senate.
1328623773168308230 2020-11-17 16:59:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOP GOP. The lunatic who would be King has been toppled, so your tweet is just feel good political spin. Your Party has become unrecognizable to older Americans because you have sold your soul to the devil. You shouldn’t even call yourselves Republicans
1328516918832209920 2020-11-17 09:54:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help these two Georgia candidates for the Senate. We need them to flip the Senate.
1328495770404786181 2020-11-17 08:30:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jerushahruth @donwinslow @Yahoo The problem is that many people, including myself,  have come to the conclusion that Trumpism is a cult and it’s not going away even after Biden’s win. If we are right it will have to be addressed. I agree that there are productive and unproductive ways to use that term.
1328488177439485954 2020-11-17 08:00:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Concede and get out Trump!
1328487928805400576 2020-11-17 07:59:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You lost Trump and none of this matters now. Why can’t you get this through your thick skull? You are irrelevant and will go down in history as the worst President in our nations history.
1328485165446914048 2020-11-17 07:48:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> Help Ossoff and Warnock win their Georgia races and take back the Senate.
1328484305442660353 2020-11-17 07:45:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> How did this corrupt POS win another term in the Senate?
1328483651844190209 2020-11-17 07:42:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RCampbellmc58 I am very sorry to hear about the loss of your brother. I do not believe it had to be this way.

The question to me is not how easily it is to tamper with election systems, but was their tampering that could not e detected across multiple independent areas of the country.
1328263510497898496 2020-11-16 17:07:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @CalCowboy2020 @SallySellers54 I believe that Christians who voted for Donald Trump put their politics before their religion

1328139239079481345 2020-11-16 08:54:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GreggJarrett @realDonaldTrump If Alito is referring to mask wearing or stopping large gatherings of people during a pandemic, I think he’s lost his ability to use common sense. I know he is a lofty figure on the Supreme Court, but what good is a government if it can’t protect you in a national emergency?
1328116247746187265 2020-11-16 07:22:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> We need both Ossoff and Warnock to win their races to take control of the Senate. Otherwise Biden will be obstructed at every turn by McConnell. Please help them.

1328110589546278917 2020-11-16 07:00:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is what I have been afraid of. The United States of America yearning for a strong man and a dictator. The people who support this view never studied history evidently.
1328094999158853632 2020-11-16 05:58:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> Help these candidates. We need to take control of the Senate.
1328094602163838976 2020-11-16 05:56:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is the crazy stuff politicians do when they are worried more about getting elected than their own country.
1328094036490670087 2020-11-16 05:54:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help Ossoff and Warnock win these Senate seats. We will not be able to get this country back on track until we get control of the Senate.
1328093490539008000 2020-11-16 05:52:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump No Trump. You are the least intelligent politician I have ever seen in my lifetime.
1328093141543612416 2020-11-16 05:50:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews You caused all this Trump. You caused people to distrust our system of vote counting when there was no evidence of it. This is what happens when elect a malevolent narcissist in the White House.
1328082152643235840 2020-11-16 05:07:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LizRNC @afreedomthinker Why don’t you take your claims to court?
1328081748513722370 2020-11-16 05:05:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @charliekirk11 @afreedomthinker If any of you would show some evidence of any fraud that could have had an effect on the election you would have been kicked out of court 9 times. Your claims sound like a red herring.

1328023007290421248 2020-11-16 01:12:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RoxanneOlemeda @WattersWorld Lady, you are what ignorance looks like. Clinton did concede.
1328022030403444741 2020-11-16 01:08:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Your own AG and the Justice Department found no evidence of election fraud that was pervasive enough to change the election results. I guess you are the type of monster that likes to destroy things on your way out, but fact is you will be history on January 20th.
1328007728732778499 2020-11-16 00:11:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich If the evidence was “tremendous “ the courts would have been ruling in your favor, so I have to say that you are full of s**t Trump.
1328006984319250432 2020-11-16 00:08:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Evidence Trump. You never seem to offer any because you are a pathological liar. All I hear is that big mouth of yours. So far our Justice System has found no merit to your claims.
1327979072186687489 2020-11-15 22:17:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @afreedomthinker @DebbieOC2 @IngrahamAngle Wrong. You have yet to show any evidence of widespread voter fraud as hard as this administration has tried to find it. There is even a million dollar reward for those who do. Your problem is you have listened to a conman for over four years and believe every single word he says
1327949059823460352 2020-11-15 20:18:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @marklevinshow It’s too late Levin. You can’t just make a statement and everyone is going to believe you. You see, we have watched this pandemic unfold and people realize the Emporer has no clothes.
1327945187407106048 2020-11-15 20:02:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are the enemy of the people Trump. A man who conned so many people who would be king. Well, you lost the election and now the investigations can begin.
1327943202557595649 2020-11-15 19:55:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @538Is @mtracey And you know this how? Why don’t you take it to court? If you have any evidence to back up your claims, you may get reward money. All I hear is people stating conspiracy theories with no evidence because they believe every word that comes out of Trump’s mouth.
1327940154326208512 2020-11-15 19:42:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BradMossEsq @TerryMoran And we are supposed to listen to a disgraced military traitor for advice on our elections? Your kidding right?
1327939711097245696 2020-11-15 19:41:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> I am so proud of our rank and file Postal Service workers. They are essential public workers in our society and should be funded as such.
1327938031970623488 2020-11-15 19:34:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @brett7three @mtracey @realDonaldTrump Who are you to say what is fraudulent and what is not? Where is your evidence? Why have the courts thrown out all the claims Trump has made? You say “We the People”, but you do not speak for over half of the American Electorate and you believe everything Trump tells you.
1327931772680736772 2020-11-15 19:09:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mtracey @realDonaldTrump Just maybe they were reporting the truth. Don’t believe everything your desperate leader tells you. He will say and do anything to stay in power, such as destroy this country’s faith in their elections. His claims have completely failed in the courts.
1327930662893064193 2020-11-15 19:05:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DebbieOC2 @IngrahamAngle They might think they are patriots, but many of them would like to see their cult leader Trump as President for life. That’s not a patriot, but is a group of gullible people who have put all their faith in one imperfect man. Read some history and see how that always turns out.
1327929295088574464 2020-11-15 18:59:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Amazingly pointless. Do what you told Dems to do in 2016. Accept the election results. I don’t remember anyone crying about fraud and rigged elections, but then again the losers were thinking adults and not a cult.
1327815659363966976 2020-11-15 11:28:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @thehill We have all seen how Mitch McConnell operates in the Senate. Remember when he wouldn’t even give Obama’s Supreme Court pick a hearing? If any of you Dem leaders think Republicans are going to work with you if we don’t offend them, you are living in an alternate reality.
1327813680382291968 2020-11-15 11:20:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> Excellent point.
1327813500446584832 2020-11-15 11:19:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump More lies Kayleigh?
1327813147605004290 2020-11-15 11:18:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> Hey Lou, why would these Republicans stick their neck out for Donald Trump? Trump had the election in his hands and completely blew a response to the pandemic and allow it to take 240,000 American lives. They also know that he lost the election. It isn’t rocket science genius.
1327811286743257088 2020-11-15 11:10:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> Help this candidate win a Georgia Senate seat and take back control of the Senate.
1327805233637060608 2020-11-15 10:46:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> Help this man enable Democrats to take control of the Senate!
1327804559264264192 2020-11-15 10:44:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Are you still running for President Trump? The votes have been cast and there is no way to change them. Voters have made their decision and that is to remove you from office. Make sure you leave the premises by January 20, 2020.
1327802579896717314 2020-11-15 10:36:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DanHenninger Trump is an optimist. While he knew how dangerous the COVID-19 pandemic was going to be, he optimistically told Americans it would magically go away and it was just like the flu. I’ll take an honest pessimist any day over a pathological liar.
1327800655793229824 2020-11-15 10:28:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> Now what would the great Lou Dobbs have said if Hillary Clinton had refused to accept the results of the 2016 Presidential Election?
1327798446745653248 2020-11-15 10:19:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You always make statements like this as if they are proven facts. They are not Trump, but since you made them, your hardcore supporters don’t need any evidence to believe them. How anyone would believe a pathological liar like you, I will never understand.
1327786395847495680 2020-11-15 09:32:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @NYGovCuomo Pfizer said they were not part of Operation Warp Speed. What vaccine are you talking about?
1327785922595860481 2020-11-15 09:30:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Who cares Trump? No matter how many of your die hard supporters are there YOU LOST THE ELECTION!
1327765268119105538 2020-11-15 08:08:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> I would have to say that this guy is an optimist in the extreme or he is doing drugs.
1327754173455200258 2020-11-15 07:23:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> American voters that think our elections are fraudulent should read this.
1327751874095828992 2020-11-15 07:14:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> If we don’t get our two Senate candidates from Georgia into the Senate in January Republicans under Mitch McConnell will block everything Biden tries to do.

1327749407790555136 2020-11-15 07:05:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @morethanmySLE We won’t be dealing with a child in the White House much longer Trump. You are fired!
1327748641247940610 2020-11-15 07:01:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Kayleigh. It just doesn’t matter how many people protest the results of this election. Unless many thousands of ballots are disqualified Biden will be sworn into office in January. You and Trump will have to be out of the White House. Surely you know this.
1327747134947516418 2020-11-15 06:55:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help our two Democratic Senate candidates. They are fighting a massive amount of money.
1327746731732295688 2020-11-15 06:54:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LeadersMaster What is the point if all this. To let off a little steam? It will change nothing.
1327746133406478339 2020-11-15 06:52:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AmbJohnBolton @NPRinskeep @NPR The don’t know about that. Many of his supporters would like to see Trump as President for Life.
1327744366966960128 2020-11-15 06:45:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Take this video in free by of an impartial judge and let the chips fall where they may. Otherwise it’s just scare tactics. To what aim?
1327726525777653767 2020-11-15 05:34:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BeBestPatriot @DanScavino That’s right. No one is going to steal this election. Biden won it and that is a fact. Trump will come around after throwing hand-grenades every where he goes.
1327726110105329666 2020-11-15 05:32:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well said
1327725899349889026 2020-11-15 05:31:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @hray89 @DanScavino The only way he will stay in office is if he takes total power and I do not see that happening.
1327725524337221635 2020-11-15 05:30:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @estanga2017 @DanScavino Maybe Fox doesn’t want to destroy this Republic with false claims of voter fraud.

1327724883233697794 2020-11-15 05:27:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @digital_patri0t @DanScavino We are waiting until they escort Donald Trump out of the White House. Biden won the electoral college and the popular vote. What did you tell Democrat’s in 2016? To get over it? I give you the same advice unless you are yearning for a dictatorship.
1327724288900800515 2020-11-15 05:25:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @alqudess57 @DanScavino You would not know if Trump was a savior sent by God or the Antichrist

1327723361305309184 2020-11-15 05:21:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump This is your doing Trump. We all knew you would try to stay in power no matter what the cost and here you are promoting false conspiracy theories about election fraud. Naturally you have your supporters brainwashed into believing every word you say without evidence. It won’t work
1327722309130530816 2020-11-15 05:17:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I have a better idea Trump. Why don’t you just quit complaining and accept the fact that you were rejected by the majority of Americans. It’s now time to put your big boy pants on and do the manly thing by conceding the election.
1327721590117724160 2020-11-15 05:14:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @CortesSteve I think in the end that voters were  just totally exhausted by Trump and his four year clown show.
1327721150244401152 2020-11-15 05:12:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GhostMusicPast @CortesSteve All this means nothing if Biden won over 270 electoral votes, which he did. Not sure why they are using Twitter. It has a lot fewer users and during that entire election I rarely heard from them. Very strange since they were always so vocal.
1327575218173382659 2020-11-14 19:32:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOP @realDonaldTrump Blah, blah, blah Trump. Just get the hell out of the White House.
1327574492957339654 2020-11-14 19:29:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ScottAdamsSays @realDonaldTrump Why would I accept your statement as fact? People like you keep spreading this BS and gullible Trump supporters accept it without evidence. The simple fact is the President, who is a pathological liar told you this and  you believed it. That’s all you have. Grow up. You LOST!
1327453925734297602 2020-11-14 11:30:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JasonSCampbell Hey Lou, why don’t we do what you suggest in every election. Every time there is a contested election, the losing side refuses to accept the results of the election. The country would fall apart. You are an idiot.
1327450506642468866 2020-11-14 11:17:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jmclghln @realDonaldTrump @gatewaypundit Don’t just claim these things. Take whatever evidence you have and go to court. I am sick and tired of hearing these kind of claims made purely for public consumption that are never taken before a judge.
1327449027407962114 2020-11-14 11:11:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Because they know you lost the election in Georgia Trump. Simple.
1327381540461023232 2020-11-14 06:43:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @cjanthony99 @atrupar It’s hard to comprehend her graduating from college. She seems like the quintessential ditzy blond.
1327377397008764930 2020-11-14 06:26:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @finesonesway @donwinslow @Yahoo If this government really did investigate Trump, I believe he would be charged with crimes. So far, the Republicans have provided cover for him. You also have State Attorney Generals that could bring charges against him. He could resign now and Pence could pardon him.
1327358837427478529 2020-11-14 05:13:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> If he did, all he’ll would break loose.
1327357542792654852 2020-11-14 05:07:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ashleyefitzger1 @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump No Ashley. We just want to follow our election laws and have a peaceful turnover of power. People used to have faith in our elections until Trump says they are unfair and corrupt and just like a thunderclap from heaven, his hardcore supporters believe him. No evidence needed.
1327355641560780802 2020-11-14 05:00:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, quit trying to blame election software. Listen to me carefully. If you were a real President, and you had taken decisive action at the beginning of the pandemic, instead of downplaying it so it would not interfere with your re-election campaign, you would have won, dummy.
1327323891958763520 2020-11-14 02:54:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I hate to break the bad news to you Donald, but being President does not allow you to make dictatorial edicts to our People responsible for our elections in this country. You will be gone soon.
1327290898703654914 2020-11-14 00:43:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ubnsrvd I am very sorry to hear you are infected Rick. If your doctor says go to the hospital, you should go. A close friend of ours had asthma, was infected with COVID, and was getting better when she took a turn for the worst and died. She was a top notch nurse fighting the pandemic.
1327247476131328000 2020-11-13 21:50:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Pattieod @7Veritas4 @GOP You are assuming that the early response to this pandemic would have been the same which I sincerely doubt. I believe Clinton would have responded according to the playbook left by the Obama Administration which Trump ignored and then even worse he downplayed the virus.
1327246255500750856 2020-11-13 21:45:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOP It doesn’t surprise me that you like to ignore all the suffering and death during this pandemic due to this president’s selfishness and incompetence and the GOP’s deafening silence about it. You cannot escape your responsibility for so many things during the last four years.
1327206889214578689 2020-11-13 19:09:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> So Trump is right about election fraud and these agencies are wrong? Don’t think so. For some reason the President’s most ardent supporters believe his every word without question.
1327202882140184576 2020-11-13 18:53:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Quimby_Jones @TheLeadCNN @kaitlancollins I agree with you. After four years of chaos and corruption, that this election was even close worries me more than anything about the future of this. country.
1327092526537445376 2020-11-13 11:34:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @andrewzimmern Rand Paul. He’s not a doctor, but a loud mouthed politician. Why would anyone listen to him pontificate on a pandemic?
1327091825128181760 2020-11-13 11:32:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> Very impressive Trump. I don’t know if you ever realized this but you can’t do anything right.
1327091164827283458 2020-11-13 11:29:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jefftimmer Fox, your witnesses of election fraud are pathetic. Is this the best you can do? If it is, you had better stop right now before you make complete fools of yourselves
1327089565157519372 2020-11-13 11:23:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @traderider @marklevinshow Mark didn’t answer because he knows the answer to that is HELL NO. Republicans cannot even come up any evidence of widespread voter fraud so they will not be going to the Supreme Court.
1327088769779064833 2020-11-13 11:19:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Crypto_Gospel @marklevinshow Trump’s supporters are some of the most gullible people on this planet. What ever Don the Con says, they believe it without question. He lost because he was an idiot and a fool.
1327088039928221699 2020-11-13 11:16:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Tlong112068 @marklevinshow Prove it. Mark my words, no one will find and prove any widespread voter fraud because it isn’t there. Most of Trump’s supporters believe every word that comes out of his mouth.
1327087256721616899 2020-11-13 11:13:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jjwangmo @marklevinshow No one has shown any widespread election fraud. Now just because Don the Con says there is election fraud his supporters are sure of it. I think they look at him like the followers of Jim Jones. It’s the adulation of one man ultimately leading to an autocratic government.
1327085703642161153 2020-11-13 11:07:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Flolady @marklevinshow Because Trump is an obvious conman and narcissist. His dumb ass lost an election he could have won easily, if he had only responded to a national emergency instead of downplaying the virus so it wouldn’t interfere with his re-election campaign. The man is a complete moron.
1327084470390939651 2020-11-13 11:02:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BrockDobie @marklevinshow You are big on dog whistles aren’t you?

1327083959474413568 2020-11-13 11:00:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @marklevinshow Mark Levin. You are supposed to be a smart guy, but your tweet is absolutely ridiculous. You and people like you can not even come up with any evidence of widespread election fraud and you are reduced to ignorant little quips like this one. Pathetic.
1327081431730966529 2020-11-13 10:50:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC It’s obvious. The only thing Trump cares about is power and getting re-elected. He could care less about this country or it’s citizens.
1327079144660885507 2020-11-13 10:41:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> Yes. It’s hard to believe unless you view Trumpism as a full blown cult.
1327078756876476416 2020-11-13 10:40:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Just because your tweets are all in caps doesn’t make what you state true Trump. You lost the election. Nothing you can legally do is ever going to change that. I know you are a sick human being but all you are doing now is destroying Americans faith in our election system.
1327038740070604800 2020-11-13 08:01:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is what entitled rich people do.
1327038149449670657 2020-11-13 07:58:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow I got out of Facebook some time ago because it is a cesspool of lies and propaganda. I firmly believe Zuckerberg is a hardcore Trump supporter.

1327036794228121600 2020-11-13 07:53:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @therecount @addysbaird McCarthy is either an idiot or  is just pandering for votes from some of the most gullible people on the planet.
1327032090420973568 2020-11-13 07:34:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> You Trump supporters want to talk about voter fraud?
1327031076712308738 2020-11-13 07:30:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnKennedy @MariaBartiromo @TheJusticeDept And what should be done with you Trump? You are a traitor to your own country, totally corrupt and would have been America’s first dictator. I want you tried publicly and sentenced to life in prison.
1326882713996025859 2020-11-12 21:41:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> You see how this goes. Trump and his Republican sycophants cheat by installing a corrupt Trump junkie as Postmaster General and then proceed to lose the election anyway. They then claim voter fraud as a way to delegitimize a legitimate election. This cancer must be removed.
1326860921663352833 2020-11-12 20:14:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump This particular group of Trump devotees has been reduced to offering very large monetary rewards to dig up some evidence of voter fraud. Need money? Make something up.
1326856696547995648 2020-11-12 19:57:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Are you asking a question because you have no idea, or are you trying to create doubt in voters minds? Pretty sure it’s the later dirtbag.
1326855694566428672 2020-11-12 19:53:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump Take it to court then, boy. What are you waiting for?
1326855291669983238 2020-11-12 19:52:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @johnrobertsFox So polls show 80% of voters have accepted Biden winning the election. What are you trying to promote FOX?
1326812022718287872 2020-11-12 17:00:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump We were right about you Trump. Only a President who would have been America’s first dictator would do what you are doing now. You would destroy this country to stay in power.
1326682036065677313 2020-11-12 08:23:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are a liar Trump, so why should anyone believe what you say?
1326646650878701568 2020-11-12 06:03:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> They can’t
1326646299647741955 2020-11-12 06:01:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @fawfulfan Should this country have done a poll before freeing the slaves,giving women the right to vote or voting in the Civil Rights Act? This is not a plan to get rid of law enforcement all together, but to have other better trained and equipped people to do mental health and social work
1326643777692381184 2020-11-12 05:51:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @falkingJudy @axios If these Republicans cannot produce some evidence of these claims then it’s all conjecture and rumor. So far no one has seen any evidence. The American people have spoken and according to all election laws Biden won. Period.
1326640298324357124 2020-11-12 05:37:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump No one can get anything definitive from video, because it could all be staged. The “ballots” could have been collected and not counted. Take this “evidence” to a judge and let the judicial system sort it out. It does no good to post it on Twitter unless you just want to sow doubt
1326594480225587201 2020-11-12 02:35:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump There is no shame in investigating a bunch of traitorous dirtbags colluding with the Russian Government.
1326593889260736517 2020-11-12 02:33:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RyanAFournier Hyperbole without evidence. Is that all you have?
1326587463897403394 2020-11-12 02:07:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BigtorBigtor @Ira_s36 @ABC @realDonaldTrump He said he wasn’t a “fan” of the war but did not protest against it. He just made sure he got 5 deferments including one for “bone spurs” and thanks to his wealthy father avoided having to go into combat. Most young men who fought and died in that country did not have that option
1326580096975708161 2020-11-12 01:38:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> I can understand Trump and his most loyal staff promoting these fabrications, but what really galls me are the Congressional Republicans who refuse to stand up and accept the vote counts knowing Trump lost in a free and fair election.
1326571068442767360 2020-11-12 01:02:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I am personally glad that they investigated your campaign’s connections with the Russian government. They did exactly what they are tasked to do.
1326570609510330369 2020-11-12 01:00:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ScottAdamsSays Talk is cheap Scott. That’s all you MAGA hats have. Talk. I say you don’t have any proof of anything you promote. That makes you an empty bag of air, causing damage to faith in our system of elections. To what aim?
1326569265567248394 2020-11-12 00:55:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump It’s not a “big win”. For it to be a big win, it would have to be enough votes to change this election. We all know this whole charade is for you to cause gullible Americans to doubt our election system. Anything you touch, you destroy Trump.
1326567562365300741 2020-11-12 00:48:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are a great example of a pompous loud mouthed fool Trump. McCabe is a genius compared to you.
1326566623692673024 2020-11-12 00:45:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I would believe him before you any day.
1326333958582382592 2020-11-11 09:20:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs I have never seen a man more desperate to avoid being exposed as the fraud and conman that you are. Even worse a traitor to his own country. I got bad news for you Trump. Whatever you do is not going to work.
1326306169447657472 2020-11-11 07:30:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @StanGott This resignation should show you that the Trump Administration and Barr are just throwing hand grenades for no other purpose than to delegitimize our elections in this country and it’s working. Madness.
1326304648706322435 2020-11-11 07:24:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews  https://t.co/aKPhdRBP70
1326273968588906496 2020-11-11 05:22:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich The man is a pompous ass. I will be glad to see him gone.
1326272871891693574 2020-11-11 05:17:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich The question is, for what purpose? If he were to attempt to take over the government using the military, I believe it would get very messy almost immediately and ultimately blow up in Trump’s face.
1326223522541211650 2020-11-11 02:01:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> What are they? True Trump believers or dirtbags looking for a shot at fame?
1326222911489892352 2020-11-11 01:59:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You already lost. How can you win?
1326221888738177027 2020-11-11 01:55:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> I say we just ignore Trump’s rants. When the votes are counted and the frivolous lawsuits have been dismissed, Biden will still be the President.
1326221284519383040 2020-11-11 01:52:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Do you and your supporters only cry about States rights when it suits you Trump. States run their own elections.
1326193005099954181 2020-11-11 00:00:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump We know what you are doing Trump. You are trying to stay in power by convincing your supporters to believe there is massive fraud in our elections. We never had a problem before you came along and I noticed that you didn’t claim fraud the last election only because you won.
1326183307453804544 2020-11-10 23:21:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> This shows the difference between a malevolent madman and the President of the United States. The point will be lost on Trump’s hardcore supporters.
1326182699212664832 2020-11-10 23:19:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump All you will be able to do Trump is tear this country apart. Hopefully you fail and end up in prison.
1326182442550652929 2020-11-10 23:18:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo It will be many months before that vaccine is widely available. The Idiot in Chief would say absolutely anything to win the Presidency and has lied countless times. Your entire tweet amounts to nothing.
1326181313456508928 2020-11-10 23:13:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump This tells me Ronnie Jackson is an idiot like this President. I’ll bet Trump had nothing to do with it. Besides, Pfizer never was associated with operation warp speed.
1326137002094452736 2020-11-10 20:17:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @anhtran93215008 @BreitbartNews Trump is the swamp. You hardcore followers have lost your ability to think rationally.
1326131989968248832 2020-11-10 19:57:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @koskidaddy @BreitbartNews It means absolutely nothing.
1326089632572956675 2020-11-10 17:09:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @theat171 @BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump You don’t know any of what you said. Show us some evidence instead of spreading what you have been spoon fed. That Trump has such a hold on you people shows me you area cult.
1326088327435595776 2020-11-10 17:04:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> We need the Senate. Please donate to the two Georgia Senate candidates in a special election in January.
1325966677490749440 2020-11-10 09:01:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @US_FDA You are an idiot that knows nothing Trump. Can’t wait until you are put on trial.
1325966259121479682 2020-11-10 08:59:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @pfizer @US_FDA You poor baby Trump. I guess no one likes your sorry ass. You lost. Get over it.
1325962697868009473 2020-11-10 08:45:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help elect Ossoff and Warnock as Georgia State Senators in the upcoming special election in January. Help make history by flipping the Senate on January 7th.
1325960203469205504 2020-11-10 08:35:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BrianKempGA I think he just said that to mollify the man child in the White House. There will be very few “illegal” votes,  if any.
1325935428357206016 2020-11-10 06:56:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Newsweek @donwinslow I say you better make sure the lunatic ends up on prison for life after the investigations and trials are over.
1325934416036818944 2020-11-10 06:52:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JesseBWatters First of all, lets get this straight. McConnell and his hardcore Republicans have never worked with the Dems during the last four years under Donald Trump, so listening to you cry about Dems pushing through an agenda is laughable. Personally, I would destroy Trumpism if I could.
1325873870281318403 2020-11-10 02:52:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is all because of the profit motive in journalism. Doesn’t matter if it’s bad or good for the country, as long as it produces good ratings.
1325872886431748099 2020-11-10 02:48:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump How any thinking adult would consider working for a petulant child like you is beyond me Trump. Besides, you won’t be around much longer.
1325857470636552192 2020-11-10 01:47:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> Good question
1325854042829037568 2020-11-10 01:33:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help these candidates win their elections.
1325853757469548546 2020-11-10 01:32:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> I predict Trump will not concede and will instead whip us his base by claiming voter fraud. This is who he has been his entire life.
1325852000437891073 2020-11-10 01:25:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ladiesgun @SallySellers54 The Republican problem is that when large numbers on people vote in a democratic election in this country, Republicans tend to lose. So what do they do? Try to make it more difficult to vote. They may blame it on election fraud, but the evidence says that’s just not the case.
1325848282686517249 2020-11-10 01:10:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> You have to wonder why any politician with good intentions would oppose this bill.
1325783489732616194 2020-11-09 20:53:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You lost Trump, because you are a complete idiot. You threw away victory when you refused to confront the virus because you did not want it to interfere with your re-election. Your narcissism backfired on you fool.
1325782760829689864 2020-11-09 20:50:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KLoeffler In all the years that we have listened to the “Socialism” dog whistle, did it ever really happen. No. We live in a corporatocracy.
1325773428998213640 2020-11-09 20:13:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @gms1985smg @KLoeffler I believe they should run from Trump. But they are cowards who are only concerned with being re-elected.
1325725655221362690 2020-11-09 17:03:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> Mommy told him to do it.
1325724343847018496 2020-11-09 16:58:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> I would love to see these dirtbag cowards go to prison
1325589012392931328 2020-11-09 08:00:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> The politicians in this videos are political whores. Anything goes in their never ending quest for money and power.
1325588652005732353 2020-11-09 07:58:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> I want to see these people held accountable for their actions.
1325588160047419392 2020-11-09 07:57:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ashtonpittman What a bunch of morons
1325587644022214656 2020-11-09 07:54:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> Christie is a pathetic politician who would do or say anything to stay relevant and is the same man who coached Trump on how to cause Biden to stutter during the debates. The man is disgusting
1325585572862316544 2020-11-09 07:46:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> Help these two Democratic candidates in Georgia’s Senate election. We have to flip the United States Senate.
1325584863190257672 2020-11-09 07:43:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> How true. I have absolutely no respect for that disgusting ex politician.
1325582540397285376 2020-11-09 07:34:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump supporters. This President is conning you again.
1325581913520807937 2020-11-09 07:32:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is very true. McConnell will NOT work with Democrats and has already stated that he will not approve Biden’s Cabinet choices. We need to take over the Senate and the only way to do that is to win both Georgia Senate special elections.
1325564032691163136 2020-11-09 06:21:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well sad.
1325563623578669058 2020-11-09 06:19:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC Who cares what Blunt brain says.
1325562897376948225 2020-11-09 06:16:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Jim_Jordan You are a loud mouthed joke Jordan. You boy lost the election so I don’t care what you remember or forget.
1325560307754946560 2020-11-09 06:06:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help Jon Ossoff flip the Senate and change the course of history.
1325560014317215744 2020-11-09 06:05:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> Help this man change history by flipping the Senate.
1325558686450905089 2020-11-09 05:59:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> That man was awesome with his intelligence and his class.
1325557573798518790 2020-11-09 05:55:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help these two candidates make Mitch the Enabler McConnell a minority leader of the Senate.
1325556933173108737 2020-11-09 05:52:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> I know Biden wants to unite the country, but there must be some accountability for the corruption going on under Trump’s Administration.
1325556045129932802 2020-11-09 05:49:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @StanGott She’s just a loud mouthed Trump cult member so no one will miss much.
1325555059820802048 2020-11-09 05:45:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are not a man Trump. You are a 74 year old crybaby. You failed as a President and you failed to win the election. I predict nothing you do will ever change those two facts.
1325501006755540992 2020-11-09 02:10:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump It’s over Trump. You lost.
1325488673127768064 2020-11-09 01:21:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help Jon Ossoff win a Georgia Senate seat in a special election in January. We can still flip the Senate.
1325488151037677568 2020-11-09 01:19:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> Help this man win his Senate seat in Georgia. We can flip the Senate.
1325487871265017858 2020-11-09 01:18:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> Help Biden out by supporting candidates Ossoff and Warnock in their Senate races in Georgia. We need to flip the Senate away from Mitch McConnell.
1325486835242504194 2020-11-09 01:14:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help Georgia Senate candidates Ossoff and Warnock win this special election in January. It is the only way we can take control of the Senate in January and is the best thing we can do for President Biden.
1325364742215577600 2020-11-08 17:09:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @marcorubio Rubio, you are the most disgusting type of politician there is. The type that sold their soul to the devil for political gain.
1325363645371592705 2020-11-08 17:04:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> It is vital that Dems win these two elections. We could evict Mitch McConnell from leadership and take over the Senate for President Biden. Please help these two candidates.
1325241915089031169 2020-11-08 09:01:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @bradheath If he was asking for immunity I would tell him that he can go straight to hell.
1325240444419268608 2020-11-08 08:55:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @beccaspearce @MaddowBlog @maddow I agree and completely understand. The Republicans who enabled this future autocrat have not changed. I still view them as cowardly traitors.
1325239009564631044 2020-11-08 08:49:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> Thank you Navajo Nation!
1325236515056791553 2020-11-08 08:39:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich Maybe they lost their fear of Trump World. I wish we had some Republicans in Congress that had some kahunas and cared about something other than their re-election.
1325224918703804417 2020-11-08 07:53:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> We need to bring back the Fairness Doctrine. To do that we need control of the Senate. Please support the two Democrats in Georgia running for the Senate. Ossoff and Warnock.
1325222861716459521 2020-11-08 07:45:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> Chip in and help these two candidates for the Senate.
1325222053486751745 2020-11-08 07:42:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please support Senate candidates Ossoff and Warnock in the upcoming Georgia special election and help flip the Senate!
1325221451323072516 2020-11-08 07:39:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow You poured your heart, soul and money into this effort Don. Thank you!
1325220902615871489 2020-11-08 07:37:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please help Senate candidates Ossoff and Warnock win the Georgia special election in January. If they prevail, we can take control of the Senate and help Biden make the changes we need in this country.
1325218450797719555 2020-11-08 07:27:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DeanSmi28114343 @seanhannity No scam. Most Americans just had enough of Trump. If the fool had just responded to the pandemic like an American President should have, he would have won handily, but since he was a full blown narcissist, it was not in him.
1325216811265220614 2020-11-08 07:21:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BreitbartNews Breitbart, no one gives a damn. The lunatic you helped become President is now relegated to the dustbin of history.
1325216092302811138 2020-11-08 07:18:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, why don’t you be a man for once and face the fact that A LOT of people knew you were not Presidential material from the beginning and many others became disillusioned with your selfish incompetence. Just quit crying like a spoiled toddler. People are sick and tired of it.
1325148822218084352 2020-11-08 02:51:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @APWUnational I want to thank you and all Postal workers for keeping the faith in the face of the hurdles thrown in front of you.
1325147689806262273 2020-11-08 02:46:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I consider you a man that has been a loser his entire life not just as President. History will have nothing redeeming to say about you. I believe your father had a lot to do with the miserable human being you turned out to be, but you had a choice and you chose unwisely.
1325137265920602112 2020-11-08 02:05:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @knight32_nate @newsbreakApp Do you know how many people over generations have used the socialism scare tactic to keep the government under the control of the people with money and power? We have been a nation that has had socialist policies and programs for nearly 100 years.
1325105138864885760 2020-11-07 23:57:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shannonrwatts @donwinslow If we want these things we had better flip the Senate. There is a special. runoff election in Georgia on January 5. Please support Senate candidates Warnock and Ossoff in that race.
1325104104474079232 2020-11-07 23:53:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow Just another one of Trump’s arrogant morons.
1325103514788503554 2020-11-07 23:51:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BlackBrandy6 @IngrahamAngle Not everyone jumped on the Trump train. Many were disgusted at Trump as he took a Party that was known for civility and elevated rhetoric to one that believes in political knife fighting,  a cult worship of one man, and a winner take all attitude no matter what the consequences.
1325029162189529089 2020-11-07 18:55:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @paulsperry_ @realDonaldTrump Does this mean there is fraud in the process? No.
1325028371374485504 2020-11-07 18:52:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @paulsperry_ @realDonaldTrump Election officials in every state have rules about this situation to make sure you do not vote twice.   https://t.co/IldIz04q9S
1325026554661892097 2020-11-07 18:45:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @EveningEdit People voted against you Trump. You are a self described genius and you haven’t figured that out yet?
1325026138805112833 2020-11-07 18:43:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TomBevanRCP @realDonaldTrump Like rats abandoning a sinking ship, FOX has made a calculated decision to stop being Trump’s personal propaganda arm because they know he is a doomed candidate. The Senate Republican leaders are doing the same thing as most of them were never true believers, just opportunists.
1324887286648102913 2020-11-07 09:31:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> To me, they are both cold blooded evil people so her statement does make some sense.
1324856855944982535 2020-11-07 07:31:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @tedcruz Cruz, a man like you, who like the President,  cares only about political power should never have been elected to public office. You are a disgrace, just like the man who accused your father of being involved in the Kennedy Assassination.
1324855004612743174 2020-11-07 07:23:42 +0800 <VenaAlan>  https://t.co/D5CeoPSosk
1324853355634720768 2020-11-07 07:17:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please support Rafael Warnock in Georgia’s special election runoff. We could take control of the Senate for a Biden Presidency.
1324826298586406912 2020-11-07 05:29:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> This article is a good reality check about where we are at this point in this country’s history.
1324824261652025349 2020-11-07 05:21:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is our chance to flip the Senate. Please support Dem candidate Raphael Warnock in the upcoming Georgia special election.
1324822894464159745 2020-11-07 05:16:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @Yahoo I couldn’t be an advisor to Trump. I would feel like strangling him all the time.
1324781983743025152 2020-11-07 02:33:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump We don’t know that and neither do you Trump. Most people know  you are as desperate as a cornered rat and will say and do anything to stay in power. You realize your Republican sycophants will ultimately abandon you if they regard you as a sinking ship, which you are, don’t you?
1324781014120615940 2020-11-07 02:29:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich I don’t think you are wrong. He will do everything in his power to avoid admitting defeat. Not sure I’d Republicans will support him though. He is a case of damaged goods.
1324780170889355266 2020-11-07 02:26:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @Varneyco @FoxBusiness Prove what you say for once Trump.
1324779810900582400 2020-11-07 02:24:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> They know Trump is losing so all of a sudden they are bravely not supporting ever stupid thing this President says or does.
1324675889976791041 2020-11-06 19:31:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please retweet this far and wide in Georgia.
1324673964514443269 2020-11-06 19:24:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Why do you say that Trump? Is it because you, the President of the United States is continually and mercilessly slammed by so many of it’s citizens on this platform? It’s called freedom of speech Trump. You will not get the chance to become an authoritarian dictator.
1324575537986183168 2020-11-06 12:53:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @idrealist1 I guess the Trump family is incapable of thinking about anyone but themselves and therefore do not make good decisions
1324575166526087170 2020-11-06 12:51:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @billmckibben @nytimes That was a good one Bill. I am hoping beyond hope that we win the special election in Georgia, take control of the Senate and actually respond to climate change as a country and a planet.
1324574248422137857 2020-11-06 12:48:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, face it. You are a loser in every sense of the word. You will be replaced by Joe Biden and you know it. You have reached the end of the line and now it is time to pay the price. It’s been a long time coming, but we have you in our grasp.
1324573372949417984 2020-11-06 12:44:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @staceyabrams Thank you for everything you do Stacey.
1324527738812796928 2020-11-06 09:43:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @carriecordero @SallySellers54 @FBI Is this Bannon’s idea of a democracy? What the hell did either one of these men do? Is this the kind of people Trumpism produces?
1324526189185245184 2020-11-06 09:37:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow This woman appears to be  insane and it’s very concerning that a President of the United States actually listening to her.
1324520435757817858 2020-11-06 09:14:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> What a complete idiot. One of Trump’s “best people” I guess.
1324519091701534721 2020-11-06 09:08:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Since all the votes have not been counted, I would have to say that you are dead wrong about that, Trump. The sooner you are gone, the better.
1324465559157805057 2020-11-06 05:36:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> Postal workers have secured our democracy in a time of pandemic. Join me in thanking them here. @USMailNot4Sale #SaveThePostOffice #EveryVoteCounts  https://t.co/iKMSmaRGoj
1324461202043555848 2020-11-06 05:18:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate I would like to say that I know of blatant election fraud in the Postal Service. The Trump appointee in charge knowingly slowed down the mail delivery of absentee ballots to help Donald Trump win the Presidential Election.
1324424693009551360 2020-11-06 02:53:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump is getting desperate because he knows what his future holds. Lots of time in courtrooms and ultimately prison time. I am going to enjoy watching the spectacle.
1324423953864105986 2020-11-06 02:50:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls @WSJ I  won’t have to listen to you much longer, Cruella. You will be irrelevant.
1324190584077168645 2020-11-05 11:23:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, looks like your day of reckoning is upon you. All your secrets exposed after months of investigations and everyone will see you for what you really are. Your hardcore supporters will deny it but everyone else will know what a dirtbag you really are. May you rot in prison.
1324186194092109831 2020-11-05 11:06:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls Trump loses. That will have to do. At least I won’t be hearing from Cruella anymore.
1324124200093757440 2020-11-05 06:59:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You can blame the idiots in the Republican Legislature that mandates votes cannot be counted until after the election is over, Trump. Don’t cry to us.
1324123263270817792 2020-11-05 06:56:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Devastating to who Trump? Has to be you because you do not care about anyone but yourself.
1323995816193937408 2020-11-04 22:29:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DHBerman @svdate What is the reasoning behind that rule? Another attempt to manipulate election results in states with Republican Legislatures?
1323995241469431809 2020-11-04 22:27:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> Yes, half the country are easy marks for an authoritarian conman named Donald Trump. This after all the chaos and loss everyone witnessed during the past four years.
1323802400776400899 2020-11-04 09:41:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow Hopefully they are not serious, but I have to give them credit for being polite.
1323733979284021249 2020-11-04 05:09:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @Yahoo Little hands Rubio. Only a bought and paid for politician like you would support this reckless behavior by Trump’s supporters as they interfered with our country’s system of elections. Imagine if all voters acted this way.
1323728789973749761 2020-11-04 04:48:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump, what a crybaby
1323726004456738817 2020-11-04 04:37:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> Words of wisdom
1323725134524534792 2020-11-04 04:34:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> To Trump, winning is everything, even if his actions cause the deaths of his own supporters.
1323722944703614976 2020-11-04 04:25:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @HouseGOP Approximately half of them think he is the greatest President this country has ever seen. Something is terribly wrong with the American Electorate
1323722288957632512 2020-11-04 04:22:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump and his cronies are destroying our Elections system in this country. VOTE HIM OUT!
1323721256991150080 2020-11-04 04:18:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Just think for a moment about the chaos surrounding this President as he ignored the Constitution, acted like a crime boss out of the White House leading to his impeachment and ignored a pandemic leading to 230,000 deaths which trashed the economy. Is the country better off? No.
1323718460451545088 2020-11-04 04:07:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @PeteButtigieg I will be overjoyed, but at the same time I realize that Trump and his sycophants are just a symptom of something terribly wrong with the American Electorate. After the last four years of chaos and 230,000 Americans dead, the fact that this election is close, is inconceivable.
1323715080756801537 2020-11-04 03:54:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is a conman and a carnival barker. He always speaks like that.
1323714684931969025 2020-11-04 03:52:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump They are used to dictatorships Trump. We aren’t.
1323581081992548352 2020-11-03 19:01:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> 40% of the American Electorate is primed and ready for America’s first dictatorship. This may be our only chance to stop Trump. Today, whatever it takes, VOTE HIM OUT!
1323443184370896897 2020-11-03 09:53:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> America, you have been warned.
1323442381576962048 2020-11-03 09:50:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are not going to save America Trump. You will destroy America. Your supporters will realize this too late to stop the slide into authoritarianism.
1323440009140178951 2020-11-03 09:41:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Let me guess Trump. You are the only one who can save the country. The fact is that you are dividing and destroying this country. You have a lot of people fooled, but you never did fool me or millions of other Americans. We are going to be your undoing and your day of reckoning.
1323420622358269954 2020-11-03 08:23:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> In Florida a Governor named Scott ordered an 18 month investigation of voter fraud and found nothing, zip, zero. This whole voter fraud issue is just a path to steal an election, that’s all.
1323419718867394560 2020-11-03 08:20:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> How many times are you going to run to this dog whistle, gun owners?
1323419357154807808 2020-11-03 08:18:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You will not get away with your attempts to divide this country much longer Trump.
1323418077745324033 2020-11-03 08:13:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> A great guide to understand most Trump supporters.
1323417747477483522 2020-11-03 08:12:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> The key to understanding Trump World.
1323416885141082113 2020-11-03 08:09:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> Vote like your life depends on it, because it does.
1323416139129622534 2020-11-03 08:06:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump And your plan is to ignore the virus and let it kill whoever it will. That’s the plan of a sociopath. Everything you touch dies Trump.
1323415506389487616 2020-11-03 08:03:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well said.
1323415149093527558 2020-11-03 08:02:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> Did you every wonder why Trump supporters follow a con man like Trump?
1323414737909129225 2020-11-03 08:00:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> This video helps to explain why so many people in this country believe every word Trump says. Hopefully it will make his supporters think about who they are supporting to lead this country.
1323402429342322688 2020-11-03 07:11:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please don’t sit this one out. Voting is one of the few things your country asks of you and your country needs you RIGHT NOW! Make a pledge to vote tomorrow not matter what.
1323401063836360706 2020-11-03 07:06:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> If we win, we need to make some long overdue changes in elections laws and make it easier for citizens to vote. Make Election Day a National Holiday for one.
1323399383732391938 2020-11-03 06:59:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow Can’t wait. What happened to the American Electorate to lead us to this?
1323399062855602177 2020-11-03 06:58:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is your last chance to make history tomorrow. Don’t look back and regret what you could have done to save this country from a slide to an authoritarian government. Please vote tomorrow without fail.
1323397427978817537 2020-11-03 06:51:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You know what is laughable Trump? When I see your commercials showing pictures of you, otherwise known as private bonespurs, with the words courage and strength. You are neither of those things Trump. You are a farce and a disgrace to this country.
1323396280727576577 2020-11-03 06:47:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump No, you are a future dictator Trump. You only care for yourself
1323395248190558214 2020-11-03 06:43:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You literally are the swamp Trump. Hopefully we will start draining it tomorrow, Trump.
1323394815787237378 2020-11-03 06:41:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Only you, after causing 230,000 Americans death through your selfishness and incompetence would have the unmitigated gall to criticize someone else’s handling of a health crisis. All I can feel for you Trump is total disgust.
1323393949671870469 2020-11-03 06:37:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate Tell your husband to stop misbehaving and all that would stop. Ever think about that?
1323393677692182528 2020-11-03 06:36:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump How many people died of COVID in Ohio Trump?
1323393101336092672 2020-11-03 06:34:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump What are you doing with a bank account over there Trump? What is it for?
1323392837828907014 2020-11-03 06:33:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I say you are a liar Trump. Show us your tax returns and prove me wrong. The IRS says you can release them but you and I know you never will, because it would show everyone what you really are. A liar and a fraud.
1323392143377969154 2020-11-03 06:30:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I am hoping that most American adults realize that this is plain old fear mongering to get re-elected. Remember Joe McCarthy in the 1950’s and his war on imaginary Communists? People finally got fed up and voted him out. Hopefully, people will wise up and kick Trump out as well.
1323389004977446913 2020-11-03 06:18:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Every time you say that Trump, you sound like a simpleton, an imbecile and a moron. You, the President of the United States are all those things and worse.
1323310129442365443 2020-11-03 01:04:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow I think Trump wants to know how loyal his supporters are. I think they would vote for him no matter how bad he screwed them over.
1323309728873799680 2020-11-03 01:03:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, you support goon squads with guns harassing political opponents. That is something you see in tin pot dictatorships around the world. Don’t try to tell me you and they did nothing wrong.
1323308959726555137 2020-11-03 01:00:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump I think Trump is on something. I know Don Jr is on something.
1323308750686617603 2020-11-03 00:59:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump makes all sorts of promises but never delivers. Kind of like a conman.
1323308556456779778 2020-11-03 00:58:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls @USATODAY Carson, I have no idea why you would like to see Trump remain on office for four more years. I have been told you are a doctor, so tell me you did not see anything wrong with Trump’s response to a pandemic. Actually there was no response and 230,000 American are dead.
1323307786713944068 2020-11-03 00:55:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump No one is taking your guns. Does anyone realize how hard that would be? Trump will do and say anything to get re-elected.
1323224560938979330 2020-11-02 19:24:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jefftimmer @donwinslow The man is a pig. Don’t do it ladies.
1323224138413154304 2020-11-02 19:23:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Don’t you have a large bank account there Trump? Words from your mouth mean absolutely nothing.
1323223697138868226 2020-11-02 19:21:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> To all my fellow Floridians that have not voted. You could literally make history by ending this country’s national nightmare by your vote. Don’t let anything stop you. VOTE!
1323222912049074184 2020-11-02 19:18:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> I am so proud of your daughter Bill. There is hope for America’s future. Please tell her.
1323109644961722368 2020-11-02 11:48:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ossoff @donwinslow You drove him into silence Jon.
1323105468257099776 2020-11-02 11:31:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> What are these grown men afraid of?  https://t.co/bj6vwx5WqJ
1323082568426803200 2020-11-02 10:00:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate Trump will take this to the Courts. Will the Supreme Court rule in his favor?
1323080830965731329 2020-11-02 09:53:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is a must read article about what may happen on Election Night and in the days that follow. Trump will attempt to declare himself President before all the mail in votes are counted.
1323066627630522369 2020-11-02 08:57:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Hey moron. He didn’t kill 230,000 Americans by his incompetence and you did. Sit down and shut up.
1323066247186178048 2020-11-02 08:55:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are full of shit Trump. You would say and do anything to get re-elected because you know your day of reckoning has come.
1323061995294187520 2020-11-02 08:38:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> They will never explain this hypocrisy. Trump has something on both these men.
1323060120486580228 2020-11-02 08:31:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> What a bunch of morons.
1323059513713446914 2020-11-02 08:29:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> When do these people get arrested?
1323058364826439683 2020-11-02 08:24:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @FBI Somebody better do something about it.
1323057981475463170 2020-11-02 08:22:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> I voted for Biden/Harris and progressive candidates. Get out there and vote. You will help make history.
1323057397515124741 2020-11-02 08:20:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> Absolutely. It’s obvious to any thinking person.
1323035963040423939 2020-11-02 06:55:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You could care less about God or children Trump. You only care for yourself.
1323035488928804864 2020-11-02 06:53:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I don’t know who told you that you were the all time favorite President, but the fact of the matter is you are the worst a President in our history.
1323035069473280006 2020-11-02 06:51:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You and your Republican traitors have already packed the Court fool, so I could care less what you think about Biden. You better win this election or hope that the Supreme Court saves you because myself and many others want you to rot in prison.
1322980044675960834 2020-11-02 03:13:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump This is what you get when you elect a conman and criminal to the office of POTUS.
1322969429735575552 2020-11-02 02:31:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @PilotswifePA @svdate @draiochta14 If you think what these Trump supporters did was right, you are helping to destroy our political system in this country. Any person running for office should be able to go anywhere in this country to talk to voters, or would you like to see one party rule and a dictatorship?
1322968161629708292 2020-11-02 02:26:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You inherited a good economy dummy and because you did not take action to combat the pandemic, you trashed the economy. You did nothing on both counts. You are worse than worthless.
1322967590420008960 2020-11-02 02:23:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I think most people are doing just that Trump. They are defending America by voting you out.
1322967164920516610 2020-11-02 02:22:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Your sources? Sounds like you are backing off on that lie. So unlike you Trump. If you were a man and not a spoiled preteen, you would apologize, but you never do and never will. Let’s face it Trump. You are not and have ever been Presidential material. You are a loser.
1322904514605797378 2020-11-01 22:13:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> If the courts support this view, all I can say is that a Judicial coup has already happened.
1322903623597248513 2020-11-01 22:09:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Wrong again Trump. You can’t even keep your lies straight can you. Biden never said what you claim you idiot.
1322903111401414658 2020-11-01 22:07:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump It’s just like you to ignore the loss of life that you have caused by ignoring the pandemic. After 230,000 Americans died, you have not changed at all. Those are the actions of a sociopath Trump. That is what you are.
1322880529998503936 2020-11-01 20:37:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> To all you Trump supporters. Is this behavior ok with you? Should both sides be able to stop the opposing parties from speaking in a state? If your answer is yes, you have abandoned any desire to keep the Democratic norms we have enjoyed since our inception as a nation.
1322867910382129155 2020-11-01 19:47:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> Where is the Secret Service Protection?
1322867343165456391 2020-11-01 19:45:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> Show the world that Americans have not lost their minds. VOTE TRUMP OUT!
1322735129509376000 2020-11-01 11:00:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RzstProgramming @donwinslow Where the police?
1322734172927045632 2020-11-01 10:56:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> Don Jr is as irresponsible as his father. The bad seed has passed from father to son for generations in that family.
1322732596560887814 2020-11-01 10:50:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You were never an American President Trump whether you won the election or not Trump. You do not have any of the attributes that make a President. You are simply a conman, someone who our Founding Fathers had nightmares about.
1322730368982765570 2020-11-01 10:41:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Karoli @storiesbyrusty If there is violence, Trump promoted it. He is not a President, he is simply a future American dictator.
1322723288473313280 2020-11-01 10:13:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I am positive they could have accomplished their mission without you Bonespurs.
1322722706618490880 2020-11-01 10:10:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @albertmohler I would have to say that you “Christians” would vote for the devil himself, if he banned abortions, even as he caused the deaths of tens of thousands of your countrymen and we ended up in a Fascist State.
1322721404681396225 2020-11-01 10:05:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @trentster @bflutze @realDonaldTrump You may hope that’s true, but you don’t know. Nobody does.
1322720440595419136 2020-11-01 10:01:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I have seen you sacrifice thousands of Americans, including your own supporters, because you wanted to stay in power. You ignored this pandemic because you care only for yourself and have been this way your entire life. You are responsible for all the suffering in this country.
1322718013423046657 2020-11-01 09:52:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Anyone that would believe your promises is gullible to the extreme. You say these things solely to get re-elected. This is the problem with electing a man to the Presidency who only cares for himself. Everything Trump touches dies.
1322684648867221505 2020-11-01 07:39:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> VOTE THE BUMS OUT!
1322683756340301825 2020-11-01 07:35:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> Hand deliver it and make sure it is filled out EXACTLY how the instructions tell you to. Otherwise it may not be counted.
1322679368154550273 2020-11-01 07:18:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> Texas, I don’t care if your Governor is a Republican, but it looks like you need to give Biden a police escort to his rallies. This is outrageous!
1322677999410548738 2020-11-01 07:13:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> We need a landslide! VOTE!
1322677836822597632 2020-11-01 07:12:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> VOTE Trump and his Republican sycophants out of office while you still can.
1322677329336897539 2020-11-01 07:10:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> Take nothing for granted. VOTE and you won’t have to worry about regretting not doing it.
1322664264490995713 2020-11-01 06:18:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> VOTE!
1322663948433448965 2020-11-01 06:17:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> Exactly. It sounds ridiculous when they use the words “Courage” and “Strength” in a campaign ad.
1322663448736653312 2020-11-01 06:15:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> This man is pure evil.
1322660756282855424 2020-11-01 06:04:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @B1and1and1is3 @therecount @BeschlossDC I have heard him say so many outrageous things that I am not giving him a pass on ANYTHING.
1322660275384975360 2020-11-01 06:02:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @miscellany101 @vikramantin @therecount @BeschlossDC I think it depends on how close the vote is. Unfortunately it sounds close.
1322659677516292100 2020-11-01 06:00:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> Very true. Call it what it is.
1322659492786511873 2020-11-01 05:59:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> We knew this was coming. Will these Justices do it?
1322657806596661256 2020-11-01 05:52:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RhondaH75714484 @realDonaldTrump You must be tired because Trump has been bullshitting his followers for 5 years now.
1322656663443222528 2020-11-01 05:48:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @moh1966omar @realDonaldTrump You don’t think you are a little bias do you. The man is a pathological liar and you say he is forthright and honest.
1322656236916084738 2020-11-01 05:46:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @markbotsford @realDonaldTrump So true. I had no idea this maniac would be as deadly to Americans as he has been.
1322655709184536577 2020-11-01 05:44:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AElmisalati @realDonaldTrump Trump may be good for the apartheid government of Israel, but he is not good for us, so don’t start telling us what we should do. Got it?
1322654146009440261 2020-11-01 05:38:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Bethany49749514 @realDonaldTrump You are lost and without a clue as to what is actually happening in this country.
1322653287997472768 2020-11-01 05:34:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> And Trump’s supporters think they are fighting for “Freedom”. They may or may not realize it, but they are fighting for an Authoritarian State instead of a Republic.
1322599489702666240 2020-11-01 02:01:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Only a man with no sense of shame or remorse who is totally corrupt could stand up in front of the nation and call his opponent corrupt. That’s you Donald.
1322598984389677057 2020-11-01 01:59:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @lghfive79 @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump He says a lot of things. Most of them are untrue.
1322598091787280387 2020-11-01 01:55:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, why is it that I see so few of your supporters defending you as you are attacked in the replies to your non stop tweets? Did you ever notice that? Did it every cross your mind that maybe no one can defend your incompetence and stupidity?
1322597015717597184 2020-11-01 01:51:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Then why are you not handily winning this election Trump? It’s because people just don’t like you. Do you know why that is? Because you are a terrible human being, whether you win or lose.
1322548246225498112 2020-10-31 22:37:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Then show your tax returns Trump, and prove it. You know and I know the public will never see them because it would prove you are a liar.
1322547914066010113 2020-10-31 22:36:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You and your criminal Republican allies have already stacked the Court when you refused to give Merrick Garland a hearing because it was 8 months before the election. 3 weeks before an election, Republicans had hearings on their Republican nominee and confirmed her 1 week before.
1322546815745597441 2020-10-31 22:31:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump And most all of it comes from large corporations and wealthy individuals that you gave one of the largest tax breaks in history, leading to the explosive growth of our national debt.                        https://t.co/sNta6dLO12
1322503243918938112 2020-10-31 19:38:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> VOTE IN PERSON! They are trying to stop you from voting. DON’T LET THEM!
1322501771495919616 2020-10-31 19:32:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> Everyone should read this article so you are not surprised at the chaos and violence that may erupt on and after Election Day.
1322497597194539009 2020-10-31 19:16:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> Vote in person, whatever it takes!
1322496535054098433 2020-10-31 19:11:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is just a manifestation of the fact that 62 million Americans are incredibly easy marks for a conman, without the ability or desire to verify this President’s positions and statements.
1322494800977895425 2020-10-31 19:05:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> Who would ever believe this lie?
1322494296629649408 2020-10-31 19:03:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is very scary
1322492366616436736 2020-10-31 18:55:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> This people are anti communist. I get that, but are they anti fascist? That is what we are headed for if Trump gets another 4 years.
1322491830534082561 2020-10-31 18:53:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> It should be a blowout. Why isn’t it?
1322491604205211649 2020-10-31 18:52:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> All you Trump supporters should watch this, especially the ones that think the whole idea of this pandemic is a hoax.
1322489091028586496 2020-10-31 18:42:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Laura is a Nazi. You are a malevolent conman Trump.
1322488687477821440 2020-10-31 18:40:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> Unknown
1322488415242387456 2020-10-31 18:39:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Unless all his supporters have come to the conclusion that COVID-19 is a hoax, your rallies are super spreader events which will make this second wave much worse. Anything goes in order to win, right Trump? Even sacrificing your supporters and their families lives.
1322487304942952448 2020-10-31 18:35:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I think in reality, they are revolted by you Trump. I think they are the portion of the electorate that learned who you really are during your first term. My hope is you crash and burn in this election, spending the rest of your days in a prison cell.
1322486372746354694 2020-10-31 18:31:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @OANN Trump, you are shortsighted and stupid. A transition to solar would make us self sufficient and would create millions of good paying jobs. Your problem is that all you care about is getting re-elected. You are not a leader or a visionary, but just a conman.
1322343599154044929 2020-10-31 09:04:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump More damage to this country, yes , I agree
1322343401015169030 2020-10-31 09:03:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Then quit slowing the mail down with your stooge as Postmaster General and stop downplaying the virus. You manufactured this whole issue and I know why. You screwed your first term up so bad you can’t win without corrupting our political process.
1322339441554432000 2020-10-31 08:47:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is a very sad commentary on young voters in this country. I do not think they realize how important their vote is at this moment in history. If Biden does not win this election, I think they will bitterly regret their decision not to vote in the future.
1322335795961876481 2020-10-31 08:33:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is a case of Trump’s massive corruption of our election system aided and abetted by Republican lawmakers. Are you going to let it happen, or are you going to get your ass to the polling station and VOTE THEM OUT!
1322333477954617345 2020-10-31 08:24:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump And you will continue to let people die from this virus by ignoring it. There are ways to limit the spread of this virus without shutting the entire country down Trump, but I guess you are too stupid to realize that. Wear masks and social distancing, but you won’t even do that.
1322331047443468290 2020-10-31 08:14:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SteveGuest Didn’t Trump tell his supporters to beat the crap out of protestors at one of his rallies? If yes, and you are complaining about Biden’s mild rebuke, you are partisan hypocrites.
1322329301669335041 2020-10-31 08:07:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DebiFranchio @realDonaldTrump Mail in ballots were never a problem until Trump told you they were. You can talk to any of the State Superviser of Elections and they will tell you there are multiple layers of verification to limit fraud. Only a few states send them out to all registered voters.
1322296208765931523 2020-10-31 05:55:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I voted! Against you Trump!
1322295299986042881 2020-10-31 05:52:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> Why would anyone who paid into SS vote for Trump. You would have to be an idiot.
1322293478395727872 2020-10-31 05:45:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Kaboy10849032 @realDonaldTrump I don’t know who you are, but I have a feeling you don’t even live in this country. If true, you need to butt out.
1322291677210517504 2020-10-31 05:37:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @josietijerino @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/NpakONR6Ju
1322291339317432321 2020-10-31 05:36:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @josietijerino @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump Don’t think so, lady.
1322291088409923585 2020-10-31 05:35:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> Now who do you think of when reading this article?
1322287842601717766 2020-10-31 05:22:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is how the Republican Party stays in power. Vote in person and vote them out.
1322287507875221504 2020-10-31 05:21:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is why I surrendered my mail in ballot and voted in person. You can also drop it in a mail in ballot box.
1322153035959836673 2020-10-30 20:27:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump All of you Trump supporters have been completely conned by this man AGAIN, in spite of what you have seen and heard over the last 4 years. His words and promises are meaningless. His actions or lack of action is what matters.
1322152252694581249 2020-10-30 20:23:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump All you have to do is convince enough low information voters that everything is fine until Nov 3 and you will be happy, won’t you a Trump? We are heading into a second wave and Trump has done NOTHING! If people die they die. Why anyone would listen to this man, I don’t know.
1321992398319329281 2020-10-30 09:48:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump No. You are a narcissistic con artist and a moron.
1321991988036751371 2020-10-30 09:47:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JohnCornyn Hey Cornyn, didn’t that moron you call a president tell his negotiators to stop working towards deal with Dems until someone told him that was a stupid thing to do? You are one of those politicians that doesn’t care what kind of damage Trump does as long as you hold onto power.
1321990115808468992 2020-10-30 09:39:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Only a man without the ability to feel shame could say the things you do Trump. You are one sick puppy.
1321989619370610689 2020-10-30 09:37:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mmpadellan Yes I do.
1321989550449827842 2020-10-30 09:37:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate You did not build it Trump. All you know how to do is rack up debt and lose money. Everything you touch dies.
1321989154947977216 2020-10-30 09:35:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Too many of us see through your dog whistles and lies Trump. You sound like one very desperate politician. You should be scared. Prison awaits you.
1321988610946666496 2020-10-30 09:33:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump That’s after it crashed 32% you idiot. You are a con man and the worst thing about this is that 40% of the American Electorate bought your lies hook, line and sinker.
1321945135236734976 2020-10-30 06:40:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @idrealist1 Tucker is a liar. Period.
1321944444560646145 2020-10-30 06:38:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> Do people really think Trump will protect them from a COVID-19 second wave?                               https://t.co/JmuFSVwS32
1321933775534755842 2020-10-30 05:55:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Brand0nOrtiz @HubertLinssen1 @realDonaldTrump See tweet below from Ivan Hu.
1321933372395032583 2020-10-30 05:54:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Brand0nOrtiz @HubertLinssen1 @realDonaldTrump Your middle eastern friends? You mean the Israeli’s right? I guess they are happy with Trump. The South Koreans are thankful Trump did not get into a shooting war with North Korea. Other than that Trump has accomplished absolutely nothing. He is simply a con man who fooled many.
1321931933220294657 2020-10-30 05:48:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @WWhiteBrBa @AndrewYang Then I want to apologize to you right now. I feel the same way.
1321926178744213505 2020-10-30 05:25:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @WWhiteBrBa @AndrewYang No, I think you missed his point. Trump should not be bragging about the rise in economic activity because we are still below where we started by 11%.  The economy would have dropped further if we stayed locked down, but there would have been fewer deaths. Is it worth it to you?
1321829806351273984 2020-10-29 23:02:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> Don’t rely on a mail in ballot at this point. In many states like Pennsylvania it may not ever be counted. You can surrender your mail in ballot and vote in person at any polling station.
1321824136986038272 2020-10-29 22:40:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> EverythingTrump touches dies.
1321823156269731840 2020-10-29 22:36:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> Excellent video
1321821829233856524 2020-10-29 22:30:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @WWhiteBrBa @AndrewYang And you look like a sociopath who could give a damn about how many people die in this pandemic.
1321821342044459013 2020-10-29 22:29:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Way to spin it Cruella. Unfortunately for you most thinking people factor in how much it fell as well as how much it rose. Soon, I will not have to hear from you anymore.
1321820264238403590 2020-10-29 22:24:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MHSG_salon @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @HouseGOP It could be because Trump is an extreme narcissist and totally incompetent. You have been conned.
1321819867545296896 2020-10-29 22:23:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @HubertLinssen1 @realDonaldTrump Well said. This slogan of making America great again has failed spectacularly and we are the laughingstock of thinking people all over the world.
1321767818828877825 2020-10-29 18:56:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump No, you are a dumb guy and a lousy businessman
1321767440045453313 2020-10-29 18:54:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Who could ever trust you and your Republican enablers Trump? McConnell has wanted to destroy Medicare and Social Security for years and you will support them.
1321737932428988416 2020-10-29 16:57:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> I believe that and other actions by Republicans that are designed to limit voting are part of a larger conspiracy to steal an election. VOTE THEM OUT while you still can.
1321723949747785728 2020-10-29 16:02:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> No audio but this cop needs to be charged with assault.
1321722829587521536 2020-10-29 15:57:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> Now that is how you debate a Trump Republican
1321611959675047936 2020-10-29 08:37:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> VOTE THEM OUT!
1321611774983053313 2020-10-29 08:36:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> VOTE THEM OUT!
1321611547639226368 2020-10-29 08:35:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> Ratcliffe is just another Trump stooge who will hopefully be relieved of his duties very soon.
1321610681377034241 2020-10-29 08:31:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> I guess we will see if Republicans filled the Supreme Court with partisan Justice’s soon enough. The Court will lose all moral authority and respect on that day.
1321609730943496195 2020-10-29 08:28:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You sound desperate Trump. What’s bothering you buddy?
1321609539414839296 2020-10-29 08:27:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Unless you cheat Trump, I believe you will be known as the worlds greatest loser next week.
1321609252557959169 2020-10-29 08:26:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> There is no way I would be intimidated by those idiots. I would also call the police as this is illegal within a certain distance from the polling station.
1321608452863627265 2020-10-29 08:23:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate Not on yours Cruella.
1321608287473860609 2020-10-29 08:22:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are the swamp Trump. Your deeds over the past four years have exposed you for what you are.
1321607831406202881 2020-10-29 08:20:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Because it is a conspiracy theory, whereas your crimes are obvious to most thinking people.
1321607506729279490 2020-10-29 08:19:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump We will fight this virus and save lives as any other people who care about their fellow citizens would. We will ultimately have a vaccine.  Because you are a full blown narcissist, you could care less how many people die, as long as you keep political power.
1321572797743796225 2020-10-29 06:01:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @Google @CNN You just cannot stand anyone telling the truth about who and what you really are Trump. Ever heard of the Emperor’s new clothes folk fable? You should read it. It describes you exactly Trump. A farce, a liar and a fool.
1321539486090670082 2020-10-29 03:49:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> I wonder if his supporters realize that the pandemic is not over?
1321539135971143688 2020-10-29 03:47:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> Hey moron. Ever give any thought to the people in Wisconsin who may contract the virus due to your rally instead of only thinking about the Vice President?
1321537118162898945 2020-10-29 03:39:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> This has nothing to do with following the law, but has everything to do with stealing an election when you receive fewer votes.
1321523583416520704 2020-10-29 02:45:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, you are not even a decent human being, so not being a politician doesn’t do much for you.
1321514153136295936 2020-10-29 02:08:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> This kind of BS isn’t by accident. Vote all these Republicans out on a landslide!
1321511968256217088 2020-10-29 01:59:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well that’s real nice. I wonder if Justice Thomas believes them as well.
1321511208420319232 2020-10-29 01:56:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> Kavanaugh’s comment tells me what the Supreme Court will do if the election is close. VOTE THEM OUT!
1321510495988387843 2020-10-29 01:53:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> This video explains what has been missing in the Trump Administration and Trump himself during the last four years. Vote him out while you still can.
1321399826467180545 2020-10-28 18:34:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> And they still will follow Trump to Hell.
1321379947575939073 2020-10-28 17:15:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump and his allies have crafted a plan to win this election even if the lose the popular  https://t.co/Grn1t1TY8r sure to VOTE THEM OUT!
1321363749366833157 2020-10-28 16:10:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @madrid_mike Unfortunately I don’t feel Florida is a state we can count on.
1321360520272904192 2020-10-28 15:57:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> The fix is in. This election cannot be close because Republicans will try to overturn it using their stacked Supreme Court. For God’s sake VOTE THEM OUT!
1321235677086965763 2020-10-28 07:41:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump What idiot would believe you are going to rebuild the economy after destroying it?
1321235500842274818 2020-10-28 07:41:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Republicans decided to play dirty pool, so they own this mess. You may have to live with the consequences.
1321234535800020992 2020-10-28 07:37:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump He didn’t kill 230,000 Americans and counting with his inaction Trump.
1321233756414484480 2020-10-28 07:34:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @MSNBC You still do not give a damn how many people this virus will kill in order to assure your re-election. You are the worst example of a human being I have ever known of in my lifetime.
1321204176446259200 2020-10-28 05:36:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Is it a requirement to be a racist and own an AR?
1321203629378965504 2020-10-28 05:34:26 +0800 <VenaAlan>  https://t.co/IldIz04q9S

1321180909329174531 2020-10-28 04:04:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You had better hope it’s not a Blue Wave, because even a stacked Supreme Court cannot bail you out of that situation.
1321180458122706944 2020-10-28 04:02:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @rww_gop @realDonaldTrump How you ever came to the conclusion that we need four more years of chaos, corruption, contempt for the Constitution, zero leadership during pandemic and constant lies is beyond me.
1321148596708876295 2020-10-28 01:55:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Everyone, even your supporters know you are lying about this Trump, but that would not matter to a narcissist that cannot feel shame.
1321146647410286595 2020-10-28 01:48:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> They slowed down the mail. They stacked the Supreme Court. If you haven’t sent in your absentee ballot yet, this what you can do.                               https://t.co/ltJZwqhzVf
1320999926998962176 2020-10-27 16:05:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JohnCornyn Very nice words Senator, but I believe this SCOTUS Justice is part of a master plan to keep and hold political power in this country regardless of elections. You Senator are driving this country to an authoritarian government and civil war.
1320998409894068224 2020-10-27 15:58:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump and his allies will destroy this country and it’s political institutions to hold onto political power. We are headed for civil war. VOTE like your country depended on it!
1320997357899653128 2020-10-27 15:54:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> VOTE THEM OUT!
1320884697749180416 2020-10-27 08:27:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Never heard of them, and don’t care. Trump still sucks
1320883749165453314 2020-10-27 08:23:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> Not one of these “moderate Republicans” are worth keeping in office.
1320883438963068928 2020-10-27 08:22:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> I will never forget it. These a Trump supporting Republican sycophants have to be removed from public office and thrown into the dustbin of history.
1320882411228508160 2020-10-27 08:18:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @dougbrec @Nancy49150090 @sarahcpr Doug, we are all on the edge of our seats wondering which way you will go. I just don’t think you understand the gravity of the situation.
1320882219225911296 2020-10-27 08:17:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You talk a good game Trump, but you only traffic in fear mongering politics. Only the most gullible would take what you say at face value. This is all political theater to get you re-elected.
1320881948307447808 2020-10-27 08:16:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @tedcruz Rubio in March 2016, "I don't think we should be moving forward on a nominee in the last year of this president's term. I would say that if it was a Republican president."               Cruz, you are a complete hypocrite.
1320881863750242305 2020-10-27 08:15:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump More fear mongering and BS Trump.
1320881683600650241 2020-10-27 08:15:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You and your Republican sycophants in the Senate should have thought about that when you wouldn’t even give Obama’s SCOTUS pick a hearing 9 months before the election. Now you are trying to ram through your pick three weeks before Election Day. Screw you Trump.
1320881616990994434 2020-10-27 08:14:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich Maybe it had to do with an upswing in the stock market? Not sure if you lost it when the stock market drops and regain it when it comes back up qualifies as an increase of wealth. $13,000,000,000 is a lot of money to make in one day. It boggles the mind.
1320881517124558848 2020-10-27 08:14:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @kaytooesq @MeidasTouch Ask the 100 million eligible voters that could not be bothered to vote in the last Presidential Election. I feel our apathy as a country regarding our democratic political process leads to minority rule and rampant corruption in government.
1320879626177175553 2020-10-27 08:06:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MeidasTouch @SavannahGuthrie I hope one of the people there asks him about this.
1320855094657753095 2020-10-27 06:29:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> We have been saying that Trump likes authoritarian figures and would like to be one in this country. I am glad to hear that he has publicly confirmed this.
1320795547939254275 2020-10-27 02:32:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @madrid_mike I have a dog that is smarter than you Trump.
1320795213598777348 2020-10-27 02:31:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> This just about says it all as far as Trump’s COVID-19 response. Now his Chief of Staff says the virus can’t be contained. Other countries managed to do it. What is wrong with this country?
1320793987033321472 2020-10-27 02:26:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> How do Dems work with these Republicans? All they respect is raw political power.
1320695464698748931 2020-10-26 19:55:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump The only coverup is being orchestrated by Donald Trump and his minions.
1320695267344195585 2020-10-26 19:54:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump It’s obvious to just about everyone that you do not know how to handle a National Emergency. Covid is on the news constantly because you have done absolutely nothing about the pandemic you dolt.
1320694619265507335 2020-10-26 19:51:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You blew the whole idea of MAGA during your time in office. Under you MAGA will never happen. You are not fit to be President. Resign.
1320674484781809666 2020-10-26 18:31:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> This s an authoritarian leader consolidating power.
1320654813282127872 2020-10-26 17:13:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LeadersMaster She reminds me of Joseph Goebbels.
1320637974774775809 2020-10-26 16:06:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> I would have to say that they had better wise up and vote for Amy McGrath.
1320637526332346369 2020-10-26 16:04:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> This man turns into a sniveling coward when confronted with the truth. If he does manage to win this election, I will know we are headed for a dystopian future and half the American electorate is incapable of seeing that.
1320636138487451649 2020-10-26 15:59:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow Don, I want to thank you, for sacrificing your time and wealth in your quest to stop our country from moving to an authoritarian government under the control of a madman.
1320635108819456001 2020-10-26 15:55:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @OANN Because they know you and your poll watchers are there to intimidate voters, Trump. You will do anything to win this election and avoid a prison cell.
1320520903000809473 2020-10-26 08:21:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> I am so proud of you Texas!
1320520434006269953 2020-10-26 08:19:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @60Minutes If any white people believe this they are a special kind of stupid.
1320497947633684487 2020-10-26 06:50:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich McConnell is a cold blooded arrogant SOB isn’t he?
1320497001738440706 2020-10-26 06:46:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Until it’s overfished and the industry collapses
1320496644958334976 2020-10-26 06:45:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Then he ignores the virus to improve his re-election chances and blows up the economy. Vote that self centered moron out of office
1320480921926004736 2020-10-26 05:42:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> When you do not value the life of one group of citizens, you devalue the life of all a nations citizens. That is what we are doing under Donald Trump.
1320479111362547720 2020-10-26 05:35:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> I swear to God, we are going to end up with an authoritarian government if people don’t get off their asses and VOTE!
1320478106847744002 2020-10-26 05:31:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> The fool should be fired
1320477639098961921 2020-10-26 05:29:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @senatemajldr McConnell, you had better hope Biden doesn’t come out on top and we don’t take the Senate.
1320476533102940161 2020-10-26 05:25:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @chefjclark Trump doesn’t want to end up in prison, so he makes up conspiracy theories about our election system. The man is one sick pup.
1320476055568818178 2020-10-26 05:23:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Why won’t you push for the United States to be able to negotiate with Big Pharma to lower prices Trump? They own you don’t they?
1320475178795675649 2020-10-26 05:19:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well said.
1320429444604010497 2020-10-26 02:18:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> Whatever it takes, VOTE!

1320416315031621633 2020-10-26 01:25:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> I will never understand these people.
1320403378380410880 2020-10-26 00:34:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I knew you were a dirt bag con artist the first time I heard you speak Trump. No way I would ever support your enablers.
1320403014532911109 2020-10-26 00:33:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You have already shown Americans what they have to lose Trump.
1320401127171567616 2020-10-26 00:25:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KeepFreeTaiwan @realDonaldTrump In my opinion, we have already been infiltrated by Putin and the Russian Government. Trump is obviously subservient to Putin and I believe he is compromised and very prone to blackmail. I have seen no verifiable evidence showing that Biden is controlled by the Chinese Government
1320312544305811456 2020-10-25 18:33:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KeepFreeTaiwan @realDonaldTrump I want Taiwan to be free also, but don’t encourage Americans to vote for a future dictator
1320312037466120192 2020-10-25 18:31:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @imanzahedikia @realDonaldTrump You are either blind or easily conned.
1320292708599169024 2020-10-25 17:14:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DannyMe55730387 @realDonaldTrump Biden was not my first choice, but to be clear, not voting is a vote for Trump.
1320276739696873479 2020-10-25 16:11:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I know why Trump is discrediting mail in voting and casting doubt on our voting system. If he loses the election, he will claim voter fraud to avoid prison time.
1320275938215682048 2020-10-25 16:08:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LeeSmithDC @realDonaldTrump Can you people come up with anything other than a discredited conspiracy theory?
1320274837579902983 2020-10-25 16:03:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GovernorPerry @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden If they ignore everything else that Trump represents and are only concerned about keeping the coal mines going, I guess they would vote for him.
1320147136252698624 2020-10-25 07:36:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate What soul?
1320136048064798723 2020-10-25 06:52:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump That is exactly what you and your Republican allies are doing Trump. There are millions of voters that see right through you Trump.
1320134961442312193 2020-10-25 06:47:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You had better hope so Trump. Justice is waiting for you.
1320134404350541825 2020-10-25 06:45:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> I am very proud of all those voters
1320134233336254465 2020-10-25 06:45:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please get out there and vote. Don’t take anything for granted. You may regret it the rest of your life.
1320133801780088833 2020-10-25 06:43:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> Maybe people just don’t like you Lindsey.
1320130815121100800 2020-10-25 06:31:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> All Americans should be ashamed of this action by the Trump Administration, but if his base doesn’t care if 220,000 of their fellow citizens die, they probably don’t care about these children either.
1320127733888806913 2020-10-25 06:19:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RichardGrenell @KellyannePolls All you are spouting is fear mongering politics much like this President you admire so much. Tyrants and authoritarian regimes do this same thing. Divide and conquer.
1320118099048341506 2020-10-25 05:40:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> DeSantis is a little Trump junkie and took cues from the President on how to deal with the pandemic in Florida. He has staked his political career on Trump and I hope people remember and in two years make him a one term governor.
1320082072124403713 2020-10-25 03:17:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DaneSocial @donwinslow I am proud of you.
1320081996517904384 2020-10-25 03:17:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is flat out wrong. Vote Republicans out.
1320080225204658177 2020-10-25 03:10:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Obama didn’t take anyone’s guns and neither will Biden. Trump, you just want to get gun owners riled up so they won’t start thinking about the destruction you caused in this country.
1320079307411230721 2020-10-25 03:06:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump What does that even mean anymore Trump?
1320079128918433792 2020-10-25 03:06:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You ruined it, you didn’t make it great again.
1320058459363172354 2020-10-25 01:43:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JohnCornyn You Republicans would not have chosen her as a nominee if you did not think she would support your agenda. She will be the deciding conservative vote on the Court for decades. You and your Republican allies can be proud, but you had better win this election and keep the Senate.
1320057154976567298 2020-10-25 01:38:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump The scientists were right when they said we would have a second wave in the fall, but you denied it. They also said if 95% of us wear masks we could avoid 100,000 deaths, but you won’t even do that. Why is that?Because you are incapable of caring about anyone but yourself.
1320053463506706433 2020-10-25 01:24:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You made those numbers up didn’t you Trump? You are no American President and never will be.
1319956174935101440 2020-10-24 18:57:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> This tells you everything you need to know about the Trump Administration’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
1319955675796164608 2020-10-24 18:55:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump No Trump. You sound like the corrupt lying narcissist you really are.
1319955433919041537 2020-10-24 18:54:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @marklevinshow @realDonaldTrump Still waiting for this October surprise Levin. If you think your little collection of conspiracy theories are any sort of proof of Biden corruption you are only preaching to Trump’s most hardcore unthinking followers.
1319954097760600065 2020-10-24 18:49:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump When the investigations begin Trump, we will see who sold the American worker down the river.
1319953655420887041 2020-10-24 18:47:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Putin owns a lying narcissist who conned his way into the Presidency right now Trump so forgive if I view your tweet as an act of desperation, by a complete loser.
1319952601321000960 2020-10-24 18:43:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @marklevinshow @realDonaldTrump This “President” you support has been a complete and utter failure in every metric you could think of Levin. No amount of spin from you is going to change that.
1319951816801603584 2020-10-24 18:40:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @wdunlap @realDonaldTrump And I say you don’t research what you put out there. That makes you a Trump apologist that is FOS.
1319823041883492352 2020-10-24 10:08:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are a farce Trump. Your claims are lies, your promises are lies and your life is a lie. You know who you remind me of? Joseph McCarthy in the 1950’s. He was another demagogue like you and after destroying many people lives he ended up in the dustbin of history.
1319796033413677057 2020-10-24 08:21:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC Trump is not a leader nor is he a wise man. He has no principles, values or good character. He is future dictator though.
1319788957589245953 2020-10-24 07:53:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Kenny_Sowellfan @realDonaldTrump You like to speak for the American people, but I can tell you right now, you do not speak for me or millions of other Americans, McEnany.
1319787960959705089 2020-10-24 07:49:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Nobody wants your guns. Don’t run every time you hear a Trump dog whistle.
1319787639776620545 2020-10-24 07:47:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @benshapiro @KellyannePolls We should have done that 40 years ago dummy.
1319787456091312129 2020-10-24 07:47:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @megynkelly @KellyannePolls Yea, if you say so. Your job as a Trump apologist must be very difficult.
1319742971424706563 2020-10-24 04:50:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> It’s not Republicanism any more, it’s something much different. It’s Trumpism, and some Republicans are just on it for the ride.
1319741984291098624 2020-10-24 04:46:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> I never thought about the peer pressure aspect of a Trump supporter.
1319471646344962050 2020-10-23 10:52:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @megynkelly @KellyannePolls He lied as usual and did not have command of the facts. His mediocre performance will not change the election.
1319413097107542022 2020-10-23 06:59:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is a liar and a hypocrite
1319412677647749121 2020-10-23 06:57:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate Ridiculous. China isn’t for sale.
1319411871787659265 2020-10-23 06:54:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TrumpWarRoom Donald Trump is currently in Federal Court trying to end Healthcare for 31 million Americans. Trump is universally despised by decent, intelligent people worldwide.
1319411328545660929 2020-10-23 06:52:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump It’s obvious you only care about yourself Trump
1319410769138679808 2020-10-23 06:50:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You already blew up the economy Trump, so why would anyone listen to your BS.
1319410321849749505 2020-10-23 06:48:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> Let’s not forget what these politicians did during the Trump years.
1319409434301431811 2020-10-23 06:44:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You better hope you are right Trump because there are a lot of Americans that want to see you do prison time, including me.
1319408943240777740 2020-10-23 06:43:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump has no idea of what he said. He reminds me of a cornered rat in this interview
1319408423474253824 2020-10-23 06:40:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MattWolking Matt, I hate to say it, but your acceptable level of evidence is extremely low. It’s a conspiracy theory. Not even a Republican Senate Committee investigating the issue agrees with you.
1319405126961008642 2020-10-23 06:27:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @Yahoo No one cares Baio.
1319373648860512256 2020-10-23 04:22:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You know how ridiculous you sound talking about how hateful people are to you? That’s how you act toward other people all the time unless they are your supporters or flattering you. You are the very definition of a lying hypocrite.
1319329854513418241 2020-10-23 01:28:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump And here, all this time I have been thinking that you were a sexual predator, and women did not like you very much. How many women have accused you of sexual assault Trump? 26 wasn’t it?                                            https://t.co/u7FIXiFYYt
1319255217435758595 2020-10-22 20:32:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You had two terms with Obama and did anyone take your guns? It’s a dog whistle that conservatives respond to every time.
1319253627526053888 2020-10-22 20:25:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC I predict Trump will be himself, just like he was in the last debate and he will not like being muted constantly.
1319252897142538241 2020-10-22 20:22:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump No Trump. You are running against Joe Biden and everyone else that sick and tired of a spoiled little brat in the White House.
1319252364461834241 2020-10-22 20:20:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC If it wasn’t for your rude, unprofessional and disruptive behavior during the last debate, you would not be muted at all. You are evidently too stupid to realize that.
1319204743613435905 2020-10-22 17:11:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TheRickWilson @madrid_mike Ingraham, I wouldn’t listen to your advice if you were the last person on the planet. You are an evil hag. I guess your comments mean that the Lincoln Project has been very successful.
1319203536769605633 2020-10-22 17:06:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls @SteveGuest It’s probably because you were lying.
1319187072142495749 2020-10-22 16:01:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump The only person you are standing up for is yourself Trump.  You had better win this election, or your future looks pretty grim. I will enjoy watching you humbled.
1319185967773831168 2020-10-22 15:56:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JohnCornyn Cornyn, you are a pathetic miserable coward that sold your country down the river for political power under a Trump dynasty. You are a disgusting creature.
1319185240770961414 2020-10-22 15:54:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are running to make sure you don’t do any prison time.
1319056187799818243 2020-10-22 07:21:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @EricTrump @kayleighmcenany Eric, did you come up with this sophomoric attempt at making a political statement? It’s stupid.
1319054722247086081 2020-10-22 07:15:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump It is your fault Trump. You let Americans die to ensure your re-election. You are a sick demented human being.
1319054281002147848 2020-10-22 07:13:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow I want to offer my congratulations to you.
1319054022159011840 2020-10-22 07:12:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> You have to wonder if this is planned or just incompetence
1318957706993045504 2020-10-22 00:49:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> How true
1318957488205668352 2020-10-22 00:49:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump We are tired of your empty self serving promises Trump
1318948966298517505 2020-10-22 00:15:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is a pathological liar and a criminal
1318948337027076097 2020-10-22 00:12:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I have said for a long time that you would say and do absolutely anything to retain power. This is fear mongering at it’s worst. Remember this Trump, we have already seen the devastation your four years in office caused. Why would anyone think the next 4 years would be different?
1318902807227994113 2020-10-21 21:11:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> I d not trust polls. While these polls would be great news, please do not take anything for granted and be sure to vote. The swing states are still close and Trump and his allies will contest every vote they can.
1318863271802376196 2020-10-21 18:34:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LeadersMaster I believe this goes beyond moron. They have both made a cold blooded political calculation where this number of Americans dying from COVID-19 is acceptable to keep the economy moving in an effort to win the Presidential election.
1318828030240919554 2020-10-21 16:14:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DiculousRicky @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump And you know all this how? Your man would never release his tax returns and never will.                     https://t.co/r6mEixEAJR
1318689442488516608 2020-10-21 07:03:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> To all those who would like to see Trump removed from office. Please watch this video and VOTE!
1318688048331325440 2020-10-21 06:58:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @SteveKalayjian @Varneyco You always promise, but you never deliver, something like a con artist would do.
1318687828935643136 2020-10-21 06:57:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is a brave and wise man.
1318687600631291905 2020-10-21 06:56:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Only your hard core supporters believe your broken promises and lies Trump.
1318678499918569474 2020-10-21 06:20:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RexChapman @donwinslow Trump makes a fool of himself constantly, but his supporters never notice.
1318676832250699777 2020-10-21 06:13:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @chipfranklin I am.
1318676200835944450 2020-10-21 06:11:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @democracynow Trump is what our Founding Fathers feared most.
1318675317855297536 2020-10-21 06:07:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @StanGott Trump is an idiot.
1318622676013953024 2020-10-21 02:38:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You have a lot of nerve blaming someone else for unnecessary deaths Trump.
1318611960192241666 2020-10-21 01:56:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DiculousRicky @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump I’m delusional? I read that he owes $450 million dollars to creditors and it’s coming due shortly. If true it sounds like he is ripe for becoming an asset of a hostile foreign government if that isn’t the situation already.
1318605479417909249 2020-10-21 01:30:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mmpadellan Will they actually do it? That’s what I want to know. If not, I will not watch it.
1318540364509315072 2020-10-20 21:11:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TheChainedMan @SenSchumer Well, “in the wrong” as you say, may have consequences if Biden wins the election. Conservatives will be angry, but they need to realize that whatever happens, McConnell and Senate Republicans poisoned the well as far as any compromise on SCOTUS is concerned.
1318527411231784962 2020-10-20 20:20:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TheChainedMan @SenSchumer And so was Obama. He was President and McConnell wouldn’t even give his SCOTUS pick a hearing 9 months before the election. Now they are ramming through another Justice 3 weeks before the election. If the shoe was on the other foot, you would be pissed as well.
1318462996482564097 2020-10-20 16:04:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich I predict the next moderator will not have the moral fortitude to mute Trump.
1318462446391222273 2020-10-20 16:01:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DiculousRicky @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump Let me ask you this. Who owns the President we have now? Who does he owe $450 million to? And why should  I care about Biden’s relationship with China after four years of a Trump led Administration that has shown it’s incompetence in every criteria I can think of?
1318351521839501313 2020-10-20 08:41:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump wants to be the only source of “truth”.
1318329819785011200 2020-10-20 07:14:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @CorbeilFrancene @thehill I believe there is a good portion of Trump’s base that could care less how many of their fellow citizens die from this virus, as long as they can keep the party going.
1318329004223582208 2020-10-20 07:11:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @magi_slayer @thehill Is ignorance the religion of the right?
1318328689826947077 2020-10-20 07:10:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AlwaysThink12 @thehill You are the kind of person that would make a pandemic political.  Politicians with no morals principles or ethics are the very worst people to listen to during a national emergency.
1318327526159192065 2020-10-20 07:05:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AlwaysThink12 @thehill You mean as opposed to the idiot that you support that intentionally downplayed the virus to help his re-election campaign and allowed 215,000 Americans to die from his incompetence? Hell yes.
1318325521411985413 2020-10-20 06:57:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jimsciutto Trump wants us to believe that he is the only source of truth. He reminds me of Jim Jones.
1318308405493309440 2020-10-20 05:49:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DiculousRicky @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump It’s not a simple fact and China only recently became Trump’s whipping boy when he needed a boogie man to blame his failures on. You will have to show me some evidence of your claims.  https://t.co/Zlpdb6fz1O
1317978331996934146 2020-10-19 07:58:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RepMattGaetz And you are a pathetic little Congressman from Florida. You would not know how to go after the “Deep State”. You are laughable.
1317977831352291330 2020-10-19 07:56:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You were impeached Trump. You can’t deflect all that evidence of criminality and corruption anymore. Too many people know exactly what you are Trump. Possibly the worlds greatest con man
1317976113017196544 2020-10-19 07:49:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, only your followers could understand your twisted logic. The fact is that you are either an idiot or an evil genius that thinks he can convince the country of this nonsense argument.
1317973810747002880 2020-10-19 07:40:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TWIT_ANTHONY @realDonaldTrump We just don’t understand how Trump was able to con you people so easily.
1317973015091679232 2020-10-19 07:37:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DiculousRicky @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump Biden’s a Corporate Democrat, basically like a Republican lite candidate. Even Bernie Sanders is not a communist. He is a Democratic Socialist like the government many Western European countries. You are too quick to accept the old communist boogeyman propaganda. It scare tactics
1317895309549330433 2020-10-19 02:28:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Let’s get this straight Trump. You destroy the economy placing your re-election hopes before the American’s lives, and now you are the only one that can save the economy? Not buying it. You inherited that economy and squandered it because that is what narcissists do.
1317894099802968070 2020-10-19 02:23:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> Your country needs you right now people. Drop what you are doing and vote!
1317893904449130499 2020-10-19 02:22:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DrBiden I will.
1317893748232196096 2020-10-19 02:22:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump And what are you Trump. A man with no shame and who has no integrity, values or morals. In short a man who you would want your kids to emulate.
1317809176341598211 2020-10-18 20:46:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> Outrageous behavior by this President. Nothing has changed from 2016. He is not fit to hold the office of President.
1317774223155318784 2020-10-18 18:27:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> And this, after a far right group targeted this Governor. Disgusting.
1317773265478234112 2020-10-18 18:23:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MissTrust9 @kirstiealley @realDonaldTrump How about you take him and him your Prime Minister. Polls show most Americans have finally realized what Trump is. A liar and a con man.
1317772465498693633 2020-10-18 18:20:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> Great video.
1317759367412961285 2020-10-18 17:28:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Before you run your mouth about Biden, Trump, cough up your tax returns and we will see who is the grifter and possibly a traitor.
1317758869297352705 2020-10-18 17:26:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump At least we are able to see Biden’s tax returns as opposed to Donald J Trump.                 https://t.co/BQS1QuZoYd
1317651540375752707 2020-10-18 10:19:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @OhareRobin @senatemajldr They did. 500 of them are sitting on McConnells desk.
1317651273341194243 2020-10-18 10:18:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @senatemajldr You are one slimy hypocritical politician Mitch. You say let’s make some law when you have hundreds of bills on your desk. I guess you reached bottom like Trump has. You disgust me.
1317649999489044480 2020-10-18 10:13:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AynRandPaulRyan @LeadersMaster Trump is sounding desperate
1317649531220250625 2020-10-18 10:11:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I could say the same thing about you and the Republican Party Trump. They are with us now fighting against you.
1317649263837499392 2020-10-18 10:10:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Fear mongering. How many times have tyrants done that throughout history? Wake up people!
1317648546074591233 2020-10-18 10:07:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump And you are a Russian asset Trump.
1317594594599718912 2020-10-18 06:33:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @EricTrump I guess Mike McIntire schooled your young ass didn’t he Eric? Maybe when you grow up you will research things before tweeting them.                        https://t.co/ZgXdxPA1oh
1317566629480366081 2020-10-18 04:42:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @SenSasse Sasse must have hurt your feelings Trump, so as you normally do, you are having a little tantrum. It’s not like he told us something most of us didn’t already know, right?
1317565999042957314 2020-10-18 04:39:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @PegLulu2 I get the same remarks but I give them right back or blow them off.
1317565773804720130 2020-10-18 04:38:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @idrealist1 @thedailybeast Giuliani is a nut job.
1317413197964582913 2020-10-17 18:32:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MarkoSilberhand @donwinslow 100 million eligible voters did not vote at all. Where is everybody?
1317412064193925121 2020-10-17 18:28:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> Christie is a slimy, worthless ex politician
1317410916485484545 2020-10-17 18:23:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> Amen brother.
1317410620556398592 2020-10-17 18:22:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOP Just maybe it’s because our intelligence agencies found that Giuliani’s sources on this subject were part of a Russian disinformation operation.
1317409682592497665 2020-10-17 18:18:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump Gaetz, you are PATHETIC. This is all you have? No evidence, no proof, no sources? Just “your word”? Why don’t you at least use bumbling Giuliani’s Russian disinformation sources? How did an idiot like you get into office?
1317257513641889792 2020-10-17 08:13:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC There is no redeeming this man. He is hopeless.
1317255460446212096 2020-10-17 08:05:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Beeri1975Hunt @cnnbrk Maybe you don’t care about policy or the issues facing this country. Maybe you need someone to scream at you to stay awake.
1317253904397144064 2020-10-17 07:59:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> It would seem that this says something about Biden’s level of support.
1317245856765063169 2020-10-17 07:27:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mehdirhasan @svdate Many of his supporters are racists, so he tells them what they want to hear.
1317245444351807491 2020-10-17 07:26:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> Who is intellectually challenged enough to believe this ridiculous conspiracy theory?
1317244641322930184 2020-10-17 07:22:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> I am very proud of these voters!
1317235925089439745 2020-10-17 06:48:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JKSuicideWatch General Kelly. I would like to ask you when you plan to make a statement to the American people about the dangers of Trump winning this election and serving four more years as President. Our nation needs men of integrity to stand up and confront Donald Trump.
1317220670556733444 2020-10-17 05:47:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @DHSgov There are quite a few Cubans living in Florida and if they hear the word socialism they immediately think of Cuba.
1317218683052347399 2020-10-17 05:39:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> Of course they would only release two pages.
1317218212686290949 2020-10-17 05:37:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> We absolutely will.
1317217905004761088 2020-10-17 05:36:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> Many of us realized this even before Trump was elected. I just wish his supporters could see it.
1317205822208966656 2020-10-17 04:48:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @beepee50 @wsteaks That’s rural Florida for you.
1317205530482540544 2020-10-17 04:47:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mmpadellan @ReallyAmerican1 #BlameTrump!
1317205423322267648 2020-10-17 04:47:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> #BlameTrump!
1317204921779965953 2020-10-17 04:45:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @kylegriffin1 He could have contracted the virus as he was in the White House coaching Trump on how to debate Biden. Christie told Trump that if he kept interrupting Biden he would cause him to stutter. Christie is a POS politician.
1317203524204351490 2020-10-17 04:39:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump admits that QANON has something to do with pedophiles and in the same breath he states he knows nothing about them. Trump@lies constantly
1317202701206409219 2020-10-17 04:36:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You knew what would happen to the Americans who contracted the virus from the beginning of the pandemic and you kept it quite so it would not affect your re-election campaign and now your heart breaks for the 215,000 dead? I don’t think you have a heart a Trump.
1317201740945608713 2020-10-17 04:32:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOP @realDonaldTrump How many seniors have died due to Trump’s criminal incompetence with the nonexistent Covid-19 response? And Trump is going to devote his life to you? What a bunch of hogwash. He devotes his life to himself.
1317200898486095877 2020-10-17 04:29:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump The would never trust anything you would ever say Trump. You lie as easily as you breath and never come through with your promises.
1317200425658056705 2020-10-17 04:27:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I won’t.
1317168311763959810 2020-10-17 02:19:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I will tell you what is worse than that Trump. An American President that played down a dangerous virus to win an election and by his selfish inaction caused the death of over 200,000 Americans.
1317127493925601281 2020-10-16 23:37:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is what the Age of Social Media has wrought. Multitudes of disinformation and propaganda sources.
1317126883469893643 2020-10-16 23:34:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @blakehounshell @RoseJamocha This is just one of the reasons I could never support this man even if he were running for city dog catcher.
1317089646598361088 2020-10-16 21:06:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well said.
1317089299112841216 2020-10-16 21:05:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RandPaul You and your entire party are morally and ethically bankrupt Rand. All you care about is political power and you support one of the world’s great con men to that end.
1317088214872694789 2020-10-16 21:01:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @SenatorCollins You like to use the word nasty a lot Trump. You know who is a nasty person? That would be you.
1317058420948819968 2020-10-16 19:02:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> What this shows me is that the first stimulus bill was non transparent and was ripe for corruption. Never let a disaster go to waste.
1317055663701434371 2020-10-16 18:51:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @kendal_bridges @Egregio4 @Dad1719 @AndrewYang Explain what happens after that please.
1316929558189395968 2020-10-16 10:30:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> Voting is the only power you have to shape your future. If you don’t vote you have no say and no voice. Politicians must think it’s important or they would not go to so much effort to get you to vote for them. Think about that.
1316924774824726528 2020-10-16 10:11:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> Commit to vote. You will be glad you did.
1316922888843296774 2020-10-16 10:04:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> Don’t EVER trust polls. We learned that in 2016. Hillary lost in the electoral college, but won the popular vote. What matters is battleground states. Commit to vote. Your country needs you RIGHT NOW!
1316921228989444096 2020-10-16 09:57:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GretaThunberg That means she does not believe climate change is real or a threat to mankind. I don’t have to hear her say it.
1316920489542062081 2020-10-16 09:54:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow I have to give this moderator credit because she gave it her all, but Trump refused to deny this out of this world, ridiculous conspiracy theory. The excuse that he doesn’t know what QANON is is getting old after he used that same excuse a couple weeks ago.
1316918561131143169 2020-10-16 09:47:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @StanGott She’s in love. Who cares about issues.
1316918058087305216 2020-10-16 09:45:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> That is funny
1316911623613931520 2020-10-16 09:19:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @B52Malmet Over the last four years, many politicians feel they can flout the laws. There isn’t the accountability that we used to have in government
1316910682328223748 2020-10-16 09:15:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RepSwalwell @LindseyGrahamSC Nothing will be done. Anything goes in Trump World.
1316909451744522241 2020-10-16 09:10:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich I have no idea. It strikes me as very odd.
1316854505032491009 2020-10-16 05:32:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @real_defender @realDonaldTrump Not all, that is for sure.
1316854317811486720 2020-10-16 05:31:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump Because he owes millions to unknown and possibly foreign creditors.
1316853933231538178 2020-10-16 05:30:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Desperate candidates use scare tactics and divisive language to attempt to win an election, Trump. This is what you are doing.
1316852822445625352 2020-10-16 05:25:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Dad1719 @AndrewYang I just read that Dems were unified against the initial Republican proposal from the beginning so I do not see how it was bipartisan. I have never heard of that changing. Both sides were negotiating a compromise but Mnuchin was told to end that by the President.
1316814010189262848 2020-10-16 02:51:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Egregio4 @Dad1719 @AndrewYang Never said they were both lousy bills. People are angry because they haven’t got any help from the Feds. If Dems would have accepted the Republican proposal we would have a bill with 1/3 the Federal unemployment benefits, half the stimulus money and no COVID funding. Is that ok?
1316804015661998083 2020-10-16 02:11:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Dad1719 @AndrewYang Mostly bipartisan. What does that mean?The Republicans offered a bill that was half of what the Dems wanted and they turned it down. Mnuchin began negotiations with the House and they were getting somewhere and Trump told him to stop. A week later Trumps wants a bigger deal.
1316802213004619779 2020-10-16 02:04:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Egregio4 @Dad1719 @AndrewYang That’s my point. Neither of us do. My problem is with people that want a bill even if it a lousy bill that doesn’t help Americans that are hurting.
1316754800458059776 2020-10-15 22:56:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Dad1719 @AndrewYang Do you know what is in the Republican and Democratic stimulus proposals or does it even matter to you? Just claiming you have gotten a bill passed by Congress that doesn’t help the average American worker is a useless act that politicians use to show they are relevant.
1316749332377407488 2020-10-15 22:34:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AndrewYang Something will change. We won’t have a lunatic in the White House who would turn this country into an authoritarian state. After that, there may be incremental change.
1316724207569469441 2020-10-15 20:54:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @kylegriffin1 Sounds good to me Trump
1316721755722047488 2020-10-15 20:45:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich I have often wondered what human beings, who have acquired billions of dollars in wealth, think of the desperate poverty experienced by billions of fellow human beings on this planet and how they could change that. How much does a man need and what is the point of making more?
1316717685011550209 2020-10-15 20:28:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich Maybe it had to do with an upswing in the stock market? Not sure if you lost it when the stock market drops and regain it when it comes back up qualifies as an increase of wealth. $13,000,000,000 is a lot of money to make in one day. It boggles the mind.
1316689522965590021 2020-10-15 18:36:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @InTrumpITrust11 @realDonaldTrump Your image of Trump looks like demon. What message are you trying to send?
1316688171837595648 2020-10-15 18:31:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @joelanz75 @realDonaldTrump Maybe it’s just me, but I think Jesus would be appalled by Trump. As far as words, deeds and actions are concerned, he is as far as you can get from Jesus and yet you people worship Trump.
1316687318703579136 2020-10-15 18:28:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Could Trump be the Anti Christ?Is Trump anything like Jesus, who you worship? I will answer that for you. No.                                           “For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform signs and wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect”.
1316683956390105088 2020-10-15 18:14:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> I have come to realize that these “hearings” are a waste of time and don’t tell the American people anything about a SCOTUS nominee’s outsized influence on the average American for decades to come. It’s all a big farce.
1316682501906223105 2020-10-15 18:09:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump And you need to release you tax returns. Have you forgotten about that Trump? I think not because you are fighting tooth and nail to stop the public from seeing them. They must look pretty bad for you Trump.
1316681716350754816 2020-10-15 18:05:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump What do they have to lose? Americans freedoms, form of government, their Constitution and their lives due to your nonexistent response to this pandemic.
1316680868681920514 2020-10-15 18:02:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @nypost Your corruption and incompetence have been obvious for the last four years Trump. Your days are numbered. I believe Americans are finally realizing what you really are.
1316680242153521154 2020-10-15 18:00:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump That is exactly what a guilty con artist would say Trump. There is plenty of evidence against you and the only reason you are not in prison right now is that you got yourself elected President. That could very well change in the next few weeks Trump.
1316679396183465984 2020-10-15 17:56:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOP @realDonaldTrump Not long ago, you were a Democrat Trump. Get real. You ran because you are a conman who loves power. Our Founding Fathers feared a man like you would arise in this country.
1316678443728240641 2020-10-15 17:52:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is Trump’s America. Vote him and the Republicans out!
1316678234273198081 2020-10-15 17:52:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump In the first stimulus bill Republicans made sure most of the aid went to corporations. The aid you are pushing now is the same thing. It’s all smoke and mirrors and you are hoping the American people fall for it. Try negotiating in good faith for the average American worker.
1316524599547486214 2020-10-15 07:41:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump seems remarkably unconcerned about this
1316521100889776129 2020-10-15 07:27:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> So much for a much ballyhooed investigation of Dems that amounted to absolutely nothing.
1316506806492037120 2020-10-15 06:30:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> So much for the “great” job that the Trump Administration has done with the COVID-19 pandemic.
1316496634663108608 2020-10-15 05:50:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> I am so proud of these voters. If we win this Presidential election and the Senate, we can do something about this attack in our democracy.
1316495071257165831 2020-10-15 05:44:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is a very disturbing video that people should watch. It is about a long running, complicated plan to create a sympathetic SCOTUS to conservative and corporate policy goals which will rule for decades. Vote accordingly.
1316491759296425984 2020-10-15 05:31:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @danielsgoldman @wolfblitzer @SpeakerPelosi Sounds like Blitzer have given the Republicans a complete pass on the failure of these negotiations. I don’t think he cares what’s in the bill, just so they get a bill done. Blitzer, OF COURSE it’s important if the American people get help instead of the wealthy and corporations!
1316487382296911875 2020-10-15 05:13:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @waltshaub @RBReich I believe it is a coordinated plan for the Republican Party to stay in power by suppressing the ability for people to vote in a free and fair election. Stacking the Supreme Court has been part of this plan for many years and they have succeeded in reaching that goal.
1316437228667764736 2020-10-15 01:54:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @djrothkopf @NBCNews I think that they should have been scheduled differently, but I am not sure I could stomach Trump very long anyway
1316436224446476289 2020-10-15 01:50:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC The woman seems to have some mental problems
1316435929020665858 2020-10-15 01:49:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @madrid_mike I did not see any source for the claims Hackett made in his tweet, so at the moment his opinion means nothing to me.
1316435161739866117 2020-10-15 01:46:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SawyerHackett How do you know this? Do you have something more than this tweet without a source to back up your claim?
1316433815976501250 2020-10-15 01:40:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SawyerHackett Are you saying that Dems cried wolf and it wasn’t necessary to push vote by mail in the middle of a pandemic? What is the point of your tweet?
1316431053612089345 2020-10-15 01:29:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> I think so too. And I still will not have an answer.
1316428595796021255 2020-10-15 01:20:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DonaldJTrumpJr The same thing could be said about your entire criminal family Junior.
1316426206317817865 2020-10-15 01:10:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Too little, too late Ronna. Trump is an incompetent, self serving failure as President and must be voted out of office.
1316397424299180032 2020-10-14 23:16:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> Commit right now to vote Trump out no matter what. Your country needs you and you will be making history. You will be happy you did.
1316395346399047682 2020-10-14 23:08:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TuckerFace00 @MattWolking Why would he even waste his time on the question? Show us some proof that this is even a real issue and not just another right wing conspiracy.
1316394594997862400 2020-10-14 23:05:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MattWolking @KellyannePolls Biden didn’t explode. He is just not going to spend time on conspiracy theories as Trump runs the country into the ground.
1316393748260098049 2020-10-14 23:01:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @democracynow You know what explains this President’s behavior? Trump is a narcissist who only cares for himself.
1316392905955856386 2020-10-14 22:58:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You would literally do anything to stay in power Trump. Lie, cheat, steal, kill. Man’s history is full of people like you that deceive the people and lead them to suffering and death. You remind me of Hitler.
1316391476541128705 2020-10-14 22:52:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump This country doesn’t need to poison it’s water supply by fracking, to meet it’s energy needs. It is a false choice.
1316390995378999296 2020-10-14 22:50:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I say if you vote for Donald Trump, you are going to lose no matter what.
1316390692806176769 2020-10-14 22:49:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Americans don’t need to “take back their country”. They just need to get rid of political leaders that try to divide us. Leaders like you Trump.
1316390091028344838 2020-10-14 22:47:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, in reality, you are a coward and a punk who talks like a strong brave man. When a person wrongs another person, they should apologize to them. That is a sign of confidence, strength and moral character. You have none of those qualities. You are unfit for office.
1316358723246403584 2020-10-14 20:42:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> There is a wealth of information about the rise of Trumpism in this article. Worth the read
1316325081308692481 2020-10-14 18:28:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> Right now Trump is doing what he does best. Pretending
1316290324256391169 2020-10-14 16:10:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @9NEWSNANCY @Steel94010 @JasonMillerinDC You are wrong. He did not stop all the Chinese travelers from entering the country. Besides that one act was not a proper response to a world wide pandemic. He downplayed it and wished it away, because he did not want it to interfere with his re-election.
1316289099108679680 2020-10-14 16:05:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JasonMillerinDC Jason Miller. A man who creates a revisionist history opinion piece about Trump’s response to this pandemic. The problem is that we watched it in real time and through Trump’s own words. You are simply a political prostitute who is willing to sacrifice his reputation for Trump.
1316164784920948736 2020-10-14 07:51:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AdamParkhomenko @donwinslow She doesn’t recall? Does she live under a rock or is she lying?
1316161335990902790 2020-10-14 07:38:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> Cruz is a pompous moron.
1316161188762394624 2020-10-14 07:37:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> Man, Klobuchar schooled Barrett on the law as she tried to avoid answering a question. She obviously knows how to handle a SCOTUS nominee who tries to breeze through a Senate hearing.
1316159419890176004 2020-10-14 07:30:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> Keep tweeting this. Don’t stop.
1316159195037741056 2020-10-14 07:29:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, you are sick profoundly damaged human being. I think deep inside you know that. When you go down, it will be a great fall and you will hear cheering in the streets.
1316158330595930114 2020-10-14 07:26:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ChrisJansing From people who like a sniveling coward like you Lindsey.
1316157895294308352 2020-10-14 07:24:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, you are an uneducated, morally bankrupt racist moron.
1316157646584590337 2020-10-14 07:23:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @CoryBooker We know you will never follow up on that promise Trump because you had four years to get it done.
1316136470655234049 2020-10-14 05:59:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @StanGott @NBCNews Why didn't Romney push for the winner of the Presidential Election to choose the next Supreme Court Justice? He's like Susan Collins. Concerns and platitudes about the state of the country is not what we need. Romney needs to stand up to Trumpism and Trump himself, but he won't.
1316106949335941122 2020-10-14 04:02:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JasonMillerinDC I wonder why his poll numbers are so bad then? Maybe these people do not give Trump credit for why they feel the way they do.
1316071605227921408 2020-10-14 01:41:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @fred_mkfred6 @GrandSolarMin @realDonaldTrump Let me put it this way. Yes there are people in both Parties that are dirty but if you don’t get the king of the swamp out, you will not be able to even begin to drain it.
1316035346157776897 2020-10-13 23:17:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GrandSolarMin @realDonaldTrump Get rid of the maniac in the White House first, then sort it out.
1316014634126643201 2020-10-13 21:55:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You have made many promises Trump, but you have not delivered on most of them. A person would have to be extremely gullible to believe you.
1316014147012681737 2020-10-13 21:53:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are doing what you have done during your entire term as President. Lie, distract, deflect, exaggerate and take people’s words out of context to win this election. You have no principles, ethics or values.
1315970530319753222 2020-10-13 18:59:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Craftmastah @realDonaldTrump Your Republican lawmakers have been doing it for years. The Court is packed with Republican Justices.
1315970000675536901 2020-10-13 18:57:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @tteegar @realDonaldTrump This is what happens when you rely on political ads for your information.
1315969623792246784 2020-10-13 18:56:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Where are all these supporters you say you have Trump? I don’t see any of them on this thread. Do you really have any or are you hallucinating again?
1315968925365153792 2020-10-13 18:53:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> It’s good to see a religious group that is not hypocritical about their faith.
1315968484459917312 2020-10-13 18:51:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You and your Republican sycophants in the Senate should have thought about that when you wouldn’t even give Obama’s SCOTUS pick a hearing 9 months before the election. Now you are trying to ram through your pick three weeks before Election Day. Screw you Trump.
1315963931924606976 2020-10-13 18:33:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I thought you told them to stop negotiations. Now all of a sudden you want to push them to get a bill done before the election. Perhaps that is what you are really worried about.
1315963144951525379 2020-10-13 18:30:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> I agree. Anarchists are not helping anyone.
1315927251335208966 2020-10-13 16:08:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Wait a minute Trump. If you owe 450 million dollars to some foreign oligarchs, how are you going to put up any money? Your broke. You are pulling ads and can’t compete in numerous states. I say you are a pathological liar Trump.
1315925911775129600 2020-10-13 16:02:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You never stop being a con artist and a carnival barker, do you Trump? That’s one of the reasons why you suck at being the President. Who would believe anything you say after 20,000 lies during your term in office?
1315785798734753792 2020-10-13 06:45:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> Please commit to vote in this Presidential Election. Unless you don’t mind 4 more years of Trump, busy or tired is not going to cut it.
1315783864464347139 2020-10-13 06:38:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You failed America Trump. Spectacularly.
1315770967109533696 2020-10-13 05:46:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Jeffery_038 @JudiciaryGOP @dbongino Spare me your moral outrage. You and the Republican leadership should have thought about what would happen when you wouldn’t even give Obama a hearing on his SCOTUS pick 9 months before the election. You will not like what will happen if Dems win the Senate and the Presidency.
1315769675700146179 2020-10-13 05:41:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ZackCz He tweeted the same message but was referring to New York State.
1315768506751877122 2020-10-13 05:37:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> We have a group of incumbent Republicans that will do absolutely anything for political power.
1315767348658343939 2020-10-13 05:32:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> I agree. This would have been a complete Biden blowout 40 years ago and our parents would have been appalled with Trump’s behavior and incompetence. What happened?
1315760481001447424 2020-10-13 05:05:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> This man cannot learn anything.
1315745446715949056 2020-10-13 04:05:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Promises Promises Trump. You never make them a reality. Promises is all you have. Not buying any of it.
1315744983106883594 2020-10-13 04:03:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump No, you don’t. It really has nothing to do with you Trump. Why should you get any credit?
1315744753057660931 2020-10-13 04:02:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I am going to contact you when you lose Trump. You will be the world’s biggest loser.
1315744346923302914 2020-10-13 04:01:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump No one tweets this much unless they know they are losing BIGLY!
1315744127687024641 2020-10-13 04:00:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You know what is worse? The Autocratic dystopia you want to create Trump.
1315743731165868032 2020-10-13 03:58:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are sounding desperate Trump. Take a breath and relax.
1315743544250949633 2020-10-13 03:58:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump It’s just like Private Bone Spurs to attack someone else for their military service. Daddy bought your way out of Vietnam didn’t he Trump.
1315742933723873282 2020-10-13 03:55:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump The end of your Presidency is at hand Trump. Next stop, prison.
1315742636435795969 2020-10-13 03:54:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump It’s Indigenous People’s Day. Columbus was a horrible human being, much like you Trump.
1315742286014275586 2020-10-13 03:53:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Talk is cheap Trump and you had 4 years to make what you are promising now a reality. The bill has come due. No more talk and it’s too late for action.
1315741685729591297 2020-10-13 03:50:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You can talk about the Stock Market all you want Trump, but the Stock Market is not the economy. You destroyed that with your incompetence, remember?
1315741270611054593 2020-10-13 03:48:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump The country has gone to hell thanks to you Trump.
1315741088519540737 2020-10-13 03:48:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump How long have you been promising good healthcare Trump? 4 years? Where is it Trump? You are a snake oil salesman, nothing more. You would promise people the moon if it helped you get re-elected.
1315740423101575170 2020-10-13 03:45:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Your facts are either, made up, out and out lies or your personal opinion, none of which I care about.
1315739544487104518 2020-10-13 03:42:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump What are you babbling about now Trump? All I hear is noise, as usual.
1315560020243865605 2020-10-12 15:48:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @4THEBEEZ2 @MilesTaylorUSA @HeatherjoyK @realDonaldTrump Isn’t it true that you were not at these meetings and Miles was? The public face of Donald Trump is scripted and sanitized, so I would have to say that you don’t really know him, do you?
1315558262755020801 2020-10-12 15:41:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @hughhewitt This tweet is pure political hyperbole at it’s worst. Did you ever stop and think how many Catholics are going to be voting for Joe Biden because they can’t stand the lies and corruption of the Trump Administration anymore?
1315556403281629184 2020-10-12 15:34:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @CNN @nytimes Trump, you are the last person on earth I would ask about who is qualified to be President. In fact, I would use you as an example of who not to have as President. You are not even a good example of a human being.
1315548840888619008 2020-10-12 15:04:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @govender_mari @ABC Sort out what? The Trump campaign taking Fauci’s comment about the medical community out of context and using them in a Trump political ad to make voters think he was speaking about the President? Privately my ass. Trump needs called out for his lies and deceit every time.
1315408965765935104 2020-10-12 05:48:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Kenny_Sowellfan @realDonaldTrump We are not even close to being a socialist nation and are moving rapidly toward a Corporatocracy. If you are a working American, that is not good.
1315407786780565504 2020-10-12 05:43:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Hades25292508 @realDonaldTrump You have been completely conned by a man without a conscience who would be King. Much like the Germans before WW2.
1315406530502627329 2020-10-12 05:38:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are either blind, stupid or have lost your memories of the last four years Trump. I do believe you are mentally ill so even if it is the latter, your time in office has been a series of lies, criminal behavior and abuse of power. You have caused 213,000 deaths. Are you nuts?
1315391122521427968 2020-10-12 04:37:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LabyrinthWeaver His supporters worshiping Trump as a God that can do no wrong, much like the Germans viewed Hitler before WW2.

1315361026154680331 2020-10-12 02:38:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Rich_Newton_ @RBReich I blame Trump for his lack of response to this virus which blew up the economy. Besides, he inherited the economy from Obama.
1315360325353570305 2020-10-12 02:35:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ddale8 @svdate @kaitlancollins I knew that the first time I heard the ad. Trump will go to any lengths to win.
1315352508819271682 2020-10-12 02:04:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @idrealist1 You would have to be an idiot to believe the central narrative of QANON.
1315351414626037760 2020-10-12 01:59:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews To be clear Trump, you have destroyed everything you ever touched. Time for you to take responsibility.
1315349152503660546 2020-10-12 01:50:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> You are a total hypocrite Grassley. Whatever happens now, you brought it on yourself

1315345698057908224 2020-10-12 01:37:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You had better hope so Trump or you will end up doing prison time.
1315345420097290241 2020-10-12 01:36:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @NateSilver538 The clock is ticking Trump.
1315345281530159110 2020-10-12 01:35:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Beachlover14504 @kevdog All I can tell you is we better not win the Senate, because you will not like what comes next. You will just have to eat it like we did.
1315344107611607041 2020-10-12 01:30:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> Lindsey, you are a perfect example of a slimy corrupt politician.
1315343789695938563 2020-10-12 01:29:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ksush73 @AndrewCMcCarthy Payback will be hell!
1315343038038900737 2020-10-12 01:26:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well what do you know? And hear she is, ready to jump into a SCOTUS seat 3 weeks before an election.
1315342525494947843 2020-10-12 01:24:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @waamutoo @AndrewCMcCarthy Whatever happens, just remember. You brought it on yourself.
1315342247647416321 2020-10-12 01:23:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @sirenidica @AndrewCMcCarthy McConnell should have thought about this when he refused to give Obama’s SCOTUS pick a hearing 9 months before the election. Can’t work with you Republicans. They will stab you in the back every time. Payback is going to be hell if we win the Senate.
1315338241252433927 2020-10-12 01:07:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AndrewCMcCarthy @realDonaldTrump You conveniently forgot to mention that 9 months before the election, Senate Republicans refuse to even give Obama’s SCOTUS pick a hearing and then three weeks before this election you are ramming through Trump’s nominee. If we win the Senate, you are going to pay dearly for that
1315247570827042817 2020-10-11 19:07:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @appleuserinc @brianneDMR @Susan_Hennessey @SenatorCollins I have had it with Collins concerns and platitudes.
1315247190646951936 2020-10-11 19:05:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @madrid_mike Don’t trust the polls. We will not have one shot at this. Commit to vote.
1315210368818515968 2020-10-11 16:39:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> Absolutely, bring back the Fairness doctrine
1315208950795694080 2020-10-11 16:33:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @JudgeJeanine @tedcruz All of this, is because of you, and a group of hard core right wing ideologues like Mitch McConnell whose only goal is total political power. Did you not think that the pendulum may one day swing back the other way?
1315081538850217985 2020-10-11 08:07:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> You would think that Christie would feel like an idiot, but maybe not.
1315081316598153217 2020-10-11 08:06:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> That’s what I like to see.
1315080010051579906 2020-10-11 08:01:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @madrid_mike Damn right lady.
1315069213116162049 2020-10-11 07:18:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TrumpWarRoom You cannot trust these Republican leadership. They only know one thing. Power and no holds barred politics. They better hope to God we don’t take the Presidency and the Senate. I will be pushing to neuter them.
1315067825799790594 2020-10-11 07:12:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Nick_Jacobs2003 @realDonaldTrump That would be a hard sell at my door.
1315067362257899522 2020-10-11 07:11:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DiogenesQuest @GOP They have lost the ability to think and reason.
1315067202203258881 2020-10-11 07:10:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JudgeJeaninefan @GOP What does this have to do with the State Department Pompeo? You are a fat partisan hack.
1315066900863385605 2020-10-11 07:09:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is great.
1315066709016010752 2020-10-11 07:08:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @pappasabre @GOP You and your fellow Trump supporters are destroying the country. What you see in that man is beyond me.
1315066196446842883 2020-10-11 07:06:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOP All Trump has to do is prove he is not shedding the virus, but he refuses to. Screw Trump. He acts like an idiot on the debate stage so it’s not worth watching anyway.
1315063260178264064 2020-10-11 06:54:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @sladesr I did what you suggested during the last presidential election and have regretted it ever since. Biden is not perfect, but if you don’t realize that he will not destroy this country like Trump will, you are willfully uninformed and extremely foolish.
1315061727248216066 2020-10-11 06:48:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> Great work Pence. You and Trump sure know how to deal with the virus, that’s for sure. I guess as long as they vote for you before they are in the hospital, all is good, right?
1315060776462413830 2020-10-11 06:44:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> The naked hypocrisy here is astounding. You cannot work with these people. They will stab you in the back every time.
1315060271048781824 2020-10-11 06:42:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You only stand for yourself Trump. You have made that very clear over the last four years.
1315059514694139904 2020-10-11 06:39:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> Poor babies. Maybe they shouldn’t have hitched their wagon to a lunatic
1315058475563655169 2020-10-11 06:35:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> Hot damn, Lindsey’s stupid comment makes me want to run out and vote for him.
1315053630932819968 2020-10-11 06:16:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @YungZoomer @NomadicIndian2 @WingYour @LaurenWitzkeDE All I have heard from you is your opinion and opinions and truth can be very different. Besides, if you are not full blooded American Indian, your forefathers were immigrants or conquerors.
1315015492881518593 2020-10-11 03:44:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @cbudoffbrown @jonathanvswan @ddiamond @politico There are things we can do to lower drug prices for people in this country, but this looks to be a very temporary fix at best and political pandering at worst. Why don’t we do what most other countries do and negotiate the prices of drugs with the pharmaceutical companies?
1315013369838084097 2020-10-11 03:36:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ACampaNajjar Assa is FOS and not worth listening to.
1315012414090424320 2020-10-11 03:32:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LeadersMaster @GOP You have to get a Trump’s enablers out of office.
1315012149526302721 2020-10-11 03:31:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOP This entire tweet is a real piece of work. Republicans fought Obama every step of the way on just about every issue. This video conveniently leaves that fact out.
1315011385970089986 2020-10-11 03:28:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOP It’s not easy coming out of a deep recession caused by a Republican Administration. Besides, that is a bizarre way judge an Administration’s economic track record. Besides, if you look at the graphs, Trump inherited a booming economy.
1315007144090128384 2020-10-11 03:11:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AdamParkhomenko Yes, Laura is right. No more con artists and criminals in the White House.
1315004425061257217 2020-10-11 03:01:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Redistrict @svdate I have always heard that it takes time to count mail in ballots, possibly days, and Trump is counting on in person voting to have the lead on Election Day. There is also the possibility that many mail in votes will be challenged or they were incorrectly filled out.
1315003922344443917 2020-10-11 02:59:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Redistrict @svdate I have always heard that it takes time to count mail in ballots, possibly days, and Trump is counting on in person voting to have the lead on Election Day.
1315002703408435206 2020-10-11 02:54:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @YungZoomer @WingYour @LaurenWitzkeDE No one said mass migrations are without consequences, only you. All we have needed is for years is Congress to agree to common sense immigration policies and they have never done it because it has become a political foot ball. Immigrants have long been important to this country.
1315000237145100291 2020-10-11 02:44:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Empact @mack_a_d00 @LaurenWitzkeDE Maybe you can tell me. What was the point of Lauren Witzke tweet?
1314999083459895297 2020-10-11 02:39:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LaurenWitzkeDE What is the point of this tweet? Is it to encourage opposition to immigrants coming to the United States? They helped build this country and they still are.
1314997794088914945 2020-10-11 02:34:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mattkatz00 Isn’t it something that ex politicians even get the experimental drug. I wonder what criteria the company uses to decide who gets it and who doesn’t.
1314997219758661632 2020-10-11 02:32:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> I agree. Trump is a symptom, not the cause.
1314996945795063812 2020-10-11 02:31:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @CNN @CNNOpinion I think Bush swore he would get out of politics and live out his days on his ranch. Sadly, I don’t see him doing what I think is the right thing for the country.

1314995633477033984 2020-10-11 02:26:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MYSTIC7 @GretaThunberg How about the science on Covid-19 and how to stop it from spreading when you don’t have a vaccine available.? How is the President’s scientific knowledge on that issue?
1314994896743419904 2020-10-11 02:23:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @okellojonathan5 @GretaThunberg @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden The’ll be sure to get back with you after the election.
1314994557759746049 2020-10-11 02:21:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @kylegriffin1 All Trump cares about is getting re-elected.
1314993329877192704 2020-10-11 02:16:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate Never? How would you know it’s never, Trump? I hope you crash and burn on Election Day. I will be tweeting you every day reminding you what a loser you are.
1314990500399771648 2020-10-11 02:05:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich For what purpose? To take Biden out? Otherwise it just makes them look like idiots thumbing their nose at this virus and then contracting it by their irresponsible behavior.
1314989843605225472 2020-10-11 02:03:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @guypbenson @KellyannePolls I would have said that the Republicans were doing it in 2016 and they are doing it again as we speak. They better hope we don’t win the Presidency and the Senate or they are going to be very unhappy.
1314916725511651329 2020-10-10 21:12:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> Cruz, why don’t you just walk over to the President and tell him that he is an idiot for ordering COVID negotiations with Dems to end. That would be the manly thing to do. You people are your own worst enemies.
1314915695977730049 2020-10-10 21:08:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump So Kellyanne, I thought that just a couple weeks ago Trump said to break off negotiations with Dems for a COVID relief bill. Now he wants a bill bigger than either side ask for. Are the steroids working on his mind or did he finally realize he screwed up royally?
1314906566546649088 2020-10-10 20:32:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> Hey all you Trump supporters. You have got to see this. Amazing.
1314905796124311552 2020-10-10 20:29:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AmoneyResists Peace and quite.
1314870043705069568 2020-10-10 18:07:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JuddPDeere45 Of course they do. The last devious Republican act before going down in flames.
1314866624764301312 2020-10-10 17:53:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> If Dems take the House and Senate there will be investigations going on for years.
1314865640533110784 2020-10-10 17:49:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @brithume Brett, we need to bring back the Fairness Doctrine and get rid of the political propaganda arm of the Republican Party.
1314864851756486658 2020-10-10 17:46:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @fwtoney Bill Barr
1314864729500811265 2020-10-10 17:45:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @EashiaT Something very upbeat, like we won a war or something
1314864286666285056 2020-10-10 17:44:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @marklevinshow @realDonaldTrump I have heard enough lies from this conman.
1314863746473504768 2020-10-10 17:42:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DavidHu37880992 @realDonaldTrump If you detest lies and lack of integrity, you would detest Donald J Trump. But you don’t do you? There lies the problem. You espouse noble, lofty ideas about people and good government but you support a pompous liar and a conman because he gives you what you want.
1314713072561520643 2020-10-10 07:43:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @SteveScully Are you hallucinating in your alternate reality again Trump?
1314712834320760833 2020-10-10 07:42:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @EveningEdit @FoxNews Flynn is nothing but a traitor, as are you Trump.
1314712513909587969 2020-10-10 07:41:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DavidHu37880992 @realDonaldTrump Like most Trump supporters, if you hear anything negative about Trump, you close your mind. Fortunately, many Americans have finally seen what Trump really is. If you have not figured him out by now, you probably never will.
1314711369070120960 2020-10-10 07:36:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 He is opening up our national parks for mining, oil exploration and logging, including the Alaska’s Tongass National Forest up for development which absorbs 8% of our CO2. He pulled us out of the Paris Climate Change Accord. He is not protecting anything. He is destroying it.
1314703047310929920 2020-10-10 07:03:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 He did sign the animal cruelty bill into law and he did make 1.8 billion dollars available for opioid abuse programs. He did not destroy ISIS, in fact he pulled our troops out just before our troops and the Kurds destroyed them. He did nothing useful in N. Korea.
1314699419640647680 2020-10-10 06:49:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 I will believe it when I see it. Trump has built very little wall and Mexico is not paying for it. He promised us fantastic healthcare but there is none in sight. He called a meeting with big pharma and none of the executives came. He has done nothing.  https://t.co/ApdxuJyH3k
1314689067540508673 2020-10-10 06:07:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is a moron.
1314682038251905026 2020-10-10 05:39:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BoSnerdley Should I care what you have to say? Don’t think so.
1314681405172047872 2020-10-10 05:37:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> I personally could care less if Trump debates or not. After the first one, I will never watch another presidential debate if Trump is involved in it. It would be a complete waste of my time.
1314680502616551424 2020-10-10 05:33:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump We have seen Trump in action for four years so you trying to convince myself and others that he cares about people is a joke. The man is a classic narcissist and most people realized that a long time ago.
1314679446658584577 2020-10-10 05:29:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Well Trump, they are having a hard time finding intelligent moderators that are not Never Trumpers. It is what it is, Trump.
1314678976124780544 2020-10-10 05:27:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I heard that they wanted to remove you Trump, not Biden. You have never had what it took to be President. You are the biggest loser on the planet.
1314673407032733698 2020-10-10 05:05:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow Christie is an idiot that put himself at risk being a political sycophant for this President. These high level Republicans thought they did not have to worry about a pandemic. The virus proved them wrong.
1314672622538547205 2020-10-10 05:02:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> I think Trump has lost his mind. He is confused, making mistakes and erratic.
1314672137140088833 2020-10-10 05:00:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls @axios Who cares Kellyanne.
1314671520749416453 2020-10-10 04:58:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> This sheriff is a white supremacist supporter. That should make everyone feel safer.
1314670153800519689 2020-10-10 04:52:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @PhilArballo2020 He always was a slimy little coward.
1314669992860884997 2020-10-10 04:52:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TheFrankOzJam I will certainly help him by voting him out of office.
1314669586546073601 2020-10-10 04:50:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @RushLimbaughEIB I will be sure to avoid listening to it.
1314669469868974085 2020-10-10 04:50:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> That is a great question
1314669194965856257 2020-10-10 04:48:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> So well said, but I doubt if his supporters will ever see the Trump’s obvious hypocrisy.
1314667952122269696 2020-10-10 04:43:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> I have always known that Trump was a threat to our democracy.
1314667573355646978 2020-10-10 04:42:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> The White House refuses to answer that question.
1314667278890340355 2020-10-10 04:41:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I cannot wait until you are in a prison cell Trump. I promise to write to you.
1314667027416715266 2020-10-10 04:40:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mckaycoppins @jonathanvswan They make this an issue as they hypocritically pack the Supreme Court
1314666375605084161 2020-10-10 04:37:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DavidHu37880992 @realDonaldTrump If you are supporting that maniac in the White House, you are doing exactly what I accused you of, whether you realize it or not. As far as mindlessly eating from the slop trough, I could say the same thing about you.
1314604296126771203 2020-10-10 00:31:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump’s the only one. He is an utter disgrace.
1314600606594629632 2020-10-10 00:16:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> We have got to clean this rat’s best out of the White House right now. VOTE!
1314593175877627904 2020-10-09 23:46:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MarshaBlackburn That is a hilarious statement coming at a time when Republicans are stacking the Supreme Court. In 2016 they wouldn’t hold hearings for Obama’s Merrick Garland because it was close to an election and now weeks before the election they are rushing to fill a vacancy on the Court.
1314591076238405635 2020-10-09 23:38:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is another legacy of the age of Trump. He is by far the worst President I have ever seen in my lifetime. How is supporters find anything to admire about the man I will never understand.
1314585269241352194 2020-10-09 23:15:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Don’t ever speak for me Trump. I despise you and everything you represent.
1314585018702925824 2020-10-09 23:14:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Only you could make a statement like that after we have watched you completely ignore the Covid-19 pandemic in this country. You have no sense of shame at all, do you Trump. You lack so many positive human emotions. You are a sick human being.
1314583900472184833 2020-10-09 23:10:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are encouraging these kind of people Trump and as far as I am concerned you are trying to start a civil war in this country. I predict you will go down in history as one of the most disgraceful Presidents in the history of this country.
1314579464785989632 2020-10-09 22:52:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @StewardshipAmer @realDonaldTrump Where do you people get the idea that Americans are exceptional and what are we doing at this point in history that is exceptional? We can’t even respond to a national emergency as a united people. We refuse to work with other nations to address international problems.
1314518654525022208 2020-10-09 18:50:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @PattyCT17 @realDonaldTrump And you are divorced from reality.
1314518460798513154 2020-10-09 18:49:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @rat_momma2 @realDonaldTrump You forgot to mention 210,000 dead Americans or do you just not give a damn about them. Be honest, at least with yourself.
1314517733212594176 2020-10-09 18:47:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LyleMorris12 @gerryflood8 @realDonaldTrump You do not know that. You just want to believe that is reality, so you state it as fact.
1314514180817539073 2020-10-09 18:32:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Rockprincess818 @realDonaldTrump Don’t know where you came up with that scenario, but Obama pulled us out of the the Republican caused Great Recession and handed Trump a thriving economy. Trump has managed to kill the economy because his main concern was getting re-elected and not confronting a deadly virus.
1314510415649529856 2020-10-09 18:18:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @sanaayesha___ @realDonaldTrump You sound like you are only concerned with life in the womb and not with 210,000 dead from COVID or the people who die from lack of affordable health care in this country every year.
1314508869452943360 2020-10-09 18:11:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @real_defender @realDonaldTrump No. You just happened to put a lunatic in the White House.
1314508618667094016 2020-10-09 18:10:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> 40% of the electorate is ready for an authoritarian government in this country and the personality worship of one man who would lead it. Donald Trump.
1314507532908531714 2020-10-09 18:06:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DavidHu37880992 @realDonaldTrump I believe there are 30-40% of Americans that don’t give a damn about 210,000 of their fellow citizens dying from COVID due to a President who cared more about getting elected than responding to a national emergency. I believe you are in that group.
1314506328593891328 2020-10-09 18:01:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BluegrassComics @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden When we slide into an authoritarian government under Donald Trump, I have to wonder how you would feel about being told what to do then.
1314504103490396160 2020-10-09 17:52:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 I would like to hear what Trump has actually done in the last four years and spare me the “He is making America great again” mantra. That means absolutely nothing.
1314503483576528896 2020-10-09 17:50:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Let’s see. He acted like a crime boss extorting dirt on a political opponent in Ukraine a had an impeachment trial. He was more concerned about getting re-elected than he was about confronting a pandemic and 210,000 people are dead. He has shown contempt for the Constitution.
1314389311140368384 2020-10-09 10:16:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow He can’t stand a string, confident woman, can he?
1314388922391298051 2020-10-09 10:15:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump Law and under under an Authoritarian government? You sold your soul to the devil Pence.
1314388315844628480 2020-10-09 10:12:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @huitrecouture @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr I know it’s hard to accept, but Trump supporters got conned out of their money as people like Parscal lived lavish lifestyles on your campaign donations. I would be pissed off too.
1314387118765076480 2020-10-09 10:08:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 I plan on doing just that. If you actually think Trump is transparent you fell for the biggest con artist in history.
1314369384337596417 2020-10-09 08:57:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @wandavazquezg After hearing what you said about Puerto Rico after the hurricanes Trump this Governor must be crazy to endorse you.
1314367819031744512 2020-10-09 08:51:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews I have heard enough BS from you to last me the rest of my life
1314346736517812224 2020-10-09 07:27:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> The man is a bumbling baffoon.
1314345773157548032 2020-10-09 07:23:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> All I can say is that Donald Trump  appears to be an unstable wack job.
1314344691639476224 2020-10-09 07:19:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> He blew past the politics and got to the meat of the matter.
1314338825385246733 2020-10-09 06:56:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> Like the video says,Trump and his Administration are not even protecting themselves or those that come to the White House. How will they ever protect Americans in this country. They can’t.
1314302822477897730 2020-10-09 04:33:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> Don’t worry folks. The Denier Crowd says this is normal and there is nothing to worry about.
1314302306335232000 2020-10-09 04:31:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well, well, well. I would wager that this is not the work of Antifa.
1314202907634397186 2020-10-08 21:56:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Only on you and your rich buddies Trump. Screw them.
1314150340892205056 2020-10-08 18:27:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SarahHuckabee @VP @realDonaldTrump Except for the people dying from COVID you might add.
1314117710721290240 2020-10-08 16:17:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Only idiots would fall for this garbage from the President. It’s just another desperate attempt to get re-elected. He needs removed from office immediately.
1314115914812526594 2020-10-08 16:10:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @BorisJohnson Will you just stop with theChina virus nonsense Trump. It’s another blatant attempt to shift the blame from your own incompetence and pathetic response to this virus and most thinking people realized this a long time ago.
1314114743473508352 2020-10-08 16:05:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @idrealist1 Now that is one nasty woman on so many levels.
1314114433732444161 2020-10-08 16:04:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> I would have to say that many of these people working in the White House do not care about other people, their families, or even themselves. Their politics is like a religion that has run amok.
1313994139093131268 2020-10-08 08:06:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump We are waiting for you to lose the election Trump and then we can begin the arrests.
1313991731730354176 2020-10-08 07:56:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Brickhouse20 @brianklaas I believe one reason is because Trump heads up the Federal Government which could enforce the Voting Rights Act to stop voter suppression, but won’t.
1313953978590400512 2020-10-08 05:26:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> Commit to vote now and show up during early voting or on November 3. The country needs you right now.
1313944245166911495 2020-10-08 04:48:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> Good for Biden. I would not Trump for one minute on this issue or any other for that matter. He will cry about it, but just ignore the noise.
1313940913182384130 2020-10-08 04:35:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> What protocols?
1313940780201971712 2020-10-08 04:34:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> If you did get a mail in ballot, Florida allows you to take it to any polling station, surrender your ballot and vote in person.
1313940320472752134 2020-10-08 04:32:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> Don’t believe the polls. You remember what happened in 2016. I urge you to vote in person if you feel safe enough. Trump wants his poll watchers to disqualify as many mail in ballots as possible and most of them will be for Biden.

1313903488552833024 2020-10-08 02:06:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is a super spreader.
1313903251268554753 2020-10-08 02:05:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> I cannot believe Americans are ok with this.
1313902201778118659 2020-10-08 02:01:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I know what you are doing Trump. Trying to get Americans to lose their faith in our election system and the free press. All that leaves is you as the source of truth in this country. Since you are a narcissistic, pathological liar that would not be a good thing.
1313900491777224704 2020-10-08 01:54:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> I am suggesting that anyone who  feels safe enough to vote in person, do so. Trump is trying to disqualify as many mail in ballots as he can. In Florida, we can take our mail in ballot to any polls station and vote in person.        https://t.co/iEKodl1ymu
1313896759760912393 2020-10-08 01:39:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump If you mean more Chaos, you are right Trump.
1313896579787522048 2020-10-08 01:38:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump There is plenty of evidence that the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians in 2016. I want our intelligence agencies to investigate these kinds of traitorous behavior. You would have to be insane not to.
1313895754038206465 2020-10-08 01:35:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are a liar Trump. You are tearing this country apart with your talk about red states and blue states. We all pay taxes and everyone should get the benefits.
1313890655744204801 2020-10-08 01:15:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> If we are ever going to get this country straightened out, Fox has got to go. Bring back the Fairness Doctrine!
1313889175033311239 2020-10-08 01:09:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @charliebeatty @eugenegu Either way you look at it, Trump is and has always been a self serving moron.
1313853786293706752 2020-10-07 22:48:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well, well, well. One of Fox’s finest. I thought those anchors respected the police.
1313851733752377347 2020-10-07 22:40:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DianeDo51850827 @GreggJarrett Trump and his Republican enablers brought all this on themselves by refusing to follow any guidelines set by medical experts. Not only that, but they encourage his followers to do the same thing. And you want me to feel sorry for the fool? I feel sorry for the 210,000 who died.
1313850375607328769 2020-10-07 22:35:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @angie_spencer71 @GreggJarrett @home A home where he is still infectious and there are people working there waiting on him hand and foot that could contract the virus from him. Not even close.
1313849157174648833 2020-10-07 22:30:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @bhaynes291 @GreggJarrett But it sure beats refusing to wear a mask at all doesn’t it?
1313757459840933889 2020-10-07 16:26:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KBillingsworth @GreggJarrett Hypocrisy? She is not openly contemptuous of the virus and encouraging people to not follow guidelines like this President is doing. His whole Administration was doing the same thing and it backfired on them spectacularly.
1313756554349473813 2020-10-07 16:22:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KahlerSabrina @GreggJarrett Here come the conspiracy theories. If you have been paying any attention to Trump and his Administration’s attitude toward this virus, you would have noticed that they show it contempt and do not follow ANY of the simple guidelines to slow it’s spread. This virus doesn’t care.
1313753984281333766 2020-10-07 16:12:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> Yes. This is obvious to many, but after 4 years of death, lies and empty promises, this election is still relatively close. That should tell us something is wrong with the American Electorate.
1313752552308170757 2020-10-07 16:06:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You keep pushing that BS Trump, because you are getting desperate. The clock is ticking and you are behind and the only way you can win is by limiting our people’s ability to vote. You really are a sick demented human being.
1313751668115279875 2020-10-07 16:03:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @SteveFDA I know you Trump. You would give people arsenic if it made the pandemic go away and allowed you to be re-elected.
1313632112839360514 2020-10-07 08:07:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> But his supporters love it. Maybe they want some tin pot dictator ruling over them.
1313631505462198272 2020-10-07 08:05:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @PaulaSeitz1 @KellyannePolls I say Claudia has more wisdom and common sense than many adults including her mother. Trump and Kellyanne’s world view will lead to sickness, death and the destruction of our planet.
1313618711673274369 2020-10-07 07:14:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I keep telling you Trump, you are your own worst enemy. My suggestion? Just keep being who you are, because you can’t pretend you are a peacock when you are a snake.
1313606634770399242 2020-10-07 06:26:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ericmetaxas I wonder how well he would have done while living like an average American without an army of doctors and the latest unapproved antiviral drugs. The fat slob would have most likely died.
1313605755547906048 2020-10-07 06:23:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC You know what kind of people like to project the image of strength? Authoritarian rulers and dictators.
1313604689599102976 2020-10-07 06:18:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow You are disgusting Christie. You helped devolve the Presidential debates into a schoolyard brawl. Proud of yourself? Then Trump and his buddies have you Covid. You know what they say about Karma.
1313594533104541703 2020-10-07 05:38:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @benshapiro You are not a true blue Trump supporter are you. The fact is that my dog make a better President than Trump ever was and yes, that is all due to Trump himself.
1313593789878022152 2020-10-07 05:35:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I guess we will find out Trump. I would be so overjoyed if you were beat so badly you would just crawl away and hide. The whole country would see you for what you hate most. A loser.
1313576084944883712 2020-10-07 04:25:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Well, I guess all you Trump supporters that have lost your jobs or businesses are not going to get any relief from the government thanks to this President. That money is for all the states, not just Democratic states and that is how it should be.
1313574431600541701 2020-10-07 04:18:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> Yes, a freeloader is someone like Trump.
1313574036039925760 2020-10-07 04:17:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump The Stock Market is not the economy Trump. You wiped out the economy Trump because you were more interested in political power than the citizens of this country. You are a disgrace.
1313500555239739392 2020-10-06 23:25:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> I have to correct Trump. He has the “best medical care in the world”, not you. So when he tells you to not fear or be “dominated” by the virus, remember this. You live in two very different worlds and he doesn’t give a damn about you.
1313499260235796481 2020-10-06 23:20:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @esaagar @jonathanvswan You are wrong or most likely lying Trump. The highest flu death rate in the last 30 years was in 2003- 2004 when 48,000 Americans died from the flu.
1313496623423594496 2020-10-06 23:09:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @VoterCenter I am suggesting to Democrats that if you feel safe voting in person, do that instead of voting by mail. If you  https://t.co/iEKodl1ymu have a mail in ballot, you can surrender that at any polling location and vote normally. This Atlantic article explains why I suggest this.
1313495247339622406 2020-10-06 23:04:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> I am suggesting that if you are healthy and feel safe enough to vote in person, you should do that instead of voting by mail. In Florida, if you already have a vote by mail ballot, you can surrender it to any polling location and vote in person.        https://t.co/iEKodl1ymu
1313487217856319495 2020-10-06 22:32:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @tyllierae @theintercept No, I don’t where a mask at home, but Trump’s “House” had 8 people become infected with COVID-19 because the President and his Republican allies are contemptuous of this virus and go out of their way to avoid social distancing and wearing masks.
1313391347307610112 2020-10-06 16:11:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @theintercept I am sure his supporters will view his irresponsibility in some positive light.
1313390395217375233 2020-10-06 16:07:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @4mediaequality @JudgeJeaninefan @atensnut Biden does have a checkered past and was never my first choice for President, but he has changed. Trump on the other hand is what he has been his entire adult life. A narcissist conman, and if you support him for President, you are the sucker helping him create a dictatorship.
1313260411450462208 2020-10-06 07:30:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> Is it just me or is Trump corrupting every person that spends any time around this President?
1313259918015823873 2020-10-06 07:28:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jw_beech @madrid_mike And if the Texas numbers were up, Cornyn would be saying Trump did a great job with the pandemic.
1313259297195917321 2020-10-06 07:26:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate Every example that Petrine made about Trump’s experience were things that Trump has been terrible at.
1313248551099674624 2020-10-06 06:43:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @santiagomayer_ I believe you are.
1313248404622004224 2020-10-06 06:43:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Bill_Maxwell_ Yes
1313247931361882112 2020-10-06 06:41:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Who in the hell would believe all that nonsense Trump? You are an anti hero.
1313244706671931396 2020-10-06 06:28:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Who in the hell would believe all that nonsense Trump? Your audacity never ceases to amaze me. Everything you touch dies and your corruption and incompetence is obvious to everyone.
1313216176865116165 2020-10-06 04:35:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> No matter how Trump’s recovery goes, he’s proven that he is totally irresponsible and doesn’t care about anyone but himself
1313215344379670528 2020-10-06 04:31:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Anyone who would believe you is not paying attention and besides, you have already wrecked the economy Trump.
1313214767784484870 2020-10-06 04:29:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is the kind of people these employees decided to work for. I suspect they knew the kinds of lowlifes they were working for a long time ago.
1313214085023109129 2020-10-06 04:26:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> True
1313213448600408065 2020-10-06 04:24:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Any so called Republicans left that are concerned about the national debt? Someone is going to have to pay for these tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy and that will be you and your children and your grandchildren. Think about it.
1313212776354115585 2020-10-06 04:21:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Your supporters may not know this, but we already have a law that protects people with pre-existing conditions called the ACA. All Trump is able to give you us promises that you will never see delivered. That is what a conman does.
1313211960784236545 2020-10-06 04:18:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Is he still alive and working? If he is, he is lucky.
1313211030621782016 2020-10-06 04:14:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MaryHeglar It sounds like what an insane and self destructive species would do.
1313210242998718465 2020-10-06 04:11:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @glennkirschner2 I think you nailed it. We will soon see if that scenario comes to pass, but it sounds like something he would do. The man has no guilt or shame.
1313209662884524037 2020-10-06 04:09:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> There is nothing that would surprise me about this lunatic.
1313209454364708879 2020-10-06 04:08:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> And yet his supporters worship this man. I wonder how many of them will end up with this virus?
1313208889358389250 2020-10-06 04:06:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is a great example of the moral bankruptcy of the Republican Party. They are more concerned about campaign donations than their own supporters health.
1313114318343483392 2020-10-05 21:50:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @CarmineSabia Maybe they are a group of Americans that do not want to see authoritarian rule in this country by a mentally ill man child. They love this country instead of a personality cult of one man. Can you blame them?
1312921979217944576 2020-10-05 09:06:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich We all knew that would happen. Not sure Biden decided to do that, but I knew Trump would not respond in kind.
1312921547347238915 2020-10-05 09:04:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> Everyone has to keep one thing in mind. Donald Trump gets what he wants, no matter what.
1312880383399202821 2020-10-05 06:20:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is a full blown narcissist and that explains the bizarre and tone deaf comments he makes.
1312865144783986689 2020-10-05 05:20:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> This video is awesome. It says everything I would like to say to President Trump about his entire lack of response to this pandemic.
1312851519457431557 2020-10-05 04:26:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @4mediaequality @JudgeJeaninefan @atensnut Lemme guess. If Cruz had said those things about your family, you would decide to suck up to him and say how great he was because you knew you couldn’t survive politically without Trump’s bone headed base? I wouldn’t. I think if I were Biden I’d rather be called a racist.
1312667131679584257 2020-10-04 16:13:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TexasDagney @maartenvda It’s a nice story, and people can debate this forever, but wouldn’t it have been great if Donald Trump had just released all of his tax information in 2016 instead of using the excuse that he was being audited by the IRS? The same IRS said that excuse was false. Why didn’t he?
1312525930405851136 2020-10-04 06:52:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC The Trump clan is the entitled class and rules for the common people can be ignored.
1312520452242247680 2020-10-04 06:30:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @Yahoo That statement could describe this entire Administration for the last four years.
1312517658865094657 2020-10-04 06:19:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DeeDeeDiane9 @theadkpratt @davenewworld_2 Trump looks like he is going down in defeat. You won’t be laughing then will you.
1312510980815945728 2020-10-04 05:52:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> Conclusion: It most likely was not created in a weapons lab.
1312498925849337856 2020-10-04 05:05:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @phil_di_valerio @rickwtyler No.
1312481338654552064 2020-10-04 03:55:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump How about the 200,000 people you killed by your arrogance, your lack of empathy, your narcissism and your incompetence? You are feeling well and they are not feeling at all. Does any of that ever bother you Trump? I think not. You are a monster.
1312476159892840448 2020-10-04 03:34:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @trump_turtle The people in this Administration have made everything political, even a pandemic. They were arrogant in their attitude to this virus and it cost 208,000 Americans their lives. Their attitude mirrors this President’s attitude. Vote them out.
1312472523649425408 2020-10-04 03:20:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich Did these two geniuses ever consider the fact that Trump and his Administration have been so contemptuous of the guidelines put in place to stop the spread of this virus that it was inevitable that this President would become infected? They both want to politically spin this.
1312442792514260992 2020-10-04 01:22:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @vermontgmg @svdate We can’t ever trust them.
1312441890336198657 2020-10-04 01:18:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @HindlesKitchen @Mikel_Jollett  https://t.co/IMfxWnVgR9.               There was an opinion in the article that stated his Executive Order carried as much weight as a campaign slogan. Sounds like it may not as enforceable as your definition might suggest.
1312440595818803200 2020-10-04 01:13:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SelfieShanNow @stampsfaninsask @Mikel_Jollett What did he accomplish? He signed an Executive Order that could very well be unenforceable. His supporters always seem ready to accept whatever he says as fact without verifying
1312439446856372224 2020-10-04 01:08:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> The article included an opinion that Trump’s Executive Order carries as much weight as a campaign slogan.
1312339605123981317 2020-10-03 18:31:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> Why would they do that?
1312337386286837761 2020-10-03 18:23:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TheRightMelissa @brithume @realDonaldTrump It’s ironic that this meme was posted as your own President has contracted the virus because he would not follow medical guidelines.
1312336823528587264 2020-10-03 18:20:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump So your own President has contracted a disease, which he knew was dangerous, but publicly called it a hoax, and now you are claiming it’s a hoax. I think that this a President has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that the virus is real and dangerous
1312333824135749632 2020-10-03 18:09:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @brithume And you are supposed to be a professional, accomplished and respected journalist, so you tweet this? This juvenile attempt at humor is beneath you.

They all thought that somehow they were all immune.
1312327880035233794 2020-10-03 17:45:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @charliekirk11 Kirk, you are either stupid or you are a cynical liar. This Administration has shown contempt for the Covid-19 virus for months and it has finally caught up with them. You are a spin doctor and an apologist for an Administration responsible for 200,000 deaths
1312325125585489920 2020-10-03 17:34:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @kylegriffin1 @SallySellers54 I am not managing Biden’s campaign, but if I was, I would do everything I could to send this President into the dustbin of history. I would not pull the ads.
1312324320253956096 2020-10-03 17:31:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SebGorka @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I have read your request and have decided to ignore it vote Democrat down the line for the good of this country.
1312319212942131200 2020-10-03 17:10:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls And I say you don’t have a heart Kellyanne. You and this Administration showed contempt for this virus and encouraged many other Americans to do the same causing sickness and death. Now it has found you.
1312316735719178241 2020-10-03 17:01:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> I agree. I could care less what Fox News wants. Trump is a pompous idiot that ignored basic precautions during a pandemic.
1312209330553331712 2020-10-03 09:54:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mtredden @svdate Why am I not surprised
1312203012065034240 2020-10-03 09:29:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump Republicans are relentless and focused. We should be also.
1312184051130757120 2020-10-03 08:13:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @democracynow Very nice Melania. Your concern for these kids is obvious to everyone
1312181251462197248 2020-10-03 08:02:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> I just saw one of Trump’s negative political ads attacking Joe Biden. I don’t believe Biden should slow down his campaign.
1312179750165598208 2020-10-03 07:56:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @madrid_mike @ProjectLincoln I am urging Biden to continue campaigning and ignore Fox News. The stakes are two high and we cannot afford another 4 years of Donald Trump and his Republican enablers.
1312178415202496515 2020-10-03 07:51:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jessie4324 @realDonaldTrump I certainly do not.

1312163586228191234 2020-10-03 06:52:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> I remember those polls vividly. Register immediately and commit to vote in this Presidential Election. Your country needs you now.
1312161134070308864 2020-10-03 06:42:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RetroGamer_81 @JoeBiden Biden tested negative so you can just stop the stupid conspiracy theories.
1312160543445151751 2020-10-03 06:40:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @saffronwitreen @JoeBiden The don’t believe you can speak for all the troops.

1312159343454765056 2020-10-03 06:35:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @wxilliam @JoeBiden He very well could be faking it. I do not put anything beyond him.
1312158676015226880 2020-10-03 06:33:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jackie13911256 @JoeBiden You don’t speak for me so you can drop the “we the people” BS.
1312158314273271808 2020-10-03 06:31:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @allthingssoft1 @JoeBiden @Scaramucci Really. I noticed how well Republicans worked with Democrats during the last four years. 400 bills from the House that Mitch McConnell refused to even bring them to the Senate floor. Personally I don’t care if you work with Dems or not. I’ll bet you never have it a thought.
1312156903028355072 2020-10-03 06:25:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mmpadellan I absolutely agree.
1312093486074691585 2020-10-03 02:13:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> You obviously don’t Wilson.
1312093114195210241 2020-10-03 02:12:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> I knew that was coming.
1312091167870377984 2020-10-03 02:04:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is the mentality of Team Trump.
1312090001602220035 2020-10-03 02:00:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DeAnna4Congress I find it strange that you would ask such a ridiculous question, like there is a conspiracy at work here. Trumpers, including the President call it a hoax, Dems take it seriously and follow medical science guidelines.
1312088579649220609 2020-10-03 01:54:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @28stormy Your hero refused to wear a mask and if he’s not lying about the whole thing, look where that got him? Trump also called COVID-19 a hoax along with many of his supporters. I wonder what they are saying now since he supposedly has it?
1311991114321330176 2020-10-02 19:27:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> These Republicans are cowards and are enabling Trump to dismantle our political system. They care more for their positions of power than the country. VOTE THEM OUT!
1311982354165096448 2020-10-02 18:52:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> This just about says it all, in a humorous way.
1311981669004513280 2020-10-02 18:49:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ACampaNajjar I have so little trust in Trump and his Administration that I don’t even know if this is some kind of political hoax or not, so no, I do not feel any sympathy for him.
1311980594948182016 2020-10-02 18:45:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump supporters are voting for a Russian asset and an American traitor to his country. Every one of you got completely conned.
1311980087147978753 2020-10-02 18:43:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> As usual, Republicans are trying to suppress the vote in what’s supposed to be a democracy. They don’t want people to vote so they can stay in power period.
1311979319464521728 2020-10-02 18:40:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC Bottom line is that I do not trust anything Trump or his Administration puts out. Could very well be a hoax.
1311978776440569860 2020-10-02 18:38:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mmpadellan Could very well be a hoax. I am not sure how this will help him though, unless his handlers have him near death and he miraculously recovers and his supporters are crying and thanking God he is still alive. Then they all go out and vote.
1311977760328482823 2020-10-02 18:34:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> Of course they did. They are the party of white racists.
1311976818656841728 2020-10-02 18:30:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MollyJongFast @svdate Texans, rise up, register and find a way to vote this despicable political party out of office. When you do that, you will live in a state that encourages people to vote. Isn’t that’s what supposed to happen in a democracy instead of suppressing it?
1311974868892688385 2020-10-02 18:22:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow Everything Trump does is geared toward staying in power and he will do ANYTHING to accomplish that. They probably gamed this announcement out a long time ago. How this helps him, I don’t know.
1311973895185063936 2020-10-02 18:18:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Acosta He was forced to do this because he wants to stay in office.
1311973537557737478 2020-10-02 18:17:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> Do not pass this tweet by. Read the whole thread and decide for yourself if it alarms you enough to register TODAY and VOTE!
1311972867853242369 2020-10-02 18:14:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ChrisMurphyCT @svdate Every piece of information that comes out about this Administration screams “Get this corrupt group of Americans out of office ASAP”, before there comes a time when you are unable to! VOTE!
1311970527821561856 2020-10-02 18:05:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @idrealist1 The first thing I thought of was if Trump and his campaign are lying about the whole thing.
1311965259545169920 2020-10-02 17:44:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @PainterChick1 @ericgarland @CUPCAKEWILLIAM6 Good point. There are other ways to change the situation though. 100 million eligible voters in this country could not be bothered to vote in 2016. I would like to know where they are. It would be a perfect time to show up.
1311832302905946115 2020-10-02 08:56:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JudgeJeaninefan @atensnut I personally don’t give a damn what Cruz says about anything. The man is a complete coward. First Trump tells him his wife is ugly and then says that Cruz’s father was involved in the Kennedy Assassination. Then Cruz spends the next four years sucking up to Trump. Cruz is no man.
1311803293211926528 2020-10-02 07:00:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @13Sisters76 @TrumpWarRoom @JennaEllisEsq The left is very concerned about an authoritarian government, especially in our own country. That’s why we fight against this President. If Trump wins this election and is given a free hand by Congress, I believe he will become America’s first dictator.
1311801467213361152 2020-10-02 06:53:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @charliekirk11 @Squidpower007 Who said?
1311801021262331905 2020-10-02 06:51:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> Don’t trust the polls. Make sure you register early and commit to vote no matter what. We need Americans to stand up for our Republic by voting in this incredibly important election.
1311799873923174405 2020-10-02 06:47:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> That woman is a real piece of work. Where do they find these people?
1311799474403119105 2020-10-02 06:45:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RubinReport @realDonaldTrump Why wouldn’t he do it this time? Something change?
1311798632740532230 2020-10-02 06:42:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GreggJarrett @realDonaldTrump Looks like you came up with these “stunning” revelations Gregg, so the source is suspect already. The Trump campaign was interested in any dirt they could get on Clinton from the Russians and Micheal Flynn pleaded guilty to his crimes. Not stunning.
1311795651269795841 2020-10-02 06:30:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JackPosobiec @realDonaldTrump Not surprising since Trump supports a racist Zionist Israeli government. Big deal.
1311795152038563842 2020-10-02 06:28:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GreggJarrett @realDonaldTrump Of course the Florida AG requested an FBI investigation. Our Governor is a Trump zombie and the Republican Legislature did not follow a legally passed Amendment to our Constitution AGAIN! Your tweet is not even news.
1311793902110814208 2020-10-02 06:23:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ColumbiaBugle @realDonaldTrump Who is the enemy? Anyone that doesn’t want a malevolent, narcissistic man child in the White House? Count me in.
1311793403278000129 2020-10-02 06:21:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GreggJarrett @realDonaldTrump I would trust Comey long before I would trust a member of Trump’s personal ministry of propaganda.
1311792448172175360 2020-10-02 06:17:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Gee, a bunch of law enforcement Trump supporters. Who cares?
1311792143774765061 2020-10-02 06:16:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KDORR_USA @realDonaldTrump Who cares? They can vote how they want. Personally, I want the dirtbag out of office and in a prison cell.
1311791687677640704 2020-10-02 06:14:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GreggJarrett @realDonaldTrump This would not even be an issue if Trump has released his taxes as he promised he would. Even now, he could release his taxes and prove the NYT was wrong. Why won’t he?
1311790285349945344 2020-10-02 06:09:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @PastorDScott @realDonaldTrump That’s not how debates work. Trump’s inability to follow simple debate rules to avoid talking over each other and allowing both sides to make their case without interruption is the problem. It’s part of his personality. The rules don’t apply to him.
1311788792248897536 2020-10-02 06:03:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate As far as I know, Trump doesn’t get to decide whether these changes are made or not. He can accept and follow them or stay home.
1311787259872587778 2020-10-02 05:57:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> Do people really think it can’t happen in this country? I’m sure the Germans felt the same way before WW2.
1311768736769224708 2020-10-02 04:43:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC No person should have the power Zuckerberg does. I think he actually supports Trump.
1311768021615206403 2020-10-02 04:40:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> I can tell you from experience. Don’t trust these polls. Make sure you are registered early and vote! You country needs you right now.
1311766751324110851 2020-10-02 04:35:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> I would ignore the morons.
1311766123193536512 2020-10-02 04:33:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @PainterChick1 @ericgarland @CUPCAKEWILLIAM6 I care. I do not want one of our adversaries interfering with our elections. To me, that’s close to declaring war and it should be confronted in the strongest terms
1311765130024300544 2020-10-02 04:29:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> This Press Secretary made sure that she did not go anywhere near the ballots in the river remark by Donald Trump. She also made sure she did not say that the President was mistaken or exaggerated the story. Where do they get these people?
1311763862472060928 2020-10-02 04:24:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JohnCornyn @WSJ I say you and this article are wrong Senator, and Joe Biden is correct.                                            https://t.co/QO4B6TDKNI
1311760889616498689 2020-10-02 04:12:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> Donald Trump is to blame. His campaign wants to misdirect us away from the actual problem.
1311760493074358287 2020-10-02 04:10:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> Unbelievable
1311759736065470471 2020-10-02 04:07:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> I agree completely. I believe even if Trump loses, it will be a long hard road to get us back to what we were as a country.
1311758213218545664 2020-10-02 04:01:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump And that entire list of people have made the cynical decision to put political power before the good of the country by supporting a corrupt madman who would be King.
1311735482326319104 2020-10-02 02:31:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is a racist and supports racist groups.
1311735135977508865 2020-10-02 02:30:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @tedcruz No Ted. You know why it was a train wreck. It’s because the guy who said your father was involved in the Kennedy assassination, doesn’t feel any debate rules apply to him and turned it into a dumpster fire. You know what he is, and yet you made a cynical decision to support him.
1311733734664736768 2020-10-02 02:24:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> I guess it’s not important if it is true or false. Only if people believe it is true
1311729236995170306 2020-10-02 02:06:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump. The fact is, you have never engaged in a formal debate and you did not debate Biden Tuesday night either. There are rules in a debate and you did not feel they applied to you, like just about every other aspect of your life. It was a waste of time for everyone involved.
1311695470759153668 2020-10-01 23:52:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> Don’t think that could ever happen here? You give Trump another term, you may find out.
1311625856100564992 2020-10-01 19:15:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LindseyGrahamSC Lindsey Graham, one of the biggest hypocrites on the planet.
1311625393540079617 2020-10-01 19:13:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @roxyhound @LindseyGrahamSC I could care less what you do.
1311609371093282817 2020-10-01 18:10:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @idrealist1 @BoKnowsNews @CBSNews I have often said that 40% of the electorate in this country was primed and ready for America’s first dictatorship. How did we get here?
1311608083873968128 2020-10-01 18:05:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump You mean Protect the President don’t you? You and your fellow Trump worshipers will do anything to keep him in power. You know what is hilarious? In spite of all your efforts, Trump will run that big mouth of his and reverse any progress you thought you made.
1311504875323355137 2020-10-01 11:15:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> Look closely Trump. You are a loser.
1311504508279754752 2020-10-01 11:13:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump And you are a coward and a blowhard Trump. I will take Biden any day over you.
1311504189059739648 2020-10-01 11:12:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Because they are some of the most gullible people on the planet perhaps?
1311503754294956032 2020-10-01 11:10:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You should be tried for treason Trump.
1311503503102300160 2020-10-01 11:09:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I am getting the impression that your master plan to convince Americans that our mail in ballot system is ripe with fraud is going to fail Trump. 5 weeks to the election Trump. You had better up your game, or your last years are not going to be good ones.
1311471055538659330 2020-10-01 09:00:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump More and more people are realizing exactly what you are Trump. You can’t help yourself can you? Keep up the good work.
1311469955678863361 2020-10-01 08:56:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> Isn’t that nice Kellyanne. Are you a  sick twisted white racist also?
1311469235282083842 2020-10-01 08:53:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC They better, or no one will watch them again. Trump destroys everything he touches.
1311468977806348288 2020-10-01 08:52:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump lies as easily as he breathes.
1311468471176302593 2020-10-01 08:50:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @paulsperry_ @realDonaldTrump The only plot against this President is his own sick mentality. Keep it up Trump, you are doing great!
1311465560769789953 2020-10-01 08:38:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AriFleischer I watched the debate and all I can say is your bias for Donald Trump is obvious. I wonder if it’s because you are as gullible as the rest of the Trump mob, or do you harbor some nationalistic Zionist ideology. Your man was an abusive pig on that debate stage. Admit it.
1311464077877706755 2020-10-01 08:32:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> He still did not denounce them!
1311463855759949825 2020-10-01 08:32:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Nothing you say will change Americans view of you as an incompetent blowhard.
1311463386564222978 2020-10-01 08:30:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Keep it up Trump. Every time you run that big mouth of yours, you bring us one step closer to seeing you in prison.
1311463006862221313 2020-10-01 08:28:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @paulsperry_ @realDonaldTrump Do you actually by all that BS you put out? Trump supporters are some of the most gullible people on the planet.
1311462640057712640 2020-10-01 08:27:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOP @realDonaldTrump Dominant eh? He came across like an arrogant, rude, ignorant loudmouth to most Americans, even his supporters. And that is exactly what he is. Trump is our greatest ally.
1311461784205824000 2020-10-01 08:23:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @paulsperry_ @realDonaldTrump Your man Trump is so bad, so destructive and so incompetent, anyone with a pulse would look good. I’ll bet when it’s all said and done, Trump and his gutless enablers will will be despised in this country for decades.
1311460512094466054 2020-10-01 08:18:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GroverNorquist @realDonaldTrump Hey Grover. You are an idiot. Biden should ban fracking. You act like this is a bad thing that you can use to attack Biden. People like you are dinosaurs.
1311459204662808576 2020-10-01 08:13:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are hilarious Trump. You, the biggest liar on the planet are outraged over Comey’s statement. Do you see how ridiculous you look? You are an IDIOT Trump!
1311458452355592192 2020-10-01 08:10:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @CortesSteve Hey Cortes. Your hero Donald Trump already destroyed the economy by his cynical lack of response to the Coronavirus and you think Biden is going to destroy it? You have tough job. You have an loudmouthed idiot as President and you are struggling to get the fool re-elected.
1311441235522060289 2020-10-01 07:02:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well said Bruce.
1311441077862313984 2020-10-01 07:01:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @WajahatAli Actually I want to applaud that person. Many voters got to see the real Donald Trump for the first time.
1311440636101431298 2020-10-01 06:59:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well what do you know. This constant drumbeat of attacks on voting by mail and it looks like it was all inteaded to help Trump to win an election. I am shocked.
1311439857470840832 2020-10-01 06:56:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JillFilipovic I think this world would be much different if women were in charge. I think there would be fewer wars and more emphasis on families.
1311438855330058240 2020-10-01 06:52:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> This comment is great Mark.
1311438403762880512 2020-10-01 06:50:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> They are living in fear and keeping quiet to spare themselves from the wrath of Trump World. They are not only cowards, but traitors as well. They should not be holding political office VOTE THEM OUT!
1311431622923825154 2020-10-01 06:23:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Most Americans will not miss you Trump. It will be a great relief to many when we have an adult in the Oval Office instead of a 74 year old man child.
1311371098492198915 2020-10-01 02:23:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @NikkiHaley You mean Trump has done more harm to this country in 47 months, don’t you?
1311370350748463106 2020-10-01 02:20:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> Ecstatic
1311368641288568832 2020-10-01 02:13:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> Excellent commentary.
1311366983640920066 2020-10-01 02:07:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RobertGarciaLB I am very sorry to hear that Robert.
1311366796306452480 2020-10-01 02:06:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> Can’t wait.
1311366394110504961 2020-10-01 02:04:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You know nothing Trump. You don’t even know you are losing and will ultimately do prison time.
1311350700367110153 2020-10-01 01:02:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> Nothing at all. If Trump is at the next debate, I won’t be watching it.
1311350483785863169 2020-10-01 01:01:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @FPWellman After avoiding the Vietnam War using the paid off doctor and bone spur method, this President has no credibility on Hunter Biden.
1311349720917446656 2020-10-01 00:58:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> Another day in Trimp’s life, another lie.
1311349303995240453 2020-10-01 00:56:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @idrealist1 @tinachook1 You can’t. There is nothing that is going to reach those people. What we could be focusing on is the 100 million eligible voters that failed to vote in 2016.
1311348283235803139 2020-10-01 00:52:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> You summed it up perfectly
1311346417185837058 2020-10-01 00:45:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @IvankaTrump @WSJ What would no about that Princess? You haven’t worked a day in your life.
1311346196682813441 2020-10-01 00:44:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are a totally incompetent President so all you have left is politics based on fear. Hopefully most Americans will reject you based on your job performance and your constant lies.
1311344785660227585 2020-10-01 00:38:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I am so tired of listening to your big mouth Trump. Hopefully your time is short now.
1311344478448488449 2020-10-01 00:37:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOPChairwoman We deserve a President that can actually defend his term in office without insults or shouting his opponent down. Why don’t you start with something simple like that lady.
1311343623875764225 2020-10-01 00:34:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> Great idea!
1311308038020771842 2020-09-30 22:12:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> If the next debate is anything like this one, there is no point in watching it. It was not a debate. It was a complete waste of time
1311303932640137217 2020-09-30 21:56:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump’s supporters call all that lying “winning”. They could care less about what the is true or false
1311300681865846790 2020-09-30 21:43:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> I absolutely agree with that idea. There is no point in watching the debates unless they do something like that.
1311300218999181312 2020-09-30 21:41:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, what you and many of your supporters don’t realize is that shouting down your opponent in a debate is not winning anything. You didn’t win a battle of ideas with your arguments because you apparently don’t have any. You simply did not allow your opponent to share his ideas
1311295559999815680 2020-09-30 21:23:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @NazJaf4 @realDonaldTrump Personally, I like a President to be someone that does not behave like a lying, abusive loudmouth pig and that pretty much defines Trump.
1311294320859910148 2020-09-30 21:18:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @FloAmerican @sonuroral @realDonaldTrump Your guy is not and never will be Presidential material. He is literally a pig in shoes.
1311253524186005504 2020-09-30 18:36:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LawTrj @JC123124 @realDonaldTrump Absolutely true.
1311252695425187840 2020-09-30 18:32:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LawTrj @JC123124 @realDonaldTrump A moderator does nothing if the candidates don’t respect them and follow some kind of decorum. The entire debate was ridiculous.
1311252201885650944 2020-09-30 18:31:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JC123124 @realDonaldTrump I am not sure how any moderator would do a better job, unless they just walked away from the debate.
1311218682778050561 2020-09-30 16:17:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @FloAmerican @realDonaldTrump You love a loud mouthed fool that Connor keep is mouth shut and has killed 200,000 Americans with his incompetence. Way to go.
1311218316002947072 2020-09-30 16:16:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @techoncall888 @realDonaldTrump If Trump would have ever shut his mouth, he would have done that.
1311217749327319040 2020-09-30 16:14:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JC123124 @realDonaldTrump You looking up to Trump after watching him in what was supposed to be a debate tells me everything I need to know about what’s happened to this country. He’s got morons and idiots supporting him.
1311216992532168705 2020-09-30 16:11:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Van1llaGorilla @realDonaldTrump All Trump showed me is that your man is a pig in shoes, nothing there to admire or look up to. Actually, I knew that when I first heard him open that big mouth of his.
1311215779237556224 2020-09-30 16:06:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Yes Donald, 47 months of destroying life in this country, the economy, our institutions and our form of government. You are the worst example of a human being I have ever witnessed.
1311214758285193216 2020-09-30 16:02:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump showed us what a pathetic human being he really is.
1311214426834558976 2020-09-30 16:00:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls Yes, Trump did more damage to the country in 47 months than anyptherPresident in history.
1311115587792273408 2020-09-30 09:28:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Your man does yap constantly, like a dog.
1311081129634598912 2020-09-30 07:11:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @charliekirk11 Then you are as naive and gullible as the rest of Trump’s supporters.  https://t.co/Ue4GX7aiiW
1311078202631229442 2020-09-30 06:59:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump No one needs any of your incredibly gullible supporters at polling stations.
1310918045452455936 2020-09-29 20:23:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> Who could blame them. The man is a pathological liar
1310916632898875393 2020-09-29 20:17:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Show us your complete tax returns or shut the hell up Trump.
1310916033541214210 2020-09-29 20:15:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MollyJongFast I wonder why that is Rudy?
1310912084721496064 2020-09-29 19:59:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Strandjunker Maybe it will be investigated when Biden wins the election.
1310853144109293570 2020-09-29 16:05:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, the only defense for your entire failed first term in office is “fake news”. It’s an old worn out excuse.
1310852348521177088 2020-09-29 16:02:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump From a group of right wing supporters in Australia I might add. Means absolutely nothing to me Dobbs. They are probably buddies of yours
1310851120663859201 2020-09-29 15:57:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> I can tell that the Trump campaign is getting desperate. They are dragging the crazies out for a last ditch effort to save this Presidency. Who could forget a wacko like Bachman.
1310849779296088064 2020-09-29 15:51:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Does anyone know if this is real or staged? No one knows except for Project Veritas and their sole mission is to get Trump re-elected
1310848615615795205 2020-09-29 15:47:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump No matter how much you try to spin this President’s response to the pandemic, most people have realized that Trump totally and more important willfully blew it.
1310847864717930496 2020-09-29 15:44:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> Beautiful
1310847333093998593 2020-09-29 15:42:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr You die hard fanatical Trump apologists can talk all you want, but do Americans really want a serial liar and a conman who is deeply in debt to who knows who? That makes him compromised and ripe for exploitation by a hostile foreign adversary. The game is up.
1310712807546138624 2020-09-29 06:47:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @hannahcwiley @madrid_mike @lara_korte This QANON conspiracy theory is an example of the stupidity and gulliblility of a large portion of the America public. It is a growing threat to this country.
1310702874406662146 2020-09-29 06:08:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @frattwins @mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump Looking for an explanation for this revelation are you? I have an idea. Why don’t you ask Trump to release all his tax records and we can all get this mystery behind us. You and I both know why we will never see those records don’t we?
1310701335369715712 2020-09-29 06:02:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @danthemango @MeidasTouch @realDonaldTrump There is definitely something wrong with this guy.
1310700685630025730 2020-09-29 05:59:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @lucymcaldwell Nothing can get through to Trump’s most hard core supporters, but there are voters that are more open minded.
1310699912154296329 2020-09-29 05:56:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> I’ll bet Parscale has lots of stories to tell.
1310699457877508097 2020-09-29 05:54:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> They probably enjoy watching us fight over underfunded budgets.
1310698946210263041 2020-09-29 05:52:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> Absolutely. Any news organization  should routinely do this. Why wouldn’t they?
1310690197454163969 2020-09-29 05:17:49 +0800 <VenaAlan>  https://t.co/BgbJ70ZjUE.                                                Trump’s ads are lies. Fact check them before you take them at face value.
1310689679268868102 2020-09-29 05:15:45 +0800 <VenaAlan>  https://t.co/SQjbFHcdJW                                             Trump ads are lies. Verify these ads before accepting them at face value.
1310688083625607178 2020-09-29 05:09:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> Congressional Republicans don’t care.
1310687882252881926 2020-09-29 05:08:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is true. Any candidate for a Congressional or Presidential elected position should be required to release their taxes, no excuses. If we can’t get the information we need to judge these people, they should not be a candidate.
1310686699350093830 2020-09-29 05:03:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> And once again Senate Republicans are going to ignore what Americans want in their pursuit of political power and the ability to stack the Supreme Court for decades. They are hoping that you will forget about this and you will not vote them out.
1310684477597847554 2020-09-29 04:55:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @alextdaugherty There are a lot of questions about Parscale and large transfers of money from Trump’s re-election campaign to Trump’s family and Parscale himself. He did real good for himself since joining the campaign in 2016.
1310671480368308224 2020-09-29 04:03:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @StevenTDennis Sounds like it.
1310670844314648583 2020-09-29 04:00:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is our greatest ally in the effort to remove him from office.
1310670278536712197 2020-09-29 03:58:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> Absolutely. Remove the Republican politicians that want to destroy this 240 year old American institution.
1310665344449642501 2020-09-29 03:39:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> So we should be deporting Donald Trump and his family instead of illegal immigrants because they obey our laws and Trump does not. Makes sense to me.  https://t.co/DxNBQ7uJTq
1310647962935189510 2020-09-29 02:29:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> Gee, I wonder what country would like to get into a bidding war to buy a President.
1310607927313563648 2020-09-28 23:50:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> Yes, why is that?
1310607652284661760 2020-09-28 23:49:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are starting to sound desperate Trump. Release your tax returns and show everyone that you are a fine upstanding citizen with nothing to hide.
1310606731760861185 2020-09-28 23:46:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I would expect you to say that Trump. Why don’t you just release you tax returns today to clear your name?

This article, even if true, does not prove there is widespread fraud and is just support for Trump’s propaganda campaign to win the election
1310598492843368457 2020-09-28 23:13:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MaggiePeggy123 @JamesOKeefeIII @seanmdav @mirandadevine @nypost What scheme? Explain what that means.

1310368282797584385 2020-09-28 07:58:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Strandjunker Yes!
1310354085359620096 2020-09-28 07:02:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> Lindsey knew what Trump was early on, along with dozens of other Republican Senators, but something changed his mind. Could be that Trump has something on Graham that would cause the Senator to completely change his view of Trump overnight, or maybe he just loves his job too much

1310346624410046464 2020-09-28 06:32:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @B2theRyan @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump Are you concerned about any other subject other than the money you made and healthcare in the military?
1310346168325599232 2020-09-28 06:30:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @tylerhale00 @mato394 @realDonaldTrump I have listened to these excuses for Donald Trump by his supporters for years. The man is one of mankind's greatest con men, but his lack of character, principles, morals, values and integrity makes him the worst president in the history of the United States of America.
1310344773736239105 2020-09-28 06:25:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BIGDAVE21420668 @realDonaldTrump Well, you certainly are easily fooled.
1310344155244228610 2020-09-28 06:22:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Donald, your secrets are becoming public and people are going to be able to see what you really are. That must be terrifying to you, but you really do deserve everything you are going to get.
1310343376802385920 2020-09-28 06:19:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Donald, you sound like a leader that is so unappreciated by so many. Did it ever dawn on you that this may be because you are a pathological liar, a classic narcissist, a sociopath and you are destroying this country? Probably not.
1310329396025331714 2020-09-28 05:24:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @edwordxo @eaglefreak1951 @blondygirl1 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC I can vote in person, but if I had pre-existing conditions I could literally be taking my life in my hands doing that. You should not have to risk your life to vote. Besides, there are lots of people who don’t have cars in this country. Not everyone has the resources you and I do
1310328352759320577 2020-09-28 05:19:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @edwordxo @eaglefreak1951 @blondygirl1 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC We certainly can use COVIDas a reason for mail in voting. If you believe this virus is dangerous it makes perfect sense. You talk about absentee and mail in ballots. In Florida they are exactly the same thing. Only 5 states in the country send out ballots that are not requested.
1310326131367776258 2020-09-28 05:11:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @charliekirk11 @edwordxo You lie Charlie. 9 ballots which were not all for Trump were put in the wrong envelopes by the voters themselves and the election workers had to open them up. You and Trump are making a mountain out of a mole hill. I wonder why?
1310325197686345728 2020-09-28 05:07:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Shannonagain2 @realstuart45 @blondygirl1 @eaglefreak1951 @edwordxo @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC Wrong. Evidence shows that the virus does spread through airborne aerosols, though it may not be the primary way it spreads. Whatever your source is is spreading misinformation.              https://t.co/XZqAz3jVFZ
1310058542955716608 2020-09-27 11:27:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @IngrahamAngle I thought you were supposed to be a genius Laura. Where was it found in the Constitution in 2016?   You are pathetic.
1310057495415730177 2020-09-27 11:23:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls Kellyanne. Anyone ever tell you that you were an ugly evil lying bi**h? It’s no wonder your own daughter can’t stand you.
1310056855880773632 2020-09-27 11:21:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SenSasse @realDonaldTrump You and your fellow Republicans have singlehandedley caused open warfare in our political system in this country. You can be proud of your takeover of the power of government but it will come at a cost. There can be no more bipartisanship. We have become implacable enemies.
1310055125319323648 2020-09-27 11:14:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump You had better spin some outrageous lies to get your people to the polls lady. You people are some of the most cynical, evil dirtbags this country has ever produced.
1310054016777416704 2020-09-27 11:09:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SteveGuest You are a real piece of work Steve. First, you and your Party block Obama’s Supreme Court nominee 9 months before an election and now you are pushing a Trump nominee 38 days before an election and you think videos of outraged Dems is a defense of your hypocrisy? Your a joke.
1310051996318269440 2020-09-27 11:01:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SteveDaines @realDonaldTrump You are a fool Daines.
1310051748795609091 2020-09-27 11:00:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SenShelby @realDonaldTrump Yes and you are just another a Trump whore Shelby.
1310051574178340866 2020-09-27 11:00:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SenatorTimScott @realDonaldTrump You are an enabler of this nations greatest traitor. You and the other Senators who failed to confront this President will be judged harshly by history as you have done a great disservice to this country.
1310049710187700225 2020-09-27 10:52:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump How many jobs did you lose again Trump and now you are bragging about job creation? You did NOTHING in Syria except for pull our troops out and snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Putin has something on your traitorous ass Trump. You are a murderer as well. 200,000 dead.
1309988450398076928 2020-09-27 06:49:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LeadersMaster @realDonaldTrump I am voting for Biden.
1309987729804079107 2020-09-27 06:46:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow I wanted real change like most Bernie supporters, instead of the two party status quo. We were and still are facing catastrophic climate change and a widening wealth gap. Besides that, polls said Clinton was supposed to win. Sure, you can cuss me out if it makes you feel better.
1309986049259642880 2020-09-27 06:39:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @SusanSarandon I feel terrible about it. But I will say this. Why don’t we only allow two candidates to run for President, one from each party. That way we can perpetuate our two party system and continue the gridlock in Washington. I think this country desperately needs a third Party.
1309942915800731651 2020-09-27 03:48:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> I hope many of them include the 100 million eligible voters who could not bother to vote in 2016.
1309942260751110148 2020-09-27 03:45:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Funny, that’s not what the Republican Senate investigation into Russian influence on our elections said. They said it is a “Grave Security Threat”.
1309941394379808769 2020-09-27 03:42:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> Excellent suggestion. Trump would have no idea what to say next. Pass it on.
1309941107032313857 2020-09-27 03:41:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well that’s inconvenient isn’t it Amy? I think your ambition will trump your religion in this case, won’t it? You are a hypocrite like every other Republican on Capital Hill.
1309935228501348356 2020-09-27 03:17:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ddale8 @idrealist1 This is his plan. Call the election before the mail in votes are counted.
1309934671933865985 2020-09-27 03:15:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> A lot of Republicans are downplaying the idea that Trump will refuse to concede if he loses the election. Trump"s lawyer thinks they are wrong and so do I.
1309932712460013573 2020-09-27 03:07:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is why it is essential that the 100 million eligible voters who did not vote in 2016 commit to vote in this upcoming election.
1309932106735390724 2020-09-27 03:05:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> This sounds exactly like what is happening in this country. This is not just a coincidence.
1309930228656091137 2020-09-27 02:57:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> These politicians make me want to vomit.
1309929832361398275 2020-09-27 02:56:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @tedcruz It happened in 2016 when Republicans would not allow confirmation hearings for Obama's Supreme Court Justice nominee 9 months before the election. I didn't hear you state your argument then Cruz. All of this has shown how hypocritical and dirty Republicans really are.
1309928482214993922 2020-09-27 02:51:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> What a great video. I say Trump has something on Lindsey Graham.
1309927719640215552 2020-09-27 02:48:00 +0800 <VenaAlan>  https://t.co/ShEekxUz0o I have decided to vote in person even though I will get a mail in ballot. The theory is that Trump's voters will be counted first at the polling stations and Biden's mail in ballots will be counted later. Trump will declare victory on election day.
1309880019980820481 2020-09-26 23:38:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GeorgeTakei I did.
1309879399865614342 2020-09-26 23:35:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> I believe this person, if confirmed, will do everything Trump wants her to do.
1309878384131010560 2020-09-26 23:31:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate Didn’t it also say that the Trump campaign’s contacts with the Russians for help with the election was a grave threat to the United States? And you have decided to push this?
1309875761202032640 2020-09-26 23:21:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> I don’t think most Americans realize how serious this is.
1309874346878525441 2020-09-26 23:15:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> That is Trumpism at it’s worst. They would provoke a civil war to win an election.
1309873921068597248 2020-09-26 23:14:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> This video is so good I began feeling sorry for him, until I started laughing.
1309872812266582018 2020-09-26 23:09:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> Yes, the only persons that would touch this have agendas and will not be independent. Let’s stay focused and take the House, Senate and the Presidency. We will have options at that point.
1309872039944228866 2020-09-26 23:06:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Bill_Maxwell_ Sure do.
1309871911380430851 2020-09-26 23:06:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> If anyone wants to get an idea of the level of corruption in the Trump Administration, read this. Anything Trump touches dies.
1309870610219229184 2020-09-26 23:01:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Lou, are know you are not blind and stupid enough to believe the statement you made in your book. You have an agenda as does Fox News, which is the propaganda arm the Trump faction of the Republican Party. All you care about is political power, not the country.
1309831266557202432 2020-09-26 20:24:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> So basically she said that Trump was an encouragement to her, so she agreed to lie and mislead the American people on a daily basis. Where does Trump find all these people without a conscience or principles?
1309829831991975936 2020-09-26 20:19:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @SenDanSullivan @repdonyoung Let’s talk about the 200,000 Americans who have died because of you Trump. The rest of you so called accomplishments amount to nothing.
1309808055736045569 2020-09-26 18:52:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TeaPainUSA @LeadersMaster Hopefully this will be true, but I worry about Biden making his own gaffs. Trump will be going after Biden’s family and will try to get Biden to get angry and lose his cool. It’s like watching a boxing match, only with words.
1309801394392707072 2020-09-26 18:26:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You already have and I always knew you would. I wish your cult realized what you are Trump.
1309800705058840576 2020-09-26 18:23:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> Is this even legal? I have paid into that program for 50 years and he never asked me.
1309799639172907010 2020-09-26 18:19:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mmpadellan I think Trump is insane.
1309799308540207105 2020-09-26 18:17:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> Our government has become corrupt. Vote Trump and his traitorous allies out of office.
1309798599245664256 2020-09-26 18:14:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> Vote this monster out of office.
1309798045727457282 2020-09-26 18:12:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> Another bold face lie from Trump.
1309797665354461184 2020-09-26 18:11:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @grandmagrit I have heard that she never wanted to be a First Lady and she cried when Trump won the election
1309797184582361088 2020-09-26 18:09:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @davidmweissman I was a Republican until Bush’s second term and am trying to understand how your average Trump supporter can ignore most of what they see and hear and have this almost religious worship of Donald Trump. To me, the similarities to a cult are striking.
1309795438497869825 2020-09-26 18:02:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump surrounds himself with liars.
1309795239083888640 2020-09-26 18:01:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @thekjohnston @LeadersMaster Sometimes I think it’s because American news organizations are primary concerned with ratings.
1309794393440870400 2020-09-26 17:58:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> Donald Trump is actively causing the deaths of Americans, including his own supporters, with his lies and misinformation, for political power. Are you going to sit there and let him do it, or are you going to VOTE THEM OUT!
1309792339829944320 2020-09-26 17:50:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LeadersMaster @realDonaldTrump This President is the worst traitor in the history of the United States of America.                                             https://t.co/XGfitUaVRe
1309791834428846080 2020-09-26 17:48:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Your dear leader Trump is a traitor.         https://t.co/XGfitUaVRe
1309791411265568768 2020-09-26 17:46:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump The Republican Senate Investigation stated that you and campaign were actively trying to get Russian help in the 2026 election. That makes you a traitor Trump. Your supporters need to wake up.                                      https://t.co/XGfitUaVRe
1309682441356029953 2020-09-26 10:33:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ZackCz @realDonaldTrump I hope you are right, but Micheal Cohen says he won’t.
1309681916384346112 2020-09-26 10:31:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> How nice. We have some totally wacko politicians in this country.
1309681562242478080 2020-09-26 10:29:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Bradshaw2020 @kentaylorspeaks Thanks for calling out Trump’s unmitigated BS.
1309680973521526784 2020-09-26 10:27:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You probably don’t know this Trump, but Fox News had to admit in court that Tucker Carlton is not required to report news accurately. In other words he can report total BS. Kind of like you, Mr President.
1309679593541038083 2020-09-26 10:22:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> This article is very scary, but an important read. It’s good to know the kind of mayhem that may happen from November 3rd to January 20th.
1309663528916262912 2020-09-26 09:18:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> It brought tears to my eyes.
1309661301334069248 2020-09-26 09:09:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TheRickWilson It will give me great joy to see that man go down in flames. He and Trump are American traitors.
1309660327555076096 2020-09-26 09:05:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mmpadellan He’s my Governor I am ashamed to say. He is an arrogant hard core Trump junkie who will do whatever the President tells him to.
1309656925236350978 2020-09-26 08:51:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @kylegriffin1 What gets me is when his supporters parrot Trump’s defense which is he didn’t want to cause a panic. This is after Trump called Coronavirus was a Democratic hoax. How gullible can these people be?
1309655226136305664 2020-09-26 08:45:12 +0800 <VenaAlan>  https://t.co/iW9w38qIZx.                    The author states that Trump will be winning on Election Day due to in person voting, but may be losing in the days after as mail in votes are counted. He suggests if Democrats can vote in person safely, this could thwart Trump’s plans.
1309625975798456320 2020-09-26 06:48:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> Why don’t you just shut the hell up Meadows.
1309623523678314496 2020-09-26 06:39:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> Yes Lindsey, you and politicians like you are part of the problem. You might have been an honorable man in the beginning but became a corrupt hypocrite of the ruling class. You need kicked out of office in shame.
1309600848125865985 2020-09-26 05:09:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> I call on the 10 million eligible voters who did not vote in the 2016 election to register immediately and commit to vote in the upcoming Presidential Election. Not doing so could have tragic consequences for our country and you and your families.
1309598922550185986 2020-09-26 05:01:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @McAdooGordon @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/ffETDOAryw
1309597744726765568 2020-09-26 04:56:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump I think was explained. Intelligence agencies were concerned that Donald Trump was colluding with the Russian Government.                   https://t.co/PWmsYSRMQG
1309585194287091713 2020-09-26 04:06:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @davidgura Not surprised at all.
1309581828412583937 2020-09-26 03:53:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> That must have really hurt Iowa Slaughterhouse bad. Stocks are down.
1309581199199928322 2020-09-26 03:51:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> I would say that this confirms what we though all along. Trump is lying again to get re-elected. His supporters would not agree and would probably go off about the Deep State.
1309580657803358216 2020-09-26 03:48:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @madrid_mike Trump tries to act like he is tough and fails miserably. Biden does not need to “act” tough.
1309580166503464960 2020-09-26 03:46:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> Wise words from a wise man. Pretty much sums up America today.
1309571555303792641 2020-09-26 03:12:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> You are right Lindsey. We do hate your corrupt traitorous ass.
1309571018936193024 2020-09-26 03:10:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> VOTE! Your country needs you RIGHT NOW!
1309570108117979137 2020-09-26 03:06:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich I would say, never underestimate Trump. He has a very large base out there that believe every word he says without question. He could say the Deep State is destroying our Democracy by using a rigged election to get him out of the way. I could see them march on Washington.
1309522721848676352 2020-09-25 23:58:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> Will this make Trump’s supporters question their claims about widespread voter fraud? Hell no. If Trump says it it’s got to be true.
1309522067797299201 2020-09-25 23:56:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> It amazes me how Trump supporters think building an extremely expensive wall will solve the problems this country is facing now.
1309474840320016385 2020-09-25 20:48:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @NRA @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Hey Pierre, you POS, why don’t you explain the NRA taking millions from your members. You are a corrupt organization who traffic in fear and are part of the propaganda arm of the Republican Party.
1309473197063012352 2020-09-25 20:41:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump It’s clear you are a drug addict. Your daddy, and his allies in Congress have brought this on themselves with years of no holds barred, winner take all politics. And no, no one is coming to take your guns. It’s a dog whistle and fear mongering at it’s worst.
1309437560792453121 2020-09-25 18:20:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> This guy is definitely on something. Vote them out!
1309437040904278016 2020-09-25 18:18:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> I am hoping this is all true. The alternative is unthinkable. The scary thing about this election is that it shouldn’t even be close. It should be a landslide
1309327811518308353 2020-09-25 11:04:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JasonMillerinDC @realDonaldTrump Sounds like you have the unenviable job of making a sow’s ear into a silk purse. I think you will fail.
1309316450134482944 2020-09-25 10:19:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> They have good reason to hate your guts Lindsey. You are a corrupt political opportunist who loves the power of being a Senator, more than you love your own country.
1309315769398972416 2020-09-25 10:16:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> How do we vote these dirtbags into office?
1309314531575975936 2020-09-25 10:11:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RESachs You know what the worst thing about it is? His supporters will call him a hero and that he is the only President that ever helped them with the high cost of medical care.
1309296190383587328 2020-09-25 08:58:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I think you are lying through your teeth again Trump. You promised the same thing 4 years ago and where is it? Much like your taxes. You are simply a morally bankrupt conman. You make many promises you intentionally will never keep. You have repeatedly conned your supporters.
1309292974468202497 2020-09-25 08:45:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well Doctor, you can’t ally yourself with a meglamaniac like Trump and expect to come out clean.
1309292164359258112 2020-09-25 08:42:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> These Republicans are worried they may lose their political power, and are trying to reign this President in. Don’t be fooled, they are all complicit in this take over of our political system.They all most go.
1309290998044950530 2020-09-25 08:37:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> I am asking every eligible voter to register and vote in this election. Registration deadlines are looming in most states. You will be affected by this election, but you do have a voice if you choose to use it. One day, you may not.
1309282762793324547 2020-09-25 08:05:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> You are a monster Trump. A real life monster.
1309281881024802820 2020-09-25 08:01:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> I could tell from Trump’s body language that he did hear them. He can’t stop lying.
1309281399225094144 2020-09-25 07:59:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> Register tomorrow and VOTE THEM OUT!
1309280663833587712 2020-09-25 07:56:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> It was so satisfying to watch Trump listen to what so many Americans think of him. He doesn’t get out much.
1309280180448432128 2020-09-25 07:54:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> This has got to be the most corrupt Administration in United States history. For God’s sake, register and vote these people out of office!
1309278457965281286 2020-09-25 07:48:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> I love it. I want to thank all those Americans who took the time to tell Trump to his face what they thought of him. He needed to hear it badly.
1309277679150129154 2020-09-25 07:44:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ElizabethDrewOH One that puts their agenda over the country. Let’s hope none of them have that goal.
1309277268687179779 2020-09-25 07:43:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> I hope polls are accurate this time
1309276351191543808 2020-09-25 07:39:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> This would be a nightmare. Register RIGHT NOW and commit to VOTE November 3rd!
1309275592941068288 2020-09-25 07:36:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> As long as your corrupt lying ass is “killed” in this election, I am good with that Lindsey.
1309274816105664512 2020-09-25 07:33:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> Absolutely
1309274465256329217 2020-09-25 07:32:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> I do not have high hopes that critical thinking by the American Electorate will carry the day, but I am hoping it will.
1309273627469193216 2020-09-25 07:28:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> To me, this means men do not care if Trump is dishonest as President as long as they get what they want. I believe the character of a President is extraordinarily important to this country’s very survival as a Republic.
1309272342552629248 2020-09-25 07:23:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You have been making that promise your entire term in office. Who in their right mind would believe you are serious about it?
1309270801888223232 2020-09-25 07:17:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You have been promising a better replacement for Obamacare since you were a candidate, Trump. Where is it? You are a serial liar and only your incredibly gullible supporters would ever believe you have any intention of following through with that. It is a terrible thing to watch
1309244236668325895 2020-09-25 05:32:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LeadersMaster @realDonaldTrump After all you described, why in the hell is this election even close? It is difficult to understand.
1309200109482184705 2020-09-25 02:36:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AimIessFriend @JoyAnnReid It’s not hard to do when you compare them to Donald Trump.
1309199892481486851 2020-09-25 02:35:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @markspotsthex @WorkingActuary @JoyAnnReid You may be right. It’s happened before.
1309199374711492608 2020-09-25 02:33:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JoyAnnReid They will still be there with the same biases and lack of knowledge about our form of government. Trump didn’t win the election by himself. They will still be a threat to our Democracy.
1309126492488634376 2020-09-24 21:44:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ZekeJMiller No, he is doing a public service for people who can’t afford to pay their fines. Besides, I live in Florida and this is the second time the Republican Legislature has ignored the will of the voters. We voted for Amendment 4 which did not include ex felons having to pay fines.
1309119043148939264 2020-09-24 21:14:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @paulienz @BillW92204180 @jessie4324 @LindseyGrahamSC Never said I supported the Administration in Libya dumbass.
1309078141625868290 2020-09-24 18:32:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @paulienz @BillW92204180 @jessie4324 @LindseyGrahamSC I havent seen one piece of evidence from you to support that big mouth of yours. Typical. You spout a bunch of opinions and don’t have anything to back it up with.
1309055840083730434 2020-09-24 17:03:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @paulienz @BillW92204180 @jessie4324 @LindseyGrahamSC Is that right. And you know this how? The fact is you don’t.
1309044509393776641 2020-09-24 16:18:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @paulienz @BillW92204180 @jessie4324 @LindseyGrahamSC We would have never even had ISIS if it hadn’t been for Republican Neocons who you most likely supported.
1309043950058176512 2020-09-24 16:16:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @paulienz @BillW92204180 @jessie4324 @LindseyGrahamSC We are pulling out of Iraq now under Trump, because he blew up the Iranian general on Iraqi soil. I don’t hear you complaining about that. We should have never got involved in the Middle East so you have Bush to blame for that and it cost thousands of American lives.
1309042361482317825 2020-09-24 16:09:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @paulienz @BillW92204180 @jessie4324 @LindseyGrahamSC Did you happen to read the rest of the article. The American people wanted out of Iraq and so did The Iraqi people. That is reflected in the agreement they signed with the Inited States. Unless of course you don’t care what either one of those populations wanted.
1308915718130479105 2020-09-24 07:46:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @idrealist1 And as all this is happening 100 million eligible voters couldn’t be bothered to vote in 2016. I guess people have this assumption that democracy will take care of itself with not effort from it’s citizens.
1308904063455637504 2020-09-24 07:00:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> Funny that Republicans were not worried about the 9th Supreme Court Justice when the wouldn’t consider Obama’s pick for the Court in 2016. They are a lying power hungry pack of hypocrites.
1308902246890057728 2020-09-24 06:53:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> That was not his community Bondi. You are an idiot.
1308882131410718726 2020-09-24 05:33:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @madrid_mike Maybe they know how their own party thinks.
1308881056574173186 2020-09-24 05:28:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> I don’t put anything past Trump and his most ardent supporters in State Legislatures. If they do this, it will be the end of the idea of free and fair voting in the United States. Please register right now and commit to vote! Your country needs you at this moment in history.
1308868386806521857 2020-09-24 04:38:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @paulienz @BillW92204180 @jessie4324 @LindseyGrahamSC  https://t.co/U96e6KuCQF

1308839591420612608 2020-09-24 02:44:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @paulienz @BillW92204180 @jessie4324 @LindseyGrahamSC Prove your claims. I’m not taking your word for all that.
1308836378013241345 2020-09-24 02:31:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> 100 million Americans did not vote during the last election. If you never vote in any other election, vote in this one because you literally may never get another chance to change our political leadership again. Register right now and commit to vote in November 3rd. We need you.
1308833205978628098 2020-09-24 02:18:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BillW92204180 @paulienz @jessie4324 @LindseyGrahamSC In 1979 we impounded that money during the Iran Hostage crises and we could not legally keep that money after we agreed to the Nuclear Arms Deal. It was legally their money. Now you may have not liked the deal, but that is the answer to your question
1308822591235338240 2020-09-24 01:36:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> You have heard it before. This is the most important election. But the fact of the matter is that this election really is. You have very little time to register. Your country needs you right now because we could end up in an Autocratic Regime if you don’t. Commit to vote Nov. 3rd
1308821220369010688 2020-09-24 01:31:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well done Fauci, telling truth to power. You do not stand for pompous politicians putting out false information.
1308818111626317825 2020-09-24 01:18:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BillW92204180 @paulienz @jessie4324 @LindseyGrahamSC He will become an autocratic leader and you will support him as he destroys our Constitution.
1308817863243894784 2020-09-24 01:17:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BillW92204180 @paulienz @jessie4324 @LindseyGrahamSC I don’t know where you get your information, but it was Obama that had our military team up with the Kurds and beat back ISIS to small pockets in Syria. Trump@had nothing to do with it. Trump got in and pulled our troops out abandoning the Kurds an now ISIS has recovered.
1308816508102025223 2020-09-24 01:12:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BillW92204180 @paulienz @jessie4324 @LindseyGrahamSC You two are so easy. I agree with you about Cheney, but you think Trump is cleaning things up? He is making huge profits from his businesses as President with your tax dollars. He should have separated himself from them and showed us his tax returns but he would not do it. Why?
1308735792194387968 2020-09-23 19:51:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @2111015 @LeadersMaster It’s just a COVID transmission machine using people that lost the ability to respond to a national emergency.
1308735435196243969 2020-09-23 19:50:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @paulienz @BillW92204180 @jessie4324 @LindseyGrahamSC Looking in hindsight, no. Besides, it was George Bush that took us into Iraq and everything after that was trying to contain all the blowback from that decision.
1308721658849566720 2020-09-23 18:55:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> If Trump was worried about creating a panic when was playing the Coronavirus down, why is he now promoting it’s spread? Trump is a maniac.
1308715559228407808 2020-09-23 18:31:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump destroyed the economy. He ignored the pandemic and drive the economy into a ditch. Where does this trust come from?
1308696099343994880 2020-09-23 17:13:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BillW92204180 @paulienz @jessie4324 @LindseyGrahamSC Whatever. I wonder if there will ever come a day when Trump supporters will realize they made a terrible mistake with this President.
1308683193625833472 2020-09-23 16:22:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LeadersMaster @realDonaldTrump They will NEVER realize what they have done. They will go to their graves thinking he was a great man. There will never be  enough evil he can do to dissuade them from their faith in him. They have lost their ability to think objectively. They are never coming back.
1308681413269610497 2020-09-23 16:15:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is very obvious to many Americans. In fact Donald Trump is obvious to many Americans. Sure, we can blame Trump, but the real reason we are living through this nightmare is 40% of the American Electorate are the most gullible people on the planet.
1308678330456125440 2020-09-23 16:03:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump More damage to the country? I agree.
1308677715067916289 2020-09-23 16:00:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BillW92204180 @paulienz @jessie4324 @LindseyGrahamSC Talk is cheap. Time will tell.
1308553256629567489 2020-09-23 07:46:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @senatemajldr Well said and all true.
1308550898713612295 2020-09-23 07:37:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> If you can’t see the utter hypocrisy of these Republican leaders you had better look the word up in a dictionary. This party is not the loyal opposition, they are a group of partisan hacks pursuing their agenda with no integrity, shame or concern for this country.
1308549164872196102 2020-09-23 07:30:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @idrealist1 Yes, this whole Administration is insane. Giuliani claims he didn’t even know he was speaking with a Russian agent. Trump=chaos
1308526182971904003 2020-09-23 05:58:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> Of course they did. They will do anything lowlife thing for political power
1308525529725837312 2020-09-23 05:56:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AmicaAli I will send prayers, but I am proud of you.
1308524706073661440 2020-09-23 05:52:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> To all those Trump supporters that think Q is a top intelligence officer, we found his close associates living on a pig farm in Manilla, Philippines. What an ingenious cover.
1308519242510237703 2020-09-23 05:31:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> Kelly and everyone else in the country heard Trump say he played it down and they are going to create their own reality where Trump took decisive action and saved hundreds of thousands of lives. All I can say is there are a huge number of extremely gullible people in this country
1308517966837936128 2020-09-23 05:26:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Where do you find all these people without an ounce of integrity, willing to lie for you? We both know the Russians have something on you Trump.
1308517378041548800 2020-09-23 05:23:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @PlatoPox I don’t know you, but I am very sorry to hear of your loss. We tend to take life for granted to often.
1308515026484056064 2020-09-23 05:14:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @txquila1 @realDonaldTrump Yes I do.
1308473727751946245 2020-09-23 02:30:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> Young people. I hope you are registered and ate planning to vote in this election. This may be the last time you have anything to say about the kind of country you want to live in.
1308440109126123523 2020-09-23 00:16:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is an excellent read about how Americans are being manipulated. Something similar happened to me in 2016.
1308429519192297484 2020-09-22 23:34:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BillW92204180 @paulienz @jessie4324 @LindseyGrahamSC You must be a soothsayer, but since I don’t believe in that crap I would have to say you know nothing. If your prediction doesn’t come to pass, you will be the first one out there crying about a rigged election.
1308428837575942144 2020-09-22 23:31:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate It’s like Americans never saw a slimy worthless politician before.
1308427937008553984 2020-09-22 23:28:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> The Republicans have sold their soul to the Devil long ago.
1308427602521133057 2020-09-22 23:27:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump= chaos
1308421806294999049 2020-09-22 23:04:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump More fear mongering and BS Trump.
1308419883382837251 2020-09-22 22:56:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> In a recent survey, 39% of respondents said they had misused household cleaning products to kill the COVID-19 virus, including ingesting or drinking these products. That is approximately the percentage of hard core followers Trump has in the American Electorate. Let that sink in.
1308416737860354048 2020-09-22 22:43:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> We have this liar on tape saying how dangerous COVID is and now he is saying it “affects nobody”. How in the hell do his supporters explain this away?
1308414379260600321 2020-09-22 22:34:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @bamableu @idrealist1 You know why this country is falling apart? It’s because of people like these politicians, our so called “leaders”, who love money and power more than the country of their birth. They are all treasonous cowards and need to be voted out of office.
1308413305413931008 2020-09-22 22:30:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> Here are your Republican leaders before they sold their soul to Donald Trump. How did he turn these people? He turned them because even though they saw the threat Trump posed to the country, the loved their position of power more than the country. They are treasonous cowards.
1308332972295192581 2020-09-22 17:11:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LindseyGrahamSC Lindsey Graham. Corrupt, sold out coward.
1308332479334551553 2020-09-22 17:09:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @joncoopertweets @donwinslow @CDCgov @US_FDA Soon to be SCOTUS
1308317326450798592 2020-09-22 16:08:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump promised to balance the budget. I guess the Republican Party really is dead.
1308317055649800193 2020-09-22 16:07:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @benshapiro You may have just accomplished the very thing you oppose. Either way, this Republican hypocrisy has poisoned the well from now on and you may not like what comes next.
1308315934009032704 2020-09-22 16:03:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> If this is true, better tell your friends they get registered immediately, otherwise they cannot vote.
1308315084297437184 2020-09-22 15:59:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls I am sure you get great satisfaction with the Republicans ability to install Supreme Court Justices at will, but you had better not lose the Senate and the Presidency. Dems will demand stacking the Court which will lead to open warfare. I say so be it.
1308201680849244160 2020-09-22 08:29:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @idrealist1 Your goons better not try to stop me from voting. I take that shit real personal.
1308200233206243339 2020-09-22 08:23:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> That statement pretty well sums up the situation. All the Republicans respond to is political power. For God’s sake, wake up, register immediately and commit to VOTE THESE BASTARDS OUT!
1308199383423426563 2020-09-22 08:20:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow Absolutely. How in the hell are we going to be able to do that? His supporters are brain dead.
1308199166758318085 2020-09-22 08:19:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> I keep saying Donald Trump is a Russian asset. He has got to be.
1308198836796633088 2020-09-22 08:18:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump He is your personal whore Trump, so what do you expect? What is amazing is the dirtbag got in bed with you after you insulted his father. The man does not have a set of balls or any self respect.
1308198154496544768 2020-09-22 08:15:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @idrealist1 Yes, they were and are FOS now and then.
1308192277144141824 2020-09-22 07:51:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @paulienz @jessie4324 @LindseyGrahamSC I pay close attention and you are dead wrong. We will see how you accept the results of this years election. If Trump loses he will contest the results and you will support him. That would not be accepting the results of the election, would it?
1308191454095958016 2020-09-22 07:48:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JohnCornyn I don’t need to be incited Senator. You and your fellow Republican hypocrites in the Senate will have caused open warfare in our political system. You better not  lose the Senate and the Presidency. If that happens, the Dems stack the Supreme Court, you will be responsible.
1308188902193274880 2020-09-22 07:38:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JohnCornyn Senator Cronyn. That was a nice lesson in what the Constitution says about nominating SCOTUS judges. My question is this. Why did Mitch McConnell and Republicans like you refuse the allow conformation hearings on Merrick Garland 4 years ago? All of you are disgusting hypocrites
1308185697849946113 2020-09-22 07:25:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are a sick man Trump. You have no sense of shame or remorse of your behavior or the lies you tell. I read somewhere that your father was a miserable dirtbag as well and groomed you to be lunatic you are today. You are possibly one of the worst of humanity in history. How sad.
1308177312840667138 2020-09-22 06:52:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> I love this video. It accurately describes the situation in this country finds itself in.
1308176344480714752 2020-09-22 06:48:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> The man is a Russian asset and 40% of the electorate would vote for him after 4 years of chaos and corruption. Amazing.
1308175048696631306 2020-09-22 06:43:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> You have to wonder
1308174599096619010 2020-09-22 06:41:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOP @realDonaldTrump Coming from a pathological liar, I would have to conclude that the statement is untrue.
1308099939734437888 2020-09-22 01:45:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow Nothing at all.
1308098609792143361 2020-09-22 01:39:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @StanGott It is not a good long term solution, but it will is one of the few things Dems can do on the short term to stop Republicans.
1308097269108035588 2020-09-22 01:34:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @TomPerez @Yahoo Go as a group with pepper spray and clubs
1308094133429469185 2020-09-22 01:21:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> All I can say is that the 100 million of the Electorate that couldn’t be bothered to vote better register right now and vote in this election.
1308087764957700103 2020-09-22 00:56:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @kylegriffin1 He was making sure it didn’t affect his re-election campaign. That’s what narcissists do.
1308087154388668416 2020-09-22 00:54:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @paulienz @jessie4324 @LindseyGrahamSC You don’t know and I don’t know, but it’s too late now. You better hope you hold onto the Presidency and the Senate or you are going to pay dearly.
1308086177245913089 2020-09-22 00:50:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LindseyGrahamSC You had better hope you win this election and hang onto the Senate you arrogant prick. Paybacks are hell.
1308071175784931328 2020-09-21 23:50:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @madrid_mike Maybe we are worried about electing our first dictator in this country. Maybe the British should worry also.
1308070461117431810 2020-09-21 23:47:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> As a nation, we elect hypocrites, liars and narcissists. There will be consequences.
1308069435190767616 2020-09-21 23:43:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> They are a disgusting group to watch. No shame visible. They remind me of Donald Trump.
1308068876010369029 2020-09-21 23:41:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> That’s hogwash Cruz. You were not worried about it in 2016 where we had a close election, were you?
1308068471398334465 2020-09-21 23:40:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is a sick demented human being.
1308067890680168452 2020-09-21 23:37:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> Then why would they vote for him? Have they swallowed all that propaganda that Trump put out without question and they decided to vote for the devil they know? No candidate could be worse than Trump, no matter how hard they tried. Trump is a conman without a conscience.
1308066304558063617 2020-09-21 23:31:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump= chaos and death
1308065211887300608 2020-09-21 23:27:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> DeSantis is an arrogant political whore with ambitions to become a Senator on Trump’s coattails.
1308064402629853184 2020-09-21 23:23:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @morgfair He is just trying to win votes in the south.
1308063762583293955 2020-09-21 23:21:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> You have become Trump Lindsey. You have lost all credibility as a man and a Senator of the United States of America. You will say and do anything for political power. You disgust me.
1308062895486447616 2020-09-21 23:17:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LindseyGrahamSC You cannot escape from your words four years ago. You told the world about your stand on replacing a justice during an election year and here you are, trying to ignore your complete hypocrisy on the matter. You are a liar sir and place political power before your own reputation.
1307970727212089345 2020-09-21 17:11:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is a conman. Don’t be fooled. Register now and VOTE HIM OUT!

1307954800655466497 2020-09-21 16:08:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> #TrumpKillsPuertoRico
1307954023123779585 2020-09-21 16:05:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is a master at disinformation and lies as easily as he breaths. Don’t be fooled. Register and vote this man and is allies out of office,
1307826527862763520 2020-09-21 07:38:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> To the 100 million eligible voters that did not vote in 2016, I say this. You had better start getting involved in your country before you lose it.
1307825366585749505 2020-09-21 07:34:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow @FoxNews I will be sure not to watch. You make me ill Trump.
1307819119551680512 2020-09-21 07:09:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JoyceCarolOates @donwinslow Amazing, isn’t it. I will never be able to understand what people see in him after 4 years of chaos and unnecessary death.
1307816941906735105 2020-09-21 07:00:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mmpadellan Absolutely
1307816009949159425 2020-09-21 06:56:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC @GStephanopoulos This reminds me of Harry Reid when he used the “nuclear option”, when he eliminated the 60 vote rule on Executive Branch nominations. Seemed like the thing to do at the time, but came back to haunt the Democrats. Republicans may regret this decision when this causes open warfare.
1307814245116116993 2020-09-21 06:49:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @strivetopurpose @ABC @GStephanopoulos That may be true, but it’s too late for your position to be considered now. The damage has been done.
1307813489952595971 2020-09-21 06:46:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC @GStephanopoulos Cruz spent 5 minutes dancing around the problem. Senate Republicans can refuse to consider a Democratic SCOTUS in an election year, but Democrats cannot. It’s obviously hypocrisy and will lead to full scale political warfare if Biden wins the election.
1307804261443661826 2020-09-21 06:10:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @Yahoo I for one, want to see him again. In prison.
1307790027246665728 2020-09-21 05:13:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> The only people who would be surprised by this would be Trump’s supporters and they don’t care what Trump does. He could go down to 5th Ave and shoot somebody and he wouldn’t lose any votes.
1307789333739565059 2020-09-21 05:10:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> Just look at that fat pig pontificating on BLM. It’s enough to make you want to retch.
1307788893815799810 2020-09-21 05:09:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOPChairwoman The vast majority of Democratic voters know exactly what Trump is. A monster.
1307787704122437632 2020-09-21 05:04:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KenAndrews12 @GOPChairwoman Well she is in charge of things.
1307786714581270537 2020-09-21 05:00:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> How true.
1307786390126702592 2020-09-21 04:59:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> The love this picture.
1307785937846403074 2020-09-21 04:57:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DavidBegnaud The hurricane was three years ago and just before the election he is promising to send massive aid. Before that he just blew Puerto Rico off. Anyone that can’t see that Trump is a conman is blind.
1307784350243663874 2020-09-21 04:51:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @TomPerez I would like to see them try to stop me from voting.
1307782883508183040 2020-09-21 04:45:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls Hypocrisy is on the side of the Republicans also.
1307751112846585856 2020-09-21 02:38:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ABC We are in the same situation as were in 2016 Cruz. There is no difference except Republicans get to choose a Supreme Court Justice. You are a lying dirtbag. You had better hope Dems don’t flip the Senate or there will be hell to pay.
1307736442890747912 2020-09-21 01:40:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @davidmweissman I was a good Republican until Bush’s second term until my brother opened my eyes so I understand. As I listen to what Trump supporters are being told by this President and how they accept it all without question, I have a very difficult time understanding that.
1307715356715298819 2020-09-21 00:16:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @tedcruz Rubio in March 2016, "I don't think we should be moving forward on a nominee in the last year of this president's term. I would say that if it was a Republican president."               Cruz, you are a complete hypocrite.
1307712255312777216 2020-09-21 00:04:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> Wow Lindsey. We are going to find out how good of a two faced politician you really are. Can’t wait to hear it.
1307711715426041856 2020-09-21 00:02:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Don’t worry about it a Trump. I don’t think you were going to get an invitation anyway. I certainly wouldn’t want you around either.
1307711254375604225 2020-09-21 00:00:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TimMurtaugh Very scientific. Thanks
1307711070384140294 2020-09-20 23:59:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump equals chaos. He may be able to buy your vote, but you might not like what comes next.
1307710290017112065 2020-09-20 23:56:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @PiperNook2 @DrKarlynB @realDonaldTrump I sincerely don’t think you speak for everyone in the Republican Party.
1307709776474910720 2020-09-20 23:54:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> Our Founding Fathers feared men who loved power seducing the masses in our country. They feared what we are experiencing right now.
1307709168531496960 2020-09-20 23:52:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @carlettej1 It’s times like these when I realize I often take my wife for granted, assuming she will always be there. Thank you for the wake up call. I am very sorry about you losing your husband Carlette.
1307708216063807490 2020-09-20 23:48:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> It’s true.
1307707673102757888 2020-09-20 23:46:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> Get in touch with them, especially if they are your Senator.
1307669345288564736 2020-09-20 21:14:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Jim Cramer is a dirtbag, much like his hero, Donald Trump. They are both pigs along with a good portion of Trump’s supporters.
1307659428255203330 2020-09-20 20:34:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> I never had any confidence in Trump regarding anything positive. He has not proven me wrong.
1307657612662648833 2020-09-20 20:27:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> That may have something to do with you being in prison Trump. That will be a glorious day.
1307657319593979904 2020-09-20 20:26:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump All you do is lie Trump. Anyone that believes you is an easy mark, fooled by a conman. Trump, you do not have, and will never have, the qualities needed to lead this country. If you lose this election, all your secrets will be revealed and you will probably end up in prison.
1307655915827535872 2020-09-20 20:20:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump All you do is try to frighten people to vote for you because that is all you have to offer. That is a sure sign that you are weak. No one is coming for America’s guns. If anything, they will put some restrictions on assault rifles and strengthen background checks.

1307589274259390466 2020-09-20 15:55:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> I predict his supporters will reject this evidence of corruption out of hsnd. They always do.
1307588068556374017 2020-09-20 15:51:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> This tweet describes the reality of the situation in Washington DC for years. The Relublican Party is only interested in political domination and power. It’s not just a difference of opinion on the issues.
1307585520583802880 2020-09-20 15:40:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @EileenMarieSar1 @donwinslow Wow. I never thought about that. If true, we are dealing with ignorance in the American Electorate on a massive scale,which would explain the rise of Trumpism and his supporters consistently voting against their own best interests.
1307583842954498048 2020-09-20 15:34:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> I predict you will see Lindsey Graham tie himself in a knot to avoid facing his own words. He is the epitome of a slimy, worthless American politician.
1307495938894843905 2020-09-20 09:44:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> The gloves are off if we win this election.
1307495574351032320 2020-09-20 09:43:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @SenatorCollins None of them will, no matter what they said in 2016. No honor, no character no principles. Just an overwhelming desire to keep their cushy jobs. A truly disgusting group of human beings.
1307493638080008192 2020-09-20 09:35:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I will be so glad when you are rotting in a prison cell Trump.

1307452079028436993 2020-09-20 06:50:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well said and it sounds like it comes from experience.
1307451458376392704 2020-09-20 06:48:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> It’s always a political calculation for these politicians and not if it is the right thing to do. They must really love their jobs.

1307442150305652737 2020-09-20 06:11:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein Nah, nothing like that. I have a life and you just aren’t that important.
1307392558369320961 2020-09-20 02:54:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well America, it doesn’t look like it was conceived in a Chinese weapons lab.
1307379909912920065 2020-09-20 02:03:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is the Trump family. Sociopaths
1307379514650099712 2020-09-20 02:02:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> America. You don’t see a problem here? Trump and his Administration are out of control. Wake up@and VOTE THEM OUT!
1307375692896710657 2020-09-20 01:47:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jessie4324 @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Nice. I am sure they earned that money as they worked so hard for it.
1307373060887064577 2020-09-20 01:36:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein Yes, you think you are a genius, but in reality you are a partisan political zealot. I would not want to live in the world you would like to see. Tired of arguing with you. Vote for Trump. I don’t care. You are only one vote. Do what you please. Adios.
1307372079856128009 2020-09-20 01:32:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein Because they could stop Trump dummy. Happens all the time or haven't you noticed.
1307370996010229762 2020-09-20 01:28:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein I can tell that you have a high opinion of yourself, but I think your personal biases have made you an unreliable source for balanced discourse on politics. In other words you are a far right zealot. I believe you are wrong about most things and a Trump is your Great White hope.
1307369666466250756 2020-09-20 01:23:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein Ok, I give up. Where do you get the 120 million figure? You seem obsessed with it.
1307369327734161409 2020-09-20 01:21:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward Why didn’t they then. There were shortages everywhere. Where have you been?
1307369082619072521 2020-09-20 01:20:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein Unless the Commander in Chief is a Russian asset. Your President has been compromised. He has managed to keep us from looking at his tax returns so we will never know. Why is that?
1307368050585468931 2020-09-20 01:16:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein You are far right fringe. Where did you get this hatred of socialism and this adoration of capitalism? Either one taken to extremes is bad.
1307367616554717188 2020-09-20 01:15:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein They will be loyal to him. You are being very naive. You may be quite surprised and embarrassed if he wins another term. Then again, you may fit right in.
1307367188345630726 2020-09-20 01:13:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein You are an alarmist making predictions without evidence that you have no way of knowing will ever come to pass. Every election in this country, people like you scream about communism and socialism. I’ll bet you did the same thing when Obama was elected. The sky did not fall.
1307366111441231872 2020-09-20 01:09:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein Revisionist history. You don’t know that. You would probably have supported Americans starving to death while capitalism and the free market “corrected” itself. You have too much faith in a system based on man’s innate greed.
1307364446805921798 2020-09-20 01:02:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein Why do they consistently ignore it? Why do they show contempt for the idea of coequal branches of government and the checks and balances they provide? Don't tell me that Trump and his sycophants love the Constitution. They do not.
1307363472603316224 2020-09-20 00:58:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein He is stacking the Supreme Court with loyalists as we speak. I have no faith in the Supreme Court. Those oaths you mentioned are a joke. This President spoke them and it means nothing to him. He has contempt for the Constitution. Be careful what you wish for. You may get it.
1307362417786212352 2020-09-20 00:54:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein Trump has repeatedly mentioned being President for over two terms. Are you going to tell me he is joking? He is putting loyalists in charge of what used to be apolitical government institutions. The Republican Party is dead and all that is left is the worship of one imperfect man
1307360315957485569 2020-09-20 00:46:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein So FDR's polices are responsible for WW2? I have read a great deal of about that period of history and your conclusion never came up. Forgive me if I do not take your word for it. What I do remember was the excesses of capitalism was one of the causes of the Great Depression.
1307357702297878528 2020-09-20 00:35:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Tina89366765 @KelemenCari @tamarakeithNPR You and I know that Trump and the Republican leadership desperately wants to add another Supreme Court judge to SCOTUS, so much so that they will break every vow they made when they refused to consider Merrick Garland during the Obama Administration 8 months before the election.
1307356299466870786 2020-09-20 00:30:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward They also greatly feared a tyrant would rise up in this country without any character, principles, morals or values. Sounds a lot like the man you still support after watching this country in chaos for the past four years.
1307355386383605760 2020-09-20 00:26:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward You have to have a President that actually believed the country was experiencing a national emergency before these companies would begin producing masks. He didn't want to cause a panic, remember? How you could ever come to the conclusion that Trump is a great leader is beyond me
1307353935666204677 2020-09-20 00:20:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward Jesus was a Conservative? Not sure how you ever came up with that, but I guess I will never know because I would not buy your book. Also, I believe anyone that pays a modicum of attention to politics in this country could debate Trump and win. Have you ever heard him speak?
1307352141573566464 2020-09-20 00:13:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @StevenHailAus @JimboStanford At what cost? If you destroy the earth's natural systems, what will happen to all of those people that were pulled out of poverty by the vaunted Capitalists of this world? Everything comes with a set of costs and benefits. Wisdom is considering them both.
1307350481077964807 2020-09-20 00:06:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward One man's opinion, and you know what they say about opinions. Very simplistic, almost like you were educated by our President. Biden is a centrist, corporate Democrat and not much different than an establishment Republican. Trumpism is a road to authoritarianism.
1307334703448457216 2020-09-19 23:04:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KelemenCari @tamarakeithNPR It’s not in the man’s nature and this whole Administration was waiting like vultures for her passing. His staff would make sure he knew before speaking with reporters. Any Presidential staff would.
1307333721406791685 2020-09-19 23:00:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> I agree. They knew exactly what Ginsberg’s condition was.
1307333438945583110 2020-09-19 22:59:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @biotechusa2020 @AnnMcNeal11 @tamarakeithNPR Are you actually talking about Trump?
1307331407967137796 2020-09-19 22:51:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @GOP Your only obligation Trump is to yourself. Didn’t your dad teach you that? You do not have it in you to care about anyone else but yourself and you know it.
1307330941636022273 2020-09-19 22:49:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> Evidently
1307286478863695875 2020-09-19 19:52:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DevinCow Yes, absolutely. If you riot, loot and burn, you are literally destroying our form of government.
1307286172708868099 2020-09-19 19:51:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> I don’t believe this will bother Republican politicians or voters with no principles, morals or values. There are many who believe “Winning” is everything.
1307285181364137984 2020-09-19 19:47:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well put Robert. I expect to hear this argument from Republicans repeated often.
1307284560804294659 2020-09-19 19:45:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You used to love China. What changed Trump? You saw a political opportunity to deflect scrutiny of the monumental failures of your Presidency. I always knew you were a malevolent conman.
1307283857281089537 2020-09-19 19:42:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Blatantly buying votes right before the election. You could have done this long ago Trump, when they needed you, but you ignored and denigrated them. You are a pathetic human being.
1307282539149758467 2020-09-19 19:37:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> I think he knew exactly what he was doing. Register right now and vote this criminal enterprise out of office.
1307272004714868737 2020-09-19 18:55:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> I predict Lindsey will not have an ounce of integrity left and this is nothing new.
1307270260207357953 2020-09-19 18:48:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> Good point. This is important. I have supported Kelly from the beginning.
1307269898884861955 2020-09-19 18:46:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RobertMaguire_ I did vote for Jill Stein in 2016 and I have regretted it. Polls said Hillary would win. Was it wrong that vote for the candidate of your choice as opposed to an establishment candidate? Isn’t that what you do in a democracy?Then there is the 100 million people that did not vote.
1307267586753691648 2020-09-19 18:37:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> Share this fine example of our Republican elected leaders wisely. Nothing matters to them but “winning”. Our form of government is burning down before our eyes.
1307266599343329281 2020-09-19 18:33:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> Scott is another Florida conman that should have gone to prison for defrauding Medicare. He also conveniently forgot how McConnell would not bring Obama’s Supreme Court pick to the Senate floor 10 months before the election. The hypocrisy will not be a problem for this POS.
1307264824477454336 2020-09-19 18:26:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein Here is what I learned from my “mama”. Trump is a pathological liar. Trump is a narcissist that cannot feel empathy. Trump want’s total control and has his whole life. Trump does not have the character, integrity or values to be POTUS. Trump will be America’s first dictator.
1307260145941000192 2020-09-19 18:08:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> You vote in a Supreme Court nominee Lindsey and you have no integrity left. Actually you gave your independence up a long time ago. You are a great example of what is wrong with this nation’s leadership.
1307257961383952385 2020-09-19 17:59:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> Nothing surprises me from this future aurocrat. VOTE!
1307257279864090624 2020-09-19 17:56:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @EdMarkey @Bradshaw2020 I agree. This group of Republicans practice no holds barred, open warfare in government where the goal is complete domination. They have been the driver of this party since the days of Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich. One day you will not be able to oppose them. VOTE!
1307144000999219200 2020-09-19 10:26:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate Yes Lindsey. What do you have to say about the Supreme Court opening?
1307143565009661952 2020-09-19 10:24:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate @KatyTurNBC He looks like a “winner”. Other than that Republicans will have a friendly Court for decades.
1307142994584375297 2020-09-19 10:22:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich I predict that will not happen.
1307142792230178817 2020-09-19 10:21:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donnabrazile They won’t. Of that you can be sure. They don’t care how they get what they want, as long as they get it.
1307142448993402880 2020-09-19 10:20:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls You don’t fool me with your .condolences you witch. Republicans will fill the Supreme Court seat just before the election. Something they would not allow Obama to do 10 months before the 2016 election. Republicans view our political system as open warfare and the winner takes all
1307106252296683520 2020-09-19 07:56:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOP @realDonaldTrump It wasn’t long ago that you were putting Puerto Rican’s down Trump. Didn’t want to help them. What changed. An election perhaps? You are a fraud and a phony.
1307105356468887554 2020-09-19 07:52:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ChrisMegerian And all this time I thought that is how elections are supposed to work.
1307104718884417537 2020-09-19 07:50:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I thought you had called them “suckers”and “losers”. Now they are heroes? Is that what politicians with no integrity do?
1307100105099620353 2020-09-19 07:32:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well this is a first. Trump lied and his supporters love him for it.
1307099032016367617 2020-09-19 07:27:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You sound like a maniac Trump. A desperate one at that.
1307098699584212992 2020-09-19 07:26:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump We will see how many people believe a known pathological liar like yourself Trump. Personally I don’t believe anything that comes out of your mouth.
1307098226017828864 2020-09-19 07:24:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump The heard that you begged Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party for help in your Presidential election. Begged like a dog. Is that true Trump? I know you are in the pocket of Putin, but China too?
1307055698916921346 2020-09-19 04:35:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein I say that if you have a President with no respect for the Constitution and control the House and Senate, you can do anything you want. Get rid of any generals you think are a threat and you are good to go. Who is going to stop them?
1306995245956112385 2020-09-19 00:35:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I hate to have to bring this up, but since you are a dumbass, did Obama lose 200,000 Americans? Did they not write the pandemic playbook and set up a task force because Bush saw the danger to this country during his 2nd term? And you did nothing. You only cared about the election
1306953132224786432 2020-09-18 21:48:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein You may end up with what you say you do not want because you have lost all objectivity about this President
1306952818297917440 2020-09-18 21:46:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein Was FDR a socialist? Did the country fall apart during a World War? You and the President traffic in fear mongering when all we want is some balance in a capitalist society. None of the arguments you have made have swayed me from my belief that Trump is a fascist threat.
1306946868937621504 2020-09-18 21:23:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein He is the nightmare that kept them up at night. Alexander Hamilton described Trump and his supporters of perfectly.
1306946485880344576 2020-09-18 21:21:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein Bullshit.
1306945908114944000 2020-09-18 21:19:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump What’s pathetic is watching you spread the virus in real time as you talking about how you’ve done such a good job with it. Of course your supporters eat up anything that comes out of that big mouth of yours.
1306945491398254593 2020-09-18 21:17:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Not true Trump. You have been wrong about just about everything except for this statement. “I could go down on 5th Ave and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose any votes, ok”. Your supporters are easy marks aren’t they?
1306944708791488513 2020-09-18 21:14:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realstuart45 @eaglefreak1951 @edwordxo @blondygirl1 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC Actually. I believe you know that you are spreading lies as opposed to just being ignorant.
1306944354825764864 2020-09-18 21:13:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realstuart45 @eaglefreak1951 @edwordxo @blondygirl1 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC Sounds like you are a conspiracy theorist. I have looked the CDC numbers so you are going to have to do better than just making a statement. Gimme some proof.                                    USA 196,277 TOTAL DEATHS +1,224 Deaths since yesterday CDC | Updated: Sep 17 2020
1306906639619043329 2020-09-18 18:43:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You put the country in danger Trump
1306906496735817728 2020-09-18 18:42:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> I believe Barr will stop at nothing to ensure Trump stays in office.
1306906055897747457 2020-09-18 18:40:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump is a con man America.
1306902118457057280 2020-09-18 18:25:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> WHY? I think we all know the answer.
1306901868505956352 2020-09-18 18:24:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> It sounds like Barr is getting desperate. I want to see you sweat Barr.
1306901621381660672 2020-09-18 18:23:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> There is nothing else that could explain Trump’s foreign policy decisions as Predident.
1306900826271686658 2020-09-18 18:20:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> Donald Trump is a sick demented human being.
1306898706306945031 2020-09-18 18:11:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @senatemajldr You are corrupt little POS McConnell. You may have Kentucky fooled, but you can be made irrelevant.
1306897634968436738 2020-09-18 18:07:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> Compare
1306896713039384576 2020-09-18 18:03:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> I know many of you are just trying to survive, but your country needs you RIGHT NOW! Register immediately and VOTE THESE PEOPLE OUT!
1306895173876670464 2020-09-18 17:57:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is playing you America.
1306894523746996224 2020-09-18 17:55:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> Yes. This one astounds me.
1306893997156302853 2020-09-18 17:53:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump supporters believe this President is tough on China? Trump loved China until he needed a scapegoat to distract from his monumental failures
1306892743562723330 2020-09-18 17:48:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well what do you know. Trump loves China until he needs a scapegoat for his disastrous trade policies and COVID response. Trump’s supporters are so easy.
1306891115887501312 2020-09-18 17:41:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @eaglefreak1951 @edwordxo @blondygirl1 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC Gofer. We have estimates of 400,000 dead by the end of the year. Two simple things. Wear a mask and social distancing. If Americans would do that, we would most likely not be having draconian shutdowns. Why do people turn this into a civil rights issue? It’s a medical emergency.
1306768120758104065 2020-09-18 09:32:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @pwnallthethings @SallySellers54 Radical Socialism. Do you have a definition of that or are you just parroting Trump? There is nothing radical about Joe Biden. It’s just a meaningless word to trigger Trump supporters and it looked like it worked on you.
1306765987979685889 2020-09-18 09:24:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @tvural9 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Biden has a plan and you only have a narcissistic lunatic whose only “plan” is to get re-elected.
1306765277149962242 2020-09-18 09:21:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOP @realDonaldTrump Did you ever notice that Trump’s “answers” are really not answers, but rambling incoherent BS? He’s a con artist and you cannot believe a word he says anyway.
1306760455134892033 2020-09-18 09:02:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donmoyn Anyone who would believe this WH explanation is incredibly gullible.
1306759407674458118 2020-09-18 08:58:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is and never was concerned with panic in this country. All he is concerned with is getting re-elected.
1306758154022199296 2020-09-18 08:53:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOP I was a Republican years ago. I do not recognize the Republican Party of today. They don’t care about the debt anymore or following the Constitution. To me it looks like the Republican Party is dead.
1306755150011346946 2020-09-18 08:41:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> I am very sorry to hear this. Register right now and vote this Administration out of office!
1306754754190639104 2020-09-18 08:39:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well, I am not surprised. The guy is an arrogant POS just like his boss.
1306754400094949377 2020-09-18 08:38:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls That wasn’t all Donald Trump. Obama and Biden had to pull us out of a Republican recession, which you seem to have conveniently forgotten. Just like your boss, you lie through your teeth constantly.
1306753304559595520 2020-09-18 08:34:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are lying again. Biden is a corporate Democrat who supports Obamacare which is not socialized medicine. Of course your supporters never fact check anything and sadly believe every word you say, but in any case it’s a lie.
1306752191487717376 2020-09-18 08:29:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump That’s not what you top pandemic people are saying Trump. Of course, you are lying again, the same disgusting behavior you have done your entire life. It’s not all your fault though. Your dad was a horrible person and your supporters that put you in office are easy marks.
1306750870311370752 2020-09-18 08:24:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> Barr is no less corrupt than Donald J Trump
1306750423043395586 2020-09-18 08:22:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I don’t really care how you look at anything Trump. You are a lunatic
1306739174997975040 2020-09-18 07:37:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Hey Trump. I hate to break the bad news to you, but you are a delusional, sick puppy. I think you already know that. You do not have ANY of the qualities needed to be President of the United States. You are the world’s biggest loser.
1306729748186398720 2020-09-18 07:00:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Your just a classic conman, a pathological liar and a narcissist. Why would anyone vote for you as President?
1306725790650904582 2020-09-18 06:44:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well what do you know. Trump’s racists supporters killed police officers. I don’t want to hear Trump lie and tell us he supports law enforcement.
1306694005980360705 2020-09-18 04:38:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is a White House official who was there during the early days of Trump’s nonexistent pandemic response and is worth listening to.
1306692780778024960 2020-09-18 04:33:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> Why would anyone ever vote for this madman?
1306692200286302211 2020-09-18 04:31:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump The only madness we have is you Trump. Why did we not have major problems with our elections until you came along. We know what you are doing. You are a monster.
1306691462726377478 2020-09-18 04:28:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You lie Trump
1306685832821125120 2020-09-18 04:05:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DanLavorando @HubertLinssen1 @realDonaldTrump Yes, he fights anyone that doesn’t agree with him. I do not see him fighting for ordinary working Americans. I see him fighting for big business and himself.
1306685205097447426 2020-09-18 04:03:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @CherrieHomes @HubertLinssen1 @realDonaldTrump Well said. I agree completely. I read 100 million eligible voters did not even bother to vote in 2016z
1306682545648685061 2020-09-18 03:52:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Don’t believe one word Trump says. He is a Pathological liar.
1306682300567031808 2020-09-18 03:51:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls There has been no change. It’s just spin from Kellyanne Cruella de Vil.
1306680903301820416 2020-09-18 03:46:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein Alexander Hamilton described precisely how Trump and his supporters think and act. He knew a man like this was dangerous to this republic so long ago. You and people like you are blind to all of this.
1306652532245225475 2020-09-18 01:53:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein It may justly be suspected that his object is to throw things into confusion that he may ‘ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.’”  Alexander Hamilton
1306648698634539010 2020-09-18 01:38:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein when such a man is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity—to join in the cry of danger to liberty—to take every opportunity of embarrassing the General Government and bringing it under suspicion— to flatter and fall in with all the nonsense of the zealots of the day...
1306648408149684226 2020-09-18 01:37:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein “When a man unprincipled in private life desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper, possessed of considerable talents, having the ability of military habits—despotic in his ordinary demeanor—known to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty.
1306647887401582593 2020-09-18 01:35:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein BS. The man has contempt for any limits on his power. That’s obvious. He is the most dangerous president this country has ever faced.
1306646779136540672 2020-09-18 01:30:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein Did that just pop in your head that or do you have some evidence?
1306538111749545984 2020-09-17 18:18:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> Could be, or he wants the country to think everything is normal to help his re-election campaign. Either way the man is a sick and evil person
1306520138561318913 2020-09-17 17:07:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow If it’s not in the womb there is no crime.
1306519887532224512 2020-09-17 17:06:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> I thought Trump supporters viewed these people as “Patriots”.
1306517487736049664 2020-09-17 16:56:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> Barr has the same mindset as the madman in the White House. They both have a political agenda and there can be no opposition. If they get 4 more years, there will not be any independence in the Justice Department. Register now and VOTE THEM OUT!
1306503546507079681 2020-09-17 16:01:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein They did not conceive or want an all powerful President. In fact they feared that because they had just thrown off the yoke of a British King. And yet here you are supporting a President who is contemptuous of our Constitution and our coequal branches of government. Pathetic
1306498553636950016 2020-09-17 15:41:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> Of course she does. That is what liars do.
1306497937883770880 2020-09-17 15:39:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> I agree. All the signs are there, but they are in denial, thinking it could never happen in this country. There is nothing special about Americans that would not allow a dictator to rise up here.
1306497085685014529 2020-09-17 15:35:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are lying Trump. Again. You don’t give a damn about the environment or any living thing besides yourself. You will plunder and destroy Alaska’s wild places.
1306385254773649408 2020-09-17 08:11:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> This baffoon in a suit is not a President of the United States in the truest sense of the word. He is President of the Red States.
1306370032214122499 2020-09-17 07:11:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BrianKarem @donwinslow @realDonaldTrump Trump heard that reporter. It’s good to see these people standing up to his lies.
1306369331941572609 2020-09-17 07:08:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein You know what an extreme case of not being a socialist is? A Fascist like your dear leader in the White House. Does that make sense to you? You are an extremist. I don’t like extremists.
1306330448302428168 2020-09-17 04:33:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @56blackcat Never seen anything like it.
1306329673060802560 2020-09-17 04:30:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> Why would anyone vote for this lying moron?
1306329210009591808 2020-09-17 04:28:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> All I see is fools and idiots.
1306328512920518658 2020-09-17 04:26:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LouDobbs @gatewaypundit Fuck Trump. He is a sick individual  whose only claim to fame is the ability to con large numbers of people. He’s not a king and never will be.
1306327759334133761 2020-09-17 04:23:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> I am very proud of this journalist, who had the courage to speak truth to power to the Press Secretary for a man unfit for the Office of President of the United States.
1306326974584033280 2020-09-17 04:19:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, Cramer is man enough to admit he made a mistake and apologize for it. You on the other hand, are not a man, but a fat spoiled child, who feels that he has never done anything wrong and has never apologized to anyone. I have absolutely no respect for you whatsoever.
1306325488177217536 2020-09-17 04:14:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BillyBaldwin Trump is an idiot.
1306324546832793600 2020-09-17 04:10:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @PeaceonEarth666 @SassyKadiK @snw106 They have an agenda and they have been flexing their political muscle for many years. If they as a congregation gave contributions to any political party or candidate I believe they should immediately lose their tax exempt status. That comes with political risk because they vote.
1306276370075586560 2020-09-17 00:58:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Heartless? Do you know ridiculous that sounds coming from the world’s best known narcissist?
1306275384363753473 2020-09-17 00:54:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein No. I can see that you have no idea what you are dealing with concerning Donald J Trump. You and your fellow Trump supporters that can’t see anything but good in the man have been completely conned. Kind of like the Germans in WW2. It’s also incredibly naive and foolish.
1306228541281968131 2020-09-16 21:48:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @SMG8816 @ktumulty That’s how I see it.
1306228207654506497 2020-09-16 21:47:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DonnDlp @ktumulty Time will tell.
1306227937860030466 2020-09-16 21:46:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> The was waiting for one of Trump’s finest to endorse the idea of the first American dictator. There is no doubt in my mind that if Trumpers won control of the House and Senate, they would make this a reality. Register right now and VOTE THEM OUT!
1306226292254277634 2020-09-16 21:39:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @izzyzuni @ktumulty Nice.
1306207010619351040 2020-09-16 20:23:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @2020DoOver @ktumulty I would think you would be more concerned about Trump’s complete ignorance as President than if you can get Biden in the same position. People are dying due to Trump’s criminal incompetence.
1306205310244265991 2020-09-16 20:16:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @desmarais_kelly @ktumulty Either way, Trump’s mouth is the best thing we have to get this future autocrat out of office.
1306203881072996354 2020-09-16 20:10:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Acosta I read that any immunity you get lasts for 3 or 4 months. This virus may not even lead to herd immunity and how many people would have to die to get there?
1306201639766851584 2020-09-16 20:01:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @thor_benson @harrisonjaime Sounds good to me.
1306201522582286336 2020-09-16 20:01:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> Absolutely right. He will use any vaccine as a political weapon against his perceived enemies and his most rabid supporters would be thrilled with that.
1306200746107568130 2020-09-16 19:58:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> This President does not care how many Americans die during this pandemic. All he cares about is the country appearing normal. Most of his supporters support him on this philosophy. His incompetence and character flaws caused this situation. VOTE THEM OUT!
1306177978569818112 2020-09-16 18:27:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> This President is one of the most ignorant people I have ever known about and he is POTUS. Vote this madman out.
1306143333866242049 2020-09-16 16:10:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein You are really proud aren’t you? You know what they are doing right now? Looking at us and shaking their heads at a country that used to be a beacon of freedom, sliding toward being a Fascist State under our Dear Leader Donald Trump. They remember what happened to Germany.
1306142105656532992 2020-09-16 16:05:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JdRoyal10 @marklevinshow I’m not going anywhere. Got it?
1306141562657800192 2020-09-16 16:03:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JdRoyal10 @marklevinshow Empty words. You and Trump are sociopaths. You and people like you are why this country is in the mess it is in.
1306012322562035712 2020-09-16 07:29:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> This video is correct. Trump nation is a cult.
1306011239370366977 2020-09-16 07:25:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein We have three healthcare systems in this country. Medicare, employee based healthcare and no healthcare. That is why we are so inefficient with healthcare dollars. Do you understand?
1306007932371435520 2020-09-16 07:12:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> Because Trump is a dick.
1306001552545665024 2020-09-16 06:46:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein If we had universal healthcare we wouldn’t be paying four times as much. Japan pays 6% in administrative costs and we pay 26%. If you don’t care if Americans have healthcare there is no reason to even discuss anything with you. I do.
1306000640196448258 2020-09-16 06:43:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein I don’t know where you get your information, but my stepson lives over there and they pay more taxes, but they all have free healthcare. Most of them view what is happening over here in horror. Go rant and rave and think what you want. I don’t give a damn.
1305994563186765829 2020-09-16 06:19:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein Don’t give me a bunch of superfluous BS. Socialism is practiced in Europe, they seem to do fine and are happy, so all socialism is not necessarily bad. SS and Medicare could be considered socialism, along with various public services but I don’t hear anyone complaining about that
1305993367936000001 2020-09-16 06:14:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JdRoyal10 @marklevinshow Question. Do you give a rat’s ass about anyone else other than yourself and your rights?
1305921807518703617 2020-09-16 01:29:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> This guy is over the top. If there is violence this idiot should be held accountable
1305921307343826945 2020-09-16 01:27:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GOPChairwoman Do you realize how stupid you sound Ronna. Who is President again?
1305920240090525697 2020-09-16 01:23:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> If you do not see a pattern of interference with the election in this man, you are not paying attention.
1305918825473495047 2020-09-16 01:18:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ozyrobbie191 @onlytruthhere @realDonaldTrump How do you know all this? I don’t think you do.
1305917095130148866 2020-09-16 01:11:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate I would bet money Trump never read it.
1305905062699565063 2020-09-16 00:23:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @PierreDefecto6 @HKrassenstein That means you are willing to forego SS and Medicare. You ok with that?
1305903425113264130 2020-09-16 00:16:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @WalshFreedom I wish more Americans had the principles you have.
1305903020430028808 2020-09-16 00:15:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> I would say that 30-40% of the American electorate is ready for a dictatorship in this country. They have put all their faith in one imperfect man, like the Germans before WW2.
1305901173787029504 2020-09-16 00:07:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> This s a disgusting story about two sociopathic Trump allies.
1305899665305591808 2020-09-16 00:01:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> Ok Trump supporters. Does this guy speak for you and your President? I personally think that Trump claim the election was rigged if he loses, setting up a Constitutional crises.
1305897378315210753 2020-09-15 23:52:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @PierreDefecto6 @HKrassenstein As far as total spending of the US Government is concerned, Medicare and SS make up over half. If you look at discretionary spending defense is almost half of the total. Which one would you like to cut?
1305891502225338369 2020-09-15 23:29:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BaiamonteEdward @HKrassenstein You ever heard of Western Europe? Most of those counties practice Democratic Socialism and they are not starving or poor all their lives. How do you explain that? There are different forms of socialism, that’s how.
1305850482741645315 2020-09-15 20:46:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JdRoyal10 @marklevinshow Covid-19 and the flu are not the same. You can try to spin this anyway you want, but the fact of the matter is that you can save American lives if you follow simple guidelines like wearing a mask and social distancing. It’s not about your rights. You just don’t care.
1305848690981179394 2020-09-15 20:39:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> I would believe Cohen before I would believe anyone in the Trump Administration including the President
1305847779592417280 2020-09-15 20:35:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ProjectLincoln 5 days? I say Trump has something on you. You told exactly what Trump was during the last election, but now you sing his praises. What changed Lindsey?
1305794348886487040 2020-09-15 17:03:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Deedee31439664 @CAPBP1414 @Kenny_Sowellfan @Jim_Jordan @DC_Draino I guess you get your information from watching TV. The media will always show the riots over peaceful demonstrations because it helps their ratings. A small number of people riot, loot and burn. Large numbers of people peacefully protest.
1305792890216554497 2020-09-15 16:57:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @PierreDefecto6 @HKrassenstein It sounds like you parrot hard core Trump talking points and don’t know the definition of either Socialism or communism. SS and Medicare can be considered socialism so I am sure you would support getting rid of them. Communism definition. All property is owned by the State.
1305780118892285952 2020-09-15 16:06:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JdRoyal10 @marklevinshow You are right about the flu numbers, but those numbers are for a calendar year and COVID has killed 200,000 in 6 months. They are not the same.There are estimates that say we could be at 400,000 by the end of the year if people are stupid and don’t  social distance or wear a mask
1305778428688302080 2020-09-15 16:00:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jjjlaughter @Mom2320625846 @CAPBP1414 @Kenny_Sowellfan @Jim_Jordan @DC_Draino Nope. Not a troll. Just don’t like complete BS being spread around.
1305665533019336704 2020-09-15 08:31:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> I got off Facebook because it is a cesspool of lies, propaganda and criminal activity. Zuckerberg supports Trump.
1305664702765248514 2020-09-15 08:28:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @HKrassenstein I cannot understand it either, but could see the Cuban population in South Florida supporting Trump because they hate anything that is labeled as socialism.
1305664100513599488 2020-09-15 08:25:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> I thought everyone knew that Trump was smarter than all the scientists. He told us so.

I condemn the rioters and looters, but applaud the peaceful protestors.

1305637827724668929 2020-09-15 06:41:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @FredHarris_GC Did I say good cops are not heroes? No, so just stop your assumptions. There are out of control cops out there that must be removed. There has to be oversight over law enforcement in this country.
1305628387134799878 2020-09-15 06:03:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> Many people don’t think he is serious. I certainly do. One day it will be too late to stop him. Register and VOTE!
1305628050281893893 2020-09-15 06:02:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> What do people see in this fool?
1305627643082088449 2020-09-15 06:01:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is a walking, talking moron and other morons love him.
1305626996244983808 2020-09-15 05:58:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JdRoyal10 @marklevinshow Admit it. You don’t care about anyone but yourself. You are a sociopath. Let thousands die and get on with your life. Trump is a manifestation of Americans like you. You and people like you are the root problem in this country. Trump the narcissist is the result.
1305625854458896385 2020-09-15 05:53:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @marklevinshow It’s what you do in a pandemic when you don’t have a vaccine. What would you do? Let it run through the population killing who it will and hoping for the best? Sounds like a sociopathic Republican.
1305624890863751168 2020-09-15 05:50:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @EndExtremism87 @CBSPhilly No, I don’t think everyone knows what to do in a pandemic. There are a lot of stupid people in this country. Anti maskers are included in that group. They only care about themselves.
1305624252842901504 2020-09-15 05:47:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KJxthatxLEO @CBSPhilly Are you one of those people that are crying about your rights because health authorities want you to wear a mask. Are you a grown up who cares about other people, or are you a spoiled child that doesn’t give a damn about anyone else?
1305623102609645568 2020-09-15 05:42:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @StarUltranova @CBSPhilly What you have just said in so many words is that this country cannot take collective action in response to a national emergency. Let’s say we were at war. Could this country draft people for the military? America has lost the ability to respond to disasters. God help us.
1305621743718019073 2020-09-15 05:37:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @HylanderPaul @CBSPhilly There will always be people that don’t give a damn about other people. You are one of them. 200,000 Americans are dead and you say this virus is not a killer? Don’t even start about it being just like the flu, because it isn’t. Maybe you ought to wake up.
1305619557722324992 2020-09-15 05:28:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Kenny_Sowellfan @Jim_Jordan @DC_Draino Is it ok if they call peaceful protestors, protestors, because that is what most of them are and it’s protected by the Constitution.
1305272174706651136 2020-09-14 06:28:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is a very real possibility and it is dangerous to reject out of hand.
1305271630915043335 2020-09-14 06:26:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RBReich You can never be too cynical when talking about Trump.
1305267534938157056 2020-09-14 06:10:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is preparing to contest the election.
1305266767829315584 2020-09-14 06:07:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I am sure you believe that Trump, but the last four years of hell with you as President felt like 47 years.
1305240147106107399 2020-09-14 04:21:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> Idiots following a madman.
1305239265673179136 2020-09-14 04:17:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I would say most people don’t give a damn about Trump playing Village People. Hopefully you can find some issues that more important at this point in our country’s history.
1305237657203638276 2020-09-14 04:11:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump and his cronies are corrupt and are racists.
1305237297462423552 2020-09-14 04:09:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, you are leading this descent to the bottom in this country. You and your lack of ethics, values and principles. You also lack any good character traits which makes you unfit for the office of President.
1305229053151064064 2020-09-14 03:37:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JoyceWhiteVance I am so glad she is explained that to me, because I wouldn’t have thought of that. What l bold leadership.
1305228475498930176 2020-09-14 03:34:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> Yes. Trump did not get where he is by himself
1305214197274415116 2020-09-14 02:38:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @eaglefreak1951 @edwordxo @blondygirl1 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC What I see is you putting false information on Twitter and everyone retweets it without even fact checking and finally all go away believing it is fact. The fact is that the worst flu season in recent times had 60,000 deaths in a calendar year and COVID has caused 200,000 in 6 mo

1305125290730020865 2020-09-13 20:44:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Instead of trashing your opponent, why don’t you explain you nonexistent response to the pandemic and the Woodward tapes?
1305124424077762560 2020-09-13 20:41:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @davidmweissman Thank you David.
1305111598407745542 2020-09-13 19:50:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump hasn’t learned anything and does not have a plan. In short, there has been no unified response to this pandemic.
1305073333625655296 2020-09-13 17:18:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are the con job Trump and if you are not totally insane you know that is true. You are a man without a conscience and are not able to empathize with other humans.

It’s no wonder that most Trump supporters appear to be so totally uninformed. I can see why you voted for a conman. You are such easy marks.
1305055870749999104 2020-09-13 16:09:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @eaglefreak1951 @edwordxo @blondygirl1 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC I would have to ask you where you get your information? In the worst flu season on record, we lost 60,000 people in a full year. We have lost nearly 200,000 people since February during this novel coronavirus pandemic. I now expect the “Fake News” defense from you. Every time.
1304938463880531973 2020-09-13 08:22:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MarjanKg What do you want Biden to do. Go to war with Iran? You probably like Trump because he is hostile to the Iranian regime, but even this President is not going to invade that country. Donald Trump is a threat to this country and he has to go.
1304935143338061830 2020-09-13 08:09:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> I have been saying this for a long time. Wake up America! Register right now and VOTE THEM OUT!
1304933874674348034 2020-09-13 08:04:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> Of course he is. Barr and Trump ignore guidelines and precedents.
1304932921816608776 2020-09-13 08:00:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You are the major threat to our Democracy Trump and the greatest threat to this country in our history.
1304929932502544390 2020-09-13 07:48:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jessie4324 @realDonaldTrump The Tea Party hated Obama, then it morphed into Trumpism
1304895794814881792 2020-09-13 05:32:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Eiggam5955 That’s what I have been saying. They are not going away and a large portion of them are unreachable with facts and logic.
1304894760012972032 2020-09-13 05:28:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @joncoopertweets Very sad.
1304894387902701568 2020-09-13 05:27:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> This President’s political appointees are corrupting institutions that should be apolitical. Everything Trump touches dies.
1304892892767543296 2020-09-13 05:21:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> That’s called Trump logic.
1304855252995375104 2020-09-13 02:51:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow The election is going to be a mess.
1304854061401935878 2020-09-13 02:47:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> Sudan Collins is a Trump supporting Republican, nothing more. She has lost her independence.
1304853235287691267 2020-09-13 02:43:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ThePubliusUSA I am constantly asking the same question and it’s an important one to answer. The repeal of the Fairness Doctrine and the rise of Fox News, the worship of wealth and fame, Citizens United, the idea that politicians in Washington didn’t care about the struggles of rural America?
1304849662449418240 2020-09-13 02:29:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> It’s hard to believe isn’t it? I believe if Trump moved to became America’s first dictator, 40% of the country would support him.
1304847892478332928 2020-09-13 02:22:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> Worse than worthless.
1304847664400523264 2020-09-13 02:21:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump If you ever become America’s Dear Leader, you can make him give it back. I think you will have another stroke before that a Trump. Does that scare you?
1304846985590173699 2020-09-13 02:18:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trumpism is not anything like Reaganism. Trumpism will ultimately lead to an autocratic United States government. If you don’t like that idea, register right now and VOTE THEM OUT!
1304844749648670720 2020-09-13 02:10:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @idrealist1 His supporters didn’t say a word about it did they.
1304844463039229958 2020-09-13 02:08:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Here the king of lies and corruption is crying about Mueller and Clinton again. For a guy who tries to act tough you sure do whine a lot. You are truly a pathetic human being. I know what you want Trump. Total power.
1304808583008342016 2020-09-12 23:46:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @maureenfox I don’t mind Independants, in fact I wish more politicians were that way. Collins lost me when she gave Trump a pass after the impeachment trial. She succumbed to pressure from the Republicans and Trump is getting more out of control by the day.
1304806588067254279 2020-09-12 23:38:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jessie4324 @realDonaldTrump Tear their miserable asses up Paul. These people can’t stand truth. You are doing a great job. I love it
1304795186782973952 2020-09-12 22:53:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> Susan Collins might as well not even be in the Senate. She tries to play it both ways, but she just looks useless. As a Republican she just can’t stand up to Trump’s excesses.
1304793691853410304 2020-09-12 22:47:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> Any of you Trump supporters planning on relying on SS and Medicare in retirement? Let me answer that for you. YES, but go ahead and support a President and Party that wants to get rid of something you have paid into all your life. That makes sense doesn’t it?
1304790891878637569 2020-09-12 22:36:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You have been doing that for 4 years Trump. You are pathetic.
1304790677084045313 2020-09-12 22:35:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> Ambassador, with all do respect, was Bahrain and Israel ever at war? No. So how is it that you describe this as a “Peace Deal”? It’s simply a normalization of relations between the two countries.
1304789315663396864 2020-09-12 22:29:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> Damn right. I would like these WH reporters to stand up to Trump and support one another.
1304788450294534144 2020-09-12 22:26:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> Many of our politicians view themselves as the elite of society, better than working class Americans. They will lie cheat and steal to keep their well paying, cushy jobs. Kick them out. VOTE!
1304757293926486016 2020-09-12 20:22:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> This would be awesome!
1304757127953756160 2020-09-12 20:21:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> Then this POS has to go. Please contribute to Any McGrath!
1304756435595730944 2020-09-12 20:19:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> I’ll give him this much. He’s able to screw Trump’s supporters and they are still cheering him on.
1304755607363346432 2020-09-12 20:15:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> Any of you Trump supporters aware of this BS?
1304755401200742400 2020-09-12 20:15:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> This just about says it all.
1304733666854293504 2020-09-12 18:48:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> All that comes from this Administration is propaganda and lies. It’s a crimsoned enterprise at the highest levels of our government
1304732433640759296 2020-09-12 18:43:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, if you had a lick of sense you would realize that this was not a “Peace Deal”. The two countries have never fought a war you idiot. Bahrain never recognized Israel, So all this was, was a normalization of of relations between the two countries.
1304730977856565254 2020-09-12 18:38:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> Damn right. The system is broken, but part of the problem is an uninformed and unengaged electorate in this country. Half of them, over 100 million people could not be bothered to vote.
1304726282316533760 2020-09-12 18:19:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> Why?
1304717958388895749 2020-09-12 17:46:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is a very big deal. This whole Administration is an unmitigated disaster, compliments of the gullible, low information 40% of the American Electorate.
1304713588175708161 2020-09-12 17:28:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @NewYorker After the COVID lockdown where many if not most Floridians were not working, the unemployment system created by then Governor Rick Scott completely broke down and many were not getting paid. Talk about some angry people. Most blame Governor DeSantis, aka the “Trump whore”.
1304710021104709632 2020-09-12 17:14:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> We have a criminal enterprise in the WH operating under Donald Trump that will violate the Constitution, precedents, and norms to further their political goals. Register now and VOTE THEM OUT!
1304604224278409223 2020-09-12 10:14:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> The Dem in Congress will be ignored. If you want action you must VOTE THEM OUT!
1304602572880314368 2020-09-12 10:07:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> VOTE
1304541499363930114 2020-09-12 06:05:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> Good for Bret. Trump surrounds himself with liars.
1304540787338866688 2020-09-12 06:02:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TomMWhittemore @AprilDRyan That makes sense, but if you see a half million people not wearing masks in a pandemic, there will be a large increase in cases.
1304540382169104384 2020-09-12 06:00:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Haley72512248 @AprilDRyan Go ahead and wonder, but you don’t have to wonder about this group of morons.
1304540121384062977 2020-09-12 05:59:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is a great example of what is wrong with this country. Trump is a very serious problem but most of these idiots put him in the White House. They make up the Moron Party.
1304538778162397184 2020-09-12 05:54:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @madrid_mike You are do full of shit Trump.
1304538392106074125 2020-09-12 05:52:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> Sounds like something an Autocrat would do.
1304531147767115776 2020-09-12 05:23:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> Her first promise not to lie was her first lie of many.
1304530501324156932 2020-09-12 05:21:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> Of course you did Trump. Everyone already knows you protected a cold blooded murderer.
1304530086520139782 2020-09-12 05:19:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> She got a pass and didn’t have to learn it.
1304529779488690183 2020-09-12 05:18:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @sfpelosi We are under a different set of rules than Trumpland.
1304529453155061760 2020-09-12 05:17:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> I’m all for the House investigations, but the only way we are going to stop Trump from trampling the Constitution is to VOTE THEM OUT! Register right now and commit to vote in November.
1304528604068540425 2020-09-12 05:13:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jheil @JoeNBC The could say Trump is a POS and his whole family is on some sort of drugs. That’s what I hear.
1304504637618360323 2020-09-12 03:38:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @terrihammer2728 You could have million followers and still spread bullshit. A good example is this sorry excuse for a President you like so much. All of you are a bunch of extremely gullible marks putting all your faith in a conman.
1304491197340282880 2020-09-12 02:45:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls If you don’t fix the Palestinian problem you haven’t done anything useful. You are a dumbass, Trump.
1304480167507701761 2020-09-12 02:01:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> A madman divorced from reality in the White House. Vote that incompetent bastard out of office!

1304454203428012032 2020-09-12 00:18:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @bryanbehar We still have a lot of racists in this country. I’m surprised none of the players flicked that crowd off. Those guys had a lot of self discipline.
1304453700791029760 2020-09-12 00:16:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> I know you Trump supporters are in some serious denial, but do you really want Russian government spy’s working with the White House? If you think Russia is our friend, your living in a fantasy world.
1304413446109364226 2020-09-11 21:36:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> The suggest everyone carefully sign your mail in ballot including myself.
1304412965509181448 2020-09-11 21:34:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump out and out lies constantly. He exaggerates, deflects and misleads. He is a conman and always has been.
1304411211988115457 2020-09-11 21:27:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump There was a time that you loved Fox News. What happened Trump? Did they start actually reporting the news instead of being your own personal propaganda ministry? You are pathetic.
1304410340508217345 2020-09-11 21:23:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> Every member of the WH press pool should be doing that and supporting those who do. Getting the story and ratings should not be your only priority. You are a member of the Free Press if this country and should act accordingly.
1304408976046592000 2020-09-11 21:18:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> Thank God for the Republican led Senate, doing vital important work in the middle of a crisis where the President is lying to the American people. Good work McConnell.
1304398119564718082 2020-09-11 20:35:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> And here I thought Trump was going to eliminate the deficit. Promises made, promises broken.  https://t.co/Q89raxtl9u
1304397006840922114 2020-09-11 20:30:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ColinHanks It shows me that a lot of sports fans are Trump supporters and racists
1304392806782447624 2020-09-11 20:14:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> @HildyJohnson305 @JaredMichael28 @WalshFreedom I don’t believe we would have had mass panic if Trump was a leader instead of a narcissist.
1304388019714248705 2020-09-11 19:55:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JaredMichael28 @mikeaomari @JohncleJohn @WalshFreedom You are also good with not giving a shit about 200,000 dead Americans. 30% of the American Electorate are sociopaths so I wouldn’t want you to think you are the only one.
1304387311891812352 2020-09-11 19:52:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mikeaomari @JohncleJohn @JaredMichael28 @WalshFreedom Don’t see any intelligence from either one of you. Putting all your faith in one imperfect man without thinking for yourself makes you look both like blind idiots.
1304383580341178368 2020-09-11 19:37:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JaredMichael28 @Gray808 @WalshFreedom Don’t make excuses for this President. The last two Administrations had a pandemic playbook to follow and since Trump is always the smartest guy in the room, he ignored it because he wanted to be re-elected. Start thinking for once.
1304382519362584581 2020-09-11 19:33:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JaredMichael28 @thecinnaMANbun @WalshFreedom There are times when a nation of people faces a dangerous threat and they have to react like the adults. Are you an adult, or would you run around like Chicken Little? Any leader could have laid the threat out to us and how we should face it, but not Trump. He wanted re-elected.
1304380678016991232 2020-09-11 19:26:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> Mr Walsh. We may disagree on policy, but I appreciate and respect your courage, honesty and integrity. How did 40% of the electorate get to this point?
1304379456044371972 2020-09-11 19:21:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> Even after the Woodward tapes, Trump and his supporters act like this virus is not dangerous. 200,000 dead and nothing has changed. We are dealing with a corrupt leader and his brainless followers. VOTE THEM OUT!
1304365910128500737 2020-09-11 18:27:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @MittRomney You do not have the temperament or the intelligence to be President of the United States. You are the Founding Fathers worst nightmare.
1304365483295211522 2020-09-11 18:25:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> Is Trump panicking anyone about a Democratic win in November? I thought he tried to avoid panic?
1304364923095572481 2020-09-11 18:23:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Many of us know what you are Trump. You deserve all the hate.
1304362903219384320 2020-09-11 18:15:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @SarahHuckabee This is you Trump. “When a man unprincipled in private life desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper, possessed of considerable talents, having the ability of military habits—despotic in his ordinary demeanor—known to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty”
1304361196804599808 2020-09-11 18:08:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> We have an incompetent madman  who is a Russian asset in the White House. It can’t get any worse than that. REGISTER NOW and VOTE THEM OUT!

1304359118090768384 2020-09-11 18:00:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @RichHudson This is you Trump. “to flatter and fall in with all the nonsense of the zealots of the day—It may justly be suspected that his object is to throw things into confusion that he may ‘ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.’” Alexander Hamilton
1304357540508000256 2020-09-11 17:54:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump This is you Trump.  “When  such a man is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity—to join in the cry of danger to liberty—to take every opportunity of embarrassing the General Government and bringing it under suspicion—“

1304346357403131905 2020-09-11 17:09:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump’s supporters are unreachable. It’s up to the 100 million Americans who did not vote in the last Presidential election to REGISTER right now and commit to VOTE in the November election to avoid America’s first dictatorship. Will you step up and save this country?
1304345045827452928 2020-09-11 17:04:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> All Trump cares about is winning this election no matter how many people he hurts. His supporters are so invested in him that no facts, scandals or outrageous claims or behavior would ever change their belief in him. They are unreachable.
1304342882246168577 2020-09-11 16:55:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Anyone that would believe your lying, incompetent ass Trump, is a complete idiot.
1304342508537868293 2020-09-11 16:54:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls @JoeBiden He would have followed the pandemic playbook left by the two previous Administrations that he helped create you idiot.  https://t.co/qGUG8wFeIp
1304338740685475840 2020-09-11 16:39:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You and your Republican allies goal is to eliminate SS and Medicare, and your supporters will blindly support you as you destroy something they have worked for their entire lives. It’s an amazing spectacle to watch.
1304218144479809536 2020-09-11 08:40:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> What Trump showed is that he is a heartless mentally ill monster.
1304216582110040065 2020-09-11 08:33:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AprilDRyan @SallySellers54 @realDonaldTrump I’m shocked that his supporters still defend him. Nothing he could ever do no matter how evil would bother them. I should have known.
1304216041816551425 2020-09-11 08:31:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Remember when you said that you could go down to 5th Ave and shoot somebody and you wouldn’t lose any votes. Does that hold true of you kill hundreds of thousands as well?
1304215334275219457 2020-09-11 08:29:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Anyone with a lick of sense would ignore you Trump.
1304215033501675522 2020-09-11 08:27:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow That group of journalists should turn on you like a pack of wild dogs, Trump.
1304214827963949057 2020-09-11 08:27:00 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump To hear are more of your lies? No thanks.
1304214612087312388 2020-09-11 08:26:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @davidwebbshow @KellyannePolls And you only get to vote for an authoritarian dictator once and he’s with you forever.
1304214365055393793 2020-09-11 08:25:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Jim_Jordan I think you are well aware that this President is not fighting for us. He is fighting for himself. You and your fellow Trump traitors know what he is, but your political fortunes are tied to a mentally ill narcissist. You and people like you are the end of the American experiment
1304203242394521601 2020-09-11 07:40:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @rigdont @NumbersMuncher No, I want people in charge with some common sense. I shouldn’t have to ask you to wear a mask, because you should wear one to keep the virus from spreading. That’s what we have done for over 100 years in a pandemic. Don’t cry to me like a baby about your rights either.
1304169187926044672 2020-09-11 05:25:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @rigdont @NumbersMuncher What efforts? What planet are you living on? Did Trump tell you he did a great job and no one could have done it better? PS. Trump lies
1304168272540119041 2020-09-11 05:22:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @rigdont @NumbersMuncher His response was a disaster and he could have mandated masks and social distancing nationwide. He also could have used the Defense Authorization Act to produce the PPE so many people needed, but he didn’t. He could have followed the pandemic playbook left by Bush and Obama.
1304159446541664256 2020-09-11 04:46:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump supporters like to claim that the idea of Russian interference is a hoax. It’s not.
1304152836524081152 2020-09-11 04:20:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @x22steve8224 @WalshFreedom I hope you are right, but Trump’s 30-40% of the Electorate is not just going to go away even if Biden wins this election. They will always try to take us back to the nightmare we are living in now.
1304150889918328832 2020-09-11 04:12:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is everything our Founding Fathers has nightmares about
1304150253315264516 2020-09-11 04:10:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> Since Trump loves to be flattered and praised, Kim Jong Un was wise in his negotiations with the US. Trump is a preening baffoon.
1304147438148747265 2020-09-11 03:59:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> This White House Press pool should ask him more terrible questions and don’t let him off the hook until they rip the truth out of him.
1304146965933043712 2020-09-11 03:57:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MommaKat @ttguitar @DoYouEvenLif I feel that if Donald Trump wins this election, he will become President for Life and there will be no more free and fair elections. I don’t feel that way about Biden.
1304120250804383747 2020-09-11 02:11:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> @rederic1989 @BKSRacer930 @JoyAnnReid It’s not hard to figure Trump out is it?
1304116219231039490 2020-09-11 01:55:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BKSRacer930 @JoyAnnReid This is not one of those things.
1304110651128909825 2020-09-11 01:33:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @matthewjdowd @svdate @ktumulty I hope you are right about this, but when I interact with Trump supporters on social media, there is nothing this President has ever done that bothers them in the least.
1304109707611828226 2020-09-11 01:29:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> You would think this would be true.
1304108367418404865 2020-09-11 01:23:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> Here is another viewpoint of Donald Trump from someone that worked for him.
1304108098794262539 2020-09-11 01:22:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> So much for the Russian Hoax narrative.
1304105144058023936 2020-09-11 01:11:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> This Administration is totally corrupt and a threat to this country.
1304081309401317378 2020-09-10 23:36:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RonCCole @JoyAnnReid You would think, but this outrage will not bother them a bit. Most of them could care less about the loss of 200,000 American lives.
1304079583759814657 2020-09-10 23:29:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BKSRacer930 @JoyAnnReid Let’s put it this way.  If Dr Fauci was President he would have been able to be honest with the American people about the virus without causing panic or chaos. Your analogy of an asteroid hitting the earth is ridiculous. You can take measures to limit deaths in a pandemic.
1304005403433463808 2020-09-10 18:34:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @72JBEY @JoyAnnReid If you are a leader, you would do everything you can to stop the spread of the virus by making social distancing and masks mandatory nationwide with penalties if you fail to comply. The morons who do not take personal responsibility will complain, but it wouldn’t bother me a bit
1304004116298031109 2020-09-10 18:29:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @seg_ct @JoyAnnReid You have hit the nail right on the head. Thank you
1303984787875561473 2020-09-10 17:12:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @seg_ct @JoyAnnReid I came to the same conclusion. Thank you.
1303981823035346944 2020-09-10 17:01:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @volleypc @JoyAnnReid People like you will be the downfall of this country. “I could go down to 5th Avenue and shoot 200,000 people and I wouldn’t lose any votes, ok?”
1303969455626768386 2020-09-10 16:11:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @west8181 @davidmweissman @JoyAnnReid @TheMandyMoore I hope you are right, but so far I have not seen evidence of that. I swear, he could line a million people up on 5th Avenue and shoot them and he wouldn’t lose any votes.
1303967901242843136 2020-09-10 16:05:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> I agree completely. Trump could become a murderous authoritarian dictator and they would still support him. Half of the Electorate has lost their ability to think or reason. If anyone reading this loves their country and has not registered and committed to vote, do so now!
1303856110118502400 2020-09-10 08:41:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @edwordxo @eaglefreak1951 @blondygirl1 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC If recent events haven’t changed your mind about this President nothing ever will. I predict one day, we will be living under a dictator because of people like you. Goodbye

When’s the last time this country has done that? Have you ever heard of the Posse Comitatis Act? It’s a federal law that limits the use of the federal military in the United States.
1303853766471548928 2020-09-10 08:32:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @edwordxo @eaglefreak1951 @blondygirl1 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC Trump knew how bad this virus was in January and did nothing but downplay it. If he had taken action at that time fewer people would have died. He did not lead, he let it happen. We are past numbers now. We are in criminal mismanagement and incompetence
1303837594086670337 2020-09-10 07:28:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MollyJongFast His supporters do not care about this news and so far it has not changed their minds about Trump. They don’t appear to be very upset about 200,000 dead Americans either.
1303836068345794562 2020-09-10 07:21:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump. “I could go down on 5th Avenue and shoot 200,000 people and I wouldn’t lose any votes, ok?”
1303835409416417280 2020-09-10 07:19:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trumps supporters will never notice the hypocrisy.
1303834841889341441 2020-09-10 07:17:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> Tell her that was an excellent observation and yes, his supporters are giving him a pass on the one.
1303834522123939840 2020-09-10 07:15:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> He runs a fear based presidential campaign.
1303832718531272709 2020-09-10 07:08:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> You reporters seem frightened of Trump. As you question him you give him excuses for what he did and he jumps on it. Your questions should be simple and direct. If you have the country’s best interest in mind you should not be competitors, but support one another.
1303831084606664709 2020-09-10 07:02:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow I did not.
1303830582976294914 2020-09-10 07:00:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> If you have ever listened to a QANON believer describe their conspiracy theory to you, you would be shocked at how crazy it sounds. These people are supposed to be educated adults, but it sounds like preteens telling ghost stories.
1303829113220853761 2020-09-10 06:54:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @edwordxo @eaglefreak1951 @blondygirl1 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC And how do you feel about 200,000 Americans losing their lives to this virus? If we had done simple things like wear masks and social distancing this number would have been much lower. Some people care about more about their “freedom”,but do they care about their fellow citizens?
1303827670271221771 2020-09-10 06:48:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @rigdont @NumbersMuncher That is a complete cop out. The only thing Trump did to try to stop this virus from spreading was to stop flights from a China. He could have done many things, but instead he said it was a hoax, would just magically go away, and stated it was like the flu. He let this happen.
1303811734986252289 2020-09-10 05:45:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> You are not a leader, in fact you are a destructive force in our country. You must be removed.
1303809051298541568 2020-09-10 05:34:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> Thank God. I have been waiting a long time for the Press Pool to work together instead of being competitors. You people are not helping this country. It’s not all about ratings!
1303808206364454920 2020-09-10 05:31:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> I wonder if it would bother his supporters to know they were paying Trump’s legal bills for rape. Probably not.
1303807479822921729 2020-09-10 05:28:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> And she says these things with a straight face. How does she do it?
1303807156970565632 2020-09-10 05:27:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> None of this outrage bothers Trump’s hardcore supporters, but it should bother the rest of us. Register now and vote them out.
1303806421721665536 2020-09-10 05:24:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> If Americans don’t get off their asses and vote this President out of office he will never leave. You cannot stand by and do nothing when your country is under extreme threat. Don’t care if you are busy. Register and VOTE.
1303805044148535296 2020-09-10 05:18:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> American media, Conservative or Liberal is feeding the monster.
1303804516576440323 2020-09-10 05:16:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> Facebook is seductive and destructive at the same time.
1303803984134705154 2020-09-10 05:14:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow I cancelled it 3 months ago.
1303803234948124673 2020-09-10 05:11:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TFC3Tweets @NumbersMuncher Is that what all you got out of this news? Trump could start murdering innocent people and it wouldn’t faze his supporters a bit. Trump knows you so well.
1303802216621510656 2020-09-10 05:07:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KleinTrottel @NumbersMuncher @RobGeorge Stay in the woods Zanne. You are a sick SOB.
1303801682904612874 2020-09-10 05:05:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KleinTrottel @NumbersMuncher @RobGeorge At first I thought that this news would shock at least some Trump supporters, but I was wrong. You could care less if 200,000 people died. Doesn’t bother you a bit. Many of those deaths could have been avoided if we didn’t have nation of sociopaths supporting a madman.
1303800648685752324 2020-09-10 05:01:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> True statement. I am all for sanity after these past 4 years.
1303800362919505923 2020-09-10 05:00:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @rigdont @NumbersMuncher It’s pretty obvious you don’t care about people. Don’t care if they live or die because your main concern is yourself and maybe your family. I think that attitude drives the Trumpism movement. A group of sociopaths.
1303799301785751552 2020-09-10 04:55:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Jonny_Qi @NumbersMuncher You are either being sarcastic or you are a sociopath.
1303798992103497730 2020-09-10 04:54:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MaxNordau @NumbersMuncher Many of us knew he was downplaying the pandemic to make sure it did not interfere with his re-election campaign. What we did not have was a audio tape proving he knew this virus was deadly as he acted like it was nothing to worry about.
1303797483185868802 2020-09-10 04:48:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ryangunstream @NumbersMuncher If this revelation doesn’t wake you up, nothing will. And you talk about being delusional. Nothing reaches you people. It’s almost like you lost the ability to think. I can only wonder how you would feel about this if you had lost a loved one to this virus. You are unreachable.
1303795677235941377 2020-09-10 04:41:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> What does it take to wake half the country up to the realization that Trump has been lying to us the whole time about this pandemic? He was not trying to avoid panic, he was trying to make sure he was re-elected.
1303793786917707776 2020-09-10 04:33:56 +0800 <VenaAlan> Is this any way to run a country?
1303790921767682056 2020-09-10 04:22:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LenDash668 @bibbacavig @SeanParnellUSA @DonaldJTrumpJr @ConorLambPA @PittsburghPG It means nothing to me. I guess you couldn’t think of anything else to say.
1303790158404292611 2020-09-10 04:19:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DonaldJTrumpJr @ZoltanneUSA You knew your dad was lying to the American people when he downplayed this virus, all the while knowing it was airborne, highly infectious, and much deadlier than the flu. Your whole miserable family was in on it. How many would not have died if your family was not narcissists.
1303788800880119808 2020-09-10 04:14:08 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ZoltanneUSA I am no bot lady. Don’t care what you think about 14 followers. Your President has millions and he is a malevolent moron. It means nothing
1303751998181969920 2020-09-10 01:47:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @EvaMcGreggor @kurteichenwald I hope you are mistaken, but I am afraid you are not.
1303751047064813570 2020-09-10 01:44:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> I can only wonder what Trump’s supporters will think of this. I keep wondering why Trump allowed this taped interview?
1303749023162040320 2020-09-10 01:36:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TamaraHogan1 @kurteichenwald I agree with you. Why didn’t Woodward come out sooner?
1303744842607058944 2020-09-10 01:19:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @StanGott Well said.
1303744542273941506 2020-09-10 01:18:15 +0800 <VenaAlan> @StanGott The sad thing is Cruz is willing to kiss Trump’s a** after Trump said that about his family. What does that say about Cruz?
1303728954226999305 2020-09-10 00:16:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls @MailOnline A hate crime?
1303728499002347532 2020-09-10 00:14:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> The only explanation I can think of is Trump did not want to spend his own money, so the taxpayers will have to foot the bill.
1303726821033340933 2020-09-10 00:07:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @beachluvr32288 @edwordxo @eaglefreak1951 @blondygirl1 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC Well shutting down 650 high speed postal sorting machines will certainly help won’t it? Besides, we are in a pandemic and forcing older people to go to the polls with long lines of voters is not right. There are a lot of retirees where I live.
1303725812659687431 2020-09-10 00:03:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ttguitar @DoYouEvenLif If Donald Trump wins, he may never leave office.
1303725238711128064 2020-09-10 00:01:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> Now why would Trump do that? Any supporters have an idea?
1303722957500489729 2020-09-09 23:52:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> This should tell you something about Trump’s guilt or innocence
1303722635281543176 2020-09-09 23:51:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> I appreciate the staffer honestly communicating this Senator’s attitude about health care.
1303720978376208385 2020-09-09 23:44:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You had 4 years to do this. Why now?
1303720606496632832 2020-09-09 23:43:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ProjectLincoln Did you ever consider the fact that you deserve it? Just sayin.
1303718389320503298 2020-09-09 23:34:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @billmckibben I wonder what Trump’s take of the profit is.
1303718121639903233 2020-09-09 23:33:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Are you guys going to be carrying guns and take out any of those pesky leftists? If you did it would improve Trimp’s odds.
1303716521798242309 2020-09-09 23:26:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ttguitar @DoYouEvenLif I voted for a third party candidate in 2016 because Hillary was supposed to win right? I have regretted that decision ever since. Hillary was bad, but there is no way she would have been worse than Trump. Half of the American Electorate failed to vote in 2016. 100 million people.
1303715083432976384 2020-09-09 23:21:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @edwordxo @eaglefreak1951 @blondygirl1 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC At least in my State an absentee ballot is exactly the same as a mail in ballot. I have to request it and once i send it to the election offices it is treated exactly the same. They even sent me an information packet stating that very thing.
1303713991479488517 2020-09-09 23:16:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @edwordxo @eaglefreak1951 @blondygirl1 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC Tell me why we cannot use Covid to expand voting by mail. Do you believe this virus is real and has killed 190,000 Americans. If you don’t I could understand your argument but would not agree. If I believed vote by mail was prone to major fraud I would be against it also.
1303712646206812160 2020-09-09 23:11:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @edwordxo @eaglefreak1951 @blondygirl1 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC If I go into a polling station I have to show ID. If I vote by mail, the Election Supervisor has to have all my information on file before I even get a ballot and they have to compare the signature on file against my signature on the ballot. Can a illegal do all that?
1303711902967750664 2020-09-09 23:08:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @edwordxo @eaglefreak1951 @blondygirl1 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC In my state the Supervisor of Elections has a lot of my personal information and my signature on file is matched against my signature on the ballot. It has worked fine until Trump told you it was bad and riddled with massive fraud. How did our elections work before Trump?
1303710683046055936 2020-09-09 23:03:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @eaglefreak1951 @blondygirl1 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC Never heard anything about any major voter fraud during Obama’s two terms, but I am sure there were isolated cases. The only reason that it is an issue now is because Donald Trump made it an issue to be able to contest the election if he loses in November.
1303706268578787328 2020-09-09 22:46:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jbrickey66 You don’t know what my news sources are, but thanks for the advice. My whole paradigm just shifted.
1303705673184808960 2020-09-09 22:43:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @edwordxo @eaglefreak1951 @blondygirl1 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC I believe in a democracy, we should encourage as many people to vote as possible. During the 2016 elections 100 million eligible voters did not vote. I think mail in voting and making Election Day a holiday would encourage people to vote. Mail in voting helps the elderly as well

How are Dems responsible for all this?

1303622124817580032 2020-09-09 17:11:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump You destroyed the GOP. You replaced it with Trumpism, which reminds me very much of Nazism. It is racist, it attempts to divide groups of people against one another. It worships one imperfect man and will ultimately give him dictorial powers. You know how that turned out.
1303615857311068160 2020-09-09 16:46:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> @eaglefreak1951 @blondygirl1 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpitC Now Gofer, you ask a question. I answered and you call me a liar. If you don’t want to get an answer, why don’t you STFU and quit asking.

Don’t believe me? Ask the individual State Supervisors of Elections. It only became an issue because Trump told you it was
1303603848469245952 2020-09-09 15:59:11 +0800 <VenaAlan> WHY!!
1303603743917838336 2020-09-09 15:58:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> What joke. Donald Trump the environmentalist.

1303602198828457986 2020-09-09 15:52:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> Here is another perversion of our form of government. When does it stop? When Trump is crowned Emporer?
1303601712624807937 2020-09-09 15:50:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @SarahHuckabee One of the biggest liars in history and she calls herself a “Christian”. How nice.
1303600142885453824 2020-09-09 15:44:28 +0800 <VenaAlan> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump This tax is mostly on corporations and the wealthy, the same people that a Trump gave massive tax breaks to. Trump lies and his followers eat it up like pig swill.

He promotes the idea that rioting is common across entire country and wants to Federalize law enforcement. He falsely pushes the idea that mail in voting is fraudulent. He lies.
1303594579900461056 2020-09-09 15:22:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @LenDash668 @bibbacavig @SeanParnellUSA @DonaldJTrumpJr @ConorLambPA @PittsburghPG Yes, they are thugs. Yes they should be punished. What I am saying is don’t let politicians convince you that all these Americans, who are peacefully protesting a legitimate grievance which is Constitutionally protected, are just like these thugs. They are not.

How many followers you have? I could care less how many followers I have. Look at the President, a pig of a man trashing the Constitution on a daily basis, working on being America’s first dictator and he has millions of followers. It means nothing
1303482254845530116 2020-09-09 07:56:01 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BLaw Why?
1303481430404726785 2020-09-09 07:52:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump He destroyed the GOP. His supporters may call themselves Republicans, but they are nothing like the Republican Party of the past. They have morphed into a party that worships one imperfect man, much like the Germans worshiped Hitler until he destroyed their country.
1303480119718227980 2020-09-09 07:47:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @StephenKing @donwinslow We have a lot of retired conservatives living here that are less economically affected by the pandemic. They love Trump.

One conclusion I have come to is that many, but not all, relate to Trump’s personality, beliefs, style, and attitude. This would include racism and a lack of concern about their fellow citizens. They just don’t care.

It’s called a generalization and it’s BS and you know it. You are just not honest enough to admit it.
1303388321352167424 2020-09-09 01:42:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> The only people that would not support these positions doesn’t like living in a Democratic country.

1303386807258808320 2020-09-09 01:36:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 I just told you and I am not telling you again. I have no idea how your parents raised you, but if you think Trump is a good example of how to treat your fellow human beings, I have to wonder. POTUS used to be someone to look up to, but not anymore.
1303381480962428931 2020-09-09 01:15:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Whose they Trump? All the Americans that are exercising their first amendment rights to peacefully protest? It’s obvious you have complete contempt for the Constitution.

If you accept everything Trump says at face value, you are a fool, but that’s your business. Me, I want to know what kind of person is running the country. It should be required of any person running for a Federal public office, Republican or Democrat

Many of Trump’s supporters have never interacted with people from other nations and are suspicious of them. By and large, they are an extremely gullible group of people who follow every word this President says without question.

He did not build the wall, he did not come up with health care for all Americans, he did not release his taxes and didnt release his school records fighting tooth and nail to stop any of those records from being released. I would say you are dead wrong.

He’s a proven pathological liar and divides Americans instead of uniting them. He has mentioned serving more than two terms. I think people like you would be ok with that. Is it possible you are creating America’s first dictator?
1303289831993335810 2020-09-08 19:11:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @EricTrump Figures you and your corrupt family would criticize Biden for caring about the spread of this virus. None of you care about infecting others and your supporters emulate you. Your whole family exemplifies the worst of humanity.

He is everything my parents taught me never to be. He is a man that worships money over people. He is a man that is incapable of compassion or empathy. He is not fit to be POTUS or anything else.

The rioters are a very small group compared to those that are peacefully protesting grievances against the government. Yet you have the gall to say it’s all Biden supporters. You are evil.
1302962515631112194 2020-09-07 21:30:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump All this President wants you to see is the small percentage of people rioting in the streets in a few cities. He won’t show you the vast majority of people that are peacefully protesting valid grievances against police misconduct, which is protected by our Constitution.

No, and the vast majority of Trump supporters are not affected either.

There are a lot of people that support the right of Americans to peacefully protest their grievances against the government including Biden. What I see is Trump and his supporter trying make them one and the same.

A small minority are rioters, usually at night. When you refer to “they” some could come to the conclusion that all protestors are rioters.

Over 100 million voted in 2016. This is a drop in the bucket. It’s a problem created by Trump to contest the election in case he loses. I have always said Trump was one of the worlds greatest conmen.

If everything you sent me was true, how is this a major problem in our election system. I heard nothing from Trump supporters about this during the election in 2016. Why now? It’s because Trump told you it was a problem.

Over 100 million people voted in 2016. You see what am getting at. It’s called making a mountain out of a molehill. Trump wants to stay in office so he creates this narrative where mail in voting is fraudulent.

Instead of relying on my word, you can ask the individual State Supervisors of Elections.

You are a freaking joke. I feel for those elderly Trump voters though. They will have to go vote in person.

You are the ones that are willfully ignorant because you don’t want truth. You only want Trump.

1302567972318437376 2020-09-06 19:22:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Trump, it’s funny to hear you call anyone else’s conman. You are the most successful con man in history as far as I am concerned and that was not a complement.
1302567509321748481 2020-09-06 19:21:09 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump So the President of the United States is promoting harassment of an American citizen who supports an opposing political party? How low will this man go?Straight to hell I hope.

Only 6 states have Universal voting and the rest offer in person voting as well if you are concerned about discarded ballots. I believe the whole idea behind discarding incorrectly filled our ballots is to try to reduce fraud.

At some point in time the Legislature decided to make it easier for people to vote in democratic elections so they made mail in ballots available for those who requested them. That was when we really had Republicans. What a novel idea.

1302300334149296134 2020-09-06 01:39:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @USAlivestrong Immigrants entered indentured servitude contracts of their own free will, as opposed to slaves, who did not have a choice in the matter. Treatment of indentured servants differed greatly from one master to another. hence were indentured servants, not slaves.

It’s odd that the USPS is being attacked at the same time

You are free to vote however you like, but the threat is not from masks and lockdowns which are commonly used  to contain pandemics. It’s one madman and a compliant Congress.
1302294759562715137 2020-09-06 01:17:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @delbigtree The people pushing this study without context are far right news sources and people that refuse to do any research. They want you to believe that COVID is not a threat and masks/ social distancing are unnecessary. Do the 185,000 COVID deaths mean anything the author of this tweet

Do you believe it is real and has killed 185,000 so far? Could be 400,000 people by the first of the year. Maybe it was a mistake, but is no laughing matter.

In fact he was trying to have Ukraine remove a corrupt top prosecutor left over from the pro Russian government before sending aid to that country. There was no evidence that it helped his son.
1302267107061772288 2020-09-05 23:27:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 I could say the exact thing about you.

Trump’s presidency has been a complete failure.
1302265579995385856 2020-09-05 23:21:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Yes, I completely agree that Trump cannot put two sentences together and no, I do not want him to be President of the United States. He does not have the character or temperament for the office. He had no integrity, principles or morals and is a classic narcissist.

The bottom line is that this man risked his life for this country and was tortured for 5 years while Bonespurs bought a doctor off and was a rich playboy safe and sound.
1302262953538920455 2020-09-05 23:10:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> @divapaulatx @DonnaWR8 @RealJamesWoods It relates to the empathy you feel when confronted by human suffering and loss. If you say 99% of people survive and could care less about the 1% of Americans who die, along with their grieving families, you demean human life. Would Jesus respond that way? Don’t think so.

Even if Biden did nothing, which I do not believe, he could still have character. My idea of character is typically related to integrity, honesty, trustworthiness and respectfulness. Trump has none of those qualities.

Even Fox News verified the story. You and I were not there when he allegedly made those statements, but we have heard him speak that way about other vets. Let’s not forget about the bonespurs to avoid Vietnam
1302258252978290688 2020-09-05 22:52:16 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I say you are either a liar or you have a bad memory. This man was born with no arms and was not a vet. No wonder know one can read any rebuttals to your bullshit.

You listened to how he disparaged John McCain with your own ears. He made sure he didn’t get sent to Vietnam, while others could not buy a doctor with the Bonespurs excuse

1302227509073915904 2020-09-05 20:50:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump But Trump, is it true? Did you say those horrible things about the men who died in combat and veterans in general? For once in your miserable life think of someone other than yourself. Can’t do it can you? That’s because you are a classic narcissist.
1302221959611273216 2020-09-05 20:28:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @ModernFanMan @kurteichenwald @FLOTUS @TheAtlantic He went to war because his country told him to. He risked his life believing he he was defending all of us. He was shot down an tortured for 5 years. What did your POS bone spurs President do? His daddy bought a doctor to keep him out of the war. You are as f**ked up as Trump is.
1302218982594949121 2020-09-05 20:16:14 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is what a draft dodger said about a man who spent 5 years in a POW camp being tortured. If he said this about one combat vet, he is saying the same thing about all veterans.
1302212621056303106 2020-09-05 19:50:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> And why was John Kelly exhausted Trump? Maybe it was all the lying he was expected to do for a future dictator perhaps? He should come forward and call you out Trump.
1302206275095277568 2020-09-05 19:25:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> Yes, if we did, we wouldn’t have lived through this national nightmare for the last 3 1/2 years.
1302205657760882688 2020-09-05 19:23:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Many of us have heard Donald Trump’s underlings lie for him. For people to forego their principles in the pursuit of power is extremely common, especially in this Administration. Now I heard Bonespurs disparage John McCain with my own ears. That said volumes about Trump.
1302201680403062784 2020-09-05 19:07:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 So you make this statement that I am knowingly committing sedition against this country. I am trying to get a future dictator defeated in a free and fair election. You don’t even know the definition of the word. I just view you supporters as unable to engage in critical thinking
1302200331032559617 2020-09-05 19:02:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Neither one of us heard the President say any of this, but even if the sources came forward and stated that what was reported was true, you still would not believe it. “I could go down on 5th Ave and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose any votes”. You cannot be reached.
1302196997756203008 2020-09-05 18:48:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Give me some evidence of your claim.
1302073900633915393 2020-09-05 10:39:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> Maybe they are all cowards. Maybe they fear Trump and don’t have the guts to tell the voters in this country the maniac they are dealing with. I don’t have an ounce of respect for any of them. They are in effect traitors if they don’t speak up and have direct knowledge of this.
1302072112497258496 2020-09-05 10:32:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @FLOTUS @TheAtlantic You are a trophy wife Melania. You married this monster for money and to get your immigrant parents into the country. Your words mean nothing.
1302071139632582656 2020-09-05 10:28:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @DanScavino @realDonaldTrump Sounds like all of Trumps cockroaches are coming out of the walls to defend this Liar in Chief. You are all part of his criminal enterprise so what you say means absolutely nothing.
1302070246531051521 2020-09-05 10:25:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JMMulvaney1 @realDonaldTrump Since you are so closely tied to Trump, your defense of the President is essentially meaningless. To put it in a different way, you are part of a criminal enterprise in the WH called the Trump Administration.
1302044515608518657 2020-09-05 08:42:57 +0800 <VenaAlan> I still say Putin has something on Trump and it will come out. President Donald J Trump, the United State’s most dangerous traitor.
1302028605376139271 2020-09-05 07:39:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> So this makes this denial the 20,001 lie he has told the American people during his first term?
1302027055962431491 2020-09-05 07:33:35 +0800 <VenaAlan> So many pieces of evidence like this paint a picture of an Administration riddled with corruption headed by crime boss Donald J Trump. REGISTER NOW and VOTE THEM OUT!
1302008809276215311 2020-09-05 06:21:04 +0800 <VenaAlan> @passantino @madrid_mike Maybe there will be a civil war at Fox News.
1302007764512903169 2020-09-05 06:16:55 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well, I have a lot more confidence that this story is true. It only confirms what we have been saying for years about Donald Trump. Disgusting.
1302005928737341442 2020-09-05 06:09:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> Well, well, well. Trump’s supporters working with Israel’s arch enemies. Strange times.
1302002156770414592 2020-09-05 05:54:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I quit listening to them. I start feeling nauseous with disgust for that man when he speaks.
1301986359666712577 2020-09-05 04:51:52 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @USPS I don’t think Congress will do anything before the election. It sounds like a fait accompli. The mail sorting machines are removed or destroyed as well as the mail boxes. We will have to get people to the polling stations.
1301974189482573827 2020-09-05 04:03:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @GLFOP @realDonaldTrump Well at least now I know where police unions stand on our future dictator in this country. The unions don’t want to give up power either.
1301940413297811457 2020-09-05 01:49:18 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump’s hand is in there somewhere
1301938950173609986 2020-09-05 01:43:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> I keep asking where they get these kinds of professional liars?
1301937486533402624 2020-09-05 01:37:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> @svdate I don’t know if I believe the report at face value yet, but it definitely sounds like something Donald Trump would say.
1301936904372396032 2020-09-05 01:35:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AndrewYang Wise words. I hope Biden has a cabinet position for you.
1301936408857370629 2020-09-05 01:33:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> All it shows me is that this idiot never had a clue what needs to be done in a pandemic and nothing has changed. REGISTER NOW and VOTE HIM OUT!
1301934954134351878 2020-09-05 01:27:36 +0800 <VenaAlan> @jonathanvswan @amyewalter I have much less faith in polls after the 2016 debacle. Don’t assume anything. Register and vote!
1301934381641207811 2020-09-05 01:25:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JordanKarem1 @POTUS Trump has dozens of sycophants lying for him everyday and we are supposed to believe you? We have listened to him lie daily. Your testimony may work on his poor deluded followers who believe everything that comes out of his mouth, but for me, you have to do better than that.
1301932025264451585 2020-09-05 01:15:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> Barr is simply a fat Trump whore.
1301931484538863617 2020-09-05 01:13:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @StanGott Is that Barr’s illegitimate son?
1301931137007312898 2020-09-05 01:12:26 +0800 <VenaAlan> Too little, too late Zuckerberg. You never lifted a finger as all the lies, propaganda and Russian bots ran amok on your platform. I know you want Trump to win this election. You can go to hell.
1301930193288863746 2020-09-05 01:08:41 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls Trump is losing this election. I predict all your spin and misdirection will not save him. I can only hope he ultimately rots in prison.
1301929197330366464 2020-09-05 01:04:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> @mack0352 @madrid_mike My nephew served in both Iraq and Afghanistan and unlike so many others in his unit, came back in one piece. It changed him though. I want to thank you for going where your country sent you. Where would we be without men and women like you and my nephew.
1301927861809483781 2020-09-05 00:59:25 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls Sounds like you are trying to make a purse out of a sows ear. Your dear leader trashed the economy with his pathetic response to the virus aided by your incessant lying for him. The Administration that you lie for is a complete and utter failure.
1301926940803301376 2020-09-05 00:55:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> So true.
1301926830744707072 2020-09-05 00:55:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Here and I thought all you did was play golf and lie on Twitter.
1301926580449574912 2020-09-05 00:54:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KellyannePolls Cute, but you still look like a wicked witch. Obama and Biden inherited a deep recession and we had a great economy when they left office. Trump and Pence inherited a great economy and totally trashed it with their mishandling of the pandemic. Did I miss anything?
1301875156399390722 2020-09-04 21:29:59 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump And here I always thought Trump was as the Anti Christ.
1301874458744033282 2020-09-04 21:27:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> Where are you gentlemen?
1301874194280599552 2020-09-04 21:26:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is one of the reasons why Trump is not qualified to be President. Character or the lack of it has real consequences.
1301871735403315202 2020-09-04 21:16:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Says a complete failure at leading the country as President. You are uniquely unqualified for that office and during the last 3 1/2 years and you’ve proven that beyond any doubt. You like to talk about losers. Take a good look at yourself.

1301870102892212226 2020-09-04 21:09:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KarlVanghaug @CraigSh8 @thejtlewis @realDonaldTrump I would expect you to deflect from this President, except for the fact that many countries responded quickly and forcefully to the threat and their transmission rate is low. China was late to respond, but they finally did and are doing much better than we are. Stop making excuses
1301867483369013251 2020-09-04 20:59:30 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KarlVanghaug @CraigSh8 @thejtlewis @realDonaldTrump Let me put it this way. If Trump had followed the virus response playbook left by two previous administrations and taken decisive action, the death toll would be much lower. The two things that stopped him was his arrogance and his narcissistism. His only goal was to be reelected
1301866442472726528 2020-09-04 20:55:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> @AntiYouProMe1 @birdman6290 @JocelynChampag7 @ProjectLincoln @TheRickWilson Well said.
1301856077416484866 2020-09-04 20:14:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @FJWaldowJr @ProjectLincoln I feel the same way. No way, no how are his supporters Republicans. They have morphed into something totally different and they will be a threat to our democracy from now on.
1301855489463115777 2020-09-04 20:11:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @birdman6290 @JocelynChampag7 @ProjectLincoln @TheRickWilson I believed, from interacting with his supporters, that there is a good portion of them@that will never be reached. They will die believing he was the greatest President who ever lived.
1301846112165396480 2020-09-04 19:34:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> @vmidyett @ProjectLincoln I hate to break this to you, but they are the only real Republicans that will speak the Truth about Donald Trump and his Administration. You and your fellow Trump supporters are an aberration and you are not and will never be Republican. You worship one man who would be King.
1301844640648368131 2020-09-04 19:28:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> Register and request a ballot right now. If you don’t get your ballot in time you can always vote in person if you feel safe.
1301843377865064448 2020-09-04 19:23:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> I think Trump and his supporters are all RINO’s.
1301842903136980994 2020-09-04 19:21:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @Julius_Kim I think both.
1301842564761423873 2020-09-04 19:20:29 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KarlVanghaug @CraigSh8 @thejtlewis @realDonaldTrump Nice try, but the fact remains that you took what the CDC stated out of context and like other Trumpers, used it the support your conspiracy theories. Typical. You and Trump have much in common and that’s not a compliment
1301840908011425792 2020-09-04 19:13:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KarlVanghaug @CraigSh8 @thejtlewis @realDonaldTrump They also had more deaths per capita than most other countries. If you feel that keeping the country open for business like nothing ever happened with a high COVID death rate is the way to go, just come out and say it. Plenty of your other Trumpism sociopaths have stated that.

Your hero Trump does not give a damn about the military or the people of this country. He only cares about himself. You have been conned and it wasn’t very difficult.

1301690467122323456 2020-09-04 09:16:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @IvankaTrump Bonespurs ruined the picture.

That’s what President Trump is doing and he is an idiot. I think most people in this country realize that 185,000 American deaths in this country are due to this Administration’s non existent response.

This President, his press secretary and the Russians are trying to convince Americans not to trust our election system without evidence
1301588729769922560 2020-09-04 02:31:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump It’s like Trump is the biggest conman in history and running a criminal enterprise out of the White House and then they try to push Pelosi’s Salongate on the American people. What a joke.

1301299896583061515 2020-09-03 07:24:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> @MollyMcKew @svdate Bill Barr. If you are monitoring Social Media as you spy on Americans I want you to know that you can KISS MY ASS!
1301293930735112193 2020-09-03 07:00:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> When you put all the illegal and unethical things this Administration has done together, you cannot escape the conclusion that this is an organized coup in the top levels of the US Government. If you only vote in one election in your lifetime, vote this one.
1301282688410759173 2020-09-03 06:15:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> @24sales2U @realDonaldTrump Are any of you loyal Trump supporters planning on relying on SS and Medicare in retirement. Be careful what you wish for. You are about to get screwed royally.
1301281836065263616 2020-09-03 06:12:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RealFrazel @realDonaldTrump Keep voting for Donald Trump and you will end up in an Authoritarian State under a dictator. You will notice that I did not warn you against voting Republican because that party is dead.
1301281064829231105 2020-09-03 06:09:17 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realJohnSMiller @realDonaldTrump You don’t speak for myself or millions of other Americans in this country John.
1301280736515948546 2020-09-03 06:07:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump They should call it “Lies and Failures”. You have seen what this President has done in four years and you honestly want him in office for another term? What are you thinking?
1301274715441582081 2020-09-03 05:44:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JJHunt10 You people are really desperate. Salongate? You are also pathetic.
1301274255385075715 2020-09-03 05:42:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JJHunt10 I think you are full of shit Jesse and I am not going to pay money to read whatever bullshit you have to support your claims
1301273746662207490 2020-09-03 05:40:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JJHunt10 This think you are grasping for what little you can find to protect this mentally ill President. It’s really pathetic.
1301272653848813568 2020-09-03 05:35:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> I don’t think the hardcore group ever will. Many are unreachable
1301272400173170688 2020-09-03 05:34:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump supporters like to deny Russian attempts to influence our election for Trump, but they are in denial.
1301271259871879168 2020-09-03 05:30:19 +0800 <VenaAlan> Register right now and VOTE THESE IDIOTS OUT!
1301270921999724544 2020-09-03 05:28:58 +0800 <VenaAlan> @JoyceCarolOates @donwinslow No one has the spine to confront Trump. These moderators are scared to death of him.
1301270604876779520 2020-09-03 05:27:43 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trumpers have not cared at all about fiscal responsibility up to this point.
1301270200600399872 2020-09-03 05:26:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> His supporters will hear what they want to hear. Register right now and VOTE BLUE!
1301268370332045313 2020-09-03 05:18:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> That is great idea, but Zuckerberg will never do it.
1301267928122298369 2020-09-03 05:17:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> @KurtSchlichter Since Trump lies through his teeth constantly, no one trusts him. Then he starts slurring his speech and flailing around when he walks. What do you expect? It would not surprise me at all if it turned out to be true.
1301266555280470016 2020-09-03 05:11:37 +0800 <VenaAlan> @phiphi6969 @hlphoenix @ChrisDJackson @JoeBiden Sounds like you are afraid of some honesty. Truth is like Holy Water poured on Trump the vampire.
1301265831444328450 2020-09-03 05:08:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow I agree completely and am all for it. We would have to pressure the sponsors of the debates to make it a reality.
1301265232841637888 2020-09-03 05:06:22 +0800 <VenaAlan> That is an awesome idea!
1301265110770552833 2020-09-03 05:05:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump I do not feel lucky to have a mentally ill narcissistic conman as President of the United States. Can’t wait till your sorry ass is kicked out of the White House and you are in prison. It will be one of the greatest days in my life.
1301251851266949120 2020-09-03 04:13:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> Any Trump supporters plan to rely on SS and Medicare during retirement? Be careful what you wish for. You just may get it.
1301248236892585984 2020-09-03 03:58:50 +0800 <VenaAlan> Whatever political stripe you are, this is worth listening to. You can make up your own mind if you believe this explains why things are the way they are.
1301219752816373762 2020-09-03 02:05:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> This could very well happen. This is where Trump would announce the election was rigged and refuse to concede, setting up a Constitutional crises where Trump would win in the House.
1301218218221150210 2020-09-03 01:59:33 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @SenKamalaHarris I hope you don’t give this man a pass Wolf. It happens way too often in the White House Press Pool.
1301215943734054918 2020-09-03 01:50:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> @donwinslow @Yahoo The good news is that after Trump slandered Ted Cruz’s father they kissed and made up. In fact a whole list of spineless politicians kissed Trumps butt after he slandered them.
1301212908647522304 2020-09-03 01:38:27 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Well, he’s not a wannabe dictator if that’s what you are getting at.
1301212630783348738 2020-09-03 01:37:21 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @CNN And how about you? 30+ women have accused you of sexual assault so you have no room to talk about anyone else. Trump, you are a moron.
1301184049344655361 2020-09-02 23:43:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is what the Russian government does to anyone who opposes them. These same people support their asset in the US, Donald Trump.
1301177998767534080 2020-09-02 23:19:44 +0800 <VenaAlan> This President ignores any norms of behavior in the office he holds. He feels they do not apply to him and that they are beneath him.
1301176658427289600 2020-09-02 23:14:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> This is a politician answering a question by not answering the question.
1301175434852392961 2020-09-02 23:09:32 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump As usual you are FOS Trump. Besides, Biden is decent human being as opposed to you who are raving lunatic. You kind of remind me of Nero when Rome was burning, a power hungry madman.
1301173807940546560 2020-09-02 23:03:05 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is a farce and a liar. Why anyone would want him as President is beyond me.
1301161510635483137 2020-09-02 22:14:13 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump We already have seen how much destruction you have caused Trump. That’s all I need to know. You are history.
1301161148419538944 2020-09-02 22:12:46 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Compared to the crimes you committed Trump, this guy is an angel.
1301153499170902016 2020-09-02 21:42:23 +0800 <VenaAlan> Trump is a farce. Vote him out.
1301149052168556546 2020-09-02 21:24:42 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump Your incompetence has cost the lives of 184,000 Americans. You are a Russian asset as well. You should be sent packing, tried in a court of law and imprisoned for treason.
1301113810942660612 2020-09-02 19:04:40 +0800 <VenaAlan> Because all Trump cares about is power and winning this election. That’s what narcissists do.
1301113187752972288 2020-09-02 19:02:12 +0800 <VenaAlan> If true, the American people need to know. Most of us realize that will not happen.
1301084831191891968 2020-09-02 17:09:31 +0800 <VenaAlan> If you pay attention to the way our  government works over many Administrations you will find that this article is accurate. Our Constitutional Republic is in danger. REGISTER NOW and VOTE THEM OUT!
1301071890807697409 2020-09-02 16:18:06 +0800 <VenaAlan> I do not trust ANYTHING Trump or  his political appointees say anymore. They would lie cheat and steal from their own mothers to keep their jobs.
1301068507153604608 2020-09-02 16:04:39 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RichardGrenell @realDonaldTrump Wow, and why should I give a damn, when thanks to our Clown in Chief, this country is in termoil.
1300946504526557184 2020-09-02 07:59:51 +0800 <VenaAlan> Another idiotic rant by our President. The guy has completely lost it.
1300934972925194242 2020-09-02 07:14:02 +0800 <VenaAlan> What in the hell is this guy blubbering about?
1300931142061903874 2020-09-02 06:58:49 +0800 <VenaAlan> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Why doesn’t our Idiot in Chief stop promoting violence with his words and quit trying to buy votes.
1300930384088248326 2020-09-02 06:55:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump The only way Trump wins is if he cheats.
1300830975983849472 2020-09-02 00:20:47 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump If you are talking about being our favorite President, then yes, that was Fake News.
1300828598731976704 2020-09-02 00:11:20 +0800 <VenaAlan> @americanadianTO @BrandonSMichael @jessie4324 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump That’s true, but in 2006 Congress passed a law forcing the USPS to fully fund all of their employees retirement thru 2075, something no other US company or any other Federal Agency has ever had to do. Republicans have been trying to privatize the USPS ever since.
1300742992073035776 2020-09-01 18:31:10 +0800 <VenaAlan> @panikdriven @MegAndBubba @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump A very simplistic view of what’s going on in this country. If you are talking about the BLM movement, this has been a struggle going on for generations and grievances that have never been addressed. Peaceful protests are enshrined in the Constitution.
1300741662419881984 2020-09-01 18:25:53 +0800 <VenaAlan> @CtheFirefly @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I wouldn’t believe anything he said anyway.
1300722035405000710 2020-09-01 17:07:54 +0800 <VenaAlan> @sanityends @bluejupalex @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump He doesn’t go in and he doesn’t provoke violence. Simple. If the States need their National Guard they can call them. They don’t need Trump or Federal troops. I swear, Trump supporters are ready for a police state and our first dictator.
1300720583194411008 2020-09-01 17:02:07 +0800 <VenaAlan> @BrandonSMichael @jessie4324 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I don’t believe you. Prove it.
1300720192729776129 2020-09-01 17:00:34 +0800 <VenaAlan> This mayor nailed.
1300707315142873089 2020-09-01 16:09:24 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump What is sad Trump is that so many Americans have been completely conned by you. Not everyone though. Your time is coming and every traitorous thing you have done will come to light. Your name will go down in history as America’s worst traitor.
1300705966829248512 2020-09-01 16:04:03 +0800 <VenaAlan> @RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump You are a traitor Gaetz, plain and simple. You had better make sure your supreme leader wins this election, because all of you sycophants need to be investigated of your role in selling this country out.
1300705152089894913 2020-09-01 16:00:48 +0800 <VenaAlan> @CBS_Herridge @realDonaldTrump @DNI_Ratcliffe This corrupt, criminal Administration does not want the American Electorate to know how much they have subjected this country to Russian influence without a shot fired. When you look at all the evidence in totality, the pattern is clear. VOTE THEM OUT!
1300703348799279105 2020-09-01 15:53:38 +0800 <VenaAlan> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @seanhannity Like your book Trump, I’m pretty sure a ghost writer wrote the book. Neither one of you has the brains to blow your noses.
1300590128583278594 2020-09-01 08:23:45 +0800 <VenaAlan> @shelld1234 Did you ever investigate how much he gave to corporations in tax breaks, or how much he has spent golfing? What CONGRESS gave you was Chump change
