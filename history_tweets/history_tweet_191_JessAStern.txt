1343769588014706688 2020-12-29 12:03:30 +0800 <JessAStern> @YalePsych @YaleCSC @YaleMed What a loss. So many are indebted to Nancy‚Äôs work, including myself. Sending gratitude and my condolences.
1343768978754334720 2020-12-29 12:01:05 +0800 <JessAStern> Nancy Suchman was a leader in effecting change in the lives of parents struggling with addiction. I‚Äôve learned so much from her work and am sad to see her go.

I hope I can pay forward her kindnessüôèüèº

And for students with accessibility needs, re-plays &amp; captioning can better support their learning.
1341141114028511232 2020-12-22 05:58:53 +0800 <JessAStern> @JohnHolbein1 On the negative side of PhD life: My sense of worth became tied to productivity (something I'm still trying to unlearn).  On the positive side: I learned the magic of taking short breaks, walks, &amp; check-ins (i.e., venting time) with fellow grad students.

1337089802722807810 2020-12-11 01:40:25 +0800 <JessAStern> Tip for students anxious about grad school interviews: Just imagine the faculty as muppet versions of themselves. (Academics lend themselves remarkably well to this exercise.)  https://t.co/3QQyhi93yY
1336698406832631812 2020-12-09 23:45:09 +0800 <JessAStern> As a relationships researcher, the word "attachment" often comes up in my emails... and every time, Outlook's AI gently nudges, "you may have forgotten to attach a file."

1310953999407943682 2020-09-29 22:46:04 +0800 <JessAStern> We find that insecure attachment at 14 predicts decreases in teens‚Äô ability to seek &amp; receive support from friends from 14‚Äì18. These difficulties, in turn, predict greater negative interactions w/ romantic partners &amp; increases in hostile attitudes from 14-27. #friendship #support
