1343605050745245701 2020-12-29 01:09:41 +0800 <JackEvansVR> My research focuses on using #VirtualReality for assessing upper-limb movement disorders in clinical populations. We want to use VR to create fun, interesting and more detailed assessment techniques, particularly targeted at stroke survivors.  (and the odd bit of beatsaber, obvs)  https://t.co/WZdNYIkYRw
1343605041698103301 2020-12-29 01:09:39 +0800 <JackEvansVR> I started my academic journey with a BSc in Psychology, before completing an MSc in Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive Robotics (sorry, that one is a bit of a mouthful).

1340362385236910082 2020-12-20 02:24:30 +0800 <JackEvansVR> I wonder if Dom is heading back to Epsilon Five - I mean Durham - for Christmas?  https://t.co/vt5ZCXol2x
1339900123061645312 2020-12-18 19:47:38 +0800 <JackEvansVR> @FromPhDtoLife I really, really, *really!* rely on coffee
1339899229230260225 2020-12-18 19:44:05 +0800 <JackEvansVR> Like the exam results over the summer, this is classic lackluster planning by @GavinWilliamson. Last minute announcement, no time to prepare, no dedicated training time and no staff.
1339899227946819584 2020-12-18 19:44:04 +0800 <JackEvansVR> Even after watching what I'm sure is a thrilling and instructive webinar, surely teaching + support staff can't be expected to administer tests to 20-30 kids per class, while simultaneously managing &amp; teaching the rest?
1339899226285813760 2020-12-18 19:44:04 +0800 <JackEvansVR> Staff are expected to administer tests to kids. They will use current staff meetings, and probably more personal time, to review training materials.   It's not like those meetings already fill an important role... for planning, discussing issues, and scheduling perhaps? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  https://t.co/W6RMu0m52J
1339899220187353088 2020-12-18 19:44:02 +0800 <JackEvansVR> As usual, the annoucement comes late in the day and leaves schools no time to prepare. Many have closed for christmas, and many more are closing this week.
1339899218467676160 2020-12-18 19:44:02 +0800 <JackEvansVR> In January, sec schools will be having staggered return and staff will be used to administer tests. It's great idea and welcomed by many...   ... but poorly thought out.

1336992673601888256 2020-12-10 19:14:28 +0800 <JackEvansVR> @jackbrookes I agree. We had to 3D print our own mounts for the vive trackers to track elbow/shoulder/wrist joints. Even then, they were too bulky to attach with any real precision.

You can then work together to find the best way forward for you.  You shouldn't be expected to be brave or scary all the time. Don't sit in silence mate!
