Christine: Yes. Instagram followers do not translate to power in Congress is actually—it warms the cockles of my heart...
1340082535586476033 2020-12-19 07:52:28 +0800 <701007> “The two of them can drop dead, but, before they drop dead...” ahaha JPod.... starts at about 30:00 in...  “...and create some sort of Utopian ideal where we run on bio-mass...” 😆 — Noah... (31:44)
1340076001435521030 2020-12-19 07:26:30 +0800 <701007> The conversation on gratitude that follows is my absolute favorite thing on this podcast today (and it’s a quite good one)...
1340075964932485127 2020-12-19 07:26:22 +0800 <701007> JPod, at about 25:56 in, talking about Buckley and (the awesome 💛) Jonah Goldberg pointing out about living a good life, how to understand our lives as being good, and the key being gratitude...
1340075861534502922 2020-12-19 07:25:57 +0800 <701007> Noah cont’d.: ...And, after a year of this, now we’re talking about ‘well, maybe they should die because they have the wrong skin color?’  Followed by Christine and JPod...  Noah at 20:30...very good stuff here...
1340075769687650304 2020-12-19 07:25:35 +0800 <701007> Noah at 19:19: It is so shocking, and myopic and ideologically blinkered that we’re even having this discussion. Because what did we do for the last year? We shut down all of society, and for what? To save the most vulnerable populations from death... (1/2)

Ahaha (36:10) &amp; at about 38:00 in...followed by Noah...
1339707178312187908 2020-12-18 07:00:56 +0800 <701007> Noah at 15:44 on the clip with Whoopi remarking that Jill Biden making a possible great surgeon general. Also 17:38.  Christine at 18:54 — also, “I’m a miracle, John.” “You are a miracle.” Haha   JPod 21:36... &amp; 24:48 (which includes a fact I was unaware of). 28:25...

1339668586370052096 2020-12-18 04:27:35 +0800 <701007> Noah at 20:29, starting with, ‘they know they won’t be policed, either...  ‘...They just kind of come and they’re shadows that pass through their lives, they have no impact on their—they know them academically,’ line is *so* Noah, quite true and so beautifully rendered...💛.
1339668289014951940 2020-12-18 04:26:24 +0800 <701007> JPod: 18:35, on the other story of the pandemic... &amp; 19:20...
1339668199583956992 2020-12-18 04:26:03 +0800 <701007> Noah cont’d (4): I can tell you right now it’s not going to be the case—not because it’s not necessary—but because it’s not going to happen.
1339668145024495621 2020-12-18 04:25:50 +0800 <701007> Noah cont’d (3): ...and rather than evince some humility, they’re going right ahead and saying, ‘we’re masking and social distancing until 2022,’ when that’s surely not going to be the case.
1339667920117444608 2020-12-18 04:24:56 +0800 <701007> Noah cont’d.: And it’s here, and none of them have revisited the lack of faith they demonstrated in the capacity of public/private partnerships, and human ingenuity, and every engine pulling in the same direction to yield this miracle...
1339667809400451074 2020-12-18 04:24:30 +0800 <701007> Noah: There’s no humility on the part of these people who presume to speak for, capital ‘T,’ The, capital ‘S,’ Science. These are the same people who were saying it would be a medical miracle and we should not expect the delivery of a vaccine before the end of calendar year 2020.
1339667713069867016 2020-12-18 04:24:07 +0800 <701007> More highlights, thus far: JPod at 15:59 in...
1339659430489710592 2020-12-18 03:51:12 +0800 <701007> Abe calling it ‘the never ending virus’...then JPod and Eli talk about the all-time low trust in institutions and how they erode that trust by not following the rules themselves...(didn’t know the Cabo video fact)...
1339655623525462021 2020-12-18 03:36:04 +0800 <701007> JPod: Dr. Vin Gupta is glatt Covid. But this is where the rubber meets the road because that cannot be the standard for a free society.  JPod, at about 5:44 in, speaks about Covid orthodoxies and heretics...
1339650781142802436 2020-12-18 03:16:50 +0800 <701007> Had to take a break for a moment to warm up my tea...  Anyway, about 4:00 minutes in, Christine chimes in with a great observation about political power plays and teacher’s unions, then Noah follows by saying they like this...a point with which I agree...
1339646206713204736 2020-12-18 02:58:39 +0800 <701007> Christine speaking now—so happy to hear these guys again.   Also, for someone with a medical degree to listen to—who won’t let you down on Covid advice—I heartily recommend Pradheep J. Shanker...he’s great, he’s been right about all of his predictions &amp; he’s smart and honest...
1339643898671587333 2020-12-18 02:49:29 +0800 <701007> Noah: ...so I am, therefore, saying he has no idea what he’s talking about, and you can’t prove me wrong.  (2/2)  Missed this guy, too—funny, while still making a good point.💛
1339643757059256321 2020-12-18 02:48:55 +0800 <701007> Noah: ...and, in that sense, I know just as much as Dr. Vin Gupta does about what happens after you get the second dose. So, *I* am saying you’re liberated; you’re free. Both of us have the precise same amount of information and expertise to deliver, at this point... (1/2)
1339640736183181312 2020-12-18 02:36:55 +0800 <701007> JPod con’d.: ...this ranks among the dumbest since, “you don’t have to wear a mask...” Noah: That was the Platonic ideal of the noble lie. JPod: And so is this. (😆 at JPod’s delivery here.) about 2:00 in... (2/2)
1339640613025800192 2020-12-18 02:36:26 +0800 <701007> JPod (referring to Gupta’s MSNBC vaccine take): So, let me just say, that this is, in a year of dumb, counterproductive, stupid...and discrediting and delegitimizing spins being offered by the public health community...”  (1/2)

1334591131259187201 2020-12-04 04:11:35 +0800 <701007> “And yet, the analysts forge ahead, issuing new, far-reaching predictions even as they wade through a hip-deep morass of flawed and discarded forecasts.”

1332427062028759045 2020-11-28 04:52:21 +0800 <701007> 😂  Guys, went to YT today a bit ago and saw this vid up and...it’s funny and generally awesome, much like Ben himself...💛   https://t.co/w9BvRKHr3M

1332134330546737152 2020-11-27 09:29:08 +0800 <701007> ...He’s also fun and hilarious and he makes me laugh more than anyone on here...he’s like a big, beautiful ray of sunlight on this site and in the political realm. Irreplaceable.
1332134235302408192 2020-11-27 09:28:46 +0800 <701007> ...last, but not least, there’s Ben...smart, funny, kind and strong. I admire him immensely. I admire that he is himself and strives to do right in a world where everyone is pressured to cave to the status quo ‘morals’...
1332133999951667205 2020-11-27 09:27:50 +0800 <701007> ...there’s also AG, and Dan (aka baseballcrank), and JeffB (and his love of, and delight in, music), who share their legal knowledge and are again, I cannot stress the importance of this enough, honest and good people...
1332133782422515713 2020-11-27 09:26:58 +0800 <701007> ...people like the wonderful JPod and Christine and Abe, who are a delight to listen to and add so much to people’s lives without realizing it, not only with their knowledge, but they’re such good-hearted people—it makes a difference...
1332133666831667201 2020-11-27 09:26:30 +0800 <701007> ...people like the amazing Noah and Jonah—stable, principled, honest, gifted writers &amp; men...
1332133450913107976 2020-11-27 09:25:39 +0800 <701007> I’m also thankful for intelligent, honest, fair and decent people who share their gifts with us and use them to make the world better...people like Pradheep and Matthias, who have been such a blessing during this pandemic...
1332133323171356674 2020-11-27 09:25:08 +0800 <701007> I’m thankful for people with truly kind hearts and beautiful spirits of which there are far more than most people notice...
1332133033428848640 2020-11-27 09:23:59 +0800 <701007> I’m thankful to be able to rest and trust in someone wiser than anyone (God), someone who is the highest good and loves us all equally...he is the perfect provider and protector...
1332132914818134017 2020-11-27 09:23:31 +0800 <701007> ...for science and scientific advances and the grace from above that made two mRNA vaccines available this year (in an astonishing amount of time) with around 95% efficacy...
1332132843682738176 2020-11-27 09:23:14 +0800 <701007> ...I’m thankful for peace, and innocence and joy...for fresh hot and cold running water in plentiful supply, of good food to eat and a wide variety of it...for a lovely, perfect home, for a bed to sleep in at night, for the sound and feel of rain...
1332132532901523467 2020-11-27 09:22:00 +0800 <701007> I am personally thankful for living in one of the best countries that ever existed. I’m thankful for the astonishing beauty I see all around me everyday...

1332101711234797571 2020-11-27 07:19:31 +0800 <701007> Ahaha
1332101656004222976 2020-11-27 07:19:18 +0800 <701007> Some of the better responses to the ‘unthanksgiving’ thread...  But seriously, how do they not hear themselves and realize how sanctimonious and off-putting they are...?
1331816550966374400 2020-11-26 12:26:24 +0800 <701007> Too many tweets to fully catch up...  Hope you beautiful tweeps have a wonderful, blessed Thanksgiving. Even during 2020 &amp; this wretched pandemic, there’s so much to be grateful for...  😌💛💛
1331809527918977026 2020-11-26 11:58:29 +0800 <701007> Haha

1331445985009160192 2020-11-25 11:53:54 +0800 <701007> Yes.
1331429485917462529 2020-11-25 10:48:20 +0800 <701007> X2...
1331424885361545228 2020-11-25 10:30:04 +0800 <701007> This is just embarrassing, tbh...
1331390672612552704 2020-11-25 08:14:07 +0800 <701007> Ugh...
1331390237893914624 2020-11-25 08:12:23 +0800 <701007> MTE...

1329271666422280194 2020-11-19 11:53:56 +0800 <701007> Goodnight, my lovely tweeps...hope everyone has a good day tomorrow. 💛😌
1329271462113538048 2020-11-19 11:53:07 +0800 <701007> One of my faves, two, actually—Ella &amp; Irving:  https://t.co/tQvuY7PVQR
1329268373138657280 2020-11-19 11:40:51 +0800 <701007> Thoroughly enjoyable read, though, I’ll admit, I’m a bigger fan of Irving than Cole...  “Yet he continued to produce songs of undiminished brilliance—he actually claimed to have written part of “At Long Last Love” while waiting for help to arrive after his accident...”  https://t.co/LaTukJFEEH

1329223359415148546 2020-11-19 08:41:59 +0800 <701007> Excellent stuff here: “But I’ll leave it here: The world is more complex—and in many ways, much better—than the tales of woe many of us are wallowing in.”  https://t.co/PYCrGjU51R
1329184597247225864 2020-11-19 06:07:57 +0800 <701007> Great thread here...
1329183620603449346 2020-11-19 06:04:04 +0800 <701007> Exactly.
1329183345671073792 2020-11-19 06:02:59 +0800 <701007> Ugh...
1329180058196582401 2020-11-19 05:49:55 +0800 <701007> This.
1329173018657116167 2020-11-19 05:21:57 +0800 <701007> Ahaha💛
1329160283991007242 2020-11-19 04:31:20 +0800 <701007> This.
1329158277847011331 2020-11-19 04:23:22 +0800 <701007> This is the proper response...
1329158201581899778 2020-11-19 04:23:04 +0800 <701007> People who care this much about power (to where they’re willing to rob others of their votes) do not deserve to gain or wield it.
1329158152496025602 2020-11-19 04:22:52 +0800 <701007> Also, there’s the Ga. senate seats to think of. While some Republicans are busy not accepting the results of the election (only the presidential part, of course, they accept the wins down ballot), they’re making themselves look as crazy as the Dems did these past four years.
1329157901752164353 2020-11-19 04:21:52 +0800 <701007> What do you think centrists (on both sides), and independents, think about your side when you’re going along with Trump to try to disenfranchise voters to keep power? It‘s immoral. And if it keeps up down this road, it will lead to a backlash for Republicans, too.
1329157336208912384 2020-11-19 04:19:38 +0800 <701007> They misread how many people *weren’t* along for the ride, and got hit with a well-deserved backlash for planning ways to usurp our democracy and grab power and entrench that power for themselves for the foreseeable future.   Now they are paying.
1329157252671008771 2020-11-19 04:19:18 +0800 <701007> It’s just sad at this point, and, more importantly, damaging to Republicans. The reason they did so well in the house and the senate, and perhaps the legislatures too, is because the Dems were drunk on the prospect of likely gaining more power than they already had.
1328881074118807554 2020-11-18 10:01:52 +0800 <701007> Kinda awesome, tbh...
1328877141832949773 2020-11-18 09:46:14 +0800 <701007> Ahaha
1328877065127473157 2020-11-18 09:45:56 +0800 <701007> Adorbs...
1328783265877127169 2020-11-18 03:33:12 +0800 <701007> It’s true...
1328782521660821505 2020-11-18 03:30:15 +0800 <701007> New Pradheep avi pic too...with Yoda, no less... 👍
1328779505004138498 2020-11-18 03:18:16 +0800 <701007> New avatar pics on both Noah and Abe...Noah’s is better, less fuzzy, looks relaxed and like he’s in a place like sun-splashed Italy (probs not, but...)  ...and Abe—wow! I always imagined him with dark brown hair. He reminds me a bit of Benedict Cumberbatch. Very nice eyes...
1328778055427514383 2020-11-18 03:12:30 +0800 <701007> Ahaha
1328153204379578370 2020-11-16 09:49:34 +0800 <701007> Now this:  https://t.co/kfvFqDN52Y  Ray Charles kinda night...😌
1328149441656795136 2020-11-16 09:34:37 +0800 <701007> For some reason, this song is stuck in my head rn...  Classic:  https://t.co/RlDKWWN8lj
1328148286105153536 2020-11-16 09:30:01 +0800 <701007> Haha
1325870047173218310 2020-11-10 02:37:07 +0800 <701007> 😂
1325869794306961409 2020-11-10 02:36:07 +0800 <701007> Ahaha
1325869039638507521 2020-11-10 02:33:07 +0800 <701007> ... and it needs to be prominent Dems, not just Biden tossing a few words like unity around...but it takes a lot of strength to kill pride and be honest about how your hurt others, so, what are the odds...?
1325869013126275076 2020-11-10 02:33:00 +0800 <701007> Until they face up to how they continuously demonize the other half of the country, apologize, and behave better, it will be hard to have any true reconciliation...
1325864802468638724 2020-11-10 02:16:16 +0800 <701007> It’s amazing how some people think they speak for great masses of people. How arrogant.   Also, Jonah is, undoubtedly, one of the most principled, strong (of spirit and integrity) and intelligent conservatives I’ve seen around...
1325860735944187904 2020-11-10 02:00:07 +0800 <701007> Timely...
1325859601162579969 2020-11-10 01:55:36 +0800 <701007> Sounds good!
1325844212718465029 2020-11-10 00:54:27 +0800 <701007> And leftists predicted the market would crash when Trump was elected in 2016...neither happened and both were irresponsible, terribly selfish wish-casting.  The MSM and Trump deserved each other; they are so much alike in many ways...
1325823687333974017 2020-11-09 23:32:54 +0800 <701007> Yep.
1325822566125219841 2020-11-09 23:28:27 +0800 <701007> Between this sort of article, the pathetic Guy Fawkes Day bungle, and trying to claim the jump in the stock market today, quite obviously because of the Pfizer/BioNTech news of a vaccine, is because of Biden...is embarrassingly transparent and sad, tbh...
1325822285492654083 2020-11-09 23:27:20 +0800 <701007> And that’s their right, but... leftists look desperate trying to make it seem like more people are excited about Biden than there really are, out some sort of need for validation...
1325821001469407241 2020-11-09 23:22:13 +0800 <701007> Really like Bourla...have read a bit about him and about Pfizer’s and BioNTech’s coming together for this vaccine, and the creative process Bourla instituted at Pfizer for this. He seems like a highly intelligent, creative man...
1325819869674270723 2020-11-09 23:17:44 +0800 <701007> What would I have done during this pandemic without wonderful, pragmatic, knowledgeable people like Matt and Pradheep for honest, non-politicized data...? I’m so grateful for good guys like these two...
1325818774486921217 2020-11-09 23:13:23 +0800 <701007> You have GOT to be kidding me! I seriously hope there’s some sort of context missing here...
1325817993473961986 2020-11-09 23:10:16 +0800 <701007> DeSantis would be great...and I’m a big Haley fan...
1325815907042680836 2020-11-09 23:01:59 +0800 <701007> Well, I’d take Scott Walker...he was my second choice in 2016...  Sucks about Rubio...
1325814718355951617 2020-11-09 22:57:15 +0800 <701007> I hadn’t seen this...
1325814028267089921 2020-11-09 22:54:31 +0800 <701007> Well, that sucks...I didn’t know this...

1325500623912099843 2020-11-09 02:09:10 +0800 <701007> Insane.

1324507250237517826 2020-11-06 08:21:51 +0800 <701007> Good.
1324506825606221826 2020-11-06 08:20:10 +0800 <701007> I’m not gonna miss it...this election turned out perfectly, Biden, but with very little power...
1324499086180057088 2020-11-06 07:49:24 +0800 <701007> I was thinking of him just last night...hope he wins!
1324497209107374081 2020-11-06 07:41:57 +0800 <701007> Exactly this.
1324493381238689792 2020-11-06 07:26:44 +0800 <701007> ...and it’s repellent. I’ve seen many list-making ideas from the left aimed at taking vengeance on people who didn’t bow the knee. As petty and vengeful as I’ve seen Trump be, I suppose his son doing this isn’t surprising...this attitude should be beneath any decent Republican.

1324432721033285634 2020-11-06 03:25:42 +0800 <701007> Agree. Transparency is important, and openness...I think Biden has legitimately won this, that said, there should be no problem with answering earnest questions and worries from conservatives...

1324431355455963136 2020-11-06 03:20:16 +0800 <701007> ... but it also helps that they’re careful to ask questions without jumping to conspiracy theories or accusing anyone of wrongdoing (which is something they’d want for themselves), look for honest answers, and accept them when they’re given... (2/2)
1324431151755350022 2020-11-06 03:19:27 +0800 <701007> This is true too. I can understand their worry, after what I’ve witnessed the past few years, and people being understanding about it helps... (1/2)

1323746987406184454 2020-11-04 06:00:50 +0800 <701007> JPod talking about being a presidential speech writer...💛
1323744302632230914 2020-11-04 05:50:10 +0800 <701007> Relaxing and listening to the “Commentary” podcast rn...💛😌
1323738464853045252 2020-11-04 05:26:58 +0800 <701007> Ahaha perfect...
1323726583413248000 2020-11-04 04:39:45 +0800 <701007> Though meant as an insult, it’s true, tbh...he is quite clever, and very witty...
1323718783777689600 2020-11-04 04:08:46 +0800 <701007> Haha
1323712373975298049 2020-11-04 03:43:17 +0800 <701007> Super cheesy, but...I think you’re probably right...
1323711794121187328 2020-11-04 03:40:59 +0800 <701007> Wow. This is actually not “completely normal”...

1323393582062063616 2020-11-03 06:36:32 +0800 <701007> Meanwhile, tried to read Noah’s &amp; Christine’s new articles and having trouble with the site for some reason...
1323393219569266692 2020-11-03 06:35:05 +0800 <701007> So, yeah, I capped the whole article—it’s that good...  Again: Jonah &amp; Noah, the two best political writers I follow...and there are a lot of good ones out there. I’m not trying to diminish them. But these two—the best.  https://t.co/7I9RHktFB5
1323387449914101760 2020-11-03 06:12:10 +0800 <701007> They’re cute...
1323386994580402176 2020-11-03 06:10:21 +0800 <701007> The John Mulaney monologue JPod refers to:  https://t.co/CSaD4KAaP8
1323383319359344641 2020-11-03 05:55:45 +0800 <701007> Abe’s got it right about the fallout from Nate Silver’s tweet last night—they’re angry because they use him to comfort themselves...
1323377006885720065 2020-11-03 05:30:40 +0800 <701007> Followed by an excellent point by JPod about generic Rs and Ds getting votes because of the polarized world we’re living in rn...
1323376360715407366 2020-11-03 05:28:06 +0800 <701007> Reminds me of some anecdotal shares on Twitter from people who said that after Trump contracted Corona that the people they saw around them that were going to grit and vote for Trump, or enthusiastically do so, had visibly dampened in their determination...
1323376296257298432 2020-11-03 05:27:50 +0800 <701007> At about 17:45 Christine on the enthusiasm gap, and speaking of the Trump trains this weekend and how the media covers them, but also talking about how annoying they are no matter who you’re voting for—agree on all of this...
1323374299407929349 2020-11-03 05:19:54 +0800 <701007> About 17 min. in, JPod doing an excellent grim-state-of-the-race for Trump encapsulation here...

1323369375769001990 2020-11-03 05:00:20 +0800 <701007> Christine on being surprised, upon listening to the podcast (she wasn’t in it at the time), at the lessons MSM and the left hasn’t learned...how they treat the Trump voter...
1323367515108581378 2020-11-03 04:52:57 +0800 <701007> I like that Noah was willing to go back and listen to the pre-2016 election podcast, even though he thought it might be an exercise in self-flagellation. I respect and admire it when people are strong enough to search for and face the truth.   Jonah is like this...
1323364602818822147 2020-11-03 04:41:22 +0800 <701007> Thank God JPod needs a cathartic, non-Twitter venue...
1323364046477942785 2020-11-03 04:39:10 +0800 <701007> Aw man! “Commentary” is doing a live blog too!  Ben or the gang—how do I choose? 😭😭😭  Now all I need is for Jonah to do the same and make it even more difficult...  Guess I’ll try to toggle back and forth...*sigh*
1323361545154404363 2020-11-03 04:29:13 +0800 <701007> Almost done with Ben...  LOLing rn at his joke on Amazon editors picking Cuomo’s book as one of the best of the year and how the title should’ve been, “If I Did It”.

1323341606825660416 2020-11-03 03:10:00 +0800 <701007> Ben illustrating the point right now with examples...
1323341278604648448 2020-11-03 03:08:41 +0800 <701007> Also, “Uh, no, that is not how he’s gonna govern.” Totally agree. And he’s contradicted himself on this many times...he will be a leftist for leftists. He will not be a centrist (nor is he) and not a unifier (see: all the comments/insults he’s made about the other side...)
1323340265902493697 2020-11-03 03:04:40 +0800 <701007> LOL @ about 19:30 in...also, Ben is just on point with the bulwark thing (and much more)...
1323331910416896000 2020-11-03 02:31:28 +0800 <701007> Ben talking about the data rn...quite interesting. A treat to get to listen to my favorites before Election Day...
1323331188199727106 2020-11-03 02:28:36 +0800 <701007> An interesting podcast...worth a listen.  Listening to Ben rn, then “Commentary”...  Also, definitely worth a read, Jonah’s article on the election:  https://t.co/wIt8JP2KbQ

1323308428912189442 2020-11-03 00:58:09 +0800 <701007> Though, I will say, I care more about the senate race. And things look iffy rn for the R’s keeping it. Even so,  even if the Dems gain the senate, I will keep my peace. It’s not like it’s the last election, after all. Things can be changed next time...
1323307895191195651 2020-11-03 00:56:02 +0800 <701007> I care, but will accept whatever happens...  An election matters, but it’s not everything, and I feel sorry for people who are deifying this win on either side or behaving as if whoever gains the WH will save Democracy/the US...

1323296545660424201 2020-11-03 00:10:56 +0800 <701007> “That’s what makes demagoguery come so easily to him: His only conviction is that he should be president, so he’ll say whatever it takes to get there.”   Something he and Trump share, also the prolific  lying...
1323296419730608128 2020-11-03 00:10:26 +0800 <701007> “A liberal friend of mine told me within this past year that Biden is a “purely transactional” politician.” (1/2)
1323296063885889536 2020-11-03 00:09:01 +0800 <701007> “Biden’s whole career was built on doing whatever it took to “connect” with an audience, no matter how many fibs and exaggerations and plagiarisms it took — and no matter how wrong his policy analyses were.”
1323295975574831104 2020-11-03 00:08:40 +0800 <701007> “Yes, “demagogue.” From Reagan, that’s especially strong stuff. But it’s entirely accurate.”

1323294465784688641 2020-11-03 00:02:40 +0800 <701007> I just really wonder what’s gonna happen on the FP side of things if he wins the presidency, as the odds look overwhelmingly that he might do. We’ve had a couple of indicators already that don’t look good...
1323294331512463360 2020-11-03 00:02:08 +0800 <701007> This is quite interesting. A little tidbit I was unaware of: Biden criticizing Reagan’s speech calling out Gorbachev, huh?

1320909272327344135 2020-10-27 10:04:46 +0800 <701007> Anger-inducing...
1320908249172975618 2020-10-27 10:00:42 +0800 <701007> Nice...
1320908151579938817 2020-10-27 10:00:19 +0800 <701007> *Insert eyeroll at his bitter, impotent theatrics here*
1320907773794803713 2020-10-27 09:58:49 +0800 <701007> Woo hoo! Hey, guys.😃  A historic moment occurred tonight. ACB confirmed. Undoubtedly, one of the best moments, IMO, to happen in this God-forsaken year...  😌🎉🎊👏
1320564520499224577 2020-10-26 11:14:51 +0800 <701007> Ha!
1320562880664739840 2020-10-26 11:08:20 +0800 <701007> It’s true...
1320558724445032450 2020-10-26 10:51:49 +0800 <701007> 💛🙏
1320557898435616769 2020-10-26 10:48:32 +0800 <701007> The plethora of vids showing anti-semitism abounding in NY lately, is both disgusting and sad...
1320556390465871872 2020-10-26 10:42:32 +0800 <701007> Rhetorical, btw...
1320556317619167232 2020-10-26 10:42:15 +0800 <701007> What’s the point of this...?
1320554040724459520 2020-10-26 10:33:12 +0800 <701007> Well, this is pretty awesome...
1319457041052819457 2020-10-23 09:54:07 +0800 <701007> Indisputably...
1319456607638593537 2020-10-23 09:52:24 +0800 <701007> So, a blatant lie then...
1319452171730038785 2020-10-23 09:34:46 +0800 <701007> Haha
1319449733010755586 2020-10-23 09:25:05 +0800 <701007> Yes. He had a nice line about shutting the virus down, not the country, but it was hollow if you’ve been paying attention all this time: that really isn’t the Dem’s position...
1319448970565980165 2020-10-23 09:22:03 +0800 <701007> This...
1319448653178802177 2020-10-23 09:20:47 +0800 <701007> Shocking...
1319447916856152065 2020-10-23 09:17:52 +0800 <701007> Should be good...
1319446623743770630 2020-10-23 09:12:43 +0800 <701007> Trump is his own worst enemy...
1319446512422834178 2020-10-23 09:12:17 +0800 <701007> This.   So why are they so scared and running from this? If it wasn’t while he was in office, why the fear?
1319373897058471942 2020-10-23 04:23:44 +0800 <701007> These are good and fair questions. Also, I would like to know if China has anything on the Bidens that they could use to influence his dealings with them...
1319371191648440321 2020-10-23 04:12:59 +0800 <701007> Pretty accurate here...
1319370888496775168 2020-10-23 04:11:47 +0800 <701007> Making a case for himself is definitely not a strength of his. Partly because he lacks eloquence; he’s *not* a good communicator.
1319368953970479104 2020-10-23 04:04:05 +0800 <701007> Excellent discussion on “Commentary”...about halfway through. It’ll be interesting to see how the Biden thing plays out. They make some excellent, and noteworthy, points—a constant for this podcast that makes it an asset...
1319361040208007171 2020-10-23 03:32:39 +0800 <701007> Listening to the “Commentary” podcast rn...finally, after several weeks...  Hearing JPod’s voice intro everyone is like...coming home.

1319355531992174595 2020-10-23 03:10:45 +0800 <701007> “... I am the recipient of the email published seven days ago by the ‘New York Post’ which showed a copy to Hunter Biden and Rob Walker. That email is genuine.” (2/2)
1319355424324407298 2020-10-23 03:10:20 +0800 <701007> “My name is Tony Bobulinski. The facts set forth below are true and accurate; they are not any form of domestic or foreign disinformation. Any suggestion to the contrary is false and offensive...” (1/2)

1319351218968342528 2020-10-23 02:53:37 +0800 <701007> He really doesn’t seem to understand women well, does he...?
1319341194216935433 2020-10-23 02:13:47 +0800 <701007> It was smart to release it and show the bias, but, also, this too...
1319340369960632321 2020-10-23 02:10:31 +0800 <701007> Every word of this thread is right on the mark...💛
1319337721224138752 2020-10-23 01:59:59 +0800 <701007> This.
1319336227380858880 2020-10-23 01:54:03 +0800 <701007> Ahaha
1319333916399067136 2020-10-23 01:44:52 +0800 <701007> Good article by Dan on the possibility of courtpacking...  https://t.co/zVbaJ0tXim
1319319490904133635 2020-10-23 00:47:33 +0800 <701007> Yes.
1319318513052504067 2020-10-23 00:43:39 +0800 <701007> So...court packing seems likely, and Biden will more than likely go along. Perhaps I’m wrong, but...I find that looking at people’s continual past behavior gives a very good indication of what they will do in similar circumstances in the future...
1319318498552778758 2020-10-23 00:43:36 +0800 <701007> To me, though he left it open, I feel he will go along with the pressure to do so. He has a long history of going along, and has changed actual stated positions when pressed to do so from the Dems. And they’re gung ho about it.
1319317165250588673 2020-10-23 00:38:18 +0800 <701007> Should be a good one! And I think I have time to listen. Pretty happy to hear JPod and the gang’s reactions to the news on this...
1319308897891635200 2020-10-23 00:05:27 +0800 <701007> Very much this...
1319307020269461504 2020-10-22 23:57:59 +0800 <701007> This. I want to know if Joe was involved in this. It looks likely, given Tony Bobulinski’s statement that he knew...  He’s campaigning to be president, and the voters deserve, and need, to know...
1319305719317975047 2020-10-22 23:52:49 +0800 <701007> Unsurprisingly...
1319305005124431878 2020-10-22 23:49:59 +0800 <701007> Statement by Tony Bobulinski:  https://t.co/8jwZP6YXsd

1318647291943804938 2020-10-21 04:16:28 +0800 <701007> Great read written by the wonderful, intelligent and highly observant Noah...💛  https://t.co/ezaPey9zZg
1318645090605289474 2020-10-21 04:07:43 +0800 <701007> “Unlike devoted and unpersuadable partisans, voters do not see the Supreme Court as just another stage on which the drama of electoral politics plays itself out. And the more the public got a closer look at Barrett, the more they warmed to her.”  So true...
1318642003308171268 2020-10-21 03:55:27 +0800 <701007> Ahaha
1318639876217196544 2020-10-21 03:47:00 +0800 <701007> Sending a virtual hug to Pradheep today...
1318637065161134086 2020-10-21 03:35:50 +0800 <701007> Most of these going against norms (making DC a state, getting rid of the filibuster and electoral college, etc.) conversations were happening far before this.   Ben is right, the left has lost its mind...
1318636862278389762 2020-10-21 03:35:01 +0800 <701007> I mean, they were talking about it before the vacancy opened, etc., this was just a more (seemingly) solid excuse—vengeance...
1318635795230720000 2020-10-21 03:30:47 +0800 <701007> 🤢  🤢🤢🤢🤢 ...
1318634076694339584 2020-10-21 03:23:57 +0800 <701007> Haha
1318362302324813831 2020-10-20 09:24:01 +0800 <701007> Ben makes a lot of great points here (no surprise there). And it’s arguable 1 &amp; 3 are the most important...but 2 does hurt him a lot, and continues to constantly do so. His character flaws are quite repellent.
1318357964395261952 2020-10-20 09:06:47 +0800 <701007> Haha perfect...

1318339076056121344 2020-10-20 07:51:43 +0800 <701007> So, umm, this sample is pretty cool. I bet their yard is awesome...
1318338666444558338 2020-10-20 07:50:06 +0800 <701007> Ahaha
1318338525239169027 2020-10-20 07:49:32 +0800 <701007> Hear, hear! 👏
1318291228639846405 2020-10-20 04:41:36 +0800 <701007> Welp...

1318272617183432714 2020-10-20 03:27:38 +0800 <701007> This...
1318270572640587776 2020-10-20 03:19:31 +0800 <701007> Ahaha
1318269526455234567 2020-10-20 03:15:22 +0800 <701007> OMG...
1318269052293447681 2020-10-20 03:13:28 +0800 <701007> Yes.
1318265617431121926 2020-10-20 02:59:50 +0800 <701007> As usual...
1318264520121384964 2020-10-20 02:55:28 +0800 <701007> This would be nice...
1318263754350526464 2020-10-20 02:52:25 +0800 <701007> I think there’s a truth to this...
1318263595248062466 2020-10-20 02:51:47 +0800 <701007> I wonder how far we’re gonna have to fall, in America, to see some earnest, substantive change for the better...?
1318263134323355649 2020-10-20 02:49:58 +0800 <701007> Astonishingly irresponsible that so many Dems have been impugning the coming vaccine—and especially, that they’re still doing it...
1318262582197846016 2020-10-20 02:47:46 +0800 <701007> SMH...
1318262435518795779 2020-10-20 02:47:11 +0800 <701007> I would add also, creepy also, with whiffs of totalitarianism...
1318262142328557574 2020-10-20 02:46:01 +0800 <701007> Two happy tweets in a row. This is pleasant. Again, Ben usually always makes the day brighter...
1318261986556260354 2020-10-20 02:45:24 +0800 <701007> 💛 this...
1318261542413045767 2020-10-20 02:43:38 +0800 <701007> Also miss Pradheep, the awesome Ben, my wonderful Jonah, AG, et al.
1318261310463873024 2020-10-20 02:42:43 +0800 <701007> I miss listening to the gang...a group of generally interesting and lovely people...  Hoping to have time tomorrow, since I’m finally seeing some daylight... 💛😌
1318260910398623746 2020-10-20 02:41:07 +0800 <701007> This. I’m not voting for either of them, and very much this...
1314685881115176960 2020-10-10 05:55:14 +0800 <701007> Fingers crossed, next week will be better.   Sincerely hope all my wonderful tweeps have a great, relaxing weekend...   Take care... 💛😌
1314685596510703618 2020-10-10 05:54:06 +0800 <701007> It’s been a busy three weeks. I miss all my favorite podcasts/shows... The last one I got to listen to was part of Ben’s show after the Trump-Biden debate (which had a perfectly hilarious open, btw), and a piece of Guy’s show, where he had a discussion with Jonah.
1314684737919897601 2020-10-10 05:50:41 +0800 <701007> Ahaha 💛 Ben is absolutely the best. He really can brighten any day...
1314683011259138048 2020-10-10 05:43:50 +0800 <701007> 😆
1314667563054510082 2020-10-10 04:42:27 +0800 <701007> Nothing crazy about this... 🤷🏼‍♀️
1314666439450730496 2020-10-10 04:37:59 +0800 <701007> Pretty much absolutely disgusting...
1314666206482305026 2020-10-10 04:37:03 +0800 <701007> MTE...
1314666157803216900 2020-10-10 04:36:51 +0800 <701007> Ahaha
1314665791300739072 2020-10-10 04:35:24 +0800 <701007> ...and generally horrible...
1314663956745777154 2020-10-10 04:28:07 +0800 <701007> Also, Noah and Jonah (don’t know anything about Matt, so I can’t comment on him) are wonderful, honest, intelligent and good human beings. They don’t sell-out and are staunch in their principles. Anyone who has read them for even a little while will find this easily observable.
1314663624460378112 2020-10-10 04:26:47 +0800 <701007> Uhh...apparently Jonah’s been busy today—squashing gnats...
1314662016443969536 2020-10-10 04:20:24 +0800 <701007> Just...
1314661902170173442 2020-10-10 04:19:57 +0800 <701007> So...how’s the day going for everyone? Any crazy news? Any good news (haha—yeah, I know)...  Hope everyone is doing quite well, though. 💛😌  Just gonna do quick catch up of today’s news, because it’s busy...
1314324215408009217 2020-10-09 05:58:06 +0800 <701007> This...
1314323983957929990 2020-10-09 05:57:11 +0800 <701007> Also, if he was afraid of making them mad, why did he already say he was against it three times before?
1314323968254509058 2020-10-09 05:57:07 +0800 <701007> They’d get mad at him, but they would still vote for him. In fact, they’ve already outstripped mail-in-voting at 3:1 to Republicans. How many of their votes does he already have? Plus, he would ease people’s minds and win more Independents/undecideds this way...
1314321641854337025 2020-10-09 05:47:52 +0800 <701007> Haha   Whatever it was, hope it heals quickly...
1314308016943050752 2020-10-09 04:53:44 +0800 <701007> Hard to believe otherwise, tbh...
1314306792965496832 2020-10-09 04:48:52 +0800 <701007> Very much this...
1314306495568322571 2020-10-09 04:47:41 +0800 <701007> They’ve been dodgy about several policy positions (GND, taxes, fracking, court packing, ending the filibuster, etc.), and vague, but when they get in office, they’ll assume they have a mandate...  What will everyone do then?
1314259202001580036 2020-10-09 01:39:46 +0800 <701007> You behave as if you are omniscient and, therefore, fit to judge everyone. Just because a man thought she lost, doesn’t mean they were wrong or that they did so for any nefarious reason.   Pride is an impediment, to yourself and those around you.
1314259161656496128 2020-10-09 01:39:36 +0800 <701007> Secondly, for you to proclaim this means that you have the god-like capacity to measure all women’s debating abilities everywhere, and also to know all outcomes that might happen in the context and are fit to declare that no one could’ve done better.
1314259123396108289 2020-10-09 01:39:27 +0800 <701007> This assumes that Kamala is the best debater of all women anywhere. Think about that for a minute.
1314258800170414082 2020-10-09 01:38:10 +0800 <701007> This is utterly ridiculous.
1314254828378509314 2020-10-09 01:22:23 +0800 <701007> Ahaha
1314252524724117506 2020-10-09 01:13:14 +0800 <701007> This.
1314251941208379396 2020-10-09 01:10:55 +0800 <701007> And it undercuts women, makes them seem like they’re weaker than men in debating, always at a disadvantage—which, I can tell you from experience, is not true. This is just insulting and contradictory behavior from the party that is supposed to be pro-female advancement.
1314251925039255552 2020-10-09 01:10:51 +0800 <701007> Trying to make women scared of men who interrupt them in a debate, or misuse the word ‘mansplaining’ is just a bunch of BS.
1314251794323734531 2020-10-09 01:10:20 +0800 <701007> It really is. It’s obvious they’re just trying to bail her out. She lost fair and square. Going into this debate, many people pointed out that she wasn’t as good at this as Pence, which she proved while running for the Dem nomination for president.
1314250100806488065 2020-10-09 01:03:36 +0800 <701007> To put a finer point on it, they don’t care who kills norms, unless it goes against something they want. Getting what they want is what matters, talking about norms is just a tool for them. Seems to be nothing more, at this point...
1314063965635436544 2020-10-08 12:43:58 +0800 <701007> 💛
1314063940213772288 2020-10-08 12:43:52 +0800 <701007> Haha
1314048735131963392 2020-10-08 11:43:26 +0800 <701007> Yes. Being good at debating people has nothing to do with gender...to use this to try to bail out her performance is just sad and wrong.
1314047823877373952 2020-10-08 11:39:49 +0800 <701007> This, so much...
1314047769284411394 2020-10-08 11:39:36 +0800 <701007> This is just insulting and embarrassing...either she’s a good debater, or not.
1314042934707224576 2020-10-08 11:20:24 +0800 <701007> Quite sexist...

1313944454160678912 2020-10-08 04:49:04 +0800 <701007> Greatest movie of all time? Nah. But definitely one worth trying...
1313940193909637121 2020-10-08 04:32:08 +0800 <701007> This.
1313935348574179329 2020-10-08 04:12:53 +0800 <701007> Huh...
1313934144267747333 2020-10-08 04:08:06 +0800 <701007> Sounds good to me...
1313934060905996294 2020-10-08 04:07:46 +0800 <701007> Platonic.   Or...not used often enough? And does it qualify for the ‘totally eclipse’ measure? Meh...first word that comes to mind...
1313931174859997184 2020-10-08 03:56:18 +0800 <701007> And I don’t even believe *this* promise, tbh...
1313930866683453442 2020-10-08 03:55:04 +0800 <701007> Sweet...about the Master’s in Immunology...
1313930575384903680 2020-10-08 03:53:55 +0800 <701007> Not my favorite (IDEK what that would be, tbh—too much good music out there), but a quite old one that comes to mind is Kyu Sakamoto’s “Sukiyaki”...
1313929245656313858 2020-10-08 03:48:38 +0800 <701007> Pin-worthy tweet...
1313923609212129285 2020-10-08 03:26:14 +0800 <701007> Trump has bungled it, no doubt, but they manifestly had no care for their fellow countrymen, and they have made that apparent: wishing for economic crash, disaster, plague, death on people—all for the power they feel entitled to even more than they did in 2016...
1313923519315693569 2020-10-08 03:25:53 +0800 <701007> And anyone who doesn’t think many on the left in prominent positions felt this way weren’t paying attention to them hoping for months for a Katrina-like event for Trump. And then, when Covid struck, hoping this was it.

1313574695573356551 2020-10-07 04:19:47 +0800 <701007> At this point I feel like Homer is president...  I mean, if there’s a rake to be found, he’ll find it and step on it...

1313558214634541057 2020-10-07 03:14:17 +0800 <701007> Perfect.
1313557671035965441 2020-10-07 03:12:08 +0800 <701007> They like to throw this word around because of the way it makes them feel, but it seems very few on the left, in governmental leadership roles, actually respect science or understand what it is at its core...
1313548732110118914 2020-10-07 02:36:36 +0800 <701007> You have *got* to be kidding me...

1312102934637801473 2020-10-03 02:51:31 +0800 <701007> She is truly a piece of work.   Her fellow citizens, whom she was elected to serve, are suffering in many ways from the effects of a horrid pandemic and resultant economic shutdown, and she has made it very clear by now that she couldn’t care less about them.
1312101029052248065 2020-10-03 02:43:57 +0800 <701007> Oh man! 🙏

1312094693786710017 2020-10-03 02:18:47 +0800 <701007> Too short to screen cap, but a good point here...

1310305642884849666 2020-09-28 03:49:44 +0800 <701007> An excellent special Sunday “Commentary” podcast today...  So happy they decided to do it.😌
1310298443789860866 2020-09-28 03:21:07 +0800 <701007> JPod and Christine on the tweet she referenced earlier by Ibram X. Kendi...yes.
1310295518992642049 2020-09-28 03:09:30 +0800 <701007> “I’ll be shocked to see a politician cede a microphone.” — Noah  Okay, LOL’d at that...
1310293413053566979 2020-09-28 03:01:08 +0800 <701007> The second wave Pradheep, for one, has been talking about...
1310291969705418755 2020-09-28 02:55:24 +0800 <701007> Love, love, love what JPod says about what is there to dislike, and especially, Christine saying to ‘bring it’ about Barrett vs. Harris (at about 25:50)...
1310291777878929408 2020-09-28 02:54:38 +0800 <701007> Noah’s making a good point about how Kavanaugh was a literal choir boy and the Dems made him out to be a secret sociopath during his confirmation hearings...
1310287065473581058 2020-09-28 02:35:55 +0800 <701007> Excellent question by JPod at 12:18...
1310286112217280516 2020-09-28 02:32:07 +0800 <701007> I know I definitely am not...
1310285229966471169 2020-09-28 02:28:37 +0800 <701007> Only Dems get to use initials...
1310284941142437889 2020-09-28 02:27:28 +0800 <701007> Chris Wallace is an excellent journalist—period.
1310284609633038336 2020-09-28 02:26:09 +0800 <701007> Not good...
1310284380762525696 2020-09-28 02:25:14 +0800 <701007> JPod makes a great point about how liberalism is leaning ever more heavily into secularism and isn’t really fond of any serious religion, such as Orthodox Judaism, Catholicism or Protestantism...
1310281036669091847 2020-09-28 02:11:57 +0800 <701007> What is it with these people and the Nazi/Holocaust comparisons?
1310279958506463232 2020-09-28 02:07:40 +0800 <701007> Listening to the podcast before I finish catching up, but, how wonderful it is to hear these voices again! And Christine and JPod just capture perfectly the ceremony yesterday...
1310270210725810176 2020-09-28 01:28:56 +0800 <701007> Ahaha
1310270062826323970 2020-09-28 01:28:21 +0800 <701007> Woo hoo!💛
1310269459463012353 2020-09-28 01:25:57 +0800 <701007> Ahaha
1310269041702055938 2020-09-28 01:24:17 +0800 <701007> So many things to say about this insipid line of attack...
1310268530361851904 2020-09-28 01:22:15 +0800 <701007> See the appallingly repellent attacks have already started...  *sigh*
1310267954114813957 2020-09-28 01:19:58 +0800 <701007> I’m going with door number two, Alex...
1310267529475100673 2020-09-28 01:18:17 +0800 <701007> Pretty much...
1310267226835111938 2020-09-28 01:17:05 +0800 <701007> Welp...
1310266159908950022 2020-09-28 01:12:50 +0800 <701007> Haha
1310265665396314114 2020-09-28 01:10:52 +0800 <701007> Also can’t wait till tomorrow to (hopefully) get to hear the tremendous JPod (who I could listen to talking and telling stories for hours at a a time), the insightful Christine and, last, but not least, the absolutely irreplaceable Abe).   They have been sorely missed.
1310265619246440451 2020-09-28 01:10:41 +0800 <701007> ...the smart, and lovely-spirited, Matthias, the beautiful and kind Mollie and remarkable David.
1310265543031693313 2020-09-28 01:10:23 +0800 <701007> And so happy to get to read some of my absolute favorite peeps again: my spirit animal, the wise &amp; wonderful AG Hamilton, the magnificent Pradheep, the superb &amp; inimitable Jonah, the outstanding perfection that is Noah, the handsome, witty Ben [who is my other spirit animal]...
1310265199534972928 2020-09-28 01:09:01 +0800 <701007> Happy that ACB was picked (even though I would’ve liked Lagoa, a lot—ACB is an awesome pick).   About to dive in and catch up today, but hope all my lovely tweeps are doing well. 💛
1310265126201819143 2020-09-28 01:08:44 +0800 <701007> Ugh...have even sick since Tuesday of last week (an inner ear thing). And, boy, have I missed all of my most favorite tweeps...and I feel so behind on most of the news. 😭
1308580403792547840 2020-09-23 09:34:15 +0800 <701007> These people seriously need a mirror...
1308506565306183680 2020-09-23 04:40:50 +0800 <701007> This is hilarious. If she had ever been truly conservative, or even moderate, she would understand what conservatives feel about this. But no.  While Harris is telegenic, what she will more than likely do in this will make her look bad. Also, ‘extremist?’ Really?
1308505054781923328 2020-09-23 04:34:50 +0800 <701007> 💛
1308502031741657092 2020-09-23 04:22:49 +0800 <701007> Nothing crazy about this...
1308499362536882177 2020-09-23 04:12:13 +0800 <701007> Haven’t seen this...pretty powerful though...
1308484951353053184 2020-09-23 03:14:57 +0800 <701007> The rest of a good piece from Noah:  https://t.co/RrGNFes05s

1308482545424662529 2020-09-23 03:05:23 +0800 <701007> Nothing creepy about this...
1308182986559492096 2020-09-22 07:15:03 +0800 <701007> Haha
1308156996206702594 2020-09-22 05:31:46 +0800 <701007> Matt has a good point, after all I’ve seen the Dems do, I wouldn’t trust them to keep this bargain, but something like what he suggested here would work...
1308155749521121287 2020-09-22 05:26:49 +0800 <701007> Haha 💛
1308155670928207876 2020-09-22 05:26:30 +0800 <701007> Didn’t know Pradheep suggested something similar...?   One reason why he’s a great follow, level-headed, knowledgeable, fair, and a good man...
1308155162914152451 2020-09-22 05:24:29 +0800 <701007> The (coughing) intro alone makes you want to read it, haha, but it’s a really good piece from earlier, a la, the great Noah:

1308152038799429634 2020-09-22 05:12:04 +0800 <701007> Another gem: “...but deploying ludicrous pseudo-Talmudic reasoning as a debating justification is the oldest game in the book. (The Talmud is pretty old.)”
1308151286907506695 2020-09-22 05:09:05 +0800 <701007> “It was innovated by Teddy Kennedy, who dragged Robert Bork through the mud in 1987 (having already drowned someone in shallow waters in 1969, he knew something about it)...”  OMG, haha...
1308149779650707460 2020-09-22 05:03:06 +0800 <701007> A new JPod piece? Yes!
1308149616957894656 2020-09-22 05:02:27 +0800 <701007> It is...actually, it’s my favorite, on this subject, I’ve read today...and I’ve read several good pieces:  https://t.co/GmQcWp921k
1308137644845662209 2020-09-22 04:14:53 +0800 <701007> Ahaha
1308130014861438977 2020-09-22 03:44:34 +0800 <701007> Like this—a lot:
1308127731587178498 2020-09-22 03:35:29 +0800 <701007> Uh...yikes...
1308125485566767105 2020-09-22 03:26:34 +0800 <701007> “My best friend is named Norm.” Ahaha
1308123434103181312 2020-09-22 03:18:25 +0800 <701007> 💛
1308122167171784707 2020-09-22 03:13:23 +0800 <701007> Tweet of the day.
1308120543514759172 2020-09-22 03:06:55 +0800 <701007> This.
1308120307333509127 2020-09-22 03:05:59 +0800 <701007> Worth a read, on Lagoa:
1308115601680936963 2020-09-22 02:47:17 +0800 <701007> I like this nomination, tbh...

1308108624892395521 2020-09-22 02:19:34 +0800 <701007> Also, yes:
1308108545896972291 2020-09-22 02:19:15 +0800 <701007> This, too.
1308108512975781888 2020-09-22 02:19:07 +0800 <701007> This.
1308107361874214912 2020-09-22 02:14:33 +0800 <701007> LOL

1308105853992607746 2020-09-22 02:08:33 +0800 <701007> This.

1308102859041497097 2020-09-22 01:56:39 +0800 <701007> “Ultimately, the vacancy also helps Trump because the Republican Party is never more unified than during a Supreme Court confirmation battle.”  Has this proven true—not just in Kavanaugh’s case?
1308100192806342657 2020-09-22 01:46:03 +0800 <701007> Also, I like this selection the best:  https://t.co/BcgwgXEMeD
1308100117745070082 2020-09-22 01:45:46 +0800 <701007> For those of you out there who haven’t subscribed to “The Dispatch,” yet, or who haven’t made it a part of your daily reading routine—you should. If you want sane, knowledgeable, independent thinking, this is the place. And Jonah, is one of the best political writers out there.
1308100095062179840 2020-09-22 01:45:40 +0800 <701007> This is an excellent, and refreshing (in all the madness) piece.
1308086757670432770 2020-09-22 00:52:40 +0800 <701007> We need more of this in our lives...
1308086634760613891 2020-09-22 00:52:11 +0800 <701007> A joke...for so many reasons...
1308086249207533569 2020-09-22 00:50:39 +0800 <701007> With Charlie? Bring it on!💛
1308084881650577410 2020-09-22 00:45:13 +0800 <701007> This.
1308083894047125512 2020-09-22 00:41:18 +0800 <701007> No party needs the sort of power hegemony that the Dems are seeking...that’s part of what the constitution protects us from, and they are threatening it. They are worse than Trump at this point.  Congrats, Dems...
1308083317267464192 2020-09-22 00:39:00 +0800 <701007> This is insane. The Dems have really lost it...  These sort of threats actually make me think about voting for Trump—something I never thought I’d probably do. You can’t talk about killing norms and killing the electoral college, etc., and expect reasonable people to be unmoved.
1308081911009554432 2020-09-22 00:33:25 +0800 <701007> Ahaha exactly. What is this about. I mean, so is Joe, so...?  In fact, some people in 2016 were talking about how, because he re-built up his fortune, they should elect him, for the economy, which is one point he’s actually done well on...
1308079042986422273 2020-09-22 00:22:01 +0800 <701007> Wow. People have gone insane over RBG’s death. Just...
1306294861721726976 2020-09-17 02:12:19 +0800 <701007> Have an incredibly busy day today—but got onto YT just now and saw Ben’s new show up. Couldn’t resist sampling the beginning and...  When he plays “Despacito”—OMG so awesome, ahaha...  Never change, Ben...
1306068826723942400 2020-09-16 11:14:08 +0800 <701007> Okay, now I’m really done. Ciao, my beautiful tweeps...   💛😌
1306068259020644354 2020-09-16 11:11:53 +0800 <701007> GTG. I’ve been on Twitter way later than usual...  Have a lovely rest of the evening, guys...hope you get good rest! 💛😌
1306067600170909697 2020-09-16 11:09:16 +0800 <701007> He looks good. I’m not necessarily a cowboy hat fan, but he pulls it off nicely...
1306064284376608768 2020-09-16 10:56:05 +0800 <701007> Welp...

1306050278861438977 2020-09-16 10:00:26 +0800 <701007> Wow...it was that bad, huh...?
1306047423844937728 2020-09-16 09:49:05 +0800 <701007> Random thought: AG is awesome. Measured, thoughtful, intelligent responses...
1306046825972092929 2020-09-16 09:46:43 +0800 <701007> Is he okay with lying? Yes.
1306046047907651584 2020-09-16 09:43:37 +0800 <701007> Also, this is excellent and relevant:  https://t.co/e1e3917jgU

1306040847809630208 2020-09-16 09:22:57 +0800 <701007> Yep...
1306040734328422400 2020-09-16 09:22:30 +0800 <701007> Ahaha
1306040540132188161 2020-09-16 09:21:44 +0800 <701007> Definitely...
1306040187122782208 2020-09-16 09:20:20 +0800 <701007> This is just really sad and obvious pandering...
1306039892229619712 2020-09-16 09:19:10 +0800 <701007> Exactly what I was thinking, not what the Dems need rn, especially in Philly...
1306039571310837761 2020-09-16 09:17:53 +0800 <701007> Actually, he looks good in it, tbh...
1306039121513771014 2020-09-16 09:16:06 +0800 <701007> LOL...
1306030350213226496 2020-09-16 08:41:15 +0800 <701007> Wow.
1306020082624212992 2020-09-16 08:00:27 +0800 <701007> “And I don’t care if it‘s a very small group of people. They identified themselves as protesters and they were wishing death on two officers who had been the target of an attempted assassination. Despicable.”— Christine

1306012916819341312 2020-09-16 07:31:58 +0800 <701007> Everything I’ve seen trying to dunk on what happened today has been incredibly lame, tbh...
1306010703615209472 2020-09-16 07:23:10 +0800 <701007> “This is like targeting for a drone strike.” —  Christine Ahaha  Excellent podcast today...
1306001253533716480 2020-09-16 06:45:37 +0800 <701007> Bret really is an excellent reporter...
1306001054551674882 2020-09-16 06:44:50 +0800 <701007> 😂

1305990342601330688 2020-09-16 06:02:16 +0800 <701007> Gotta read this and Christine’s...
1305988134191214592 2020-09-16 05:53:29 +0800 <701007> Talking about LatinX now (and the Hispanic vote)...Christine and JPod made some good points (Abe pretty quiet here), and then Noah goes in and just...he’s really owning it today...
1305983955280244737 2020-09-16 05:36:53 +0800 <701007> “Sotto voce, drink.” Ahaha Noah, being funny and interesting...
1305982780115955715 2020-09-16 05:32:13 +0800 <701007> About 27:00 in, another Noah digression...it’s good too, re: Solemeini an deterrence breaking down...
1305979254908375040 2020-09-16 05:18:12 +0800 <701007> Yep.
1305978731266215936 2020-09-16 05:16:08 +0800 <701007> Haha
1305978274879856640 2020-09-16 05:14:19 +0800 <701007> Which is nothing...
1305976646491570180 2020-09-16 05:07:51 +0800 <701007> People are just going crazy...seriously...
1305969807414767616 2020-09-16 04:40:40 +0800 <701007> Haha JPod, ‘You know, that was a great rant, and I really enjoyed it.” Ahaha and true....
1305969284896747520 2020-09-16 04:38:35 +0800 <701007> Noah, at about 16:00 in, starts one of the ‘digressive rants’ he was talking about earlier—it’s a good one...  I love how he flips my expectations on their head sometime, and informs me as well...
1305967162713165824 2020-09-16 04:30:09 +0800 <701007> “Having your permanent status be one of either victim or martyr does not, long term, do much for your actual people and their concerns.” — Christine talking about the tonal shift on the Palestinian cause, even in the MSM...
1305962818605395974 2020-09-16 04:12:54 +0800 <701007> Noah, followed by JPod after Abe speaks, is just good stuff...looking forward to hearing Christine’s take, as well...
1305961377065046016 2020-09-16 04:07:10 +0800 <701007> Actually, all of what Abe says at the beginning. “If this is Arab hatred of Israel and the United States, bring it on. We need much more of this kind of hatred.”

1305955085680283650 2020-09-16 03:42:10 +0800 <701007> The only feed I found to play the speeches was from Fox, and the audio feed was abysmal. I really wanted to hear Netanyahu’s speech...😭

1305918842368151559 2020-09-16 01:18:09 +0800 <701007> Yes! Bring it on...😌💛  Reminds me, last Friday’s “Commentary” podcast ended with a delightful discussion on viewing recs for the weekend. I added “Rome” and the Sinatra doc to my ‘to watch’ list... also sad to hear that “Tenet” didn’t meet expectations...
1305916162241433606 2020-09-16 01:07:30 +0800 <701007> Need to read this, Christine’s article from yesterday and try to listen to the podcast from today and yesterday. I never usually go back to podcasts I miss, mostly, but not entirely, because of lack of time, but the topic yesterday sounded intriguing...
1305915692982697984 2020-09-16 01:05:38 +0800 <701007> Ahaha
1305915117725507584 2020-09-16 01:03:21 +0800 <701007> Monstrously callous...
1305914394065371137 2020-09-16 01:00:28 +0800 <701007> Finally...
1305910739069218816 2020-09-16 00:45:57 +0800 <701007> And don’t forget some of them have undermined themselves. Going woke about corona and BLM...  As Pradheep says, a mess...
1305907851777445890 2020-09-16 00:34:29 +0800 <701007> Huh...
1305901517015339011 2020-09-16 00:09:18 +0800 <701007> 🤞
1305901400979845122 2020-09-16 00:08:51 +0800 <701007> What’s this about...?
1305901282369196032 2020-09-16 00:08:22 +0800 <701007> Yes.
1305901030396309504 2020-09-16 00:07:22 +0800 <701007> This.
1305899194272677888 2020-09-16 00:00:05 +0800 <701007> Some happy news...
1305898799420899328 2020-09-15 23:58:30 +0800 <701007> Meanwhile, you’re one of the only leftists, with a large platform, I’ve seen decry it. It’s a simple truth. And why I was pleasantly surprised to see you decrying it.   Usually Dems all walk in one giant lockstep.
1305898759457591303 2020-09-15 23:58:21 +0800 <701007> Very glad you’re calling this out, but conservatives have been calling it out—a lot. I’ve seen it many, many times...
1305897920835842048 2020-09-15 23:55:01 +0800 <701007> Love this...
1305897643084845057 2020-09-15 23:53:55 +0800 <701007> Sweet...
1305897381515472898 2020-09-15 23:52:52 +0800 <701007> This is exactly on point...
1305896585927290882 2020-09-15 23:49:43 +0800 <701007> Welp...
1305895499904561153 2020-09-15 23:45:24 +0800 <701007> Huh...
1305682244007333888 2020-09-15 09:38:00 +0800 <701007> LOL!

1305681165748178944 2020-09-15 09:33:42 +0800 <701007> Ahaha  Also, better plans or no, I doubt he’ll be better on the economy—seriously doubt it...
1305545579225903120 2020-09-15 00:34:56 +0800 <701007> This is a strong point that matters a lot to an independent like me...removing the checks and balances and forging ahead with no one to stop the Dems on whatever plans/laws they want to implement—neither side should have this much power...
1305544607485362182 2020-09-15 00:31:04 +0800 <701007> Nice...
1304539425683234816 2020-09-12 05:56:50 +0800 <701007> Haha
1304539357131550721 2020-09-12 05:56:34 +0800 <701007> I love this...this is what we need more of...

1304537586418036744 2020-09-12 05:49:32 +0800 <701007> Have had a lot to squeeze in between listening to Ben, so I just finished.  He ends by doing a truly excellent examination of “Cuties”...  Missed this show. And now, time for “Commentary” but dk how much I’ll live tweet because it’s getting late...
1304496340702027776 2020-09-12 03:05:38 +0800 <701007> Look at this sentence...Noah (along with Jonah), two of the best political writers I follow. No one beats Noah on eloquence...
1304495667491078145 2020-09-12 03:02:58 +0800 <701007> Ben is funny, smart, and interesting, and, for me, watching his show is just cathartic. If you’re not watching his show already, you should start...  One of my favorite subscriptions.
1304495654329294849 2020-09-12 03:02:55 +0800 <701007> Some great stuff re: Biden and his interview yesterday, and now he’s onto the politicization of sports...

1303853607759097857 2020-09-10 08:31:39 +0800 <701007> He’s gotta be joking.   He can’t even tell the truth now, let alone if he gets what he wants. And I’m not talking about this—which was probably a gaffe. He’s already lied many, many times, and been deceitful.   They both lie. So give me a break with the ‘honest Joe’ ploy...

1303794504252755968 2020-09-10 04:36:47 +0800 <701007> Trump and the Dems, news networks/sites...they all said it wasn’t as deadly as the flu, etc., because, at the time, that’s what they believed...also, Trump is a big braggart, so, yeah, Pradheep was right.
1303794389760856067 2020-09-10 04:36:20 +0800 <701007> Because everyone at this time didn’t know almost anything about the *novel* coronavirus...I watched on the news, and read it, as both sides got stuff wrong...and I gave them a pass (and still do) because we were all still learning.
1303759935185080324 2020-09-10 02:19:25 +0800 <701007> Pradheep is on fire today...
1303756708263735299 2020-09-10 02:06:36 +0800 <701007> Then again, Dems downplayed it at first, too, wished for a Katrina-like event before it happened and hoped this was his, and also wished death and economic misery, etc., on everyone for their chances, too, and have done so several times since the corona outbreak.
1303756688688926720 2020-09-10 02:06:31 +0800 <701007> Yep. I watched him do it. It was obvious if you paid attention that he was doing it and that he was scared of what it would do to his election chances...

1302024870998552579 2020-09-05 07:24:54 +0800 <701007> There’s more, but I didn’t want to cap the whole thing. Also, doggo stuff:  https://t.co/f1riLDSjll
1302024562486530048 2020-09-05 07:23:40 +0800 <701007> Great G-File goodness. Some highlights:  https://t.co/jhNLjOkDtu
1301995463885946883 2020-09-05 05:28:03 +0800 <701007> Wonderful end segment discussing “Cobra Kai” and Bruce Lee (whose great grandfather was Jewish-Dutch from Rotterdam, a fact I didn’t know). And so cool that Christine is a 🥋 .    If any of you guys have any spare time, you should listen to today’s podcast. Really good one.
1301988442943959042 2020-09-05 05:00:09 +0800 <701007> Noah positing, ’If the President’s mouth was going to do him in, it would’ve done so by now...’   This.
1301987664002940929 2020-09-05 04:57:03 +0800 <701007> Basically, this moment in our nation is not a good one, as pointed out in the podcast...
1301987645065695233 2020-09-05 04:56:59 +0800 <701007> Two people have come out and said they were there and it didn’t happen, and these people said it did. I hate that the president’s character makes me wonder. Also, will this really change anyone’s mind? He has a terrible character, but this election has some stark choices.
1301987530141827072 2020-09-05 04:56:31 +0800 <701007> JPod pointing out correctly that you don’t read it and believe Trump couldn’t have said it. Which is the trouble for me... What’s true?
1301985219386445824 2020-09-05 04:47:20 +0800 <701007> Christine making me laugh again, ahaha, invoking Tom Clancy...
1301984718150397952 2020-09-05 04:45:21 +0800 <701007> Have heard him reference “Oliver!” and “Rio Bravo” in one podcast, even “Wizard of Oz” and use it (quoting several lines of script) perfectly.
1301984704929959936 2020-09-05 04:45:18 +0800 <701007> Always love JPod’s movie references (I only aspire to be as knowledgeable as he and Jonah are on this subject), today is “Hunt for Red October.”
1301983585184952324 2020-09-05 04:40:51 +0800 <701007> Noah’s talking rn, Weimar-esque actions...his prescient book...  This podcast is perfect for today.
1301981452385636352 2020-09-05 04:32:22 +0800 <701007> About 4:53 in...JPod, I love the way he reads the article and then his following comments are just—yes.
1301979775913820161 2020-09-05 04:25:42 +0800 <701007> A new Noah, too...yes!
1301979199402541056 2020-09-05 04:23:25 +0800 <701007> Gotta read this sometime today...
1301979025104080896 2020-09-05 04:22:43 +0800 <701007> Listening to the “Commentary” podcast rn... as Ben is my catharsis, this is like coming home...  Already out of the gate, LOLing at Christine saying she’s the optimist of the group...
1301966814629560320 2020-09-05 03:34:12 +0800 <701007> Sounds intriguing...
1301946783183052801 2020-09-05 02:14:36 +0800 <701007> No surprise here...
1301946466441756674 2020-09-05 02:13:21 +0800 <701007> Haha
1301946405184040963 2020-09-05 02:13:06 +0800 <701007> Didn’t know this...
1301946198115446784 2020-09-05 02:12:17 +0800 <701007> “I remember when they [the press] just walked around carrying a drool cup for Obama.” Ben rn... ahaha
1301944906747961349 2020-09-05 02:07:09 +0800 <701007> ACLU is a shell now...
1301944313664942080 2020-09-05 02:04:47 +0800 <701007> All true.
1301940515886243843 2020-09-05 01:49:42 +0800 <701007> 👏
1301938983077904384 2020-09-05 01:43:37 +0800 <701007> Today’s “Commentary” podcast and Ben’s show look promisingly good today...  Missed them.
1301937710081466376 2020-09-05 01:38:33 +0800 <701007> Yes, this.
1301936129927766016 2020-09-05 01:32:16 +0800 <701007> I thought this too...guess we’ll see...
1301936024264859648 2020-09-05 01:31:51 +0800 <701007> This.
1301935885756379140 2020-09-05 01:31:18 +0800 <701007> Haha
1301298667996016641 2020-09-03 07:19:14 +0800 <701007> This little cutie’s face makes me happy...
1301298552526770176 2020-09-03 07:18:46 +0800 <701007> Abhorrent...
1301298164901781510 2020-09-03 07:17:14 +0800 <701007> Personally, I think it’ll be a tossup to who’s worse. I give Biden a bit of an edge, maybe...  But then, maybe one or the other will surprise me.
1301297231589445634 2020-09-03 07:13:31 +0800 <701007> Just...
1301296440384335873 2020-09-03 07:10:22 +0800 <701007> True...
1301296202772873216 2020-09-03 07:09:26 +0800 <701007> ‘Saucy nugs’ ahaha
1301295717932298240 2020-09-03 07:07:30 +0800 <701007> Ahaha my TL making me laugh...  One of the reasons these guys are great follows.💛
1301256335254867969 2020-09-03 04:31:01 +0800 <701007> What a joke so many of our ‘leaders’ are...just a seriously unfunny joke...
1301255983214272517 2020-09-03 04:29:37 +0800 <701007> Ahaha nice...
1301255058009489408 2020-09-03 04:25:56 +0800 <701007> The stories I’ve read, only pieces, of people‘s parents and loved ones dying alone in isolated misery, limited funeral attendance allowance, and much more, and she skirts the rules for vanity’s sake, and blames someone else...  How utterly wretched.
1301251311460118529 2020-09-03 04:11:03 +0800 <701007> Also, we can see he only said something about it when his numbers started suffering.
1301251279163977729 2020-09-03 04:10:55 +0800 <701007> It was divisive, dishonest, and weak. Him not calling them out helps enable them to continue doing what they’re doing. He’s supposed to be a leader, but we can see that he doesn’t want to anger these groups and so he’s trying to play the middle.
1301251100822167555 2020-09-03 04:10:13 +0800 <701007> I haven’t read that. They weren’t that. What they were was cover for and placating the violent factions of far left anarchists, of BLM and Antifa, by naming only one side and making it a right wing problem. When really, by far, the violence has been committed by leftists.
1301249217667756042 2020-09-03 04:02:44 +0800 <701007> Man...
1301214943325413376 2020-09-03 01:46:32 +0800 <701007> California is just a mess...
1301214370513522688 2020-09-03 01:44:15 +0800 <701007> Looking forward to this, tbh...
1301214084998848512 2020-09-03 01:43:07 +0800 <701007> Ouch!
1301213861480140801 2020-09-03 01:42:14 +0800 <701007> This.
1301213693699592195 2020-09-03 01:41:34 +0800 <701007> This, also, is not okay...
1301213485930512390 2020-09-03 01:40:45 +0800 <701007> 🤢
1301212454484086788 2020-09-03 01:36:39 +0800 <701007> Huh...
1301212331515539456 2020-09-03 01:36:09 +0800 <701007> This.
1301211431594004482 2020-09-03 01:32:35 +0800 <701007> He already has some far, far leftists on his team. And the Dems like to cave to the hard left of their group, Joe has, too. He’s moved further left. These are some of Joe’s (and the Dem party as it is today) biggest issues...with moderates and independents.
1301211308487041026 2020-09-03 01:32:05 +0800 <701007> Though, perhaps I’m cynical, I don’t think it will work with them. Their goal is the destruction of America and replacing it with their Marxist utopia they are sure they can make succeed. A talk with grandpa Joe will not satisfy them unless he promises to give into their demands.
1301210996317528064 2020-09-03 01:30:51 +0800 <701007> At least he’s trying something.  We’ll see if it matters. But really, this is still about poll numbers, and also, he should call out Antifa/violent factions of BLM and bring progressives like them together to talk and stop the rioting.
1301207747707326467 2020-09-03 01:17:56 +0800 <701007> Interesting thread. Harold really doesn’t seem to get independents and their concerns. And there’s an arrogance there in a lot of what he says. RTing a few great responses from Pradheep and Megan here...
1301203153178767366 2020-09-03 00:59:41 +0800 <701007> Haha
1301202947565649923 2020-09-03 00:58:52 +0800 <701007> Taking care of their financial futures is good, but their character and their spiritual needs are more important and they’ve been severely neglected more and more for several generations...  They seek purpose and meaning, and find it where they can...
1301202869836820480 2020-09-03 00:58:34 +0800 <701007> I‘ve thought about things in this thread...I think that’s one of the reasons we see kids behaving as we do today.
1300979210614341632 2020-09-02 10:09:49 +0800 <701007> JPod at 41:30, followed by Christine...  And...JPod ended with happy news...  Watching Ben and then getting some rest. Hope you guys get some good sleep tonight and have a very good day tomorrow... 😌💛
1300965767006031872 2020-09-02 09:16:24 +0800 <701007> 27:40—Christine here, coming off a point by JPod (which relates to the article) just states it perfectly.
1300965750954430476 2020-09-02 09:16:20 +0800 <701007> Also, the wonderful Polimath has written a piece for “Commentary” this month on the Covid data reporting. He’s one of the few I absolutely trust about Covid data:  https://t.co/QKL4utOXU5
1300965716380856326 2020-09-02 09:16:12 +0800 <701007> The article JPod refers to in the podcast:  https://t.co/qlobyAuSPb
1300957845417005056 2020-09-02 08:44:55 +0800 <701007> 💛
1300957475550699520 2020-09-02 08:43:27 +0800 <701007> Haha
1300956891871412224 2020-09-02 08:41:08 +0800 <701007> This gives more deets on what JPod was talking about...just terrible.
1300955769303691264 2020-09-02 08:36:40 +0800 <701007> Nice...
1300953005903220736 2020-09-02 08:25:41 +0800 <701007> Correction: *nearly three dozen street gangs  It’s at around 20:50 in...
1300920476563275781 2020-09-02 06:16:26 +0800 <701007> This.
1300919932914479107 2020-09-02 06:14:16 +0800 <701007> All they care about are the reins of power, not the people they want power over. And I am dreading seeing who is going to be hurt next...
1300919930016202752 2020-09-02 06:14:15 +0800 <701007> These people are not going to stop and this seems like all the months of destruction are just going to get worse and continue, and he and his Dem cohorts could care less.
1300919927487041536 2020-09-02 06:14:15 +0800 <701007> He also only did this tiny amount now because of his poll numbers—and this is supposed to make me feel like things will be better for us all if he becomes president? Please.
1300919925289160706 2020-09-02 06:14:14 +0800 <701007> It was really all about him yesterday, not the American people. Has he tried to bring these groups together, talk, find or offer any solutions? No.
1300919923036782592 2020-09-02 06:14:14 +0800 <701007> He didn’t make anything better. He just threw some more words at the situation, while being careful not to irk progressives, and tried to reset the narrative.
1300919920746790913 2020-09-02 06:14:13 +0800 <701007> He ran interference, as everyone on his side has been doing all this time, for the violent groups doing this, giving them cover.
1300919918460887042 2020-09-02 06:14:13 +0800 <701007> Also, he wasn’t unifying, but dividing by political bent (which is the same crap that’s been going on all this time that brought us here).
1300919915663237120 2020-09-02 06:14:12 +0800 <701007> First, he blatantly lied, put the blame on right wing militants instead of calling out Antifa and violent factions of BLM, who have been the perpetrators of the overwhelming majority of the violence going on for months: burning, looting, stealing, assaulting, and even murdering.
1300919913419333632 2020-09-02 06:14:11 +0800 <701007> But as an independent who is a fan of neither Biden or Trump, and who is honestly concerned with what is happening to my country and my fellow citizens, it was a bad moment for Biden.
1300919911317938184 2020-09-02 06:14:11 +0800 <701007> Basically, from what I saw, if you plan on voting for Biden, you liked his speech because he checked the box.
1300919907836727298 2020-09-02 06:14:10 +0800 <701007> The problems with Biden’s speech for me were that he was attempting to show leadership, and how he would be superior to Trump during a national crisis—but he didn’t really.
1300917083128160257 2020-09-02 06:02:57 +0800 <701007> They plan on killing cops in this situation. And he talks about how this moment is “...dangerous and why we might not have seen anything yet.”
1300917066590031873 2020-09-02 06:02:53 +0800 <701007> Now JPod has read off a report of something I hadn’t heard: that in Chicago three gang factions have gotten together and are actively seeking out and filming officers doing their jobs in an attempt to catch them pulling their weapon on someone.
1300916713505067008 2020-09-02 06:01:29 +0800 <701007> Listening to the “Commentary” podcast rn. They start out of the gate just wonderfully, talking about the riots and Biden’s speech. Christine particularly was great.
