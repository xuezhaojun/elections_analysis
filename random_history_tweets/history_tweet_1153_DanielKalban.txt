1344059114872311811 2020-12-30 07:13:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> And the purity progressives are going after Pelosi, again.  Idiots.

1344047666490175488 2020-12-30 06:28:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> Hot take:  The two best Westerns are Cat Ballou and Blazing Saddles; mainly because they're not afraid to poke fun at every possible cliche while still being a tribute to the genre.

1344043839758151680 2020-12-30 06:13:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RyanHigginsRyan I'm assuming that "soon to close" DC? :)
1344043234612441097 2020-12-30 06:10:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheHeroBiz Yeah I had to drop a few people ^^;  One even before WW84 came out because they were either livetweeting their drug trips or they were just being so negative
1344041944402550784 2020-12-30 06:05:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheHeroBiz I need to figure that out because I've seen far too many things that are just pile ons (and in some cases MAJOR stretches)
1344040876809592832 2020-12-30 06:01:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheHeroBiz That's fair.  Problem is it's not CONSTRUCTIVE criticism that's happening; more of a pile on, nitpicking, etc and so on.  IMO at least.
1344040151450869760 2020-12-30 05:58:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cullenbunn Have to plug @TheNerdOnline , where I've written a few* articles for.  *okay, a couple hundred over the past 8 years or so.
1344038904438149122 2020-12-30 05:53:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> How weird was last night's blackout?  It was hyper-localized. Went from the corner to about halfway down the block.
1344036478960201729 2020-12-30 05:44:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @frankee_white @ComicsBookcase It's such a poison love letter to Hollywood, and I love it! Such great performances and camera work.  Apparantely Jack Warner or Louis B Mayer was so pissed off at the premiere, they threatened that Billy Wilder would never work again. And he laughed all the way to the bank!
1344034246021816321 2020-12-30 05:35:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @frankee_white @ComicsBookcase One of my fave movies (and musicals)
1344032986753331200 2020-12-30 05:30:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> And BC once again shows it has no ethics, morals, etc.  Seriously, this is petty tabloid trash level
1344032730531688450 2020-12-30 05:29:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TessFowler in all honesty, my intro to Discworld was through some of the itv movies based on the books they put on Netflix ^^; Read some of the books later.  Jeremy Irons and Charles Dance both play one of my fave characters in two separate films. (Irons is more of a cameo)
1344031415256690691 2020-12-30 05:23:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TessFowler For Ankh Morpork/Watch stories: Guards! Guards!  I'm also fond of Going Postal, which introduces conman Most Von Lipwig.  Or, start from the top with The Color of Magic
1344030914985275392 2020-12-30 05:21:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone wtf
1344030550693191680 2020-12-30 05:20:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @frankee_white problem is ALL nuance online has flown out the window last few years, ESPECIALLY this year.
1344027836496162817 2020-12-30 05:09:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman :( What happened?!
1344025487790772224 2020-12-30 05:00:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @dsamowen ah! I found some background!  https://t.co/VNc7duEHAG

1344022657419907073 2020-12-30 04:49:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> Let's do this!!  https://t.co/HxcTBNBe08
1344020780510830594 2020-12-30 04:41:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GwenLovesMovies @ComicsExalted Exactly! It's really weird that people are making such hash out of this.
1344016638790791168 2020-12-30 04:25:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @yourfavestoner Some people are just jerks because they aren't getting their own way
1344011869359661058 2020-12-30 04:06:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @missafayres Definitely. Just a great humorous show where we poke fun at comics (and comic fans).  There was a Lewis Black short lived show perhaps along these lines?
1344010726428565504 2020-12-30 04:01:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @missafayres Actually, the overall concept (sans nudity) could be interesting
1344010498812084224 2020-12-30 04:00:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers Seriously...some people are just...jerks

1344007445056729090 2020-12-30 03:48:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman Agreed
1344006528630710272 2020-12-30 03:45:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ChrisSamnee oh wow!
1344006213588185088 2020-12-30 03:43:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ArtofNickRobles yes
1344006023561043977 2020-12-30 03:43:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers ?
1344004803974852609 2020-12-30 03:38:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AdManComics yep
1343996376821202946 2020-12-30 03:04:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> I got Scarecrow.  Uh oh.
1343996059530493954 2020-12-30 03:03:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @j_partridgeIII Yep, but that can be applied to all fandoms.
1343994609794428928 2020-12-30 02:57:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Tweeted_Tongues Yep.  It's just a bit daunting waking up to a ton of messages and comments and having to go through them ^^;
1343994162740387842 2020-12-30 02:55:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cjp_still @Marmel Well, I have understood it.  I don't think the "purity progressives" have though
1343992007576887296 2020-12-30 02:47:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> Share your goodbye message to 2020 in one gif  https://t.co/4vL2AuuwDu
1343985988532625412 2020-12-30 02:23:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Phantomskyler DC bashing brings $$ and clicks
1343985006520242177 2020-12-30 02:19:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan @BrenttHarshman @BrianLHawkins NP!!!
1343983174037221376 2020-12-30 02:12:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> So, the Turtle has blocked us from getting those $2000 checks.  Again, I don't want to hear "both sides are the same."
1343982324799692801 2020-12-30 02:08:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MIKECOLLINS99 oh wow!
1343982107618652160 2020-12-30 02:07:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @frankee_white It's definitely one with one of the more ambitious stories :)  And it's immensely fun (gambit system aside)
1343981519866638341 2020-12-30 02:05:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman I think @jarredlujan is one of the hardest working guys in comics   And @BrianLHawkins is an amazing editor
1343979137371951104 2020-12-30 01:56:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> hey @BrenttHarshman is this what your dogs do when you're not at home?
1343974935673319424 2020-12-30 01:39:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SideKickedComix I've had so many FB messages....  Thankfully I have an editor helping me out
1343974645272354816 2020-12-30 01:38:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @zakiscorner And it completely ignores (and in a way condones) toxic fandom
1343974429118889984 2020-12-30 01:37:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Awesome!
1343963503326060545 2020-12-30 00:54:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> Put out an ad, so to speak, on FB last night about looking for an artist for that Western project.  Let's just say I'm feeling overwhelmed at the moment! XD A lot of great artists to go through :)
1343962763769630720 2020-12-30 00:51:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MrNiceGuy18_58 1. The first two you list are fine  2. I think it's become a hivemind/trolling thing at this point and not telling the truth.
1343961771531493377 2020-12-30 00:47:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @VinceUnderwood @danthemcmahon Agreed
1343961730444120067 2020-12-30 00:47:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @danthemcmahon Yep.  If there was a journalistic ethics board, that site would have been fined into oblivion
1343959754062901248 2020-12-30 00:39:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @NerdIsTheWerdYT Two (or more) parts is fine
1343959610156322816 2020-12-30 00:38:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone If I had my druthers (and the money)?  Japan, Egypt, or the UK

1343955489969876992 2020-12-30 00:22:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted @tsukiakari1203 If it got any cattier, my allergies would go off. XD  (Because I'm allergic to cats, wtf do you think I'm talking about?!)
1343955057977544704 2020-12-30 00:20:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MattDraperYT Don't mind me, I'm eating popcorn and looking at the comments for the reactions :)
1343953590432444422 2020-12-30 00:14:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 yep
1343953262421159939 2020-12-30 00:13:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @James_Blundell it's so good
1343953000562356224 2020-12-30 00:12:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 Yeah, I saw yesterday.
1343952955750436866 2020-12-30 00:12:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brykotyk I know!!! XD  And half the time its people with toxic nostalgia throwing fits about how things aren't exactly how THEY like it!
1343952412105711616 2020-12-30 00:09:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 hmmm
1343951467611365376 2020-12-30 00:06:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 I know, but at the same time...do these people just feel happy by being this negative?!
1343950515592441860 2020-12-30 00:02:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> I really hate these cynical takes by people making assumptions before they read/watch something, I really freaking do.
1343948168065642498 2020-12-29 23:53:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @IGN But no one at WB/DC ACTUALLY said that; that was the NYTimes reporter's ASSUMPTION
1343947774551842818 2020-12-29 23:51:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Bosco685 yep.  At this point, ethics have gone OUT the window
1343940680125706241 2020-12-29 23:23:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip Because there can be no nuance, only binary choices.  That and a bunch of toxic fans aren't helping matters (and he's not either by not trying to appeal to a wider audience)
1343940313094762506 2020-12-29 23:21:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> Why are people acting as if WB/DC flat out said Batgirl and Static Shock are risky films when in the article there is no direct quote of them saying that?  The only person saying that was the reporter, who was speculating.  Why are so many sites twisting this?
1343939834705022977 2020-12-29 23:20:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MatthewACherry Note that it's the NYT reporter's speculation; not a statement by WB/DC.  Why is IGN spinning this?
1343921902105079810 2020-12-29 22:08:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> THREAD
1343914027278348290 2020-12-29 21:37:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> HEHEHEHE!  It's true in SO many cases though
1343913239428681729 2020-12-29 21:34:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC :D
1343911790816751616 2020-12-29 21:28:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 Well ZS isn't helping because right now all he's doing is preaching to the converted
1343911642715860993 2020-12-29 21:27:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @LobsterJustin Yep, and it's freaking insane/infuriating.  They put DC films under a microscope they NEVER do to Marvel
1343911510012088320 2020-12-29 21:27:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeanIzaakse TOO LATE!  https://t.co/FHECUsfVV1
1343910910935638018 2020-12-29 21:25:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Phantomskyler The NY Times writer speculated those would be the "riskier" films, no one at WB/DC actually said that.
1343910768744521728 2020-12-29 21:24:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC THIS! EXACTLY THIS!  Thank God! Someone who is positive :) I swear I'm like the only freaking one sometimes.
1343910523386081286 2020-12-29 21:23:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeanIzaakse Plus I don't see people complaining about Marvel doing 3 movies in theaters plus a BUNCH of prestige streaming TV so once again double freaking standards!  But there I go again, being a grump :)
1343909925626535938 2020-12-29 21:21:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeanIzaakse It's really good but also VERY intense!!  (Also, read the novel that the first season is based on ;) )
1343886667183239168 2020-12-29 19:48:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> Power's back! (Finally)
1343884101649117186 2020-12-29 19:38:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos @Reason1975 Fair.

1343697097099517952 2020-12-29 07:15:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadewing @ComicsExalted Agreed. To do so is to be an incredibly toxic and entitled twit.  Who is doing it, btw?

1343681028179824642 2020-12-29 06:11:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Reason1975 A former exec stupidly mocked the reaction of a Youtuber, thus setting off the crazies
1343679701815087107 2020-12-29 06:06:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> My sympathies with Lucasfilm as they are attacked by toxic childish fans over the actions of someone who doesn't even work there anymore....
1343654002223931393 2020-12-29 04:24:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> I just backed World War Mob: La Collezione Completa by @incogvito  on @Kickstarter  https://t.co/99o08ggh9K

1343651526796054528 2020-12-29 04:14:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter That's why I try to do a walk on my "work from home days".  I have a preferred mile loop route I like to go on; good to get some air
1343647251147726848 2020-12-29 03:57:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams yep!
1343645905803730952 2020-12-29 03:52:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams Scott McDaniel?  https://t.co/Q8LYz6dgYu
1343644729485963264 2020-12-29 03:47:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams Sale's is the cutoff point  https://t.co/nIUCSbClpb
1343643907041730561 2020-12-29 03:44:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams WAY too long!
1343642975939735552 2020-12-29 03:40:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 it's gotten a bit nutty ^^;  And it's basically over storytelling
1343642136894464000 2020-12-29 03:37:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams hmm...Tim Sale is as long as I think they should go.
1343641536400158720 2020-12-29 03:34:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 It's...better off that way.
1343641185550802945 2020-12-29 03:33:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> That bittersweet feeling when you get editors notes...and you have more rewrites than you thought you'd had to do.  Ah well, it's not like I'm going anywhere for New Year's :P So that will be my project for the long weekend.
1343637298555084803 2020-12-29 03:17:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RyanHigginsRyan wtf
1343637086595932161 2020-12-29 03:16:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter yep.
1343636797696466953 2020-12-29 03:15:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> Oh look, toxic alt right Star Wars "fans" are going after a Lucasfilm exec because he's justly sick and tired of their BS....
1343616233007153153 2020-12-29 01:54:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> So there's a power outage at my house ^^; This CANNOT end well.
1343609511383339008 2020-12-29 01:27:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Blankzilla And they only released ONE trade of it in recent years :/
1343609299172536321 2020-12-29 01:26:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @EvaIsAdorable He needs meds, therapy, and a long stay in a padded room
1343608902399750144 2020-12-29 01:25:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeanIzaakse yep
1343608486832332801 2020-12-29 01:23:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers yep...*sigh*
1343608363926638596 2020-12-29 01:22:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TylerWalpole yep
1343605640741203973 2020-12-29 01:12:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CamelMan302 @CyborgKingX @lesbobomb Oh I know there's multiple factions at this point.  I'm stating based on my own observations.  You're being HYPERdefensive instead of working on the problem
1343603095364902915 2020-12-29 01:01:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CamelMan302 @CyborgKingX @lesbobomb It is when it went unopposed for years
1343591915145588736 2020-12-29 00:17:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CamelMan302 @CyborgKingX @lesbobomb I'm just stating my opinion based on my observations
1343574319293726721 2020-12-28 23:07:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone As a fan: meeting my fave pros  As a creator: Getting my books out there for people to enjoy
1343574188687314945 2020-12-28 23:07:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass yep
1343574155950764033 2020-12-28 23:06:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Michael26689428 They even say his name in the film, IIRC
1343566951516401665 2020-12-28 22:38:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HeyJJLopez It's called sitting back and enjoying some entertainment.  (I'd hate to see your reaction to going to a show....)
1343566524947324928 2020-12-28 22:36:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HeyJJLopez It should be more people.  But nope, too many short attention spans
1343566342390218753 2020-12-28 22:35:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HeyJJLopez I dealt with a 2.75 hr long Western a couple days before; 2.5 is NOTHING
1343566173166837768 2020-12-28 22:35:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip  https://t.co/m8mwqwR2ge
1343566085786894337 2020-12-28 22:34:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brookstweetz @jpalmiotti Plus OMG the fragile manchildren freaking out about this movie....
1343565926025863173 2020-12-28 22:34:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brookstweetz @jpalmiotti Yeah  Plus the overall "It's DC, so let's hyperanalyze it for flaws (real or imagined)! And be hypocrites by never doing it to any other franchise!"
1343565606503768064 2020-12-28 22:32:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CamelMan302 @CyborgKingX @lesbobomb Sorry, but very few of you are actively trying to stop these schmucks and its too little too late.
1343565478913073157 2020-12-28 22:32:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MattBeutner Probably.  They must HATE 1950s epic films
1343565165409820672 2020-12-28 22:31:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted Not like this
1343565053652578308 2020-12-28 22:30:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MattBeutner yep.
1343564763532505088 2020-12-28 22:29:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CyborgKingX @CamelMan302 @lesbobomb THIS
1343564639586684928 2020-12-28 22:29:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @schiekapedia @valkyriesblog I dunno, I loved Temple of Doom at that age
1343564175629574146 2020-12-28 22:27:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brookstweetz I know @jpalmiotti suggests they should have just gone with "Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey" and there would have been less kvetching from the start.
1343563871622197248 2020-12-28 22:26:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> You people don't complain about a movie being two hours plus long when its Marvel.  Don't be hypocrites.
1343525771198001152 2020-12-28 19:54:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass Hammerstein and Kern? :P  Sorry, theater joke.  In all seriousness, I think they saw how much $ Old Man Logan and TDKR made and ran with it?
1343521359964606465 2020-12-28 19:37:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass Probably the high from getting clicks from being constantly negative and making stuff up.
1343520578251194368 2020-12-28 19:34:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @rpace Im literally at a pattern where I keep waking up every couple hours :/  But that might be due to my room being overheated and becoming dehydrated quickly?
1343520381848739842 2020-12-28 19:33:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass I really don't like her; she's such a...horrid person
1343518970574417923 2020-12-28 19:27:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @schiekapedia ooo
1343518882871578629 2020-12-28 19:27:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 @Adam_LeafsFan Holy--  These ZS Cultists have ISSUES!!
1343518707755208705 2020-12-28 19:26:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jpalmiotti Watched Once Upon A Time In The West for the first time last week
1343518257798672384 2020-12-28 19:24:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers agreed. It's storytelling
1343518092308213760 2020-12-28 19:24:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> Well it's a good thing I'm up before my alarm because OMG the cat yoweling outside my window would have done the job!
1343517569039409155 2020-12-28 19:22:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 Agreed
1343517454711070720 2020-12-28 19:21:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RyanHigginsRyan Way too many people like that
1343517371953258496 2020-12-28 19:21:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 Probably B:TAS and my dad's old comics
1343390880145821696 2020-12-28 10:58:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattkrotzer Because they believed a massive hate campaign (not to mention sexism) that started before the cameras rolled? Not to mention believing the lies of a "journalist" who made up such BS that the director actually called her out.
1343374301429440517 2020-12-28 09:52:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted Oh that guy showed up before Cassie was around in Nightwing. He's an assassin often hired by Blockbuster.
1343372522415415297 2020-12-28 09:45:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @bryanbehar No idea, but they really brought out their claws before they even sat down to watch it
1343363814352449539 2020-12-28 09:11:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brookstweetz I did. I thought the cast was great!
1343357512016396294 2020-12-28 08:46:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @grantandstuff i'll have water lol
1343356750423068674 2020-12-28 08:43:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @grantandstuff Can I be the teetotal reader? ^^;
1343354290870636546 2020-12-28 08:33:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DAvallone yep
1343349261568782337 2020-12-28 08:13:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RICHARDLNEWBY yep
1343342205285638146 2020-12-28 07:45:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip @RICHARDLNEWBY Oh awful is an understatement when it comes to her
1343340235757920256 2020-12-28 07:37:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JHWilliamsIII We watched Rare Exports on Christmas Eve; fiendishly entertaining
1343340052735270912 2020-12-28 07:36:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> I hope WDC has mental health coverage for that position.....
1343337745331212288 2020-12-28 07:27:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> I feel sorry for overly cynical people.  Nothing will ever bring them joy, even when they get what they want.
1343332247391371265 2020-12-28 07:05:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RICHARDLNEWBY She is a horrid person and a disgrace to journalism
1343324707404320768 2020-12-28 06:35:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted that's convenient.
1343322881909006345 2020-12-28 06:28:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> Seeing Woody Harrelson waiting in line to get Zachary Levi and Co's autographs after a performance of She Loves Me on Broadway.  Celebs just being fans like the rest of us :)
1343322627008581634 2020-12-28 06:27:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @delia_cai Seeing Woody Harrelson waiting in line to get Zachary Levi and Co's autographs after a performance of She Loves Me on Broadway.  Celebs just being fans like the rest of us :)
1343320939459710977 2020-12-28 06:20:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeclusionStudio @KylerClodfelter yep. *sigh* But nope, they have to crush the joy of others
1343319111204483073 2020-12-28 06:13:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SupesBatsy Yeah I don't get that "argument" either.  It's nitpicking just to nitpick.
1343318190860996610 2020-12-28 06:09:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @WarmBrew_Mook @darling_sammy oh that takes me back
1343317890670407680 2020-12-28 06:08:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeclusionStudio @KylerClodfelter they definitely need one but, to paraphrase the only South Park ep I like, how do you stop that which has no life?
1343310942432595973 2020-12-28 05:41:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Exactly! Thank you! :D
1343301579731034112 2020-12-28 05:03:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> Yeah people are REACHING for reasons to be offended over things in WW84 that they wouldn't even blink over in other films....
1343295564960694273 2020-12-28 04:39:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @wolffianclassic @TheOtherMarioC mhmm
1343290741653692418 2020-12-28 04:20:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 @theanglo_files Agreed
1343290462187237376 2020-12-28 04:19:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 I also think it should be Circe
1343289893439549441 2020-12-28 04:17:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 @theanglo_files yep
1343253470527283200 2020-12-28 01:52:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC Oh I know.  I think some people are just not appreciating what they have/got.
1343251250301820931 2020-12-28 01:43:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @verge OFFS.  How about APPRECIATING the films we got?!   Freaking philistine....
1343250177654743042 2020-12-28 01:39:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> OFFS.  How about APPRECIATING the films we got?! Especially the DC ones?  Freaking philistine....
1343242004097097728 2020-12-28 01:07:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @fishandkangaroo @RICHARDLNEWBY yep
1343225477587210240 2020-12-28 00:01:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mvbrat91 1. Frick him  2. His "fixes" are bad fan fic
1343222014459437057 2020-12-27 23:47:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby The writer is actually anti CG (and vocally so)
1343220151110529025 2020-12-27 23:40:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @theanglo_files Yep.  Plus add in double standards, hypocrisy, etc
1343219942695567361 2020-12-27 23:39:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> Check this out  https://t.co/YPl7Ql41oA
1343216565471293441 2020-12-27 23:25:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jpalmiotti Yep, especially the people going out of their way to badmouth it before release.
1343205372958535683 2020-12-27 22:41:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted Because Marvel ALWAYS gets a pass for the things they attack DC for.  It's such hypocrisy
1343204596714516481 2020-12-27 22:38:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted Or ANYTHING DC does.  People want carbon copies of DC stories? GO READ A COMIC!  Let the directors et al do their thing.  (You don't see them pull this BS with Marvel)
1343204160548839426 2020-12-27 22:36:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted problem is people throw fits when things aren't EXACTLY how they want them
1343203290981535749 2020-12-27 22:33:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TomMayoWoodman yep. *sigh*
1343203086601515014 2020-12-27 22:32:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip Oh that's an UNDERSTATEMENT.  He comes off as a complete ass XD
1343202484995690498 2020-12-27 22:30:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrandonDavisBD 8
1343194191929741314 2020-12-27 21:57:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jpalmiotti Hopefully the pandemic will be over (or at least majorly contained) by the summer.
1343193086093111296 2020-12-27 21:52:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> Alan Dean Foster: TLJ was horrible! I would have retconned the shit out of it and here's what I would have done!  Me: *reads*  Me: This is FAR worse than anything TLJ/TROS supposedly did. This is absolute nonsensical fanboy trash.
1343192597574148097 2020-12-27 21:50:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> Thread
1343187816503771136 2020-12-27 21:31:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AGramuglia Yeah, TLJ/TROS is better than his "retcons"
1343187501528313858 2020-12-27 21:30:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @thebeardhunter0 Bialya is mentioned
1343183247778471941 2020-12-27 21:13:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @btmorgan85 I enjoyed it too.  It's just hip at the moment to bash it.  Time will be kinder to it
1343075672793763842 2020-12-27 14:06:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Phantomskyler *sigh* but they won't
1343025103752343554 2020-12-27 10:45:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Reason1975 Most years, it's not an issue because I usually stop by a diner to grab some grub.  This year though...hoo boy....  Maybe I should take a cab home?
1343024302401200130 2020-12-27 10:42:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> So, I have a sort of checkup in a couple weeks, a small battery of tests.  I can't eat or drink for at least 8 hours beforehand AND I have to get blood drawn.  I don't get out until at LEAST 11am. And I can't exactly grab food afterwards.  This is gonna be ugly.
1343021388446228480 2020-12-27 10:30:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @wolffianclassic @ComicsExalted mhmm
1343019636019908608 2020-12-27 10:23:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted Well they already changed the warehouse to somewhere snowy. The mountains of North Korea could have worked OR Eastern Europe and make him the Russian ambassador.
1343018774346280964 2020-12-27 10:20:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted Fair.  But they'd have to possibly choose a different nation; given the change in geopolitics
1343017477027098627 2020-12-27 10:14:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted AH!  I think it was cut for time and the fact it's somewhat dated (and a bit un PC)
1343016788494327808 2020-12-27 10:12:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted My collection tpb has those issues
1343016556284919808 2020-12-27 10:11:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 yep
1343016477004345344 2020-12-27 10:10:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> *Before dinner, earlier tonight*  Dad: Are you listening to Final Fantasy music?  Me: Nope, Once Upon A Time In The West.  Dad: Oh.  Me: ...do you want to listen to Final Fantasy music?  Dad: Not really.
1343011413019783168 2020-12-27 09:50:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @daniel_ds @Therealmanos Yep!
1343010748931440642 2020-12-27 09:48:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AndyShaggyKorty XD
1343009575579103232 2020-12-27 09:43:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrianChurilla Agreed
1343007036548788225 2020-12-27 09:33:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RonJoseph717 It's like...yes, I can understand WHY they're upset, but at the same time it's like they went looking for reasons TO BE upset.  Then they act like the offense was intentional.
1343005647676338177 2020-12-27 09:27:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RonJoseph717 Yep!   They're a great writer, but OMG it was one giant hunt for offense with them!
1343004953791631360 2020-12-27 09:25:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip yep
1343004657162055684 2020-12-27 09:23:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip Sounds good to me. :)  I...actually don't have a ranking; I never gave it much thought. (Least fave is Suicide Squad though)
1343004190893862914 2020-12-27 09:22:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> Thinking of unfollowing a certain person.  No, it's NOT because of their DC opinion.  They're just antagonistic and snarky about EVERYTHING, and looks for offense when I doubt it was intended.
1343002512648007681 2020-12-27 09:15:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip yep
1342999913999831041 2020-12-27 09:05:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 Oh I know.  I think you misread my tweet ^^;  I was saying some of those chuckleheads are hating on her flying because...well stupid petty reasons.  That and they haven't picked up a freaking comic book (or watched JL/JLU)
1342999189484167169 2020-12-27 09:02:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 I think it's mostly ZS fanatics being...well idiots
1342999117455360001 2020-12-27 09:01:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 yep
1342996131052183556 2020-12-27 08:50:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> Justice League was fine
1342989506102898688 2020-12-27 08:23:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> Not surprised to see antisemites go after Gal.  They hate strong women, and strong Jews.
1342988652301987841 2020-12-27 08:20:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> READ THIS
1342987846337130497 2020-12-27 08:17:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Stpolishook It's such blatant antisemitism; but these schmucks don't care.  They love to demonize us Jews.
1342987466417070080 2020-12-27 08:15:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted Good start :D
1342987356371091461 2020-12-27 08:15:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> Seeing the glowing positivity in the #WW84WatchParty hashtag makes me happy :)
1342986673836208129 2020-12-27 08:12:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @photonic_cannon @RICHARDLNEWBY people who need to be constantly angry all the time
1342983240236355589 2020-12-27 07:58:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AJYeend @GalGadot @DCComics @PattyJenks yep
1342982746910699520 2020-12-27 07:56:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass You're in for a "fun" night.  Damn thing sounded like a shrieking banshee
1342982511811579907 2020-12-27 07:55:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AndyShaggyKorty np
1342982382924795905 2020-12-27 07:55:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @zakiscorner wtf
1342982270379053059 2020-12-27 07:54:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SherazFarooqi_ yep
1342982054598877185 2020-12-27 07:54:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> Got a sneak peek at @charliemcelvy 's @Spider_Squirrel OGN and you guys are in for a fun, funny, and fantastic ride.
1342978973580537856 2020-12-27 07:41:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass Yeah, we had a nasty wind storm here across the pond in NYC Christmas Eve through Christmas morning; wonder if that set off a similar storm in the UK via the Gulf Stream?
1342978606578987008 2020-12-27 07:40:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> WW84 is a good movie
1342978376882130944 2020-12-27 07:39:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 Have you played TOR; the makeup of how they built it is great
1342978003777843200 2020-12-27 07:38:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AndyShaggyKorty Nice!
1342974139523588097 2020-12-27 07:22:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Paul_thePullbox mhmm
1342967394004840448 2020-12-27 06:55:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 yep
1342966988809900032 2020-12-27 06:54:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 mhmm
1342966735964614656 2020-12-27 06:53:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SocksxMC @maimonides_nutz Sure :)
1342966219121582082 2020-12-27 06:51:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 right
1342965536301441025 2020-12-27 06:48:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 yep
1342965196407631885 2020-12-27 06:47:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SocksxMC @maimonides_nutz You may take my latkes, but you shall never have my flanken brisket!!!
1342964977393664002 2020-12-27 06:46:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GalGadot I unfortunately will miss it due to dinner :(  But I watched it last night and I absolutely adored the film!  #WW84
1342964850113339392 2020-12-27 06:45:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone I swear some people just want to crush the joy of others
1342964734358859776 2020-12-27 06:45:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 And we Jews apparantely aren't allowed to point out hate against us....
1342964481685651459 2020-12-27 06:44:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @rpace Not in iambic pentameter! BOO! :P  (In all seriousness, very clever :) )
1342964076947910657 2020-12-27 06:42:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 And I'm probably going to be called an Arab hating, baby killing Zionist.....  Fuck these goyishe assholes!
1342963832155738119 2020-12-27 06:41:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kirbysepicfarm Yep.  And now people are being anti-Semitic (again) about WW (either film) *sigh*
1342963494979829762 2020-12-27 06:40:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kirbysepicfarm They "slept on it" because they believed a bunch of BS lies about it from people with asshole agendas against it ranging from sexism to "it's not Zaddy's glorious vision"
1342963092276314115 2020-12-27 06:38:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 They want to be self righteous and just feel superior.  In the end, they're as bad as the Trumpsters
1342962691560906753 2020-12-27 06:37:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AGramuglia @Nash076 Oh extra harsh is an understatement
1342962570345512960 2020-12-27 06:36:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Jasper_Reviews I agree with ya. It's not that bad at all.  But people like dumping on it because that's what the cool kids do
1342962128395915265 2020-12-27 06:34:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 Of course she doesn't know what it means. She and the rest of her anti-Semitic ilk don't care. They even excuse the Holocaust and Hamas' attempted genocide of Jews.  They are, in short, bigoted hypocritical assholes who get high off their own self-righteous supply.
1342961200901058560 2020-12-27 06:31:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 People like that go out of their way to be offended. And, in doing so, prove their own bigotry.  She is a hateful person.
1342960831089291266 2020-12-27 06:29:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter  https://t.co/48vfuFDThR
1342960199133523970 2020-12-27 06:27:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 Wow, that's a disgusting display of antisemitism!
1342958766292140035 2020-12-27 06:21:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner @UnpaintedMelody Wut?
1342958408908025856 2020-12-27 06:20:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner @UnpaintedMelody Ja
1342957913774694400 2020-12-27 06:18:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Paul_thePullbox Problem is in this day and age, sometimes even the most basic thing needs to be repeated...because people on the net are DUMB
1342957773156478978 2020-12-27 06:17:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> Well, I think this Western is ready to go to the next stage.  My editor needs to do one more editing pass to check BUT I think we'll start looking at artists soon. Perhaps even this coming week.
1342956534683344896 2020-12-27 06:12:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Bosco685 Yep, it's aggravating
1342956261944553472 2020-12-27 06:11:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman @schiekapedia yeah that's what I thought first too XD
1342953431334588416 2020-12-27 06:00:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Bosco685 Exactly! I don't get the hate AT ALL
1342951260736151560 2020-12-27 05:51:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC Possibly?  (Plus I don't game that often these days, but when I do, it does tend to be in hours long spurts)
1342950397980385282 2020-12-27 05:48:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Paul_thePullbox Yet it has to be repeated because way too many people didn't get the memo :/
1342949838221139969 2020-12-27 05:46:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BlackMajikMan90 @RICHARDLNEWBY Agreed, Time will be much kinder
1342949526009733126 2020-12-27 05:44:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DavidRF34 yep
1342948995036033027 2020-12-27 05:42:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Paul_thePullbox As long as you aren't a dick about it too
1342948653066051584 2020-12-27 05:41:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC See, first person view tends to make me queasy after a while so I dunno how I'd react to VR
1342948528843354112 2020-12-27 05:40:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RobinCook I mean....I have ideas.
1342948377441554448 2020-12-27 05:40:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Inquisitive_Elf That's more even keeled than a lot of the "reactions" I've seen
1342942958212030464 2020-12-27 05:18:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> Thank goodness for retail therapy
1342937334489239563 2020-12-27 04:56:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 @MOVIESTVMAD God these people are just...*sigh*
1342936069466185729 2020-12-27 04:51:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jpalmiotti I enjoyed it enough on my TV; but I can understand why seeing it on the big screen is another experience altogether
1342933575776264193 2020-12-27 04:41:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 @GalGadot yep
1342933285618520064 2020-12-27 04:40:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ClaireRedacted They don't care. They're antisemites who want us Jews to have no self-determination.
1342932784571154433 2020-12-27 04:38:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 @GalGadot These are people who are Jew hating bastards.  They don't want us to be safe, have self determination, or exist.  A fucking pox on these putzes!
1342932230738423808 2020-12-27 04:36:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard Possibly lol.  It's just that it's so freaking frustrating that people are going out to piss on the hard work and joy of others.
1342930713092485121 2020-12-27 04:30:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> Oh look, the antisemites are out to cancel Gal Gadot/Wonder Woman...again.
1342929465639374849 2020-12-27 04:25:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jackinovic @PaulAlexandria @AGramuglia They're only complaining about the length because it's DC.  Avengers Endgame was 3 hours. CA:CW was at least 2.5
1342928706398871553 2020-12-27 04:22:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan HBOMax is great. I've binged Watchmen, Lovecraft Country, and started Deadwood.  Plus it has the entire Studio Ghibli library
1342927806771113985 2020-12-27 04:18:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brykotyk yep.  Yet so many people are that.
1342927101968711681 2020-12-27 04:15:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MrNiceGuy18_58 the suits and the Tumbler....
1342926050532200448 2020-12-27 04:11:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RICHARDLNEWBY @markhughesfilms Tell me about it.  So many people already have the knives out
1342917681369010178 2020-12-27 03:38:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 LOL  I meant to blame the film's "failure" on  Emphasis on quotes because we both know those ZS buzzards went in wanting to hate it
1342916351594295300 2020-12-27 03:33:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 They don't care; they just want a villain
1342914264831504387 2020-12-27 03:24:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Exitoverhere So many people, for various BS reasons, went in wanting to tear this apart
1342914065845399552 2020-12-27 03:23:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrandonDavisBD 8
1342909869800742913 2020-12-27 03:07:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> I can't wait for any joy I have from watching something DC related be stomped on in three months, and then three months after that.  *sigh*  (Note: not in the mood for your negative hot takes.)
1342908334920396803 2020-12-27 03:01:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SutterCaneLPs @GwenLovesMovies yep
1342908117651173378 2020-12-27 03:00:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GwenLovesMovies Because people are aholes.
1342907042630131713 2020-12-27 02:56:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip IYO :P
1342906954952437761 2020-12-27 02:55:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CatStaggs Better him than that other Prat(t)
1342906652094320641 2020-12-27 02:54:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @markhughesfilms Yep.  Though it's tempting given how many people just want to crush the joy of others
1342906367003262978 2020-12-27 02:53:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip Oh I made a whole post earlier comparing how the reactions to TLJ and WW84 are similar and how both definitely did some subversion of expectations.
1342905631771144192 2020-12-27 02:50:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @markhughesfilms yep
1342905397691166720 2020-12-27 02:49:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip Them and Cass Cain fanatics ^^;
1342905265113468933 2020-12-27 02:48:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ronmarz @WonderWomanFilm It's a fun film that unfortunately already being maligned
1342905068899725317 2020-12-27 02:48:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SarabethPollock yep
1342904919666417666 2020-12-27 02:47:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip Or that it hasn't come across my social media as often because often people just swallow whatever the mouse gives them
1342904780423884801 2020-12-27 02:47:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip People seem to still have claws out for BoP, sadly :/
1342904478572412930 2020-12-27 02:45:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip Since WHEN?!
1342904416219836416 2020-12-27 02:45:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ronmarz @bryanedwardhill There are so many people in this world who need to work themselves into a lather of rage just to get a dopamine fix.  It's profoundly scary and depressing.
1342903478205755392 2020-12-27 02:41:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip Trust me, if it was a Marvel film, people would be giving it much more of a pass.  It seems that the DC level just makes them apply a microscope for flaws they don't do for any other franchise.  And people went into this film with their claws out.
1342902817460252675 2020-12-27 02:39:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HYeahTeenSupers That seems to be ALL fandoms now: toxic AF
1342902761835397121 2020-12-27 02:39:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RICHARDLNEWBY It's gonna be aggravating
1342902152025563136 2020-12-27 02:36:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @heytherejeffro @DanSlott far too many "fans", sadly :(
1342901824219533312 2020-12-27 02:35:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AGramuglia Oh, so you ran into that bunch of crazies.  Saw their galaxy brain post earlier, had to roll my eyes
1342901584192266243 2020-12-27 02:34:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RonJoseph717 People are just being nasty over it for no good reason
1342901459541745664 2020-12-27 02:33:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @bryanedwardhill Both, in balance and as needed for the film
1342901239252660226 2020-12-27 02:32:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers So why do people seem to get shirty with this in ONE SPECIFIC franchise?
1342901024722481152 2020-12-27 02:32:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman Yep!
1342885276818034699 2020-12-27 01:29:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @anerdwonder @Comic_Law @AGramuglia yep
1342884071475736577 2020-12-27 01:24:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @anerdwonder @Comic_Law @AGramuglia Yep.  I mean, look at the massive epics from the 50s. Those are 3-4 hours long!
1342883973614235650 2020-12-27 01:24:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @dan_raga yep
1342882326141919232 2020-12-27 01:17:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @dan_raga No, this one tends to land on his feet.  His parents, on the other hand....
1342880888980451332 2020-12-27 01:12:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> The daring young man on the flying trapeze
1342877612809576451 2020-12-27 00:59:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Comic_Law @AGramuglia Still, my overall point is correct :P  Plus Marvel films have similar run times to WW84, yet no complaints.  Plus all the complaints about the "cheese" in WW84...but not Thor Ragnarok or the overall bathos issue in the MCU?  It's just so...gah!!!
1342876232216694787 2020-12-27 00:53:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Comic_Law @AGramuglia yep.  The hypocrisy is endless
1342875002287366149 2020-12-27 00:48:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheInspecter trust me, it isn't either :/
1342870474653577217 2020-12-27 00:30:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @therealukecage @theanglo_files yep
1342869732513492992 2020-12-27 00:27:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> THIS! THIS RIGHT HERE!!!
1342869011000926211 2020-12-27 00:24:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @theanglo_files THIS!!! THANK YOU!!!
1342868672948416512 2020-12-27 00:23:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @NewTSage @ComicsExalted They really do hyperanalyze DC for flaws (real and imagined) don't they?
1342865138555244544 2020-12-27 00:09:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> Left the house to run errands, crossed the street...and realized I wasn't wearing a mask.  Good thing I keep one in my coat pocket, but I was panicking for a quick sec.
1342863211645837317 2020-12-27 00:01:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrooklynBatman_ Because they are toxic af?
1342862959836594179 2020-12-27 00:00:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AGramuglia Or sat through a 3 hour Avengers film
1342854469344751622 2020-12-26 23:27:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @gadotsquinn Agreed
1342851499404222466 2020-12-26 23:15:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cole_eliot @AGramuglia @mvbrat91 It's good.
1342851392092983296 2020-12-26 23:14:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> If you go out of your way to nitpick or look for something to get angry over, you'll end up not enjoying anything.
1342850614188003342 2020-12-26 23:11:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBringer Well, as @Eskivoart has been saying:  Knightwrath is coming... :)
1342849914179620865 2020-12-26 23:09:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cole_eliot @crazylemur @AGramuglia @mvbrat91 I didn't think so. I felt it was quite vibrant, especially that scene
1342849745723777025 2020-12-26 23:08:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBringer Coincidentally, already working on a project with him XD
1342846050281906185 2020-12-26 22:53:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @crazylemur @AGramuglia @mvbrat91 100% agreed
1342844371658567682 2020-12-26 22:47:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @crazylemur @AGramuglia @mvbrat91 Exactly.  But it's a DC movie, so people are going to go out of their way to dump on it. :/  Not to mention the ZS cultists wanting to harm it for BS and sexist reasons  And they're attacking it for things they give other franchises a pass on.
1342842848534810628 2020-12-26 22:40:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Reason1975 Nah, someone went on a "the whole movie is racist/sexist/etc" analysis that frankly is BS.  It's a microscope looking for every possible microaggression. That's not good film criticism.
1342841711026991106 2020-12-26 22:36:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @bryanedwardhill I really enjoyed it
1342841441073115137 2020-12-26 22:35:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> I just saw a "woke" (emphasis on quotation marks) take on WW84 that made me just roll my eyes.  Some people will go to great lengths to get angry.....
1342840876834435073 2020-12-26 22:33:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @charliemcelvy @PixarSoul @WonderWomanFilm Enjoy!!
1342836164428967937 2020-12-26 22:14:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AGramuglia @mvbrat91 Basically.  Oh, I *KNOW* that (thanks to the actions of the ZS cult) people are primed to rip that one shreds.  It was bad enough one critic of WW84 said in her review she went in going to rip it to shreds because "reasons", now imagine Newton's Third Law thanks to toxic fans
1342835754045755394 2020-12-26 22:12:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ashleylynch Yep. They can't just enjoy themselves on a bit of fun
1342835044809912320 2020-12-26 22:09:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @IllustratorRcn Exactly, and that's the SANE way of watching films.  Somehow people have forgotten that!
1342834127666622465 2020-12-26 22:06:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @IllustratorRcn yep.  They've forgotten how to sit back and enjoy
1342833936209227778 2020-12-26 22:05:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> I unapologetically love #WW84 and I think time will be kinder towards it.  If you can't handle that truth, piss off.
1342833685582626816 2020-12-26 22:04:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BlackMajikMan90 Yeah, way too many people going out of their way to be nasty over others enjoying a movie they did not.
1342832833547657222 2020-12-26 22:01:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @IllustratorRcn Not to mention the ZS cult.  WW84 is unfortunately the Judas Goat for many assholes to pin their anger on
1342832452327370752 2020-12-26 21:59:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AGramuglia @mvbrat91 And I agree.  But I think both you and I would agree that WAY too many people are overreacting too harshly
1342829437767839744 2020-12-26 21:47:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AGramuglia @mvbrat91 Right
1342829399658401792 2020-12-26 21:47:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> I think I hit the crux of why people are bashing WW84.  Part of it is general DC bashing. Part of it is the ZS cult going nuts.  The main reason is, like TLJ, it subverts expectations. And in this day and age of toxic fandom, that somehow is a mortal sin.
1342828895347863554 2020-12-26 21:45:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JAMALIGLE And in both situations, the reactions are so aggravating
1342828503738310657 2020-12-26 21:43:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AGramuglia @JosephGlass I think it's a TLJ situation. It subverts expectations so to a bunch of jerks, its bad.  Add in the general DC bashing and you get this bunch of bs reactions
1342828151588741121 2020-12-26 21:42:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AGramuglia @mvbrat91 Because it subverts their expectations, ergo its bad?
1342827906976919552 2020-12-26 21:41:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @IllustratorRcn Yep
1342827701997105152 2020-12-26 21:40:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JAMALIGLE Agreed.  I think many of the tantrums over it is due to the fact that it (like a certain Star Wars flick) subverts expectations
1342827419582005250 2020-12-26 21:39:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 ZS cultists are a toxic, sexist lot
1342787979094470656 2020-12-26 19:02:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone Either, but I lean towards Wonder Woman
1342787435458162689 2020-12-26 19:00:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip A nuanced opinion? How dare you! :P
1342785654225252352 2020-12-26 18:53:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC I was just tossing and turning. (Obviously checking my phone did not help)
1342706349206077442 2020-12-26 13:38:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Paul_thePullbox And yet people give it a pass for so many films...until this one....  The hypocrisy of fans is galling.
1342705279151054848 2020-12-26 13:34:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Paul_thePullbox Ah see, many of the people I'm kvetching about are being somewhat hypocritical
1342703376346308608 2020-12-26 13:26:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> What am I doing on social media via my phone? Back to bed!
1342702689919053824 2020-12-26 13:24:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Paul_thePullbox Do you have those same issues with the movies of other franchises when they do the same thing?
1342699666178191361 2020-12-26 13:12:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams All over the map...  (Kinda half asleep here so hard to remember specifics. One person was complaining about the length. They sat through movies of the same length before!)
1342698859873652736 2020-12-26 13:08:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carolcollector I've seen some very uncivil "critiques" elsewhere.
1342698419211685893 2020-12-26 13:07:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carolcollector I know right...its like "how dare this movie bring joy to others!"  People are being such putzes
1342697862463950850 2020-12-26 13:04:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> Funny, half the stuff they're bashing WW84 for is stuff that occurs in other franchises that they ignore or give a pass to....
1342695000790999042 2020-12-26 12:53:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AGramuglia People are being overly harsh to it. :/
1342692239957483520 2020-12-26 12:42:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JChetHeal @ComicBook I'm aware. The ZS extremists are still attacking it
1342662949547225089 2020-12-26 10:46:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> gonna head to bed early. :)  Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays :)
1342661553569599495 2020-12-26 10:40:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams Yep! Exactly.  I mean, I know why the ZS extremists hate it, but why do some others?
1342659524663140353 2020-12-26 10:32:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams I know, right? I don't know why some people are being such sourpusses over this!!
1342658029939011584 2020-12-26 10:26:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @lachwriter yep!
1342657185441046528 2020-12-26 10:23:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @lachwriter Agreed.  I just wish others weren't going out of their freaking way to piss on the enjoyment of others.
1342655061441323008 2020-12-26 10:14:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Cosmic_Oracle Yes
1342654053877223427 2020-12-26 10:10:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brykotyk @MichaelSacal Exactly.  But OMFG, people are being such PRICKS about it (and hypocrites too)
1342651514230341632 2020-12-26 10:00:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brykotyk @MichaelSacal The ZS cult is SERIOUSLY deranged
1342641139460038657 2020-12-26 09:19:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> Cynicism needs to be destroyed; it's poisoning everything
1342639187695165440 2020-12-26 09:11:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @frankee_white Enjoy!
1342633901399932930 2020-12-26 08:50:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @EmoComicWriter Pretty much, yeah
1342631633862729728 2020-12-26 08:41:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicBook People just want to cause fandom wars.  And the ZS cult just wants to go out of the way to be toxic and dump on this (and all other non ZS directed) DC movies
1342631396741963781 2020-12-26 08:40:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brian_shoots @Mikey_hbk90 yep!
1342631271307108354 2020-12-26 08:40:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone It's so fun!
1342630959091474432 2020-12-26 08:39:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal Sure, Jan.
1342630931216130050 2020-12-26 08:38:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brian_shoots @Mikey_hbk90 I have, and I enjoyed it
1342630674663149568 2020-12-26 08:37:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brian_shoots @Mikey_hbk90 yep
1342630648574574596 2020-12-26 08:37:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brian_shoots @Mikey_hbk90 Oh yeah, there's a lot of people bashing WW84 over things they readily give Marvel a pass for
1342630525756911623 2020-12-26 08:37:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal Doesn't mean they're telling the truth OR that they even seen the movie and are just making shit up
1342630267580723206 2020-12-26 08:36:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brian_shoots @Mikey_hbk90 Yep, bots and ZS cultists
1342630157811593217 2020-12-26 08:35:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @EmoComicWriter Exactly.  But people had their claws out to go after this movie (there's a particularly badly done review at Vulture where the critic even admitted she went in wanting to rip it to shreds)
1342629932648845314 2020-12-26 08:34:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal That's not what I'm seeing
1342627307371028481 2020-12-26 08:24:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @EmoComicWriter Exactly.  But some people are acting like its garbage that somehow committed mortal sins....
1342622808636071941 2020-12-26 08:06:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @danmcdaid Can I find both Juan and this Scott guy to be fucking pretentious twits?
1342622659780210688 2020-12-26 08:06:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> Well, the DC hate brigade is definitely working overtime now since most audience reactions seem to be positive.....
1342622184527814657 2020-12-26 08:04:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @danmcdaid it's good
1342618659416645633 2020-12-26 07:50:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BenTheKahn None, but I loved every second
1342618319338295297 2020-12-26 07:48:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @lachwriter Such a fun film.  But of course the ZS cult and other assorted curmudgeons are being a bunch of Grinches. But I think the majority of the audience enjoyed it so there :)
1342609563351179264 2020-12-26 07:13:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos yep.  But still...these bozos literally create their own narratives and realities.  They're basically Trumpsters.
1342609105425469441 2020-12-26 07:12:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 People are just aholes
1342608892417761280 2020-12-26 07:11:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos yep.  They really don't get defamation laws, do they
1342608370700840962 2020-12-26 07:09:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos Oh I saw one putz claim Patty is sleeping with Geoff Johns and plotting to ruin Zack.  These guys have gone BEYOND paranoid now.
1342608173983813634 2020-12-26 07:08:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @PattyJenks @GailSimone @WW84 It was excellent! BRAVA!
1342607937022341121 2020-12-26 07:07:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 I think its just ZS cultists/DC bashers making shit up to harm the film
1342607836774330372 2020-12-26 07:07:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KurtBelcher Because people are aholes
1342607584189145088 2020-12-26 07:06:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> So the ZS fanatics are going after WW84, making up BS to slander the director, etc.  Good for them. That will SO make people want to watch TSC in March. *eyeroll* Punkass putzes....

1342461873158041604 2020-12-25 21:27:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> Ugh. Bunch of high school nightmares. Not good.

1342278178589581313 2020-12-25 09:17:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @bywordofmaus I don't think so....  I think they just want to be constantly in a lather of anger.
1342275306363756544 2020-12-25 09:05:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip It's more the cult like stanning and gnashing and throwing tantrums.   But hey, you go and assume.
1342263275287949312 2020-12-25 08:17:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> (Seriously, people, don't "stan" politicians to the point it becomes a cult. Otherwise, you get something like the Trumpsters!)
1342260491406745610 2020-12-25 08:06:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> Tonight's Christmas Movie: Rare Exports  Or as as my folks call it "Evil Finnish Santa"
1342259629225603074 2020-12-25 08:03:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> Seriously, this is what I want to say to this Trump enabling "Leftist"  https://t.co/prpX5AYymI
1342258463431393280 2020-12-25 07:58:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> *eyeroll*  This is pathetic.
1342239609342857217 2020-12-25 06:43:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Remender This is something I needed to hear.
1342239592615997446 2020-12-25 06:43:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> This is something I needed to hear.  I've been beating myself up for not writing every day; but he's right. If I did, I'd end up hating it.
1342238024986460161 2020-12-25 06:37:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Trickyhours As much as I hate to say it, bye bye Harry Potter.

1342232420427444228 2020-12-25 06:15:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RonGOPVet4Biden Poisonous, vile, and full of hate.
1342231208265191425 2020-12-25 06:10:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RobinCook For tomorrow? Possibly.   She is cooking tonight though ^^;   Usually we'd see a movie and eat out afterwards (or beforehand) tomorrow
1342221680207392768 2020-12-25 05:32:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBlaquesmith *bows*
1342219980956430337 2020-12-25 05:25:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> Me: So, what take out should we get tomorrow?  Mom: I was thinking of cooking.  Me: *dramatic gasp*  Mom: What?  Me: We have a TRADITION! A JEWISH TRADITION!  Mom: ...I'll think on it.
1342217396052963334 2020-12-25 05:15:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> A reminder:  Your SUBJECTIVE OPINION about a movie/comic/etc does not make it OBJECTIVE FACT
1342209967118561291 2020-12-25 04:46:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @graphicpolicy They probably aren't....  A lot of people complain,  BUT they never put their money where their mouth is

1342200967425646592 2020-12-25 04:10:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Yep. (Plus dear Lord, his jacket budget must be enormous!)

1342197467492843520 2020-12-25 03:56:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AlexPaknadel Yep :)
1342197403022217217 2020-12-25 03:56:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> Sorry, but after the shit loonies have thrown at him over this, I will forgive the petty move he pulled here.  Especially because I know of one REALLY CREEPY fanboy who I swear Bendis should take out a restraining order against.
1342196810941689856 2020-12-25 03:53:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AlexPaknadel Thanks :) I had a bit of a depression spiral along these lines last week ^^;

1342194091816325123 2020-12-25 03:43:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @QueenMab87 The people complaining don't care. They just want to complain
1342192503211089923 2020-12-25 03:36:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 People just want to be aholes
1342191501510586376 2020-12-25 03:32:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> OH FOR THE LOVE OF...EVERY time I post anything POSITIVE about Star Wars, some chucklehead has to be a Grinch about it!  I hate Sequel Trilogy bashers/Fandom Menace twits; I REALLY do.

1342152727183433730 2020-12-25 00:58:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> One of my earliest Holiday AND Theater memories is seeing the big Broadway musical of A Christmas Carol at the Theater at MSG when I was 6.  So happy I rediscovered the soundtrack to it this holiday season.
1342150652219305986 2020-12-25 00:50:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @schiekapedia Trafe! 😝
1342150381028188161 2020-12-25 00:49:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass I got most of it.   This American has watched a LOT of British TV (thanks PBS!)
1342149757481996295 2020-12-25 00:46:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JoshCrewsReally @MWDanvers And most of the "RP" is attacking Bendis.  This is a middle aged man we are talking about
1342149324306853896 2020-12-25 00:45:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JoshCrewsReally @MWDanvers Oh and it gets worse.  He created an RP account where he pretends he's Jon. Its creepy AF.
1342147412513746945 2020-12-25 00:37:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JoshCrewsReally @MWDanvers He's declared all the Supes titles "ruined" because of it
1342146349278629888 2020-12-25 00:33:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JoshCrewsReally @MWDanvers I know of someone who obsessively hates him because of the aging up of Jon.
1342145322492059655 2020-12-25 00:29:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers Yeah some fans are really out there and I actually fear for the safety of some comic creators.
1342132741740113921 2020-12-24 23:39:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrianLHawkins Nice! :D
1342131707022102528 2020-12-24 23:35:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DialHForHagai The latter feeds the former
1342128693813129217 2020-12-24 23:23:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> Listening to the soundtrack of A Muppet Christmas Carol to ATTEMPT to get into the holiday spirit.
1342127874552307713 2020-12-24 23:19:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @yourpalchauncey @luiscandelari20 And that's why he's the BEST Scrooge
1342126325113479171 2020-12-24 23:13:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @NancyNorthcott Agreed
1342126232368869376 2020-12-24 23:13:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @grantandstuff Agreed.
1342125937803075590 2020-12-24 23:12:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> Get at least three quality projects crowdfunded and sent out
1342123964081074178 2020-12-24 23:04:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @nytimes Frick the GOP!  I don't want to hear "both sides are the same" rhetoric anymore.
1342123889581821952 2020-12-24 23:04:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> Frick the GOP!
1342123264617885698 2020-12-24 23:01:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> And of course the GOP blocked the $2000 stimulus checks.  I don't want to hear "both sides are the same" rhetoric anymore.
1342123103988690945 2020-12-24 23:00:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> FRICK THE GOP!!!

1342100558472208384 2020-12-24 21:31:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted I shipped a package to Australia that was supposed to be there before Christmas....so far no news.  AND I was supposed to get a package last week that still hasn't arrived even though it finally showed up in Brooklyn YESTERDAY!
1342098862836752385 2020-12-24 21:24:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> I am IMMENSELY disappointed in the USPS this month.  But the blame for their inability to deliver on time can be laid at the feet of Trump and DeJoy; not the hardworking postal workers.
1342095223040696321 2020-12-24 21:10:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BatComixChris @creepyshrek1 @BrooklynBatman_ Oh so you're one of THOSE wackos
1342092920871120897 2020-12-24 21:01:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BatComixChris @creepyshrek1 @BrooklynBatman_ Of course its relevant. Can't have the movies without the comics ie source material.
1342088202862141442 2020-12-24 20:42:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SuperWinterGirl @creepyshrek1 @BrooklynBatman_ Odd is a bit of an understatement.  But he is known to napalm bridges ^^;
1342087717874757632 2020-12-24 20:40:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BatComixChris @creepyshrek1 @BrooklynBatman_ Then why does he wish the PUBLISHER DC Comics fail?
1341952218946281472 2020-12-24 11:41:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Johnbatusijack I got through the remake fine lol  Though my first one was Cat Ballou
1341946449857273861 2020-12-24 11:19:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> So overall opinion of Once Upon A Time In The West.  Very good. BUT certain scenes/beats linger a bit too long.  This is a 2 hr 40 min film; a good 10 minutes would have been trimmed just if they picked up the pace!

1341856092968669185 2020-12-24 05:19:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted @MWDanvers then what is their main inventory?
1341855869580042240 2020-12-24 05:19:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted @MWDanvers what the heck do they sell then? Backissues?
1341854093405511681 2020-12-24 05:12:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers I think they bought into some alt-right kool-aid along with the "bash DC no matter what" bandwagon.  They're being such putzes

1341815394441506822 2020-12-24 02:38:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Marvinwynn Yes but openly defying COVID lockdown laws to sing Christmas carols and potentially spread disease is pretty bad.

1341793819818377217 2020-12-24 01:12:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Philjimeneznyc I saw it on Broadway and enjoyed it.  Haven't seen the film yet.
1341793439046918144 2020-12-24 01:10:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman I just want the likes
1341793368112836611 2020-12-24 01:10:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> The soldier out of time, the boy from Brooklyn
1341792913471262725 2020-12-24 01:08:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman Yep.  Going over my Western's first arc with one editor and working on the lettering pass of American Dreams issue 5 with another.
1341792644712771584 2020-12-24 01:07:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KurtBelcher Same
1341779190673227777 2020-12-24 00:14:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @aubreysitterson I do provide plenty of references though ^^;
1341778657111642118 2020-12-24 00:12:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @santiagomayer_ yep
1341778220207751170 2020-12-24 00:10:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @aubreysitterson Well that's unfair to me; I got a LEGIT motor skills issue!  (I'm actually dead serious on this; I can't draw to save my life)
1341777977114316801 2020-12-24 00:09:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 Ah but the fans are PROGRAMMED to whine if they don't get their way
1341777652441595906 2020-12-24 00:08:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip Yeah, the ZS cult are just...oy....
1341758750311497729 2020-12-23 22:53:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> So I just bought the #FF7R extended soundtrack. :D  https://t.co/GGZp1tYfog
1341745964776878080 2020-12-23 22:02:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBringer Cool I'll take a look
1341745010635657216 2020-12-23 21:58:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBringer Maybe closer to $100 per page for pencils or pencils/inks?  Because $245 per page, for pencils only, is a bit much for a little guy like me ^^;
1341743880421707782 2020-12-23 21:54:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBringer His page rate might be WAY out of my price range, if his website is up to date
1341743307303645185 2020-12-23 21:51:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> Per @carmengoesthwip , Batman being Jewish is confirmed as he performs a traditional Jewish gravesite custom!  https://t.co/64t1mZMm4u
1341743127376359425 2020-12-23 21:51:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip EXCELLENT!!!
1341733165975695362 2020-12-23 21:11:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBringer Nice!
1341697348532113412 2020-12-23 18:49:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBringer I'll have to look him up

1341576792319156226 2020-12-23 10:50:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip @brookstweetz yep.  But then again, too many closed minds at this point :/
1341575868863426561 2020-12-23 10:46:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @zakiscorner Seriously, some "fans" are a toxic cesspool.
1341574979977162754 2020-12-23 10:42:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HawaiiDelilah @Marmel Brilliant!
1341574573540716551 2020-12-23 10:41:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheRealHoarse I'm hoping purity progressives apologize to her, but I ain't holding my breath.
1341571650526044160 2020-12-23 10:29:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Marmel @SpeakerPelosi Yep.  I bet the purity "progressives" look mighty stupid over attacking her now :)
1341568998937387012 2020-12-23 10:19:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> Speaking of projects I'm working on, @Eskivoart comes out with page after awesome page every week :D  Excited to bring Knightwrath to you guys when it is ready!

1341562140730281984 2020-12-23 09:51:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brookstweetz It was turned into a cudgel to attack the film
1341561491015819264 2020-12-23 09:49:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> As much as I like @ArtOfTimBrown 's suggestion (and BOY would I love to make it happen), I think this artist is probably out of my price range for the Western (but OMG imagine the vistas he could paint!)  https://t.co/AHjEx1I5PV
1341561079030292480 2020-12-23 09:47:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DavidMann95 hehehe!

1341554816024268800 2020-12-23 09:22:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> I need to go looking for an artist for this Western soon....  :)

1341508592210501633 2020-12-23 06:19:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Phantomskyler Agreed.  And so many "progressives" and "leftists" are just doing the GOP's bidding

1341479684022874121 2020-12-23 04:24:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheMakCave @RyanHigginsRyan Yep.  They're not very good business people
1341477934780002308 2020-12-23 04:17:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Amy_Siskind @RobinCook @newtgingrich @WashTimes Arrest Gingrich!
1341477708543438855 2020-12-23 04:16:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheMakCave @RyanHigginsRyan I forget, but some people threw some major tantrums when DC quit Diamond, and I guess some are doubling down
1341476584268722185 2020-12-23 04:11:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @James_Blundell NP!!

1341475505091059713 2020-12-23 04:07:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheMakCave @RyanHigginsRyan There's been a couple petty stores doing so
1341475350174445568 2020-12-23 04:07:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jesterlou Comics are for everyone; but kids shouldn't be forgotten.
1341475059458846724 2020-12-23 04:05:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @James_Blundell Well then, you were more of an editor then :)
1341474301179006977 2020-12-23 04:02:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @IVWall Same
1341473599564210179 2020-12-23 04:00:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @James_Blundell Both, I think? Mainly an editor, but script doctoring might slightly apply here? Depends on the situation. If it was a top to bottom overhaul, more scriptdoctoring than editing
1341471346358972416 2020-12-23 03:51:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JustinBirch yikes!

1341458860477997062 2020-12-23 03:01:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TylerWalpole What the BAWK?!

1341408614024683529 2020-12-22 23:41:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> Okay, one of the main characters is Jewish.  Nice to see that :D  #Deadwood

1341386169968422917 2020-12-22 22:12:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> Time to watch Deadwood for the first time ever!

1341381694390235142 2020-12-22 21:54:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> So, hopefully by the end of this week, at least half of the Western's first arc will be edited.  I'm excited to go looking for a potential art team for it; but I might hold it of until we got the first arc's scripts locked down.  But I'm excited to start!
1341380262542848000 2020-12-22 21:49:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AGramuglia She really is horrid

1341216004572123136 2020-12-22 10:56:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CrusaderZero6 Of course.  But also direct your anger, and the MAJORITY of that anger, at the GOP who wanted to give you NOTHING, who wanted to protect companies...  ...oh and who refused to even bring Pelosi's very generous bills to the floor of the Senate.
1341215321399541761 2020-12-22 10:53:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CrusaderZero6 You can be mad.  Just don't make stuff up and lie.
1341214596762316802 2020-12-22 10:50:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CrusaderZero6 Oh there are times where its perfectly justified.  But attacking Pelosi when the blame is solely at the feet of the Turtle? Bad move

1341100503778926600 2020-12-22 03:17:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 It's a cult driven solely by hate and conspiracy theories.
1341100045509287937 2020-12-22 03:15:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Reason1975 They aren't liberal.  Hell, they're not really that progressive.  They're puritans and extremists; and they are Trump enablers
1341099883256754176 2020-12-22 03:15:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Peposed She is so cute!!!!

1341099365335752705 2020-12-22 03:12:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Reason1975 And this is a major "progressive" commentator (who always attacks the Dems, NEVER the GOP) with 200k followers so yeah, not gonna deal with his flying twits
1341099141674504192 2020-12-22 03:12:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @profharbinger Well given that Peter Daou decided to sic his fans at me because I thought he was spouting BS that attacked Pelosi for BS reasons, can you blame me for being hostile towards his kind of "progressive"?
1341098587657256961 2020-12-22 03:09:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> Ya know, blocking that pretentious pompous "progressive" is doing wonders for reducing my stress levels :)
1341097378867245056 2020-12-22 03:05:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @frankee_white @SimoneRagazzoni cool!
1341097086977249284 2020-12-22 03:03:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 yikes
1341096863705964545 2020-12-22 03:03:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Marvinwynn Oh, and now Daou's Rose Twitter lackies are harassing me.   Yeesh.  How DARE I criticize the great and might and always right and pure Peter Daou!  You putzes are proving my point.
1341096465578532865 2020-12-22 03:01:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> Peter Daou, consider yourself BLOCKED for harassment.
1341095245807841281 2020-12-22 02:56:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @peterdaou How about you go after McConnell? You know, the ACTUAL villain.
1341095046226046976 2020-12-22 02:55:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> Oh look, a high profile "progressive" is going after me now because I don't buy his BS.
1341089842738966531 2020-12-22 02:35:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> This is just pathetic....   https://t.co/6l6M4zkBD4
1341087349762043904 2020-12-22 02:25:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Marvinwynn Daou is a Trump enabler who is selectively editing things:  https://t.co/aY5Negv4Qs
1341084488575672322 2020-12-22 02:13:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> The sole party to blame for the miserly "stimulus" checks are the GOP.  The Dems had a much better bill sent to the Senate for MONTHS, and the damn Turtle wouldn't bring it up to a vote because he, and his entire party, are EVIL.  So stop attacking Pelosi/Democrats!
1341077452643287042 2020-12-22 01:45:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> So, obviously, I couldn't fit everything I want to do in this Western's first four issue arc/mini series  But that's what subsequent arcs are for :)  I got some ideas.....  #makingcomics #indiecomics #wildwest #western
1341054102663524356 2020-12-22 00:13:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> All done! And they took me in early!
1341052301910433794 2020-12-22 00:05:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @gbbloom I've had it at my local clinic. My doctor just wanted me to go to the hospital for the specific test
1341048369519751168 2020-12-21 23:50:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @gbbloom Im from Brooklyn, but the easiest testing center I could get to with my doctor's prescription is at NYU Langone
1341041482145345539 2020-12-21 23:22:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeanIzaakse Cool!
1341040718547218434 2020-12-21 23:19:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Yeah that's...not a good situation
1341039512982568961 2020-12-21 23:15:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter At this point, stock up on Pepto, ginger ale, and saltines?
1341039362759340034 2020-12-21 23:14:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan Yep
1341038613014974464 2020-12-21 23:11:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> To put out the fourth issue of American Dreams, if not the 5th as well.  To get more work out there (including Knightwrath and the Western I'm working on)  To do more anthologies
1341038377777414146 2020-12-21 23:10:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC Agreed
1341038271607033861 2020-12-21 23:10:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 Yep.  Why go with that particular phrasing?
1341037907356868609 2020-12-21 23:08:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter You really should see a specialist at this point
1341037517953503232 2020-12-21 23:07:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Phantomskyler @Forbes Yep
1341037310842908673 2020-12-21 23:06:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> Holy--   https://t.co/VXKoIHt4vR
1341034029672509446 2020-12-21 22:53:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> Off to Manhattan to get COVID tested (not that I think I have it, but the office wants to make DOUBLY sure we're ALL in the clear)
1341031524242698240 2020-12-21 22:43:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brentacPrime I second TDKR
1341029675578105856 2020-12-21 22:36:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @davescook I usually write on the weekends, as that's when I have the time ^^;  Though with my office closed until after New Year's, I've had more time
1341029377035931651 2020-12-21 22:34:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @sapphicgeek It's almost as if they just want doom and gloom news about DC, no matter the facts.
1341021264312463362 2020-12-21 22:02:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 @_Tra_EL_ @Adam_LeafsFan Yes, and that's fair.  I was referring more to his comment re: Batman saying "fuck" and HOW he said it.   He isn't exactly building good will outside the already converted.
1341019939906482177 2020-12-21 21:57:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 @_Tra_EL_ @Adam_LeafsFan Exactly.  And it doesn't help that ZS himself keeps catering to this crowd and not attempting to broaden overall appeal
1341019697295331329 2020-12-21 21:56:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Adam_LeafsFan She really is.  But that whole cult needs GJ as the constant enemy, otherwise so much of their conspiracy theories fall apart.
1341018140235489281 2020-12-21 21:50:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone Yep :(
1341014403672641536 2020-12-21 21:35:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> Republicans did everything they could to deny ANY aid to people and to protect businesses from liability.  But sure, go after Pelosi and the Dems for being "impure"....  Twitter "Leftists"/Rose Twitter are such willing tools for the GOP.
1341008478819762177 2020-12-21 21:11:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> Pssst  The Sequel Trilogy of Star Wars is never gonna be retconned away. They're canon.  Cry harder, toxic "fans".
1340987318950346752 2020-12-21 19:47:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> I detest both Cenk and Jimmy Dore as they're both Trump enablers from the Left with their various BS.

1340870399790358528 2020-12-21 12:03:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @gino_obarto Cool!
1340867864417488896 2020-12-21 11:53:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> I got some cats "caroling" under my window.  As I am trying to sleep, their meows and howls aren't really appreciated at the moment....
1340852614867660801 2020-12-21 10:52:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> As excited as I am to start this Western's art process, I'm gonna first work with the editor to make sure the script is locked down tight to produce the best book possible.
1340849405830852610 2020-12-21 10:39:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> Heading to bed soon.  Getting my COVID test tomorrow morning (not that I likely have it, but its a precaution the office wants given certain developments), and the office Zoom holiday party later AND it's my dad's birthday too.  Gonna be a busy day.
1340840494096658432 2020-12-21 10:04:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> Hey @jarredlujan check this out!!
1340835526048444424 2020-12-21 09:44:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @EvaIsAdorable The Dark Knight Returns
1340835102612475907 2020-12-21 09:42:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> 1. Got my 3rd issue of my comic Kickstarted 2. In the last week, wrote a Western miniseries/OGN 3. Got back into D&amp;D
1340827210555527168 2020-12-21 09:11:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip @mattseay_91 @jared_w_bowers @TheMarkRants Oh like I would sell it!
1340826649198276613 2020-12-21 09:09:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip @mattseay_91 @jared_w_bowers @TheMarkRants I own the collected trilogy of that comic, in HARDCOVER :D  (Got it from a Borders Books...and now I feel old)
1340819073710604288 2020-12-21 08:39:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @rynolds_m They just want to set off people to attack DC.
1340815586398498816 2020-12-21 08:25:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> So excited about this Western; I think working on it this week got me out of some creative doldrums.  Plus I got American Dreams #4 hopefully being on KS soon AND Knightwrath as well.  Plus I got a couple other things potentially cooking.  2021 is gonna be a good year for me.
1340809522215006210 2020-12-21 08:01:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @duckhelmet @GailSimone Agreed
1340808815319666689 2020-12-21 07:58:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 SW "fans" are such putzes
1340806271201669124 2020-12-21 07:48:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RobinCook @MarkReadsComics Isn't it always?
1340802811030810627 2020-12-21 07:34:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CeltiC527 ZS Cultists HATE humor. And fun.
1340801935423774723 2020-12-21 07:31:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted Cirque Du Soliel, perhaps?  Big Apple Circus?
1340787124317151232 2020-12-21 06:32:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JoshCrewsReally wtf
1340786910541864960 2020-12-21 06:31:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AGramuglia BoP was mine, no regrets :D  https://t.co/v6zUowUzTG
1340786723542974464 2020-12-21 06:30:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers It's one of the favorite parts of my collection :D
1340786174860922883 2020-12-21 06:28:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers He's been drawing plenty of non DC stuff on his stream the last couple years.  I even won one.  https://t.co/iwxc7CZMMX
1340785859273121794 2020-12-21 06:27:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrooklynBatman_ Because they must find a reason to bash DC.  And they intentionally ignore the fact there is a pandemic happening
1340784080779177986 2020-12-21 06:20:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> Trying to find a full LOTR extended or Star Wars I-IX set on BluRay is apparently a harder task than I thought it would be.
1340765863528566789 2020-12-21 05:07:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicBook Gee, it's not like there is a PANDEMIC going on
1340763108877414402 2020-12-21 04:56:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC Possibly?  https://t.co/n81ypj1J5w
1340761852939218944 2020-12-21 04:51:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC I'd say one shot or graphic novella
1340751783233081345 2020-12-21 04:11:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MammothMerry @stebob1984 Exactly
1340750734787276800 2020-12-21 04:07:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mkraju @heresystudiosll @jaketapper The GOP had values?
1340747127174139914 2020-12-21 03:53:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MattBeutner Agreed; sick of the TLJ/TROS bashing
1340746703750787075 2020-12-21 03:51:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 oh he does the opposite of help
1340746324375990273 2020-12-21 03:50:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 And it's frustrating.  And what's WORSE is that instead of TRYING to get more of a larger audience for the ZSJL; ZS constantly directs his PR towards the "true believers"
1340745294644977670 2020-12-21 03:46:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 I think that's literally the case now.  They've been boiling in a toxic online stew for so long that they can no longer act rationally.
1340744720008491013 2020-12-21 03:43:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 Exactly.  Problem is the ZS cult is PARTICULARY dense and need an enemy ALL THE TIME because they must have never ending anger to trigger dopamine.
1340743382155603970 2020-12-21 03:38:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 JFC, the cult is really going apeshit aren't they?
1340674103636860931 2020-12-20 23:03:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CQShep Definitely something to consider; this is more a spitball as I'm still getting the script edited first before ANY art (cover or interior) begins.  (Plus the special cover might be saved for the eventual first trade but we'll see)
1340673291397246979 2020-12-20 22:59:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CQShep ooo!!!
1340671018017406978 2020-12-20 22:50:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @pittsed_off Somehow my brain went in this direction.  (Hey, I'm Jewish, I get a SLIGHT pass)  https://t.co/0v9bWHa350
1340668591633551360 2020-12-20 22:41:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> I wonder what cool artist I can get for this Western project to do a special cover.  I'd like to see Jim Lee do it...but he'd be so out of my price range, it's not even funny ^^;
1340667971417600002 2020-12-20 22:38:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Goldrushcomic I wanted to do that for the Bruce Lee collection ^^;
1340662603887075332 2020-12-20 22:17:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> I voted for #pepsi, and you?! This is the final battle! PEPSI VS COKE! which one do you think is the winner of THE COLA WARS?! 🍹
1340662520160407553 2020-12-20 22:17:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> So I think two themes come up over and over again in my work XD  -Being Jewish (not necessarily the religious aspect, but the cultural/ethnic group aspect)  -Family, either by blood or by coming together.
1340652500844724224 2020-12-20 21:37:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheEricGoldman yep!

1340650851329781761 2020-12-20 21:30:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DJBawlzy that's fair :)
1340650240395907073 2020-12-20 21:28:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 But if they didn't have their conspiracy theories, they'd have NOTHING. 😈

1340649876925902852 2020-12-20 21:26:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mavericksmovies AND TROS!  But yeah, people using the Mandalorian to bash the sequel trilogy is just turning me off from watching season 2
1340649764833144835 2020-12-20 21:26:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> AND TROS!

1340648835190812672 2020-12-20 21:22:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @lachwriter you will!
1340648799837020163 2020-12-20 21:22:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> People using Mandelorian as a cudgel against the sequel trilogy makes me want to watch the second season LESS. #StarWars

1340452276356444160 2020-12-20 08:21:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheJacWac I watch both, to spite haters :)

1340428340960878595 2020-12-20 06:46:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @frankee_white yep.  I *might* end up divvying it into the 4 chapters as single issues first to save on production costs, but we'll see :)
1340418356135010308 2020-12-20 06:06:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeclusionStudio @Eskivoart @DavidRiveraArt :D
1340417321207214085 2020-12-20 06:02:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeclusionStudio yep, a dark hero/anti-hero written by me with art by @Eskivoart and @DavidRiveraArt
1340411341916549123 2020-12-20 05:39:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Paul_thePullbox Agreed.  But no, it's popular to bash.
1340409631424868354 2020-12-20 05:32:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> THIS! Read the box in the bottom corner!  https://t.co/kDkHhD6ufH
1340399880746004480 2020-12-20 04:53:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> Plus I'd like to thank @frankee_white and the rest of our merry Thursday crew for basically talking me down from making this Western an 18 chapter mega OGN :D  4 issue arc OGNs will be how this story will be told :)
1340396878438010880 2020-12-20 04:41:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> Okay, I'm making 2021 comic plans  -Issue 4 of American Dreams KS, hopefully issue 5 as well -Knightwrath Issue 1 -the Western I've been working on all week (if I KS issue 1 first if not the whole OGN) -Plus anything else that might happen  2021 WILL be my year! :D
1340395445026209792 2020-12-20 04:35:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @EvaIsAdorable I want to see a Batman film open with a musical number at the iceburg lounge a la Temple of Doom, just to throw fanboys for a loop XD

1340373334572326912 2020-12-20 03:08:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers Because  1. It's "different"  2. It's DC, so they're gonna find reasons to kvetch
1340367900700528642 2020-12-20 02:46:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> You! Yes, YOU!!  Why haven't you backed @Team__BEAUTIFUL  's KS yet?!  It's an amazing superhero adventure! Go back it now! NOW I SAY!!!   https://t.co/qBWZbD4dyK
1340367178592378880 2020-12-20 02:43:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> I think I can take the next couple days off from writing, somewhat.  I mean, I wrote half a miniseries/OGN this morning XD I think I'm good for now.  (But in all seriousness, I might need to start writing the second issue of another project to be ahead of the ball)

1340352458103656449 2020-12-20 01:45:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> I got my parents the latest book by President Obama for the holidays; they're really excited to read it!
1340333166310076416 2020-12-20 00:28:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> THIS
1340330705516113920 2020-12-20 00:18:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan Yep; did chapter 3 from 5:30 to 7 something, fell back asleep, then woke up at 9 something and powered through chapter 4 until 10 something.  I guess I felt like I was on a roll and just had to write it all down.
1340328767441526786 2020-12-20 00:10:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan Yep!! :D  (And I finished my volume 1 rough draft WAY ahead of schedule, so victory dance for me as well XD)
1340327849786544129 2020-12-20 00:07:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> I feel nice and accomplished this morning :D  ESPECIALLY considering my dark mood last night XD

1340302249201963011 2020-12-19 22:25:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @EvaIsAdorable @Michael26689428 This, plus the kneejerk "bash DC no matter what"/"hyperanalyze the solicits so we have something to complain about" behavior of "fans"
1340302235029434370 2020-12-19 22:25:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> This, plus the kneejerk "bash DC no matter what"/"hyperanalyze the solicits so we have something to complain about" behavior of "fans"
1340281390332559360 2020-12-19 21:02:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> Me: Ya know, I should just go full bore and finish this arc and write the issue 4 script.  Also Me: I've been up since 5:30; maybe I should get some sleep first.
1340280309976338432 2020-12-19 20:58:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> Something that grinds my gears: "Fans" of two franchises I love (DC and Star Wars) going out of their way to just divide, destroy, etc. That's not fandom, that's just being trolls.
1340277827497811970 2020-12-19 20:48:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jtlarsen Yeah, the purity progressives do their best to hamstring their allies and help Trump

1340270783592091648 2020-12-19 20:20:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 Exactly!
1340270734195757058 2020-12-19 20:20:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @EvaIsAdorable Woke up WAY too early XD but wrote a comic script so it balances out
1340270575546150912 2020-12-19 20:19:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @schiekapedia Definitely :D  After last night's dark time of the soul; I'm feeling extra productive today!  One script down, and another later today!
1340270399574126592 2020-12-19 20:18:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> Can I write a second chapter later today and finish off this first OGN of this western series?   YES I CAN! :D  #comicbooks #comics #makingcomics #amwriting #indiecomics #western #wildwest
1340267928680337408 2020-12-19 20:09:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> So, I'm definitely leaning towards this OGN volume 1 of this Wild West series to be four chapters long.  And on that note, this OGN is therefore now 75% done! :D
1340244089753776129 2020-12-19 18:34:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> Up absurdly early.  So I should write :)  Thinking this first volume of the Western will be 4-5 issues long.
1340238867283238915 2020-12-19 18:13:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers Exactly
1340238446963675137 2020-12-19 18:12:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> Apologies for yesterday's kvetching posts.  I think some old wounds and pains (not to mention self esteem issues) opened back up due to frustrations, some of which were well off the mark.

1340155920857395200 2020-12-19 12:44:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBlaquesmith It does :)
1340155454060716040 2020-12-19 12:42:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBlaquesmith Yeah :(
1340154346563112961 2020-12-19 12:37:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RobinCook Thanks
1340154318482247680 2020-12-19 12:37:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBlaquesmith Thanks.  Its eating at me and I can't sleep.  And what's fucked up is that I'm talking about this on my FB? Nothing.  It feels like my peers don't have my back.
1340154066152910851 2020-12-19 12:36:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RobinCook I feel like I put in this hard work and I dont get acknowledgement or engagement. That I'm on the outside looking in. That I'm overlooked and underappreciated.
1340153828839190529 2020-12-19 12:35:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBlaquesmith It's just that...  I post stuff for my comics that are done or in production and I get no interaction. None. Not even from people at the same publisher.  And it hurts, especially when I see them like, comment, and share everyone else's.
1340153160975978497 2020-12-19 12:33:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBlaquesmith Thanks.  I guess I'm having a wave of frustration and depression over various things that are just crystallizing into a bad moment for me.
1340151672002232321 2020-12-19 12:27:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> I'm not feeling okay right now. Mentally or emotionally.   *sigh* I hate this.
1340147434920525825 2020-12-19 12:10:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter *sigh* I mean I know it will look cool when I eventually binge, but people are just so inconsiderate.   ...damn, I'm just a ray of sunshine tonight aren't I? XD
1340146967138152449 2020-12-19 12:08:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass Or it relaunches in a later month
1340146848615559170 2020-12-19 12:08:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Too late. I haven't watched a single ep of S2 yet and it's all been spoiled for me :/ *sigh*
1340144950583955456 2020-12-19 12:00:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @OldManNamedFudo Thanks 😀
1340144251729022977 2020-12-19 11:57:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @OldManNamedFudo I hope so 😅 I think I needed to vent but it didn't exactly made me happy to post what I did. But at least it's off my chest.  I think I was having similar feelings to when I was a kid and I was always never invited anywhere etc. So it goes back to self esteem issues
1340143257838301184 2020-12-19 11:53:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> Heading to bed before I let what's stewing eat me up ^^;  I think venting a bit helped though.
1340134364672368641 2020-12-19 11:18:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> Carp #Carp  https://t.co/YJ2kiC0Fp8
1340134072434249728 2020-12-19 11:17:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> When you put time, money, blood, sweat, and tears into something, and you show off (what you can) and no one reacts? No one likes, comments, or shares? Yet they do that for a bunch of other people?  That hurts.
1340133711845711874 2020-12-19 11:15:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Tweeted_Tongues True.  But when I'm attempting to promote upcoming issues of American Dreams, issues that are either done or almost there, I get NOTHING. Not on here, not on FB. A bit on Instagram though.  And it...hurts.
1340132414958526464 2020-12-19 11:10:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted seems a bit fishy to me ;)
1340131718079127552 2020-12-19 11:07:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> What the crap is up with this carp thing?
1340130460832284675 2020-12-19 11:02:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MattMinerXVX phew  https://t.co/t8Zw1r9j80
1340130057818390528 2020-12-19 11:01:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MattMinerXVX I hope you're not talking about me? ^^;

1340129131166658561 2020-12-19 10:57:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Paul_thePullbox yep :)  As I said, it's just a general feeling of frustration for the most part.
1340129031778398210 2020-12-19 10:57:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Paul_thePullbox yep :D  It's just that last few days/couple weeks this has been something that's been bothering me, in general.
1340128643142586369 2020-12-19 10:55:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> Oh look, DC "fans" going out of their goddamn way to poopoo the announced DC titles for March....  Putzes.
1340128415790317568 2020-12-19 10:54:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Paul_thePullbox :)
1340128361369260032 2020-12-19 10:54:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Paul_thePullbox Thanks :)  I just feel like I'm laboring in the shadows and getting NO recognition, for anything :( Not by peers, not by friends, nothing.
1340127400185765889 2020-12-19 10:50:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Tweeted_Tongues And what sticks in my craw, for starters, is the top issue.  I make a politics or clever mainstream comics post here or on FB? I get interaction.  I make posts about my own projects? Nothing. No likes. No comments. NOTHING.  So yeah, I'm starting to get pissed.
1340126693172928512 2020-12-19 10:47:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Tweeted_Tongues -No one ever comments on posts about my personal projects  -I feel like I'm ignored by my peers  -I feel like I'm falling behind  -Etc  It's basically a bunch of self esteem issues, among other things, just boiling around.
1340125239217414144 2020-12-19 10:42:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> Feeling kinda frustrated tonight.  All that happy feeling from putting in hard writing work has evaporated.

1340044928416690185 2020-12-19 05:23:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @schiekapedia Awesome!
1340042148759146496 2020-12-19 05:11:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> So yeah, I think in a week or two, I might at least start talking to some artists about concept art, but not full pages yet.  But a thought for the future, what kind of "name" artist should do the cover (or a cover) for the first volume? Hypothetically of course.
1340032800855126018 2020-12-19 04:34:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> Okay, even if I don't start getting pages in for this #Western #wildwest project, I DO want to start getting perhaps some concept art done for it.  #makingcomics #indiecomics
1340031679616978945 2020-12-19 04:30:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GreggKatzman Yep.  Sadly, too many people are invested in the lies at this point :/   But I'm personally VERY excited!
1340031198786183168 2020-12-19 04:28:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Adam_LeafsFan @joshleguern Perhaps he was cleared by the investigation?
1340030796116144141 2020-12-19 04:26:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Phantomskyler Yep.   It's aggravating XD
1340030504016470026 2020-12-19 04:25:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TJatMovies DC Comics fandom?
1340005550185197570 2020-12-19 02:46:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> Okay...I might need officially need an editor for this project, now that I'm going full bore into it.  I also might need to move writing the next chapter to tomorrow as I have D&amp;D on Sunday, and the doctor on Monday.  #amwriting #makingcomics
1340001098107670528 2020-12-19 02:28:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @evanjstern Probably at the hands of an anti-Semitic mob.....

1339999962457919490 2020-12-19 02:24:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan done
1339999413650010114 2020-12-19 02:22:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> Part of me is like "I want an artist to start on this Western project now, even if it might be in fits and starts" and another part of me is "can I even afford to do this now?"  Creator's dilemma.  #makingcomics #indiecomics #amwriting #comics #comicbooks #wildwest #western
1339997545158864897 2020-12-19 02:14:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> Gotta "love" all these "progressives" who are helping the GOP/Trump by attacking the Dems instead of the other way around....
1339997174214615041 2020-12-19 02:13:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @LEBassett @ronmarz Arrest EVERY member of the GOP. From Trump on down.
1339996538144231424 2020-12-19 02:10:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @gbbloom I had a great one...but it disappeared :(  It was black with the Eddy Barrows #1 cover on it
1339995927470350339 2020-12-19 02:08:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DLKeatis Yep, it's just adding to the fandom war AND it's only there to make a swipe at DC
1339995555502678016 2020-12-19 02:06:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stevewmorris Belated Happy Birthday!
1339995233514348547 2020-12-19 02:05:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> I *might* be able to push this Western project to a first six issue OGN, but we'll see; depends on pacing etc.
1339992321472032771 2020-12-19 01:53:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> The 2020 @DCComics holiday card is great!  https://t.co/ypaezIBLuE
1339976736096858116 2020-12-19 00:52:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RobinCook I think some people are just primed to be negative these days no matter what
1339975980086116353 2020-12-19 00:49:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RobinCook I mean, it seems to be everywhere too; FB, Twitter, etc
1339975882816057344 2020-12-19 00:48:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBlaquesmith Or series of them, of 4-5 chapters each, but yes :)
1339975330979848195 2020-12-19 00:46:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone Because those customers are entitled pricks that don't care about others?
1339975115250032641 2020-12-19 00:45:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RobinCook Because comic fans tend to be that way?
1339974342386573314 2020-12-19 00:42:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Tweeted_Tongues yep
1339974297360723969 2020-12-19 00:42:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> Chapter 2 of the western is done!  Who would like to take a look at that and a semi-revised chapter 1?  #amwriting #makingcomics #comicbooks #comics #indiecomics #wildwest #western
1339941451694821376 2020-12-18 22:31:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted Thanks, gonna start after my appointment
1339941400264241152 2020-12-18 22:31:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> Also, after further thought, I was thinking of NOT doing the 18 issues thing.  I'm now thinking maybe do it more like the French bande dessinée, except with chapter title pages. So maybe 4-5 (at the most) chapters per installment until the story is ultimately told?
1339940037178343430 2020-12-18 22:26:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> Gonna start on the second chapter of the Western today. Gonna try to write one out every other day, if not every day.
1339730142642450439 2020-12-18 08:32:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Ivy_Writer_ np!

1339703420635271168 2020-12-18 06:46:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DavidTHazan @JosephGlass oh big time.
1339703361344565249 2020-12-18 06:45:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass @DavidTHazan I do have a couple new character ideas that would be perfect for opening that door, somewhat
1339701990776074242 2020-12-18 06:40:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass @DavidTHazan DC seems to be hesitant to have characters embrace their Jewish roots.  When I get in the door, THAT WILL CHANGE!!!

1339650363171999747 2020-12-18 03:15:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Tweeted_Tongues I only have the first chapter at the moment ^^;  I probably WON'T have enough material; it would be nice but it would also be IMMENSE overkill
1339650155663028232 2020-12-18 03:14:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @danthemcmahon I have that same Damian statue on my bookcase :)

1339646031571668994 2020-12-18 02:57:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby Yeah, that's if I want to keep to the symbolism.  But at the end of the day, that might have to go out the window XD
1339645289905479681 2020-12-18 02:55:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsExalted If I can squeeze everything into 9? Possibly :)
1339644009812209666 2020-12-18 02:49:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> UNLESS I split this project into three volumes of six issues each?  Thoughts?
1339643970750705664 2020-12-18 02:49:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> So, a thought on this "Jewish Western" project.  Initially, I was thinking a symbolic length of 18 issues; as 18 in Hebrew has the same letters as the word for "life".  Put that's 360 pages (if we go 20 pgs per chapter), which might be overkill for a single OGN.
1339635840562114568 2020-12-18 02:17:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard Yep.  Yet so many people DON'T read these days...not even a damn summary!

1339573927337742336 2020-12-17 22:11:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jpalmiotti Definitely.  As a friend on FB said, people just can't seem to accept a movie as "just fun". It's either the best thing ever or complete trash now :/
1339571844312150019 2020-12-17 22:03:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RonJoseph717 oh yeah, that's a great bit.

1339399164665487363 2020-12-17 10:37:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> Not gonna lie; I want full orchestral scores for my comics.  Something John Williams-esque for American Dreams, obviously  For this new project? I'm leaning more Bernstein than Morricone (I just prefer the style and orchestrations of the former than the latter)

1339344569390018564 2020-12-17 07:00:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> Getting a lot of good feedback so far from people who read this first chapter.

All I know I want it to be a mini/maxi series or an OGN that can be split into the former in a pinch.  Or into two OGNs that serve as two acts of a whole.

1339312887794442241 2020-12-17 04:54:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> Chapter 1 script done!  Who wants to read it? :D  #makingcomics #amwriting #indiecomics #comics #comicbooks #western #wildwest

1339273894046396421 2020-12-17 02:19:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @IllustratorRcn @screenrant I'm going by what the article I linked says  I said it's outpacing growth, doesn't mean it has more subscribers.  Point is it's not "failing" like people claim
1339272406507130880 2020-12-17 02:13:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @IllustratorRcn @screenrant It was outpacing D+ in October, the announcement came in November/December....
1339271483110068224 2020-12-17 02:09:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @IllustratorRcn @screenrant Actually, HBOMax ISN'T failing as it had the fastest growth in subscribers the last couple months.   https://t.co/vc50DwSNFC

1339269835402973184 2020-12-17 02:03:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 @screenrant And if WB does do something to compensate, it will likely be ignored.
1339269392090226690 2020-12-17 02:01:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Bosco685 @screenrant @IllustratorRcn yep

1339268587123564544 2020-12-17 01:58:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @IllustratorRcn @screenrant But you get my overall point though, right?

1339267627294797824 2020-12-17 01:54:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @screenrant @IllustratorRcn So WB gets slammed for this, but Disney gets a pass?

1339228678526562306 2020-12-16 23:19:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ProfofEvil They don't reveal every solicit at once.  Patience is a virtue, but I guess snark gets you more popularity.  Oh, and they just started dropping Superman book details:  https://t.co/wX5DE0xLNa
1339225545213693952 2020-12-16 23:07:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @OttoSchmidt72 But does he have a menorah arrow? ;)  (I'd also settle for a latke arrow XD )
1339225156913418244 2020-12-16 23:05:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Finger_Gunzz @mvbrat91 As I said ADMITTEDLY a stretch  But it probably made people not watch the film (and of course they watched it during lockdown and went "why did I believe the crazy rumors?")
1339224947378556929 2020-12-16 23:04:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cloudwrangler Awesome!!

1339212625956233216 2020-12-16 22:15:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GaxTZ No, me as well.

1339211463785930753 2020-12-16 22:11:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @nytimes There is a pandemic going on....
1339211155924013056 2020-12-16 22:09:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Inquisitive_Elf @mvbrat91 Agreed.  I mean, the DC bashing alone.....
1339210373656875010 2020-12-16 22:06:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @philhester I've got two.  But a LOT of absolute editions and omnibi
1339210092277878784 2020-12-16 22:05:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TroNorth Blame the puritans
1339209620733177864 2020-12-16 22:03:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> WTF DOES THIS EVEN MEAN?!  Seriously, I'm anti-Trump as it comes, and even I think this guy's word salad is a MAJOR stretch.  (Also, doesn't really help fight back against claims that Collider is biased against DC....)  https://t.co/VWotzrtt6v
1339208918388662277 2020-12-16 22:01:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Finger_Gunzz @mvbrat91 I think her going out of her way to harm BoP and the fact people believed her lies and spread them like wildfire *MIGHT* be considered harm....but it's admittedly a stretch
1339208129066700805 2020-12-16 21:57:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mvbrat91 In a sane world, yes.  But she pulls the Fox News "some people say...." BS card which technically gives her plausible deniability.
1339205259017728005 2020-12-16 21:46:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> I think I'll start scripting that "Jewish Western" idea either later today or tomorrow.  Kinda a bit on edge at the moment so I don't know it will be this morning...but I do want to start it soon.  #makingcomics #amwriting
1339202918600339459 2020-12-16 21:37:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @washingtonpost No.  The BEST way would be to punish the traitorous GOP!  And to throw Trump in jail!

1339194470433173505 2020-12-16 21:03:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> How should I write this new script?  Full script? Or quasi Marvel style where I break down each page of each chapter and do dialogue later?

1339036378609426433 2020-12-16 10:35:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> Gonna head to bed and begin my semi-isolation.  Fingers crossed!

1339022949379084293 2020-12-16 09:42:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @schiekapedia I should start watching that
1339022397970804736 2020-12-16 09:39:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cloudwrangler yeah, I'm with you on this one
1339019623396757505 2020-12-16 09:28:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cloudwrangler yeah, semi isolating right away, and I have my mask(s) to wear in the house if I have to leave my room. Gonna get tested on Friday  I don't have one, I was using it as metaphor. XD
1339018953843159046 2020-12-16 09:26:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby thanks
1339018920435601408 2020-12-16 09:26:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cloudwrangler I know. I'm just worried I might have caught it (though probably not since the office takes COVID protocols seriously), and I'm worried if I did, I might spread it to my folks.   My dad turns 70 on Monday, this isn't good.
1339018409925865473 2020-12-16 09:24:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @zakiscorner yep. *sigh*
1339018079863496711 2020-12-16 09:22:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> So...I made a monkey paw wish.  I wanted the office closed tomorrow so I didn't have to go in due to the storm.  Well, it's closed alright, though NOT due to the storm.  One of my co-workers popped positive for COVID.  So yeah, bit freaked out.
1339017782583758848 2020-12-16 09:21:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman ...I made a monkey paw wish :/
1339013580386136064 2020-12-16 09:04:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BillBushman @MrNiceGuy18_58 Also true, but intentionally ginning them up for shits and giggles is pretty nasty. IMO at least, brings you down to their level
1339003656889307136 2020-12-16 08:25:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AndyShaggyKorty np!

1338977845062864898 2020-12-16 06:42:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @marcusto I dunno. He doesn't seem the picky type to me.

1338975132581289985 2020-12-16 06:32:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MrNiceGuy18_58 You know why.  You just want to set off the BvS fans.  And you do that nonstop.  Why not talk about things you enjoy versus constantly bashing something?
1338974536973299712 2020-12-16 06:29:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MrNiceGuy18_58 Geez, all you do is troll....
1338933603229700096 2020-12-16 03:47:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @WeGetDubbed @BT_Comics @topcowmatt Thanks!! :D
1338925134082691073 2020-12-16 03:13:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard yep  But now people are too invested in the freaking fan war to move on....
1338924063872471040 2020-12-16 03:09:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard Plus technically they set it up in the DCTV side of things
1338923955667742720 2020-12-16 03:08:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard yep.  But because it's DC, everyone has to piss on it even before production begins. *sighs in annoyed nerd*
1338923269450309632 2020-12-16 03:05:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard Oh no worries, I got it lol  Flash might also be going multiversal; with Affleck AND Keaton reprising their Batman

1338922313799053317 2020-12-16 03:02:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard lol  My main dig is at those looking at the upcoming Flash film and calling it "bloated" too.  Plus there are people now complaining about WW84's run time and I'm like "You sat through a three hour Avengers film..."  So I'm mostly poking fun at fan hypocrisy.  But you're right
1338920722870247428 2020-12-16 02:55:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheMakCave I believe writing and drawing. I'd have to check
1338920040561827840 2020-12-16 02:53:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheMakCave I don't believe it got strong reviews
1338919779252441092 2020-12-16 02:52:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheMakCave Well that's another story lol  I am referring to his Agent X and GI Joe books

1338917858856882176 2020-12-16 02:44:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheMakCave Didn't his recent work fall flat?
1338917461165543428 2020-12-16 02:42:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HeatherAntos That is very weird....
1338917173088169985 2020-12-16 02:41:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> Feeling a bit bloated.
1338917117576540162 2020-12-16 02:41:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> Why is Liefeld doing ARCHIE books?  Granted, he's doing the hero books, but still....

1338915510050844674 2020-12-16 02:35:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers People are just programmed to bash DC no matter what.
1338915223852507144 2020-12-16 02:33:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @matthewplmurphy True, but given the level of scorched earth he went....
1338913709218025473 2020-12-16 02:27:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @matthewplmurphy Well, given that Liefeld is literally on record wishing for DC to collapse? I don't think that will happen without a major mea culpa on his part
1338912332978720770 2020-12-16 02:22:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @matthewplmurphy Given how he burned his bridges, not DC

1338824479091417091 2020-12-15 20:33:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> So @Wksahadewa1  just sent me two awesome colored pages :D  Just waiting on editorial approval :)
1338822097360052224 2020-12-15 20:23:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KatarHol5 Yeah, but it's not helping matters AND it's driving people off versus making them interested.
1338819282151550976 2020-12-15 20:12:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Fair.  We'll see how it is in a few months.  But I do think people would have been more forgiving if  1. He didn't say these things   and   2. His cult wasn't so freaking toxic
1338818223786037249 2020-12-15 20:08:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> Ya know, speaking as someone who is rooting for this revised JL to succeed...it would have a better chance of doing so if ZS SHUT HIS MOUTH! Seriously, he's driving people away instead of convincing them to give it a fair shake.

1338687466916745218 2020-12-15 11:28:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip We'll see.  They basically dropped a (cut off ) F-bomb in Spider-Man Homecoming and no one had an issue with that.
1338686193790291968 2020-12-15 11:23:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBlaquesmith Well Im gonna try to do some small bits and pieces at the office tomorrow; but yeah, we might be told to go home early on Wednesday if the storm hits the NYC area hard
1338684604631445505 2020-12-15 11:17:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> Well, time to bed.  Snowstorm coming in a couple days; wonder if that means work will close early?

1338683402199961600 2020-12-15 11:12:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> All the films are enjoyable; both the ZS extremists and the DC bashers are a bunch of aholes in their own ways
1338682972522881026 2020-12-15 11:11:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @graphicpolicy @trans_rage It's DC, ergo they will bash and go out of their way to do so including being raging hypocrites
1338681219719049218 2020-12-15 11:04:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> DC Bashers: WHY IS DC LETTING BATMAN DROPPED AN F BOMB?!  Nerd please! You didn't have any issue with DEADPOOL; so now you're being MASSIVELY hypocritical.  Hell, they technically dropped it in Spider-Man Homecoming for a LAUGH, and you guts didn't have an issue.

1338674686608207879 2020-12-15 10:38:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @StorytellerJosh Yeah, plus people were already planning to break out the claws from the getgo, this gives them more fuel to prejudice them.
1338672929278713856 2020-12-15 10:31:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> The sad thing is that, despite all the controversies, if the new JL cut is good, people are still going out of their way to bash it because "it's DC".

1338668865010753538 2020-12-15 10:15:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> Watch the ZS JL cut be (potentially) good, yet all the DC bashers will either begrudgingly admit it OR make shit up to bash it  That does seem to their pattern.

1338650207358251022 2020-12-15 09:00:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @vince_gattuso Thanks
1338649694306701314 2020-12-15 08:58:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> Just got an awesome mystery box courtesy of @jpalmiotti @AmandaRantsAlot @paperfilms1   Thanks guys!
1338638282905808898 2020-12-15 08:13:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> Had to break out my menorah for tonight, because the family one needs to be cleaned out ^^;
1338636158310510592 2020-12-15 08:05:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Johnbatusijack ooo
1338630014577872897 2020-12-15 07:40:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Johnbatusijack :D  I should write a chunk of it first (guess what I might start doing at work during quiet times XD)
1338628573180157953 2020-12-15 07:34:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheWordsOfStan yep!
1338628524614311937 2020-12-15 07:34:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Johnbatusijack hehehe
1338627893870665732 2020-12-15 07:32:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheWordsOfStan basically
1338627856159617027 2020-12-15 07:32:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheWordsOfStan lol. I know the fifth issue of American Dreams is almost halfway colored and issue 4 will hopefully be on KS soon.  So HOPEFULLY, trade next year OR 2022.
1338627288963932161 2020-12-15 07:29:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheWordsOfStan I don't know how many I've written; I know I've written copious notes for ideas
1338627179928834049 2020-12-15 07:29:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheWordsOfStan yeah, but sometimes you have to take the plunge.  That or I sell the idea to a company who can pay for an artist and have the publishing rights etc
1338626870825381891 2020-12-15 07:28:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheWordsOfStan yeah, I'm juggling two projects at the moment and it's a lot
1338626766496260096 2020-12-15 07:27:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheWordsOfStan Well, if I can do reimbursement via KS, I might be able to take that route.
1338626340908650497 2020-12-15 07:26:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheWordsOfStan And if I'm financing everything upfront, it's a lot.
1338625553205694472 2020-12-15 07:22:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheWordsOfStan :D  And also the BIG question...how to finance it :O
1338625170525876225 2020-12-15 07:21:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheWordsOfStan I need to write it first and find an artist XD  Debating black and white or minimal color.
1338623606222434306 2020-12-15 07:15:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> Well, with a couple things in the works, and a couple others in flux, I'm wondering what other in progress works I should go back to.  I'm thinking my "Jewish Western" might be something to work on; maybe more as a OGN than a mini series; but we'll see.
1338621717414023174 2020-12-15 07:07:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> So I can't move forward with that project, for now.   I'll just have to bide my time a bit

1338570557911162883 2020-12-15 03:44:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC True, perhaps post COVID ^^;
1338569966220664838 2020-12-15 03:42:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC Fair, I think the closest I have to an author pic is this:  https://t.co/GZfC3uvlWt

1338554116524675077 2020-12-15 02:39:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @myhlee @HaistenWillis Arrest them for sedition!

1338552629480333314 2020-12-15 02:33:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> Get this book, people!!
1338551941836795904 2020-12-15 02:30:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TylerWalpole somewhat, at the very least.  But things can change once writing starts
1338544554723651585 2020-12-15 02:01:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> Talking to an artist about an additional project, or at least just doing designs for now.  It would be a fun project, my take on a prequel to a beloved classic.  "Second Star To The Right And Straight On Till Morning"  https://t.co/LYD7Cdcgdw
1338529944310308864 2020-12-15 01:03:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> I think not only should @SpeakerPelosi refuse to seat the traitorous GOP reps; she should have them arrested for sedition, at the very least.

Still, that's one less writing day. (Unless I write in the office)

1338221070592192512 2020-12-14 04:35:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> Yep!  The plan is to have it after the issue 5 KS (which is when arc 1 is done)
1338220935967612939 2020-12-14 04:35:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @musicgamer460 Yes, though that will likely be after the issue 5 KS
1338220122964701184 2020-12-14 04:31:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> Hopefully the Kickstarter for American Dreams issue 4 will launch soon.  And issue 5 might be ready to go into production soon too.  Until the trade comes out...should I give myself a small break from AD?  I already have issue 6 drafted, so resuming production isn't too hard.  ?

1338207165463617538 2020-12-14 03:40:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> The Lower East Side Rumble Is Coming!  On the temple steps: Liberty!  His opponent? Well, you'll have to tune in and see.

1338204051943591936 2020-12-14 03:28:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> Jimmy Dore and the rest of the "dirtbag left" are Trump/GOP enablers and way too many people fall for their crap
1338202056033701891 2020-12-14 03:20:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> Jimmy Dore is an ahole.  That is all
1338199195057065985 2020-12-14 03:08:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Ozymandias0_1 Well unless you have a first print of issue 1, you ain't seeing it lol
1338173108864348160 2020-12-14 01:25:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AndyShaggyKorty @TheMakCave yes lol
1338163917416230912 2020-12-14 00:48:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Cheekierbobcat mhmm
1338129346503077889 2020-12-13 22:31:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> Me: I can finally play Cyberpunk 2077!  Also Me: *proceeds to play on his Switch instead*
1338125652856365058 2020-12-13 22:16:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DavidTHazan @daniel_ds yep
1338123550046228483 2020-12-13 22:08:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DavidTHazan @daniel_ds I think it means he was raised in his father's faith; but given how rarely Martha is explored.....
1338122245395378176 2020-12-13 22:02:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DavidTHazan @daniel_ds yep! I believe Bob Kane himself was originally a Kahn.

1337957137130135552 2020-12-13 11:06:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard Which is weird b/c I know it streams to my FB by default.  Might be the time of day or algorithm
1337956115561246723 2020-12-13 11:02:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MTFIII @RacialDraftPod they should though, imo.  Would be interesting to explore even a tiny bit
1337953291897073673 2020-12-13 10:51:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MTFIII @RacialDraftPod Well I was working more with the comics canon lol   https://t.co/GGaCPq0t0F
1337952154393382913 2020-12-13 10:47:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> I try to promote my own comics? I get likes, but not many comments.  I stream? Not many people tune in.  I say Batman is Jewish? Boy do I get interactions! XD
1337896059473956872 2020-12-13 07:04:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheMakCave Yes!
1337869263781187585 2020-12-13 05:17:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @schiekapedia ooo
1337866317202927621 2020-12-13 05:06:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> I need to find more comic writing work...anyone have anything that needs to be written or want to team up for something?
1337865262624870401 2020-12-13 05:01:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @markstegbauer Nightwing
1337864137569873922 2020-12-13 04:57:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass I saw the show on Broadway where the role was played by a gay man. Was he camp? Somewhat. But he was probably a MUCH better choice than Corden.  The show was very heartfelt; the film sounds very manufactured.
1337863817678696450 2020-12-13 04:56:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @nethodiazz There is a Cyberpunk comic, I don't think it got that much promotion
1337860006545330176 2020-12-13 04:40:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Yep.  Seriously, there's like this Sith-cult of "fans" who just dump on anything Disney era. It's like Mickey tore up their fan fic, took their toys, etc
1337859297204727809 2020-12-13 04:38:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @wwacomics @DarkHorseComics so good!
1337858660337410050 2020-12-13 04:35:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter And that's fair. :)  Granted, I know a guy who would be pissy at you just for enjoying anything Disney era Star Wars related ^^;   (He's a bit of a loon)
1337857443829780487 2020-12-13 04:30:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Kyler...what did you do?
1337857393477230592 2020-12-13 04:30:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Eh I agree and disagree XD  Can't have all this fun expansion without the films providing a foundation
1337854729779613701 2020-12-13 04:19:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @joshleguern @geoffjohns ZS cultists are aholes
1337854501882097665 2020-12-13 04:19:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone yep.
1337847863041269764 2020-12-13 03:52:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal A friend found the image in question, he is circumcised.
1337847128417308672 2020-12-13 03:49:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> So, my folks are finally done with their program, I go turn on my PS4 so I can FINALLY play Cyberpunk 2077...  ...has yet ANOTHER patch that won't be done for two hours or so.  Needless to say, no me gusta.
1337834697238474755 2020-12-13 03:00:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JackCrowderArt pretty much XD  I might be, if I ever get the chance to write Batman, to embrace Batman's likely Jewish heritage.  Or at least point it out.
1337834424021430273 2020-12-13 02:59:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @zdarsky Speaking as an omnibus junkie? VERY carefully.  (I also have a little sidetable which helps)

1337832236633223170 2020-12-13 02:50:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RightWingWatch As a Jew, seeing our shofars being used in such a way REALLY PISSES ME OFF!!

1337828848650625026 2020-12-13 02:37:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @hugolowell She should not seat them and she should have them arrested
1337826139935543303 2020-12-13 02:26:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner yep lol
1337826085023719427 2020-12-13 02:26:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @daniel_ds But they also never said Kate's dad was gentile either ;)  Plus I think her parents were coded as Jewish as well?
1337825434432573443 2020-12-13 02:23:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner I mean, it explains why when he hallucinates he sees her more than Thomas.
1337825232996999169 2020-12-13 02:22:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> Proud Boys are terrorists and they should ALL be locked up.
1337824841374830592 2020-12-13 02:21:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner Only a Jewish mother can deliver guilt from beyond the grave!
1337824752828878853 2020-12-13 02:20:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal I do have a first print...but do I really want to check for what might be a goyishe oversight? XD

1337823103230087170 2020-12-13 02:14:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner And the guilt! The crippling guilt!!
1337820989200224257 2020-12-13 02:05:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> Some people seem to be taken aback that I claim Batman is Jewish.  His maternal cousin is Jewish; what do you think that made his mother?  Batman is of Jewish descent. It is canon and I have spoken!
1337818281026023425 2020-12-13 01:55:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> Let's Chat  https://t.co/zql6VoVBJF
1337817333331537923 2020-12-13 01:51:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrianLHawkins To be fair, I do have 9 pull list weeks worth of boxes to get through...and more to come....  Well, I know what I'll be doing during my quasi Christmas vacation
1337815262016512001 2020-12-13 01:43:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrianLHawkins And I thought *I* was behind on reading ^^;
1337815098828746752 2020-12-13 01:42:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> So, for the office holiday get-together on the 21st, we're going to be taking a zoom cocktail class on how to make an Old Fashioned.  I personally don't drink BUT I will attempt to make one that will make @MitchGerads proud.
1337813786087010304 2020-12-13 01:37:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TaylorEspo As I said, its a fine line lol  My one issue of cosplaying at a con as a comics pro is...it's just logistics challenges from the start XD  Or you can be Todd Nauck and be clever about the cosplay while still being professional etc at the table.
1337813228328456195 2020-12-13 01:35:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AaronMeyers oh wow
1337812341623283714 2020-12-13 01:31:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TaylorEspo I say it's a balance between "anytime" and "not on the clock".  Because if you're not a fan...why are you even in this industry?
1337811873329274883 2020-12-13 01:29:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter And that's why I haven't played (in part) Cyberpunk 2077 yet. By the time the update would have finished, it would be after dinner and we had viewing plans ^^;

1337763715052146688 2020-12-12 22:18:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> Well, she loves bashing WB/DC so of COURSE she's gonna spin this in the worst way possible.

1337580573775237120 2020-12-12 10:10:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> So, how do you think Trump is acting right now? 😈  The putz is probably throwing White House china at McConnell.

1337529073732620295 2020-12-12 06:45:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> There should be a law punishing antivaxxers in the light of this pandemic.  If you don't have a LEGITIMATE MEDICAL excuse, you should be required to take the vaccine(s). Failure to do so should come with penalties. Spreading antivax BS as well should be punished.
1337522500624928771 2020-12-12 06:19:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> And already anti vax BS is spreading....

1337451534662168581 2020-12-12 01:37:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> Good news: My copy of Cyberpunk 2077 came!  Bad News: Like FF7R, it's a two disc setup AND I have an additional 4-5 hour update.  Oy.
1337431989713055745 2020-12-12 00:20:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 that's not their argument though
1337426999049072640 2020-12-12 00:00:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RPHutch1975 Because they think they're great artists.  They are against the democratization of entertainment. Ergo, they are snobs.  https://t.co/YiO2KmHDtN
1337426250663677953 2020-12-11 23:57:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RPHutch1975 So it's basically greed then?  Well, things aren't going to be normal and I'm certain WB will figure out a way to meet obligations.  But it does come off, somewhat, as arrogant and out of touch on the part of the directors.
1337422606513868806 2020-12-11 23:42:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @danmcdaid Well, I always sided with the Rebel Alliance :)  (Plus it doesn't help that two of its biggest directors are throwing fits because HOW DARE WB release stuff on streaming during a pandemic!)  https://t.co/2NU2Kszkfz
1337421727077457921 2020-12-11 23:39:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @danmcdaid There was plenty of excitement when it went on; but as DC/WB is the relative "underdog", they don't get as much attention/love
1337421396704686082 2020-12-11 23:38:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CBR Wow, this director is a fucking asshat too.  Him and Nolan can fuck off to Pretentious Ass Island!  THERE IS A PANDEMIC GOING ON, YA PUTZ!
1337421364395958273 2020-12-11 23:37:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> Wow, this director is a fucking asshat too.  Him and Nolan can fuck off to Pretentious Ass Island!  THERE IS A PANDEMIC GOING ON, YA PUTZ!
1337420097498075137 2020-12-11 23:32:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ChrisMurphyCT Arrest them all. Charge them with treason.
1337418979372097536 2020-12-11 23:28:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Therealmanos Yeah, I'm sick of these gatekeeping "fans".
1337401813570625536 2020-12-11 22:20:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SnakebitStudio yep, and it gives a much larger platform to negativity
1337398987993833476 2020-12-11 22:09:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SnakebitStudio Same.  I'm so sick and tired of this jadedness and nastiness by so called "fans"
1337398726487367686 2020-12-11 22:07:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CraigRozniecki And yet purity "progressives" will defend her.

1337398290787299336 2020-12-11 22:06:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> Ahem. I like all three of them.  Fuck off with your gatekeeping
1337398203109548036 2020-12-11 22:05:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Gameonysus @JLWChambers Me. I exist.
1337396749313380353 2020-12-11 22:00:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> Is Trump having a meltdown over this news yet?
1337396153902632962 2020-12-11 21:57:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheRealNubian2 what a putz

1337393967105798144 2020-12-11 21:49:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers DC haters will literally make up anything to bash DC

1337391712642199552 2020-12-11 21:40:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> I hate to say this but...  DC, STEP UP YOUR GAME! Marvel is swamping you out with content! PICK UP THE PACE!
1337251173762560001 2020-12-11 12:21:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KatarHol5 oooo!
1337228769992458240 2020-12-11 10:52:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> I'm wondering, for when cons come back, should I have American Dreams stickers and or pins made?
1337215397142138881 2020-12-11 09:59:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @barkmouchard you are being haunted by an incel!!
1337205071986167808 2020-12-11 09:18:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SnakebitStudio XD
1337202290642587650 2020-12-11 09:07:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> About time!
1337199642023505921 2020-12-11 08:56:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrooklynBatman_ what did she say now?
1337197652677701636 2020-12-11 08:48:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 yep!!
1337196296965386242 2020-12-11 08:43:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattseay_91 exactly!!
1337195936137809921 2020-12-11 08:42:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @wolffianclassic Oh these guys are beyond nuts.  This particular guy earlier today was demanding a complete and utter redo of all three films
1337195449002954754 2020-12-11 08:40:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @wolffianclassic Wait...unless you're stating what the wackos want for clarification? 😅
1337194405409804288 2020-12-11 08:36:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 Yeah, I need to debate if I have the time/$ for it lol  PLUS I need to do my comics backlog
1337194300145328128 2020-12-11 08:35:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @wolffianclassic No.
1337193103988559873 2020-12-11 08:30:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 Yeah, I need to get back to playing TOR...eventually XD  I did Jedi Knight
1337192723917516800 2020-12-11 08:29:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> And of course, I rejoice in the new Star Wars announcements on FB and an extremist who hates ALL the current stuff has to piss in the punchbowl.
1337192242855940096 2020-12-11 08:27:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 I did not.  I've read a lot of the older novels. Thrawn Trilogy is a particular fave along with Jedi Academy trilogy.  Game wise I do enjoy TOR. I need to learn more about the new High Republic stuff.
1337190630058024960 2020-12-11 08:21:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 Original Trilogy era, but I also enjoy the prequel and KOTOR/TOR eras.  I enjoy the sequels too, but I don't know as much of the new sequel canon compared to the Legends canon.
1337188955054350336 2020-12-11 08:14:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 Or we can just do one for fun hehehe  (Can we rope Kyler into this somehow?!)
1337188385157509123 2020-12-11 08:12:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HeatherAntos I KNOW RIGHT?!  So much X-Wing action!
1337188321517330433 2020-12-11 08:11:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone me too!
1337188083956150273 2020-12-11 08:10:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> So many good Star Wars shows!!!
1337188026238328832 2020-12-11 08:10:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 And let me write a Star Wars comic book! Or just a short!
1337178287773249539 2020-12-11 07:32:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> Tonight, on this first night of Hannukah, let's remember that...  Superman, Batman, and Hal Jordan (THE BEST GREEN LANTERN) are Jewish.  Kryptonians are Space Jews and Bruce and Hal are Jewish via the maternal bloodline.  This is canon (at least with the latter two) I have spoken
1337171260019773442 2020-12-11 07:04:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Paul_thePullbox @washingtonpost I think this is more directed to...oh shall we say the seditious 100 plus congress critters who just backed the Texas suit?
1337169983797866497 2020-12-11 06:59:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @washingtonpost Sorry but they deserve the scorn and disgust coming their way

1337156242230423554 2020-12-11 06:04:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @johnkruzel Arrest all these GOP traitors
1337155741841502208 2020-12-11 06:02:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard Yep
1337155545581703172 2020-12-11 06:01:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan Yep!
1337122010359603202 2020-12-11 03:48:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> Now I just want to brainstorm with an artist until we find an idea we like and just run WILD with it.  Maybe not a superhero book, so I can have a bit more variety in my writing portfolio (but ya never know)
1337120044350906371 2020-12-11 03:40:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Jafleece @TheMakCave Plus there's a ton of FB groups
1337119630226305025 2020-12-11 03:38:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheMakCave Not that hard, but I want to make sure that I, the artist, and the project all mesh
1337113058947325955 2020-12-11 03:12:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter good idea
1337112443336667138 2020-12-11 03:10:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter if your doctor has a system like MyChart, maybe email them ASAP?
1337112353020784640 2020-12-11 03:10:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter definitely not normal at all.
1337112211559510023 2020-12-11 03:09:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> I'm also just open to brainstorming with an artist until we hit on an idea we both want to do :)
1337111711208370182 2020-12-11 03:07:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter possibly lol  Also, due to certain COVID effects, maybe get your heart checked out to be safe when possible?
1337111215982718980 2020-12-11 03:05:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Could've been worse. You could also be hacking up a lung as well! XD
1337110827699228678 2020-12-11 03:03:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Fair :) And I can understand why.  But now you know that maybe it wasn't the best idea XD At least, with this current bout of illness.
1337110437620494340 2020-12-11 03:02:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby sounds good!
1337110095390515203 2020-12-11 03:01:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby sure!
1337110065082474504 2020-12-11 03:00:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby ooo  Currently workload wise I got -American Dreams -Knightwrath -WFH that I can't talk too much about YET  And two of those are superhero books so I need to diversify, a little
1337109546062540802 2020-12-11 02:58:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby I got notes upon notes XD  The two I'm leaning more towards at the moment are:  -Murder mystery in Weimar era Berlin  OR  -WWII Action/Horror/Adventure with classic monsters
1337109103878021122 2020-12-11 02:57:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Then I am a noob! :P  Well that and I like my creature comforts XD But I go do my walks every couple days (less now due to weather and being in the office some days (except this week because of my cold))
1337108388128362497 2020-12-11 02:54:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jtlarsen Yeah...decisions, decisions.  Like which project of various notes should I do?!
1337108026612977664 2020-12-11 02:52:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter *reads thread*  GEEZ! Get some rest! Yeah, that is NOT a good reaction. (Based on my limited medical knowledge of course.)
1337106164421718019 2020-12-11 02:45:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> Im already working on two personal comic book projects, and writing a work for hire project.  Do I really need another personal project?  Yes, yes I do. But what and with who?!
1337105016444903437 2020-12-11 02:40:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Ah yeah, see the closest personal experience I have is a co-op apartment board...and I haven't lived in a co-op apartment building since I was 8.5 ^^;  But yeah, I've never heard ANYTHING GOOD about HOAs
1337101946474393603 2020-12-11 02:28:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Yeah, from what I hear HOAs are aholes (and cliquey AF)
1337082313319051267 2020-12-11 01:10:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CNN Idaho has been a Neo Nazi stronghold for years.  And with the GOP going full Nazi as well, it is a scary time for us Jews.

1337070159228514304 2020-12-11 00:22:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> Sneak peek from American Dreams Issue 5  Sometimes, a hero has to get into the muck and get dirty.  #comics #indiecomics #superhero  https://t.co/lSnFn6tJWb
1337065474614583297 2020-12-11 00:03:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ronmarz Ayn Rand has a lot to answer for...her and her cult.
1337063487420440583 2020-12-10 23:55:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> First World Kvetch:  I have a package due today that is now "running late". Therefore, it likely won't be here today.  This is the second package in as many weeks.  I am not pleased.
1337060906178670593 2020-12-10 23:45:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Reason1975 Problem is there are SO MANY PEOPLE with this mindset.  And not just for Star Wars.....
1337059847469150208 2020-12-10 23:41:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> People need to get over the sequel trilogy of Star Wars.  I know one guy who is literally demanding they be remade by Dave Filoni, OR ELSE!  How freaking childish can these "fans" get? Very, it seems.
1337059034235629571 2020-12-10 23:38:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @theanglo_files yep
1337058408239915008 2020-12-10 23:35:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @bryanedwardhill Yeah, it was a mild cold. But they wanted me to be tested for COVID to be safe. Went yesterday and got the rapid result, but we're waiting on the other test to be sure.
1337057032608813057 2020-12-10 23:30:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @bryanedwardhill decently. Was sick on Tuesday, so I have to work from home until I get the all clear from my doctor b/c work's COVID policy
1337056697492312071 2020-12-10 23:28:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TylerWalpole This is why I have the day job ^^;
1337056510346719232 2020-12-10 23:28:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KurtBelcher @RuarkMark This unprofessional and unethical YT "journalist"  I believe she does Beyond The Trailer.  She was making shit up to harm BoP, like claiming the diamond contained dick pics.
1337052670805340176 2020-12-10 23:12:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KurtBelcher @RuarkMark And then you had Grace Randolph literally making things up to try to harm it.
1337052590308265985 2020-12-10 23:12:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KurtBelcher @Shadowheart11 @natetg yep

1337030589594144770 2020-12-10 21:45:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RuarkMark @KurtBelcher No what I said was 100% accurate.
1337027701362847745 2020-12-10 21:33:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeclusionStudio My ancestors were BROOKLYN Dodgers fans...so I guess I'm doomed to root for the team that always loses? XD

1337026038405230595 2020-12-10 21:27:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 They're being snobs, who can't accept anything that differs from their preferences
1337020520727011329 2020-12-10 21:05:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @iheartmindy @RepAdamSchiff GOP are the traitors.  And you're a loon
1337019920538882048 2020-12-10 21:02:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 Agreed, on all counts.  Too many gatekeepers, too many bigots, too many "It's not my preference so it MUST be bad!"
1337018210441420802 2020-12-10 20:55:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 ESPECIALLY when it comes to ANYTHING DC does.

1337016689930756096 2020-12-10 20:49:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> Why?  Because Trump is a MADMAN who wants us all dead!
1337015584958128128 2020-12-10 20:45:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> Seeing people refusing to give things a chance, sight unseen, really pisses me off
1337015097043070976 2020-12-10 20:43:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jared_webb1 So many negative hateful "fans" not giving the books a chance before they're even out.....  No one hates DC more than DC "fans"
1337014535232909322 2020-12-10 20:41:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers yep
1337014484662153219 2020-12-10 20:41:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 Exactly.  I hate these memes, especially since most are designed to dump on one thing in the meme specifically.
1337009269598785542 2020-12-10 20:20:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RuarkMark @KurtBelcher Yes, what I said was accurate.
1336865018579718145 2020-12-10 10:47:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @johnnycdebt @xwonflower @EricEdw91696598 @zakiscorner No, that's not what happened.  That's the narrative you guys made up.
1336864708914241537 2020-12-10 10:45:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @nytimes Musk is an asshat
1336862516249587714 2020-12-10 10:37:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsNerd2 This whole thing has been so...*frustrated screaming*
1336862296874889217 2020-12-10 10:36:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AdamParkhomenko They are traitors!
1336862106826760192 2020-12-10 10:35:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsNerd2 he is a pompous ass
1336861512468746240 2020-12-10 10:33:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DavidNAtchison @JAMALIGLE Well, he might have gotten their blessing in this case ^^;
1336859095886868480 2020-12-10 10:23:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JeremyOkelley How Bleak (House).
1336858966178009088 2020-12-10 10:23:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> Random Kalban family factoid:  My paternal grandfather was attacked by ostriches.  Twice.
1336857614811074562 2020-12-10 10:17:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JAMALIGLE @DavidNAtchison ah!  I remember watching bits and pieces as a kid.
1336856878123540482 2020-12-10 10:14:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC My copy arrives Monday...so I'll see how it is then ^^;

1336855998661865472 2020-12-10 10:11:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass I don't know, but my grandfather, who was bitten, TWICE, by ostriches would have liked to known this....
1336855597573169153 2020-12-10 10:09:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC @mattkrotzer @NakatomiTim @KurtBelcher Yep.  And of course, I point this out and I'm called a "DC apologist"....
1336855483420962817 2020-12-10 10:09:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DavidNAtchison @JAMALIGLE Nope, not public domain yet (believe me, I checked).  There's a corporation set up to literally control the rights.
1336855306723356672 2020-12-10 10:08:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicBook And yet they will not get the same amount of flak WB did....
1336855282094399489 2020-12-10 10:08:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> And yet they will not get the same amount of flak WB did....
1336854614705139712 2020-12-10 10:05:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ExistentialEnso @NakatomiTim It's because the puritanical purity "progressives" are so far gone that they have become far right.
1336854154568994816 2020-12-10 10:04:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JAMALIGLE @DavidNAtchison Didn't the people who own Zorro sue that show into shutting down?
1336854055340093448 2020-12-10 10:03:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrooklynBatman_ hmm...what have I been saying?
1336853606759219200 2020-12-10 10:01:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattkrotzer @NakatomiTim @KurtBelcher People have been conditioned to just bash anything DC does, sight unseen, and it's quite frustrating....
1336848679374827521 2020-12-10 09:42:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @amateurCatalyst @Iron_Spike yep
1336847554387058688 2020-12-10 09:37:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @amateurCatalyst @Iron_Spike I know Critical Role cited a number when they dis their KS for cost per minute of animation but ive forgotten the exact figure
1336846244686213121 2020-12-10 09:32:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KurtBelcher General DC hate and a well organized hate campaign that started before the cameras even rolled
1336843973084766208 2020-12-10 09:23:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KurtBusiek yep...oy
1336843712492675072 2020-12-10 09:22:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Iron_Spike Isn't it like 10k per minute?

1336841279393705988 2020-12-10 09:12:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip Hey, I'm just stating the known fact ^^;
1336841000921280516 2020-12-10 09:11:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @thehill GOP BS is killing people......
1336839842852986880 2020-12-10 09:07:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @m_busuttil I think @KylerClodfelter would have a ball doing one
1336839708903682048 2020-12-10 09:06:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip There are numerous rumors about it being a prank gone wrong, to it being a setup, etc.  What we do know there were no charges filed
1336838307989360640 2020-12-10 09:01:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter ooo!
1336836805619015680 2020-12-10 08:55:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ConroyForReal this makes me ridiculously happy
1336836006679629825 2020-12-10 08:51:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @micahmyers @BrenttHarshman @whoisrico ooo
1336835273599164416 2020-12-10 08:49:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @PalmerReport Still, Biden should arrest these treasonous mofos
1336832629589602314 2020-12-10 08:38:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DougaWood1 I'll take a look when I can :) I'm probably too small at the moment ^^;
1336832528813084673 2020-12-10 08:38:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CrusaderZero6 Thanks! :D  Definitely going to lean more towards Brechtian feel, a la Cabaret, versus actually going full Epic Theater
1336831799448760322 2020-12-10 08:35:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> Time to watch the @AudraEqualityMc concert!!!
1336831725364764677 2020-12-10 08:34:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBringer cool!
1336831688136151046 2020-12-10 08:34:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CrusaderZero6 Well it's more thematically Brechtian than outright Brecht.  Think "Threepenny Opera"
1336830935786991618 2020-12-10 08:31:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBringer I don't know, I've never done that before. I've usually just written full script with a page rate. Let me do some research
1336830437327572994 2020-12-10 08:29:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBringer It's definitely possible.   I can do a page summary or something like that and later do a dialogue/script pass OR I can do something like a page by page breakdown
1336826535517405185 2020-12-10 08:14:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBringer I do either method ^^;
1336822428903862278 2020-12-10 07:57:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBringer AH!  THere is Marvel Method/Plot Method and then Full Script
1336820283827687426 2020-12-10 07:49:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBringer Plot and potentially script
1336816809031380992 2020-12-10 07:35:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBringer could be fun!
1336815371211378688 2020-12-10 07:29:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBringer depends. I've scripted at a page rate before so this would be a new experience XD

1336811061803151362 2020-12-10 07:12:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RobinCook :D  Such a fun book, and it teaches Jewish kids how to trick aholes who want to prevent you from celebrating Jewish holidays from an early age ;)

1336809752857366529 2020-12-10 07:07:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> I need to find my copy of Herschel and the Hannukah Goblins.  A favorite holiday book from my childhood; also complete nightmare fuel.

1336808109440950274 2020-12-10 07:01:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Jawiin yep!
1336807683786240002 2020-12-10 06:59:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DougaWood1 I don't even think I'm big enough to even start looking for an agent ^^;
1336801013232185355 2020-12-10 06:32:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KurtBelcher Yep.  And his fans are going nuts
1336800677046202369 2020-12-10 06:31:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 tell me about it
1336799969022529537 2020-12-10 06:28:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> 17 states are traitors.  By supporting this BS lawsuit by Texas to disenfranchise other states, they committed treason.
1336793174946295810 2020-12-10 06:01:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> Hmm...I wonder if I should attempt this Moritat project, with perhaps raising the funds for the first issue via KS?  Would it be easier on my wallet in the long run?
1336790168171376642 2020-12-10 05:49:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DiscordiaComic Thanks!! :D

1336785241911005187 2020-12-10 05:30:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Comic_Law oooo
1336782883827093510 2020-12-10 05:20:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> GREAT NEWS!  I had the VHS which had the song put back into the film and was disappointed to find out it wasn't in other video releases.   The film doesn't fully work without this one song in it.
1336780810435883008 2020-12-10 05:12:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 @jarredlujan Yeah, just that one BIG hurdle to get over for our fan project XD
1336780485507375107 2020-12-10 05:11:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JMichaelDonohue @jpalmiotti Ah got ya.  I got a couple ideas I want to pitch. I just don't want to pester an editorial and cold call them.
1336780268380811265 2020-12-10 05:10:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter @5etrash I remember it well   https://t.co/2ivc3LlGFj
1336779904940183553 2020-12-10 05:09:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @books_rogue @HeatherAntos And sanctioned. And jailed.
1336779842424016897 2020-12-10 05:08:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JMichaelDonohue @jpalmiotti So some just want the idea first?
1336779043581140992 2020-12-10 05:05:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jpalmiotti Well, that and I don't really know how to pitch to companies yet.  I keep looking at submissions info, though, which helps.  But i should also have the books done first before pitching too, or at least the art team gathered,
1336778339684585472 2020-12-10 05:02:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> I have so many ideas...and no idea how to pitch 😅
1336777928999309313 2020-12-10 05:01:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> Superheroes are my comic writing forte, but I do have a few other ideas. Some much darker.  One is a cross between Silence of the Lambs, Cabaret, and the plays of Brecht and Weil.  It's a murder mystery set in Weimar Germany. It's title is one word:  Moritat.
1336774457130627072 2020-12-10 04:47:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone The car is John Adams, dammit!  https://t.co/3FZvGJCkY3
1336773996604510209 2020-12-10 04:45:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HeatherAntos GOP is insane.  Plus no court worth its salt will allow this suit to proceed. It's on its fact racist AND violates the sovereignty of other states.

1336760975664558082 2020-12-10 03:53:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @llanelloyd Awesome!!
1336760472587087872 2020-12-10 03:51:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal As I said, it's the Rebirth suit with some tweaks
1336759820255375361 2020-12-10 03:49:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal Well in this case it isn't you! :P  https://t.co/lCqmjKEO1C
1336759460857987072 2020-12-10 03:47:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @EricColumbus @heresystudiosll Then it goes to show the modern GOP is a Neo Nazi terrorist cult.
1336759448249970692 2020-12-10 03:47:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> Then it goes to show the modern GOP is a Neo Nazi terrorist cult.
1336759239767961601 2020-12-10 03:46:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal *shrug*   I know one person who complains just bashes anything DC from 2011 on

1336758666272321543 2020-12-10 03:44:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal they are some people kvetching on my FB

1336754263775735812 2020-12-10 03:27:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @bywordofmaus THIS! THANK YOU!  Get a PROPER composer in there!

1336723137686360065 2020-12-10 01:23:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Ian_Face oh?  It does feel a bit overstuffed to me as well

1336722311177793536 2020-12-10 01:20:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> So I'm likely home tomorrow as well, BUT at least my rapid test came back negative.
1336714600386007042 2020-12-10 00:49:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Agreed!
1336634222858166276 2020-12-09 19:30:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard Yep
1336568841439207424 2020-12-09 15:10:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard Well it's for one year and there is a pandemic...
1336493151410917377 2020-12-09 10:09:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> I think after I get back from being COVID tested tomorrow, I'm gonna leap into my next script draft.
1336492473586241536 2020-12-09 10:06:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattbo_0 Basically.
1336488835430092801 2020-12-09 09:52:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattbo_0 Probably intentionally so they can just bash and bash.
1336487703144259585 2020-12-09 09:47:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> How do people keep ignoring the fact that WB is doing a simultaneous release on HBOMax AND movie theaters?  Do they lack reading comprehension, or are they intentionally ignoring that?
1336483146087469062 2020-12-09 09:29:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @LiamRSharp yikes! He sounds horrid!
1336481843550572545 2020-12-09 09:24:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan Hear hear!
1336479761326092288 2020-12-09 09:16:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Definitely sounds like it.  I had a laptop like that once in college, due to a busted fan, I literally had to bring a cooling pad to class just so I could take notes!
1336477953014763521 2020-12-09 09:09:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cloudwrangler What's on top of the eggs?
1336477638098120707 2020-12-09 09:07:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter stinks about your laptop :(  I had tech issues earlier just trying to vote in the Game Awards but I think its due to the site ^^;
1336464625345458180 2020-12-09 08:16:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cloudwrangler Paxton needs to be jailed.
1336463156860825601 2020-12-09 08:10:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan @HeyJJLopez yep.  I mean, my main project is set 120 years ago but it still has aspects of myself in the main character.
1336461728960405504 2020-12-09 08:04:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HeyJJLopez @jarredlujan Exactly!
1336461674119917572 2020-12-09 08:04:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HeyJJLopez @jarredlujan I mean, I put aspects of myself into my characters but I'd personally never do the full "fiction suit" concept a la Morrison.  Plus all my characters are better looking than me. 😢
1336453607793823746 2020-12-09 07:32:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AndyShaggyKorty DMing you the Google Drive link in a few

1336443354347950083 2020-12-09 06:51:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan Seriously, author self inserts happen in comics ALL THE TIME.  I mean, look at Morrison's Animal Man! He literally inserted himself into the story!

1336435333198610433 2020-12-09 06:19:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan tell me about it
1336432594297237504 2020-12-09 06:08:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> ICYMI! American Dreams issues 1-3 just got reviewed!  @Paul_thePullbox    https://t.co/VNnsyDHfbA
1336427550382428161 2020-12-09 05:48:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> The GOP has committed treason and it's about time the media bluntly told the country that.
1336404306250117121 2020-12-09 04:16:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RyanHigginsRyan Oh fan entitlement, especially from guys, has been revolting.
1336403761120632832 2020-12-09 04:14:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RobertTocco @CBR they're working on it
1336403271116787717 2020-12-09 04:12:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CBR Well, that disproves Chris Nolan right there 😈
1336403258026373126 2020-12-09 04:12:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> Well, that disproves Chris Nolan right there 😈
1336402315318849539 2020-12-09 04:08:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RyanHigginsRyan The sexist, fat phobic, and downright hateful reactions on the net have been disturbing
1336402080966316050 2020-12-09 04:07:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter So I guess we're a pair of invalids today
1336399807431241728 2020-12-09 03:58:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @danthemcmahon and how is that empanada just floating in air?
1336398954448236546 2020-12-09 03:55:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @chrisarrant Klaus by Morrison
1336398718069780482 2020-12-09 03:54:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Danimalish While he's right that WB mishandled things, WB can still make amends.  Nolan, on the other hand, still comes off as a douche
1336398421322854402 2020-12-09 03:53:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JoshCrewsReally yep

1336369153616322561 2020-12-09 01:56:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> Any comic creators would like to take a look at American Dreams issues 1-3?  I would love to hear what you think! :D (And I kinda need the blurbs tbh)  https://t.co/CozRVmpI4d
1336368286221668353 2020-12-09 01:53:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal @MWDanvers I don't think he'd be lighter than air because of all those mid air fights ^^;
1336368182966317057 2020-12-09 01:52:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal @MWDanvers So basically going back to the "solar battery" explanation, as well as agreeing with various takes (N52 comics, animation, etc) that Superman's flight patterns do cause a heat trail, then?
1336367859082158080 2020-12-09 01:51:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal @MWDanvers Whatever floats your boat.  I think we're both missing each other's points.
1336367546388328449 2020-12-09 01:50:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal @MWDanvers It's BOTH.  Are there quasi scientific explanations? Yes.  Is it still a man flying around with a cape? Also yes.  It's both.
1336366910708051968 2020-12-09 01:47:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AGramuglia yep
1336366719665901568 2020-12-09 01:47:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal @MWDanvers Whatever.  At the end of the day, it's fantasy. And what may be the explanation today might be different tomorrow.  So how are YOU going to decide which is the one true explanation?
1336365926439133187 2020-12-09 01:43:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal @MWDanvers  https://t.co/n3tr9CP0PR
1336365791663566848 2020-12-09 01:43:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal @MWDanvers But he's still got a good point, overall, you just don't like the source.
1336365403723997186 2020-12-09 01:41:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal @MWDanvers you try dumbing down refraction to a preschool level :P
1336365303098454017 2020-12-09 01:41:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal @MWDanvers Not necessarily.  My concern is more with some fans' obsessive need to have an explanation for everything.
1336364834015883265 2020-12-09 01:39:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal @MWDanvers And aren't you belittling the idea of just sitting back and enjoying a comic without wondering every detail?
1336364729045049344 2020-12-09 01:39:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal @MWDanvers So does child like wonder.  And when you consistently demand the details of every tiny detail, you lose that wonder.
1336364300085112833 2020-12-09 01:37:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal @MWDanvers I didn't say it hurts them either.  I just think its silly to demand hyperrealism in comics or an explanation for every tiny little thing.  "How does Superman fly?"  "He just does."
1336364077682188288 2020-12-09 01:36:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal @MWDanvers Don't share a vid.  YOU state the actual formula, from a canonical COMIC source, with citations!  ...see how silly that sounds?
1336363809410330627 2020-12-09 01:35:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal @MWDanvers Not necessarily.   Point is when people constantly demand explanations for fiction, they start looking silly.
1336363477598949377 2020-12-09 01:34:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal @MWDanvers So what's the chemical formula of web fluid and how is it manufactured? 😈
1336363296845410308 2020-12-09 01:33:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal @MWDanvers And you don't get to decide it either.  Why suck the fun and fantasy out?
1336362861271134212 2020-12-09 01:31:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal @MWDanvers See Mark's recent comment.
1336362370717913093 2020-12-09 01:29:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MichaelSacal @MWDanvers And yet that still doesn't make him wrong in the quote I gave.  It's fantasy. It's fiction. Not everything needs an in depth explanation.  No kid is asking "how does Superman fly" when he watches the movies, tv shows, or cartoons. They're just excited to see Superman.

1336360455934259203 2020-12-09 01:22:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers Seriously, why are people so obsessed at looking for explanations for FICTION
1336360134453440537 2020-12-09 01:20:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC I'm not allowed to :(  But I did wear a Batman tie pin on my first day at work at my job when I started XD
1336359357345357826 2020-12-09 01:17:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner @THR Basically yeah
1336354884501770242 2020-12-09 01:00:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner @jehawks @THR yep.  And as we have seen in this pandemic, people are VERY resistant to do so
1336354216194043916 2020-12-09 00:57:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner @jehawks @THR That's my point ;)  WB said right away WW84 et al would be free for HBOMax subscribers.  But everyone seemed to miss that and kept asking "do we have to pay more?" when the answer was right in the press release.
1336353083786465285 2020-12-09 00:52:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner @jehawks @THR Yep.  And at least WB isn't putting these new films behind an additional paywall.  But they get boos and jeers.  If the Mouse did it, people would be lining up to kiss their butts.
1336352128001040387 2020-12-09 00:49:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner @jehawks @THR So basically they want to stick to the old ways...mainly because they get paid more if so AND they're sticks in the mud.  It's a pandemic. WB isn't going to sit on these films.
1336351090040844294 2020-12-09 00:45:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner @jehawks @THR Pretty much.  Plus they're doing simultaneous release into theaters, so it's not like it's JUST on HBOMax.  People seems to be ignoring that fact, on purpose.
1336350278287839233 2020-12-09 00:41:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner @jehawks @THR I mean, I enjoy movies at the theater...but it's not exactly Temple Beth Elohim!  Especially given that people are on their phones all the time, are eating, are illegally recording the movie, talk loudly during it....  He's being difficult for no reason, with the excuse of "ART!"  https://t.co/df0cnhUeFK
1336340395857350660 2020-12-09 00:02:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner @jehawks @THR Basically, yeah.  Look, I get the other stars/directors are pissed; and I hope WB makes it up to them.  But Nolan is just being pretentious!
1336305914928893952 2020-12-08 21:45:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ABC7NY They should be, in this situation.

1336304984875528192 2020-12-08 21:41:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @himwhatjolts I mean, I don't play them as much as I used to
1336304787185393665 2020-12-08 21:41:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers This article is leaning very closely to libel territory
1336304445936848901 2020-12-08 21:39:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers Oh God no, people would be lining up to kiss the mouse's butt.
1336304367906004995 2020-12-08 21:39:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers HB, I think
1336285972380721152 2020-12-08 20:26:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 @BrooklynBatman_ agreed
1336284964292337666 2020-12-08 20:22:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrandonDavisBD Nah, let him burn his career.  He pushed a theatrical release during a global pandemic; that's not good thinking, that's arrogance.

1336283831129747463 2020-12-08 20:17:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JessexDCFB Because it's a COMIC BOOK MOVIE!  Not everything has to be gritty and "realistic"
1336283635780112385 2020-12-08 20:17:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrooklynBatman_ The ZS cult is hypocritical and bigoted.
1336282255384317959 2020-12-08 20:11:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass He is such a putz
1336281315818278913 2020-12-08 20:07:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 Yes, but it's easier to bash than to listen to facts
1336281201120776194 2020-12-08 20:07:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers Yep, and he ragequit DC twice (and has been a real ahole towards them ever since)
1336280901647544321 2020-12-08 20:06:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> Me, yesterday: "Isn't it funny that I only needed one sick day this year, and it was for a checkup, pre COVID"  Me, today, sick in bed: "Well...shit!"
1336276024053665794 2020-12-08 19:46:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Manprin Then why did his sound mix on Tenet suck?
1336148300844642304 2020-12-08 11:19:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> Both of the following statements are true.  1. WB must do everything to set things right with the directors and actors.  2. Chris Nolan is a pretentious ass who would rather people get sick and die than have them stream a movie.

1336136237166497793 2020-12-08 10:31:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan Fair, but it doesn't mean they won't have a plan either.  But it doesn't exactly answer my question.  What should WB have done if not this HBOMax thing?
1336135314490986509 2020-12-08 10:27:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JeffreyMcAleese exactly
1336130633471582209 2020-12-08 10:09:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Davlen @MikeKalinowski Again, we'll see what happens.  I do think they're overreacting.
1336130053692928003 2020-12-08 10:06:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Davlen @MikeKalinowski probably.  But again, at the same time, don't you think the people at WB are looking into paying the stakeholders for the 2021 slate?

1336129535822204929 2020-12-08 10:04:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Davlen @MikeKalinowski Maybe they should have waited for WB to reveal the compensation plan before going for the jugular?
1336129408910888960 2020-12-08 10:04:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @THAnderson89 @markhughesfilms It's been a long day. XD
1336129201531969536 2020-12-08 10:03:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> Hmmm, what's that Chris Nolan?! WB can't hear you over you being wrong?!   https://t.co/WNKr1Gh3au
1336128714380341250 2020-12-08 10:01:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 @ZakReckless Well, there is literally a law against studios owning theater chains ^^;
1336128601905827843 2020-12-08 10:00:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @THAnderson89 @markhughesfilms Then why the hell are we arguing?! XD
1336128539033292801 2020-12-08 10:00:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 @ZakReckless Exactly
1336128477372817409 2020-12-08 10:00:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @graphicpolicy Exactly, thank you
1336128117463773184 2020-12-08 09:59:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> And when Trump was offered the option of additions doses, he turned them down...
1336127999423500288 2020-12-08 09:58:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @imamacguffin @RICHARDLNEWBY Then what should have WB done overall? Hmm?  Just sat on the films and go BANKRUPT?!
1336127728156897282 2020-12-08 09:57:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @THAnderson89 @markhughesfilms Still not safe, overall.  What do you want WB to do? Sit on the films and lose even more $ when they release it in an overcrowded 2022 or later?
1336127465337593862 2020-12-08 09:56:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @michaelkatchan Yes and apparantely its pissed off Chris Nolan and others.
1336127404335640576 2020-12-08 09:56:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @imamacguffin @RICHARDLNEWBY And yet they can still fix this.
1336127313256341506 2020-12-08 09:55:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @imamacguffin @RICHARDLNEWBY Then why blame WB and not the corporate parent?  These actors and directors are being unprofessional and petty.
1336126783188590593 2020-12-08 09:53:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @THAnderson89 @markhughesfilms Again, how are theaters going to run DURING A FUCKING PANDEMIC.
1336126539126206465 2020-12-08 09:52:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 @ZakReckless Exactly!  But NOOOO! Must bash WB even though they were trying to do what was best.....
1336126204726956033 2020-12-08 09:51:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @THAnderson89 @markhughesfilms COVID closed the doors, not WB.  WB tried releasing a movie during this pandemic, it did not go well for anyone.
1336125939969904641 2020-12-08 09:50:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @THAnderson89 @markhughesfilms Oh sure, blame WB, not COVID.....
1336125829294796803 2020-12-08 09:49:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @imamacguffin @RICHARDLNEWBY I mean after the fact.  But what do you want WB to do? Just sit on the damn films?!  WHAT SHOULD THEY HAVE DONE?!
1336125404218880002 2020-12-08 09:48:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MikeMorrocco Hmmm, that is true....
1336124813618933763 2020-12-08 09:45:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @imamacguffin @RICHARDLNEWBY It's unprofessional, IN MY BOOK, to do this kind of nasty public spat and throwing around petty insults instead of being adults at the negotiating table.  Fuck Nolan, the guy who wanted to risk people's lives to show a movie in theaters.
1336124556185120769 2020-12-08 09:44:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Reason1975 I can understand why certain people are upset...but can't they just go to the negotiating table instead of having a public spat?
1336123143040212993 2020-12-08 09:39:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @frankee_white Yep!  I can get why the stakeholders are angry...but just slamming WB publicly instead of just going to the table?  Oy.....
1336122712830435336 2020-12-08 09:37:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HeyJJLopez Yep
1336122661752217600 2020-12-08 09:37:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @frankee_white Exactly!   But NOOOO! WB MUST SIT ON THEM UNTIL WE CAN SHOW THEM IN THEATERS!  Putzes.....  It's a business thing, and Nolan et al are being egotistical and unprofessional!
1336122318469419014 2020-12-08 09:35:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 Well they got plenty of time to mollify them
1336122019059019776 2020-12-08 09:34:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> To the people attacking WB over this, I ask this.  What would you have them do? Sit on movies and not make any money for TWO years?!
1336121507878219776 2020-12-08 09:32:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 And WB is probably going to make deals to mollify these people and honor those contracts.  Nolan is still a pretentious asshat who demanded a theatrical release, or else, DURING A FUCKING PANDEMIC!
1336120605133987841 2020-12-08 09:29:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MikeKalinowski And WB can still end up doing something to mollify them.
1336120361998577665 2020-12-08 09:28:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 There. Is. Still. A. Domestic. Release.  Why are so many people ignoring that!  At the end of the day it is, unfortunately, a business.
1336119538543431680 2020-12-08 09:24:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 THERE IS A SIMULTANEOUS THEATRICAL RELEASE!  Something they seem to be deliberately ignoring.
1336119254228348931 2020-12-08 09:23:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrooklynBatman_ Nolan and the other prima donnas complaining are being such putzes
1336119115900194819 2020-12-08 09:23:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 But it might be the right decision, overall.  They'll pay some more money to the stakeholders and that will appease them.
1336118685111640065 2020-12-08 09:21:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DougaWood1 I might be able to co-write some things
1336117796254715905 2020-12-08 09:18:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @OldManNamedFudo Pompous schmuck
1336117529299849216 2020-12-08 09:16:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @nytimes Thanks Staten Island!
1336117391693066241 2020-12-08 09:16:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter good idea
1336117334826684419 2020-12-08 09:16:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 Still, what were they expecting WB to do? Just sit on top of the films and lose more $$?
1336115869131419648 2020-12-08 09:10:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Might be just a bug
1336115465031196674 2020-12-08 09:08:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DiscussingFilm Incredibly petty and immature behavior by these actors and directors.
1336115296306929664 2020-12-08 09:08:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RICHARDLNEWBY Oh Nolan and others are being IMMENSELY petty and unprofessional!
1336115041884631042 2020-12-08 09:07:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter uh oh.  Hopefully it's just a cold?
1336114912364556294 2020-12-08 09:06:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> Geez, all these tantrums over the HBOMax move.  What were these prima donna directors thinking WB was gonna do, sit on these films or keep pushing releases back?!
1336111347797463041 2020-12-08 08:52:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> Oh look, Goya's CEO is a petty, immature supporter of the orange tyrant.....

1336006159086608384 2020-12-08 01:54:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> I came up with a concept called Justice League Rescue.

1335930165097066497 2020-12-07 20:52:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> Just read a comment by a comic shop owner crowing about no longer selling "agenda driven new Marvel/DC books", except digitally, and that "parents have stopped complaining".  ...Remind me not to patronize that shop.

1335706457933803522 2020-12-07 06:03:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers Batpenis got a whole bunch of major media reactions and jokes. Plus a certain rumormonger site didn't make articles about it non stop for weeks.  Plus its DC, so they get flak while Marvel gets away scot free.
1335706028571320320 2020-12-07 06:01:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CBR good
1335705407860445184 2020-12-07 05:59:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams I say yes and no.  Yes you can do one offs etc that aren't too bogged down in past canon, or make references without going overboard (S:TAS)  But you will have to acknowledge some foundational elements.
1335699938274111491 2020-12-07 05:37:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter yes, yes you have.  https://t.co/h4SOHi6jMJ

1335670063844757506 2020-12-07 03:38:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> Michigan and Pennsylvania are now suing trump for attempting to throw out votes.
1335658282246139905 2020-12-07 02:52:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> This is true. I was there.
1335634219285049350 2020-12-07 01:16:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter I might have to watch after the fact ^^; in D&amp;D atm

1335420877291261953 2020-12-06 11:08:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> Okay, I consumed a massive Witchblade omnibus in one day.  Writing and lettering could have been somewhat better, but it is an engaging story and the art is top notch.
1335405891923947520 2020-12-06 10:09:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard Yep. I mean wiki etc helps with filling in the gaps, but it is a bit daunting to come in what is basically the middle.  (Plus remember, superhero comics are my writing bread and butter ;) )
1335402991575326726 2020-12-06 09:57:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter hmm, raises good points
1335402906519031808 2020-12-06 09:57:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> Read this
1335367243333570563 2020-12-06 07:35:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> Come Jan 20th, the DOJ MUST arrest Trump for treason, sedition, corruption, attempted election fraud, etc.
1335364928664981510 2020-12-06 07:26:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @markhughesfilms I know, right? How DARE DC get good press! How dare we see a bright side to the HBOMax release!  Seriously, people are just aholes.

1335331432718348291 2020-12-06 05:13:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> Further thoughts on Witchblade Omnibus 1  The art is beautiful and the story is engaging for the most part  But DAMN the lettering is confusing!

1335296938242084869 2020-12-06 02:56:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> Been going my way through the first Witchblade omnibus.  Interesting, to say the least. A little too cheesecakey, but it;s fun.
1335273475989254147 2020-12-06 01:22:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @nytimes ANd thank you, Antivaxxers, for proving my point.....
1335249162904985600 2020-12-05 23:46:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @nytimes Vaccines should be mandatory unless you have a legit medical reason.  Antivax nonsense may not apply.

1335235831553003520 2020-12-05 22:53:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DemonRin I like both, but I'm a sucker for "Journey To The Past", "Learn To Do It" and "Paris Holds The Key"
1335234833644138497 2020-12-05 22:49:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrianLHawkins Haven't read anything yet. I got 6-7 weeks of pull list to catch up on ^^; But I'll probably read some of my backlog (be it pull list or otherwise) later

1335017642667765761 2020-12-05 08:26:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MrNiceGuy18_58 Agreed.  Problem is there was a slander campaign against it before, during, and after release.
1335017141674893312 2020-12-05 08:24:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> Dear certain person, who shall remain nameless,  SEEK THERAPY!  Your obsessive hate over Brian Michael Bendis and how he writes Superman is freaking disturbing. And you celebrating him leaving the book is disgusting.  IT IS A COMIC BOOK!  SEEK HELP!

1335013747526684678 2020-12-05 08:10:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> I'm two months older than Tim Burton's first Batman movie.

1334994723103264769 2020-12-05 06:55:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> Pssst...@ava is probably producing Naomi AND directing/co-writing New Gods. It's not a zero sum thing.

1334640318650724352 2020-12-04 07:27:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Reason1975 It's older than ME! By my dad's estimate, they had it 36-37 years. Which means it is at least 5 years older than me
1334636974829953024 2020-12-04 07:13:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> After nearly 40 years, my parents' fridge finally needs to be replaced.  Part of the shelving broke off, and it was plastic.  So, now my mom is going to get that replacement fridge she's been holding off on getting.
1334608912289566720 2020-12-04 05:22:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brykotyk Nope! XD  Basically excusing her siding with Trump and attacking the Democrats instead
1334607260857884672 2020-12-04 05:15:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brykotyk lol
1334597446702411787 2020-12-04 04:36:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> Of COURSE Tulsi Gabbard takes Trump's side.  She is a fake progressive, and a Trump enabler.  But of course the purity leftists will be apologists for her.....while failing their own tests etc...because she goes after the "impure" Democrats.
1334596429587894273 2020-12-04 04:32:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @grumpybirdieS No she's not.

1334210762244558851 2020-12-03 03:00:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RonJoseph717 Yep. Thanks to Wolverine constantly being played up
1334203242775982083 2020-12-03 02:30:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RonJoseph717 yep.  Scott Summers is constantly shafted by writers.  I really want to write a mini to showcase how great he is

1333963490877386752 2020-12-02 10:37:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> These CGers freaking out about the Starfire's daughter YA GN thing (for which they are not even the target audience) shows how deranged and perverse they are.  (Seriously, they're complaining that a fictional teen doesn't look "sexy" enough. That sends up MANY red flags)

1333950547301457920 2020-12-02 09:46:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> What is the worst book you ever read?  For me, it was The Monk. Purple prose by an 18th century teenager...and it reads exactly as that sounds.  It also doesn't help that it has a Wandering Jew character in it, which is a bit of an anti-Semitic trope.

1333915334210940929 2020-12-02 07:26:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman Aww, I wasn't invited to write.... :(  I will guilt trip you later for this, Harshman! :P
1333915075808272389 2020-12-02 07:25:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DemonRin WTF
1333914745729130497 2020-12-02 07:23:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TurnerInRoc No it's not.  Stop trying to co-opt Jewish things.  It's bad enough everything even BEFORE HALLOWEEN is CHRISTMAS!
1333914535644819456 2020-12-02 07:23:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KurtBelcher Is Svengali public domain? (Though he's more of a metaphorical monster)  Sirens?
1333897592896368643 2020-12-02 06:15:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @pittsed_off Yep
1333890528400855041 2020-12-02 05:47:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> Artists looking for work? Check this out!
1333888596919644161 2020-12-02 05:39:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @danmcdaid Cool!
1333882515178860545 2020-12-02 05:15:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @gbbloom Well I know @KylerClodfelter and I have had ideas for years, but we never can quite sync things up (plus I think he's quasi busy for a few more months before he is free again?)
1333881165908938754 2020-12-02 05:10:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jpalmiotti Ooo
1333880650605207553 2020-12-02 05:08:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone @Marvel @jpalmiotti @JoeQuesada That Daredevil run is so good!  And Jimmy drew a quick DD sketch in my trade paperback at my first NYCC! :D
1333876409740251136 2020-12-02 04:51:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Peposed @TheOZComic And there goes your spine
1333876194756923400 2020-12-02 04:50:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> So many comic artists I want to work with!  Got to sync up schedules SOMEHOW!
1333875065843294208 2020-12-02 04:46:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DougaWood1 Mhmm
1333863904817111042 2020-12-02 04:01:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> We are gonna have to have the Secret Service drag him out, aren't we?  https://t.co/csjUZ4uUAT
1333859005589041152 2020-12-02 03:42:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter From what I hear (though I haven't had the chance to read it yet), yes.

1333844081483665408 2020-12-02 02:43:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> I want to give a salute to the hardworking team on my comic American Dreams!  Art: Dody Eka, Tebe Andry, @Wksahadewa1  Covers: @nethodiazz, Tommy Shelton @ArtOfTimBrown  Editorial: @Team__BEAUTIFUL  Publisher: @ShortFuseMedia @MostEPICart   And all of you, for reading it!  https://t.co/PLboOCiR22
1333836279675379712 2020-12-02 02:12:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> So, as you many have guessed, I have A Christmas Carol on the brain.  So, I had an idea, that combines two prior ones.  Basically I and several artists (maybe other writers too?) do a graphic novel adaptation of the novella and Kickstart it. Any profits can go2charity.  Thoughts?
1333826410813792256 2020-12-02 01:32:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter @gino_obarto Ooo that sounds cool!

1333809031861907456 2020-12-02 00:23:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Well, that's awkward 😅
1333808078614040577 2020-12-02 00:20:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ShaneMBailey Isn't it so fun?!  Such a shame it's been slandered by so many people
1333807255674888194 2020-12-02 00:16:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JAMALIGLE Yep.

1333801034976698372 2020-12-01 23:52:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @wes_greer @AGramuglia Both are true lol
1333799303496617986 2020-12-01 23:45:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AGramuglia They are so insane
1333799150844997641 2020-12-01 23:44:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brykotyk Yep.  Gatekeepers are horrid.  Problem is so many fans agree with the gatekeeper bs....
1333798978073214981 2020-12-01 23:43:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan "Weird and pathetic" is an understatement when it comes to CG

1333768597957726209 2020-12-01 21:43:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeclusionStudio Let's just say he muted the thread and ran
1333751992888532993 2020-12-01 20:37:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeclusionStudio A whole bunch of us tried, but he just sat there and called us "elitist".  He thinks pestering a publisher through social media is A-OK! oy!

1333585122831069184 2020-12-01 09:34:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Tweeted_Tongues @danthemcmahon Excellent!  Because I have IDEAS!
1333584620881928194 2020-12-01 09:32:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Tweeted_Tongues @danthemcmahon LOTS of stories in Gotham City :D
1333584571242311680 2020-12-01 09:31:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Tweeted_Tongues @danthemcmahon :D Works for me!
1333584340450766848 2020-12-01 09:30:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @teineseina A bodega is a convenience store/newsstand/sometimes deli that is a NYC thing. But to call it a "convenience store" is selling it short.  Plus the good ones always have a bodega cat.

1333583091978412036 2020-12-01 09:26:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KurtBelcher I feel like that with writing. Most of my writing these days tends to be notes.  Takes me to warm back up writing a full script
1333582944607358976 2020-12-01 09:25:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HeatherAntos Yep!

1333522529181458434 2020-12-01 05:25:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Ian_Face @lachwriter oof, dry subject matter though.
1333522475406290950 2020-12-01 05:25:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @lachwriter Didn't they technically do that with the Hobbit?
1333521528089174018 2020-12-01 05:21:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> Heard back from Boston Fan Expo.  Hopefully I'm another step closer towards getting in there.  ESPECIALLY since, when the con happens, it will have been over 18 months since my last con...which was this January!
1333516954909478913 2020-12-01 05:03:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @teineseina only time she did a good job decorating for Christmas :P
1333515897340878848 2020-12-01 04:59:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Phantomskyler exactly!
1333514938627846151 2020-12-01 04:55:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Phantomskyler yep.  Even the "newcomers" either toiled in indie comics or they got their start in another medium
1333512996811894786 2020-12-01 04:47:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Phantomskyler yep.  Though Tom is 1. left wing and 2. put in the work by releasing a prose novel about superheroes.  Plus I think he interned at DC or Marvel at some point?
1333512758340542467 2020-12-01 04:46:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Phantomskyler yep

1333495753717780480 2020-12-01 03:38:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBlaquesmith yep. Perhaps earlier when the EC meets
1333495102975643655 2020-12-01 03:36:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBlaquesmith Yeah. It's just get aggravating.  Hit him with a permanent injunction
1333494023403823107 2020-12-01 03:32:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JasonRempala @TheOZComic @Peposed hmm...possibly
1333493943254851591 2020-12-01 03:31:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> Can a judge just permanently block Trump's election fraud BS and ban him from filing these BS lawsuits?
1333493408682438659 2020-12-01 03:29:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JasonRempala @TheOZComic @Peposed me neither!

1333490807903571968 2020-12-01 03:19:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> Just read @TheOZComic by @Peposed . SO FREAKING GOOD!!
1333484184338362368 2020-12-01 02:52:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Inquisitive_Elf Happy birthday!
1333483942876426247 2020-12-01 02:52:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Therealmanos A little irritated.  Not with my creative stuff; but dealing with someone in a FB group who is being very entitled.
1333463353457569795 2020-12-01 01:30:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Tweeted_Tongues yep
1333463065287946246 2020-12-01 01:29:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Ozymandias0_1 He really is
1333458750305406977 2020-12-01 01:11:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Tweeted_Tongues Apparantly in their world you can ask for a job no matter what, even if the position is filled
1333458579148451840 2020-12-01 01:11:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Ozymandias0_1 As I and others have told him, but he refuses to listen, and demands a shot at getting a job that isn't even open!
1333452425454374913 2020-12-01 00:46:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> I hate being the blunt "villain", but this person needs to see how things are.  Not putting in any of the work of making comics, doing cons, etc is NOT going to get you hired by a major publisher!
1333446612631302144 2020-12-01 00:23:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers And I thought the Rockefeller Center tree looked poorly.
1333444735424491520 2020-12-01 00:16:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GeorgeKambadais np!
1333442766655918081 2020-12-01 00:08:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 I mean, compare it to previous years.
1333442632417234946 2020-12-01 00:07:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> Idiots....
1333442598665596929 2020-12-01 00:07:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ABC7NY Giving people COVID and not making money to own the libs....
1333442102861160448 2020-12-01 00:05:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 Also true
1333441314009079808 2020-12-01 00:02:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> It is DISGUSTING outside today.
1333434087810474000 2020-11-30 23:33:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> I and others are trying to convince someone else in a FB group that, no, having to prove your worth to get hired for a big publisher is NOT elitist.....
1333433807098273793 2020-11-30 23:32:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ChrisBlundell Ironically this is the first year her decorations actually look good....
1333431256093249540 2020-11-30 23:22:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers Basically. And that goes for both the Left and Right Perpetual Outrage Machines....not to mention fans just throwing fits because things aren't EXACTLY how THEY want it.
1333430638150643714 2020-11-30 23:20:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JAMALIGLE The Bernie Cult is doing everything they can to help the GOP.....
1333429975521890304 2020-11-30 23:17:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DillenDanger Isn't it weird? And there were some oddly cold days a couple weeks ago

1333423515358388225 2020-11-30 22:51:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC Awesome!  (Also, take that, Wolverine, you overused writer's pet!! 😈)
1333423316749737986 2020-11-30 22:51:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers Certain segments of comics twitter just want to be constantly angry

1333411918711844864 2020-11-30 22:05:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> I mean, it's a STRETCH, but the footage does eerily match up.
1333406904090058752 2020-11-30 21:45:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GeorgeKambadais Cool!

1333398973885931520 2020-11-30 21:14:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @agraybee Probably because the purity progressives love attacking every other section of the Left for being "impure Neolibs" than going after their true master, Trump.
1333397930825424896 2020-11-30 21:10:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @excel522 Oh they knew.  Blame readers for not picking it up....

1333396652896493569 2020-11-30 21:05:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @pauljholden A Muppet Christmas Carol, on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day
1333396296275812352 2020-11-30 21:03:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @dill8786 @braran_mom @XydexxUnicorn @north_easton No, they're a LARGE part of Bernie supporters.  Look how Berners treated Warren, black voters, etc.
1333396058119020544 2020-11-30 21:02:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Awesome!!!
1333395792665653248 2020-11-30 21:01:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @dill8786 @braran_mom @XydexxUnicorn @north_easton He's a good man who will listen to progressives.  Plus he can actually build a governing coalition.
1333394024175169537 2020-11-30 20:54:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @dill8786 @braran_mom @XydexxUnicorn @north_easton Conspiracy drivel.  Bernie couldn't build a coalition, and a large part of that is due to his racist, puritanical, holier than thou cult.
1333390567586271232 2020-11-30 20:40:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @dill8786 @braran_mom @XydexxUnicorn @north_easton THE OBSERVER?! KUSHNER'S PAPER?!  HAHAHAHA!!  You really are Trump's useful idiots....
1333381410577641472 2020-11-30 20:04:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @dill8786 @braran_mom @XydexxUnicorn @north_easton Why do you keep spouting that conspiracy theory?
1333244152985899008 2020-11-30 10:59:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @georgegustines @AH_AdamHughes I think the first comic pro I ever met was @Ssnyder1835 at a talk he was giving at Bryant Park.  Literally hurried from a canceled job interview (long story short: they sent me to the wrong place and had to reschedule) in a full suit in the middle of summer to get there!
1333243185053773827 2020-11-30 10:55:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @georgegustines @AH_AdamHughes the first Special Edition NYC

1333225630943629318 2020-11-30 09:45:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 They're full of these horrid takes.  They are puritanical gits!
1333225150666387457 2020-11-30 09:43:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 yep
1333224626508369924 2020-11-30 09:41:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JAMALIGLE The far Left are such aggravating schmucks and Trump enablers.
1333224508451328000 2020-11-30 09:41:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @C_Dobbins @tomtificate yep!
1333223555350335489 2020-11-30 09:37:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 They are the opposite side of the same coin as the Trumpsters.  They are holier than thou, puritanical asshats!!!  They war on those who don't bend the knee sufficiently enough while ignoring the sins of the right!

1333218294774509569 2020-11-30 09:16:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> I saw the 1995 cast of this show that used to play MSG every year...that may have been the first musical I ever saw.   https://t.co/EinQsoHffG
1333217453959225346 2020-11-30 09:13:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ruairicoleman these look really good for "failed attempts"

1333177144801980417 2020-11-30 06:32:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> Oh look, another bunch of "both parties are the same" BS despite the mountain of observable evidence that they are not, and that the GOP is far far FAR worse.  Gah! The purity progressives/"both sides are bad" twits are JUST AS BAD as the Trumpsters!
1333174061975932930 2020-11-30 06:20:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> Probably fleeing the country.

1333162757068369921 2020-11-30 05:35:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Extremely unprofessional of the store! You bought it, they should have set it aside for you as soon as the order went in.
1333161120455122949 2020-11-30 05:29:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> whoa

1333155690140102656 2020-11-30 05:07:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Ozymandias0_1 Thanks!  Right now there's a streaming one man play version you can rent through Jan 3rd that is raising money for theaters. @axmascarollive
1333141174446678020 2020-11-30 04:09:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeclusionStudio yep
1333136989080727554 2020-11-30 03:53:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ABruine @JoshCrewsReally yep!
1333132286523559936 2020-11-30 03:34:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JoshCrewsReally Exactly. Plus bills gotta get paid!
1333131681679749121 2020-11-30 03:32:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JoshCrewsReally I mean, I've done work for hire before. Puts a little extra cash in my pocket, and more resources for my own stuff.  It's basically being snobby.
1333129898395906050 2020-11-30 03:25:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JoshCrewsReally I don't get the Bendis hate either. Or the constant bashing other pros get....  And then there's the constant DC and Marvel bashing.  Don't you want to say "My book is just as good as..." versus saying "it's better than..."? The former is more uplifting.
1333128505031180288 2020-11-30 03:19:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JoshCrewsReally I mean, I see them bashing older (and even not by that much!!) creators, not to mention "mainstream" comics....
1333127880851730433 2020-11-30 03:17:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> THIS!
1333127846609506311 2020-11-30 03:17:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JoshCrewsReally Agreed
1333121348877627396 2020-11-30 02:51:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> 'nuff said   https://t.co/OC1AbkroVe
1333118608273240064 2020-11-30 02:40:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> I have an idea for a charity group read of A Christmas Carol. Just don't know if I have the time to arrange it for this holiday season, but definitely next years!
1333111092252389379 2020-11-30 02:10:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrianLHawkins Awesome! :D And NP!
1333110670154461184 2020-11-30 02:08:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @bryanedwardhill @TravisMercer15 Exactly.
1333110061397385216 2020-11-30 02:06:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TravisMercer15 @bryanedwardhill We'll agree to disagree.  But when I listened to the TDKR soundtrack, it sounded like the same tune over and over.
1333107903046295554 2020-11-30 01:57:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TravisMercer15 @bryanedwardhill While I do enjoy MoS and BvS...the music isn't as good as Williams (or Elfman).  But then again, I prefer more orchestral scores and Zimmer is a bit overly reliant on electronica. (Plus it all sounds kinda the same after a while. I think he phoned it in for TDKR especially.)
1333107502804856833 2020-11-30 01:56:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrianLHawkins NP! :D  (BTW did you get my emails re: the thing)
1333103975315464195 2020-11-30 01:42:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> I have this comic somewhere!!
1333103945997295626 2020-11-30 01:42:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TalkingSuperman I have this comic somewhere!!
1333103523677032453 2020-11-30 01:40:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrianLHawkins Already backed!
1333101483173306369 2020-11-30 01:32:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MattDraperYT Fandom Twitter, in general, was a mistake.
1333099638589681665 2020-11-30 01:24:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kimota1977 CGers are like any other reich wing group. All they do is lie.
1333086493091524614 2020-11-30 00:32:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrianLHawkins cool!
1333085684421320712 2020-11-30 00:29:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrooklynBatman_ Or anything.
1333085650678128643 2020-11-30 00:29:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> Or hating ANYTHING for likes, retweets, etc.
1333085088129626112 2020-11-30 00:27:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> People who obsessively bash things just really really REALLY need to get a fucking life.
1333084637686603779 2020-11-30 00:25:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone Well, it's a thriller, but I do enjoy The Alienist by Caleb Carr.
1333079042703171585 2020-11-30 00:03:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @dan_raga XD Yeah, a lot of the hate comes from fan entitlement PLUS the aforementioned racism and sexism.  Would I have loved a Thrawn Trilogy adaptation? Yes, but it wasn't feasible (due to the age of the OT actors) AND why retread something we know by heart?
1333077253119467522 2020-11-29 23:55:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @dan_raga Exactly! But people are acting as if 2 out of 3 are, for some reason, akin to religious heresy.  Then again, the whining began when Disney wanted to do original stories, and then it got louder b/c there was a female lead, a black stormtrooper, and a Hispanic hotshot pilot.....
1333074806569381889 2020-11-29 23:46:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> Best. Christmas. Song. EVER!!!   https://t.co/BmMgmSUR64
1333073315376865280 2020-11-29 23:40:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> The sequel trilogy didn't "ruin" Star Wars.  The toxic AF "fans" did a good job doing that themselves.....
1333062891218612224 2020-11-29 22:58:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> Revisions are done! Hope my editor likes them.  Now, to grab a late breakfast!
1333061470641418241 2020-11-29 22:53:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Herb13238050 @LemieuxLGM She's an ally.   You just don't like her because she fails your purity tests.  And it's likely you're just a right wing troll masquerading as a leftist based on your handle so I will be blocking you now.
1333048654865817604 2020-11-29 22:02:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Herb13238050 @LemieuxLGM No, he's not actually.  Pelosi has passed NUMEROUS bills to help people through the pandemic, and yet the TURTLE won't let them onto the Senate floor.
1333048491854147587 2020-11-29 22:01:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @spir4lx @LemieuxLGM Oh I know
1333040960855564291 2020-11-29 21:31:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DJBawlzy Like I was in a combo of a Star Wars spy drama and an episode of The Office
1333026710766411776 2020-11-29 20:35:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Ozymandias0_1 She was good in Aquaman, imo
1333026630432854016 2020-11-29 20:34:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> I had my first Star Wars dream in a long time last night.  I was basically a Rebel spy, working in Imperial Tech Support and sabotaging that division to cause chaos.
1332900934557511681 2020-11-29 12:15:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> Today was writing a short for a friend and some prep on some other projects.  Tomorrow, massive revisions on a project
1332895013823537153 2020-11-29 11:51:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> Just had the privilege to watch @axmascarollive starring Jefferson Mays as EVERY character in the story.  Such a great adaptation of the classic Dickens tale.

1332853308080394254 2020-11-29 09:06:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @NatGertler there was a Star Wars horror book series, FOR KIDS!
1332851953362227206 2020-11-29 09:00:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jbfan911 fell off a wall and smacked onto the pavement
1332844694120894464 2020-11-29 08:31:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Iron_Spike yep
1332844261025460231 2020-11-29 08:30:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AndyShaggyKorty Basically how hard it is for non Big Two writers to get people at their tables at cons.  It's a somewhat self depreciating joke
1332835206915645443 2020-11-29 07:54:10 +0800 <DanielKalban>  https://t.co/pIjEDabMOx
1332834713497702401 2020-11-29 07:52:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> Also:  Star Wars/Star Trek/DC doesn't need saving.  Fandom, on the other hand, needs to be saved from itself as it is spiraling into its darkest behaviors and impulses.
1332834266120646661 2020-11-29 07:50:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> Part of the reason I find the constant pile ons on certain films to be detestable is that so many people worked so damn hard on them, and people are just dismissive of that.

1332821442820513795 2020-11-29 06:59:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MaxieZeusGod I got a Morrison joke, but then chaos magic happened.
1332820873368252419 2020-11-29 06:57:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MaxieZeusGod I had a Bob Kane joke, but he took all the credit

1332817210742599685 2020-11-29 06:42:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> I have an indie comic creator joke, but no one wants to hear it unless I wrote for Marvel.  *sigh*
1332815792807809024 2020-11-29 06:37:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MyCBCollection 4.  But one is my creator owned
1332815502721359872 2020-11-29 06:35:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass @MagsVisaggs It's basically blue 4 loko in a fancy bottle 😈
1332814522327982080 2020-11-29 06:31:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MagsVisaggs So wine mixed with an energy drink?

1332766062115512320 2020-11-29 03:19:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MrNiceGuy18_58 @CBNostalgia @SuperSuitShow @sabrina_push @UpToTASK @Ceesnation @RandyS0725 @Seedalicious @sumter_joshua @jared_webb1 @CircleCity21 JFC, you're OBSESSED!   You have this constant need to bash BvS.
1332765717213614080 2020-11-29 03:18:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheMakCave Oh...I know.  Had to block a wacko earlier.
1332765095580078080 2020-11-29 03:15:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RonJoseph717 I fell off a wall and onto the sidewalk
1332765000256118785 2020-11-29 03:15:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip  https://t.co/r4KRcGQYbd
1332761420828651526 2020-11-29 03:00:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Bosco685 @carmengoesthwip I think I skimmed past it to not raise my blood pressure XD  She's in AQM2 for now, unless WB sees her as a liability.
1332760645310230528 2020-11-29 02:57:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip @Bosco685 Tell me about it.  When it comes to the Snyder enthusiasts (and one of the stars), they don't seem to follow their own "A&gt;E" thing
1332760493207990287 2020-11-29 02:57:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Bosco685 @carmengoesthwip I don't see AH support being to the extent of the JD support, at least not on my social media.
1332759176578265088 2020-11-29 02:52:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Bosco685 @carmengoesthwip It's less support and more seeing asymmetrical reactions to defend a falling idol.  Both sides did ugly things, but only one (Depp) has a rabid lynch mob acting as if he's a martyr.
1332757946342707201 2020-11-29 02:47:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Bosco685 @carmengoesthwip IN my defense, I misread your tweet re: the TMZ thing
1332756386091032581 2020-11-29 02:40:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Bosco685 @carmengoesthwip Point is the hate is assymetrical.  He should be SLAMMED for being abusive too.  If she loses roles, that's up to the studio, as was Depp's firing.
1332756023824805891 2020-11-29 02:39:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Bosco685 @carmengoesthwip Still, see my point re: asymmetrical reactions.  Depp is not innocent, you yourself admitted that. BUT people are rushing to defend him even though he was found to be abusive.
1332755318858784770 2020-11-29 02:36:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Bosco685 @carmengoesthwip Point is both sides are ugly, yet ONLY AH is getting slammed while a whole bunch of people are acting as if Depp is an angel.
1332755076671283200 2020-11-29 02:35:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Bosco685 @carmengoesthwip True, but didn't they edit down to demonize HER (oddly enough)
1332754475350679553 2020-11-29 02:33:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby :D
1332754366839877634 2020-11-29 02:32:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Bosco685 @carmengoesthwip perhaps, but the sudden accusations against the judge doesn't seem credible
1332754247583150080 2020-11-29 02:32:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Bosco685 @carmengoesthwip Key words "TMZ edited it down"
1332754151034544128 2020-11-29 02:32:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby I've been playing since Gen 1, so you can say that XD
1332750813614182403 2020-11-29 02:18:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> A fun fan project I'm helping with :)  (I created the Growlithe character for it)

1332732090090205184 2020-11-29 01:04:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> Would anyone be interested in doing a streaming group live read of A Christmas Carol this holiday season?
1332726943129677826 2020-11-29 00:43:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @EvaIsAdorable He and his cult have really gone off the deep end
1332726696294879234 2020-11-29 00:42:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @LemieuxLGM What's with "Leftists" like Greenwald and their constant desire to attack their allies with lies etc?
1332726057615691779 2020-11-29 00:40:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @nerdist Yogurt  https://t.co/8nF7F7nuLi
1332724999262773250 2020-11-29 00:36:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @schiekapedia Some people are aholes!  I personally try to be prompt with payments and give heads up if there is an issue.
1332701841138839556 2020-11-28 23:04:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip True.  But at the same time, we shouldn't have to make shit up to attempt to cause the downfall. We should be BETTER than that.
1332699607906791427 2020-11-28 22:55:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip Fair, but again, that should be court ordered etc. Not because of an Internet lynch mob that literally makes things up to attack the judge because he ruled against Depp.
1332698933299179521 2020-11-28 22:52:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip I dunno, she may have lost work. Remember, she's lower profile than him (Aquaman aside).
1332697736433594372 2020-11-28 22:47:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> Well, had to block a bot that was spamming a certain post of mine (and ironically proving my point XD)
1332697498528456707 2020-11-28 22:46:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip Also, note that Depp, even though it is PROVEN he is an abuser, isn't getting even CLOSE to the same amount of venom Heard is.
1332697375203332098 2020-11-28 22:46:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip I'm not sure. Problem is people can create audio recordings through trickery as well.  My point being is...can we PLEASE let the courts handle this and use the actual evidence submitted versus airing this all out with publicists and selective "leaks" etc?
1332696321216622593 2020-11-28 22:42:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip Thing is with Heard we're getting a lot of hearsay and rumors, whereas Depp has been proven to be one in a court.  Now with this new claim that Heard is friends with the judge's wife or whatever...now people are literally making stuff up to attack her instead of using evidence.
1332691133609209858 2020-11-28 22:21:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Whityreviewer fandom?
1332688833922666501 2020-11-28 22:12:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Whityreviewer Because tabloids love drama?  I'm just appalled by the mental leaps some people are doing.....
1332687733018554370 2020-11-28 22:08:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> Wow, people will make up ANYTHING to attack Amber Heard and will ignore ANY FACTS about Johnny Depp being found to be an abuser.....  Tell me, where's the proof she's "friends" with the judge's wife, etc?
1332530602613088256 2020-11-28 11:43:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 Its DC. The "fans" assume the worst and just bash, sight unseen, creating a harmful narrative that ultimately harms the film and continues the perception DC can't do anything right.  With fans like that....
1332492142229516290 2020-11-28 09:10:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mngkyouGoD I have a great art team working on this book for me :D

1332403490031865856 2020-11-28 03:18:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> This is a tough one.  Bruce Lee has the speed, but Batman has the size/strength advantage and is fast himself.  Comes down to who makes the wrong move first.

1332202998467076096 2020-11-27 14:02:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> That feeling when you had vivid, action packed dreams...only to find out you only slept for 2 and a half hours.... 🤬
1332161442590633986 2020-11-27 11:16:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone Normally my mom does a savory bread pudding instead of stuffing.   This year, she made a sweet potato, squash, and onion tart instead. It was heavenly.

1332152871480160258 2020-11-27 10:42:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MikeHawthorne Depends on the year.  From what I hear, it's really the Dec-Feb period that's the hardest.

1332121246994198529 2020-11-27 08:37:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JaySandlin_ @alex_segura henchman?
1332120560655101953 2020-11-27 08:34:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> Like I said with the meme designed to have people just DUMP on BvS, I wouldn't toss ANY of these away, INCLUDING the much slandered TROS
1332120390785753090 2020-11-27 08:33:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JoshCrewsReally yep

1332119522820714497 2020-11-27 08:30:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> With the Thanksgiving gluttony over, I officially declare it the Holiday Season!   https://t.co/oD2ymPURKt
1332119371934806018 2020-11-27 08:29:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 Kirby was writing/drawing the book, so ask him! :P
1332118879989084160 2020-11-27 08:27:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ChrisShehanArt a chaotic off the rails one
1332118808325189632 2020-11-27 08:27:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @lachwriter looks great!

1332020841085870081 2020-11-27 01:58:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JustinBirch Well I was streaming earlier, using Streamyard, on FB, YT, and Twitch

1332000032707457025 2020-11-27 00:35:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> Still trying to get better at streaming.  So far, my first stream seems to be the biggest one; I just need to figure out timing etc so I can grab the biggest audience possible.
1331985367508152321 2020-11-26 23:37:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MaxieZeusGod It will likely be on my FB, YouTube, and Twitch.   Probably will do it in the afternoon before dinner
1331978376308002819 2020-11-26 23:09:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> Anyone want to do a Thanksgiving hangout stream today?
1331975794168639488 2020-11-26 22:59:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> I just backed Beautiful Soldiers Graphic Novel on @Kickstarter  https://t.co/3KVB7zeaIr

1331959167469359105 2020-11-26 21:53:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> I need to have some holiday related art for American Dreams for next year.....

1331932107405471747 2020-11-26 20:05:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> This is obscene and must be immediately overturned by the Biden administration
1331918688522526720 2020-11-26 19:12:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> Can I sue the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn for putting me and others in danger with this BS SCOTUS decision they wanted?  Their religious beliefs do NOT get to take priority over public safety and health.
1331918151475458049 2020-11-26 19:10:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> Happy Thanksgiving!   https://t.co/1wCgDjVtCV
1331917111518703616 2020-11-26 19:05:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 Agree and disagree.  She has NOT been proven guilty YET.
1331916790419644416 2020-11-26 19:04:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @nytimes GOPers and the ultra religious are pro virus and pro death it seems.
1331916480116633600 2020-11-26 19:03:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JasonCalvi They sided with the virus, if anything.
1331915792087191553 2020-11-26 19:00:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 Furthermore:  https://t.co/WcumkoOaqB   https://t.co/G0Fxg7TynX
1331915450855399425 2020-11-26 18:59:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 Not to mention, no RELIABLE source is making that claim
1331915287810224128 2020-11-26 18:58:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC fair lol *goes for water*
1331915204058288131 2020-11-26 18:58:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 IF true.  If NOT true, than someone is ALSO guilty of libel, and all to protect their fallen idol.
1331913275030777859 2020-11-26 18:50:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC true XD  Still, not a drinker.
1331913185629249536 2020-11-26 18:50:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 Again, that's a rumor.  Doesn't mean it's true.
1331911558067347456 2020-11-26 18:43:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC Even if I did drink alcohol...a bit early even for Thanksgiving, no? XD
1331911461384450048 2020-11-26 18:43:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 Oh, I'm aware. But they STILL were right, for once.  They proved their case.
1331910348291584000 2020-11-26 18:39:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> Religious "freedom" does NOT, in a SANE world, get to override public health or public safety, ESPECIALLY during a pandemic.  SHAMEFUL ruling by SCOTUS.
1331910049078398977 2020-11-26 18:37:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 No, she's being defended because it's a massive pile-on by a lynch mob of fans because they don't want to see their idol as abuser.  Let the courts decide.
1331908536977264642 2020-11-26 18:31:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 Well there's also the thing where, depending where the recording is made, it might actually be inadmissible in a court due to local recording consent laws.  Which means DEPP gets in trouble.
1331907001618665472 2020-11-26 18:25:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> Nearly 530am on Thanksgiving morning and it is POURING
1331906863013752832 2020-11-26 18:25:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 As reported by who?  Because someone could have made up that recording.   Tabloids and public opinion based on possibly fraudulent recordings are not a court of law.
1331905066060701703 2020-11-26 18:18:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 Not the point.  Point is HE was found guilty.  Until SHE is, WB can't do a thing.
1331801565393465346 2020-11-26 11:26:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Marvinwynn Yes, but he claimed the paper was libeling him by calling him a wifebeater. And the paper proved he was one in court. Ergo...
1331796283246473216 2020-11-26 11:05:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KatarHol5 Yes, but note she hasn't been found guilty in a court. HE has
1331795630998564871 2020-11-26 11:03:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KatarHol5 yep.  Did Heard do wrong as well? Probably. But people keep giving Depp a pass.
1331788039169961987 2020-11-26 10:33:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> A question to the Depp defenders:  You do realize he was fired because HE was the one doing the battering and was shown to be an abuser in a court of law, right?!  Or have you chosen to ignore that fact?
1331786205546094592 2020-11-26 10:25:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> I just backed The Last Ember: Hunted #1 - Urban Fantasy Mystery Comic on @Kickstarter  https://t.co/98dNZslwqG

1331683957461692422 2020-11-26 03:39:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @pittsed_off tempting...
1331670685165432833 2020-11-26 02:46:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> I was looking at the MoMA holiday catalogue, and I *REALLY* want the new Polaroid camera.  This is somewhat out of nostalgia for my grandpa and his Polaroid camera.
1331647131044732933 2020-11-26 01:13:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> Mom: Look at the dough for the savory tart.  Me: *to the dough* You tart!  Mom: It's not a tart until it is filled!  Me: ...unintentional double entendre?  Mom: ...Yes.
1331621020046909440 2020-11-25 23:29:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard so basically he's a potato chip gone stale? 😈
1331619928747683847 2020-11-25 23:25:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard I LOVE Thanksgiving food.   I don't get this guy's issue, at all.  ...Maybe his family can't cook?
1331619255180210176 2020-11-25 23:22:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> Oh shut up, you pretentious prat!
1331617737072893959 2020-11-25 23:16:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @13thCrusader @KrsJams yep!
1331616586084519936 2020-11-25 23:11:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> We have! Repeatedly!  You plugged up your ears and refused to listen to any mainstream Dem!

1331613872134950913 2020-11-25 23:01:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @13thCrusader Yeah, that I don't get at all either.  It's just...nasty. And it doesn't do ANYTHING to promote their own work
1331610895357792256 2020-11-25 22:49:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC True lol  And at least it's not a far walk from the NJ Transit station.  It's something I do want to try, post COVID
1331610714855919616 2020-11-25 22:48:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> Isn't this POTENTIALLY a monopoly?
1331609795552555012 2020-11-25 22:44:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @matthewdowsmith Agreed. I guess its nostalgia combined with the arrogant stuffiness way too many fans have when it comes to new things.
1331609552085790721 2020-11-25 22:43:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> Agreed
1331608190639857665 2020-11-25 22:38:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> I just backed Palmiotti &amp;amp; Johnson&amp;#39;s POP KILL Issues #3 &amp;amp; #4 FINALE on @kickstarter  https://t.co/rPbj2ijgX2   @jpalmiotti
1331607697993641987 2020-11-25 22:36:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @iamLisaHunt Grift
1331607395479527424 2020-11-25 22:35:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC I also say @pulp716 , but I also want to check out Jay And Silent Bob's Secret Stash
1331607156467052558 2020-11-25 22:34:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams Roosevelt was a freaking progressive compared to the modern GOP.
1331606481259597824 2020-11-25 22:31:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AndrewClemson im talking more those deals which are claimed...but are in the head of the creator.  I don't begrudge it when it's true; it's when it's BS is when it gnaws ^^;
1331604770843484165 2020-11-25 22:24:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AndrewClemson Well that works for me :)  I'm referring to someone going "Oh, the film is being made!!!" when they haven't even released issue 1. Or they make these big plans again without publishing.  I get the excitement etc (and I have done some brainstorms), but have a foot in reality!
1331604262179188737 2020-11-25 22:22:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams But why?! Most kids are introduced through comics through superheroes. Why look down at them?  Also, why work in a medium and detest it?
1331604117450526720 2020-11-25 22:22:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> I think I'll do another stream today. Though probably closer to 4 than 330 since that didn't really work on Monday ^^;
1331603284625338369 2020-11-25 22:18:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AndrewClemson It's like...a pro with an agent I'd get. But a regular person before even the first issue is out?
1331603147056422917 2020-11-25 22:18:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BOLTnCO I mean, in some cases I'd understand (usually big name pros with agents who make deals while the comic is being made), but Joe Schmoe?
1331602961672368128 2020-11-25 22:17:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams 100%! I don't get why they do that.
1331602044814299136 2020-11-25 22:14:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> What is your indie comics creator pet peeve? That little thing that indie comics, or their creators, do that just irritates you to no end?  For me? It's people announcing ancillary projects for their IP (film/tv/etc) before the first issue is even in anyone's hands!

1331433596771573763 2020-11-25 11:04:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mvbrat91 PREACH!
1331433539796152321 2020-11-25 11:04:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC I did a story treatment today, gonna attempt a full draft of something tomorrow.  But most days, its usually just random notes and ideas being jotted down.
1331433067853082626 2020-11-25 11:02:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone Agreed. I never liked the Tumbler design of the Nolan films, for example

1331304642848960514 2020-11-25 02:32:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> Just wrote a story treatment for an idea, just to get it out, beginning to end, onto "paper" (well, Google Doc).  It would be my take on a beloved tale's potential origin story. Dunno when I'll do it, in what format, etc. But it might be an interesting take.

1331039837399502849 2020-11-24 09:00:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> Okay, BIG ask here!  Would anyone like to give a review (either in an article, comment, video, etc) of American Dreams issues 1-3?

1330914759189868550 2020-11-24 00:43:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Phantomskyler Yep! Behind the scenes nonsense out of my and Paige's control.
1330912659261313024 2020-11-24 00:34:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> Wrote down more notes for the new idea and notes for yet another idea.  Kinda starting to build my heroic universe, somewhat.   American Dreams will be the root of a brand new superhero universe :) Just need to be able to bring it all to life.
1330908151240069120 2020-11-24 00:16:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KLoeffler @ossoff @ReverendWarnock The only bigot here is YOU, soon to be ex-Senator Loeffler.  BTW, you should go to jail for insider trading.
1330907924118564865 2020-11-24 00:15:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @A_J_Waters I personally don't care.  It's excretion, as long as its going into a toilet (or urinal), it's no one else's business.
1330907391139917826 2020-11-24 00:13:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @nethodiazz Without imo  Looks good either way :)
1330906585665851393 2020-11-24 00:10:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> DO IT!!
1330903851625566214 2020-11-23 23:59:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Therealmanos Without giving too much away? Yes. 😈  IIRC it was a combo of the two given strange tech in the place where they met up.  Problem is even if I read the script bits I have, I can't 100% recall the overall plot 😅
1330898998819950593 2020-11-23 23:40:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RAHeight I am, from the day job. Gotta use those vacation days or lose 'em.  Gonna work more on the comics work though throughout the week.
1330897909701873669 2020-11-23 23:36:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> A little behind the scenes thing.  These were covers done for a crossover b/t American Dreams and a comic called CHESS that unfortunately fell through due to things beyond the control of both creative teams.  What could have been....  https://t.co/kor1F97sLj
1330894340038795264 2020-11-23 23:21:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brykotyk yep!

1330891184370282500 2020-11-23 23:09:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brykotyk Battle Network (and Star Force) were really the only MegaMan games I enjoyed ^^;

1330889439309144068 2020-11-23 23:02:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> PLEASE let this be a remake/remaster of the original games!!!!
1330888666651250688 2020-11-23 22:59:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @_silversmith @jtlarsen Exactly
1330888077368291329 2020-11-23 22:56:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> So I think my post Turkey Day weekend plans are going to be write, write, and WRITE some more!  I got another draft for a certain project to write, and I think I want to draft a first issue of this new idea. Even though I don't know when I can move the latter into production.
1330884828930174977 2020-11-23 22:44:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GOP So you've officially become a fascist org.
1330881655234498561 2020-11-23 22:31:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @danthemcmahon Dunno, but wasn't the miniseries great!
1330880375661486083 2020-11-23 22:26:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> I agree, in part.  Pros have pointed out people are overreacting to bits out of context.  BUT the Big Two do need to allow more chances for up-and-comers
1330878907457875968 2020-11-23 22:20:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattolwell @RealZircher Of course not! (But then again, given he's kinda my namesake, I'm biased ;) )
1330878291507617793 2020-11-23 22:18:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @zakiscorner Also goes to prove that even then fans throw fits when things aren't EXACTLY how they want them

1330876058804101120 2020-11-23 22:09:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> Just wrote some notes for a new idea.  Don't know when I'll be able to produce it, but I wouldn't mind people taking a quick look for advice/input.

1330324512005558272 2020-11-22 09:37:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> Read this!
1330268287587016713 2020-11-22 05:54:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> So I'll be going to do this live video on Monday at 3:30pm ET. It will be streaming on my FB profile, the American Dreams FB page, AND on my YouTube channel   https://t.co/S0DgoF3yGM  Click the "Get Reminder" button, and I hope to see you there!
1330249879625609220 2020-11-22 04:41:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Therealmanos Ah so we don't conflict/overlap as I feared :)  I'm gonna TRY to stream once a week (probably on weekends) just to chat with people etc. See what happens
1330244227473813509 2020-11-22 04:18:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Therealmanos Sure!  What time is yours on Monday btw, I don't want to conflict too much. I was thinking 330pm ET for me.
1330242750952992768 2020-11-22 04:12:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AndyShaggyKorty Yeah, but I work Tues-Thurs so it's not like I have much in the way of options other than Monday or the weekend.  And I might have to shift it overall to the weekend (other than some Sundays as I have D&amp;D those days)
1330241807633043460 2020-11-22 04:08:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AndyShaggyKorty Well I'll try it at least once. If I don't like it, I'll just never use it again.  I think, while I'm on my current schedule, I'll attempt to do a once a week thing (either Monday or Friday afternoon)
1330238909566099457 2020-11-22 03:57:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AndyShaggyKorty Also, should I get a Streamyard account, the free one, in case people want to drop in?
1330238810781847556 2020-11-22 03:57:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> Doing some research for this possible live vid next week... Should I just set up a Streamyard account in case people want to join in?
1330236830600589317 2020-11-22 03:49:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AndyShaggyKorty Yeah.  I mean it's a staycation, if anything given COVID. But if I don't use vacation days, I lose 'em.
1330235304922542080 2020-11-22 03:43:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> Okay, I think I'll do a live vid on FB just talking American Dreams, comics, etc early next week, around Monday or Tuesday afternoon.  Anyone interested in coming along for the ride?
1330234965947199491 2020-11-22 03:41:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AndyShaggyKorty Hmm let me think on it.  I took vacation for all of next week so I have plenty of time.
1330232823844904961 2020-11-22 03:33:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AndyShaggyKorty Because I know I'll sound so high pitched :(  Plus last couple times I did a quick live vid...no one showed up :(
1330230055113515020 2020-11-22 03:22:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> Debating doing a live FB video just talking American Dreams.  I just REALLY hate my voice when its recorded.....  Plus I don't know how many will watch. 😅

1330192988098752512 2020-11-22 00:54:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> My dad and I are having a discussion about whether certain Marx Bros films (Animal Crackers, Duck Soup, Night At The Opera) count as musicals. AC, at least, was adapted from a stage musical starring the Marx Bros.  I argue they are, just not in the modern convention of a musical.
1330191664514822152 2020-11-22 00:49:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> Everyone talks about "The Greatest Showman", but it's not the best musical. Hell, it's not even the best musical about PT Barnum 😈  Look up the show Barnum, with music by the legendary Cy Coleman.  I grew up watching the televised London production. It's so fun.
1330191299765555201 2020-11-22 00:48:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @sistercelluloid @katie_brennan Fair lol  I have the album of the recent revival cast (which I also saw on Broadway, such a fun show)
1330189306921705475 2020-11-22 00:40:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @sistercelluloid @katie_brennan My issue with On The Town is that it uses only a small number of songs from the stage show.
1330189078801879055 2020-11-22 00:39:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattbo_0 @BrooklynBatman_ yeah, she's a hack, and very unethical
1330183654107209729 2020-11-22 00:17:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> There are several other conditions of course (such as forcing Zimmer to use a freaking orchestra), but let's just say I want to be around to protect my baby and to rein in some of ZS' excesses that might clash with how I view it being done.
1330183398573404161 2020-11-22 00:16:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> So I had a bit of a think over who I'd love to see do a film version of American Dreams. And it might surprise you.  Zack Snyder.  BUT, it would be under several conditions, the most important one being I get to be a hands on "creative consultant" as well executive producer.

1329880130496368640 2020-11-21 04:11:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> An episode of the new Animaniacs has a thinly veiled allegory with a hysterical anime parody sequence.  So far, VERY fun!

1329577992624934913 2020-11-20 08:11:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Reason1975 Fair.  On the optimistic side, we Jews did write most of the good ones :)
1329576766323777537 2020-11-20 08:06:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @NemesisFC2 Yeah, that's WAY too early!  I swear, the "War on Christmas" is really Christmas' war on everything else
1329575973466075142 2020-11-20 08:03:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> I heard Christmas music in a deli today.  No, just...no.  Christmas music should be mandated by law to only start the day after Thanksgiving.
1329517359099498498 2020-11-20 04:10:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @philhester XD
1329516549934297088 2020-11-20 04:07:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> I can't believe I have to explain to supposedly educated people that a state AG, like VP-elect Harris was, does not have the power or authority to write or rewrite laws.....  But I had to, because I saw some purity schmuck post a BS meme.....
1329485206122868736 2020-11-20 02:02:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @APMiddleEast And Pompeo is trying to ignite WW3 on his way out.

1329484471998050307 2020-11-20 01:59:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 @The_Snyderverse she appeals to their biases?
1329481959534419971 2020-11-20 01:49:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @The_Snyderverse @stebob1984 She made up stuff to literally hurt BoP, lies that probably did end up hurting it.
1329481791128924162 2020-11-20 01:48:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @stebob1984 She is horrid. Unprofessional, NO ethics whatsoever
1329403163913412608 2020-11-19 20:36:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC @jarredlujan hehehehe
1329402883931054081 2020-11-19 20:35:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> So, what is this building, circa 1900?  Believe it or not, it's how the Metropolitan Museum of Art looked then. The current building was built around the original 1880 structure in various expansions until it became the sprawling museum it is today.  https://t.co/8GznJXythw
1329304138233110528 2020-11-19 14:02:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC Awesome!
1329300775646978049 2020-11-19 13:49:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> Though I have never met them in person, I just had a dream within a dream where I woke up in my old bedroom and @TheOtherMarioC and @jarredlujan were on the floor planning comics.  So of course I join in the planning.
1329255621024165888 2020-11-19 10:50:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DocShaner cool!
1329248615253106690 2020-11-19 10:22:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattryanreal I saw this production when it was on Broadway. You, Keira, and the whole company were brilliant!

1329241723063701506 2020-11-19 09:54:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Johnbatusijack yep!  Reminds me, I need to get the third

1329151309912674317 2020-11-19 03:55:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass He's a comic store owner, one who got banned from Diamond summits for his behavior.  Plus he's got this nasty axe to grind against DC, in general
1329150146463092742 2020-11-19 03:51:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass ah yes, Hibbs.....  He's an ass and I'm sick of the doomsaying

1329148010060787712 2020-11-19 03:42:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> And they're closing down NYC schools now.  I think NYC will be in for a post Thanksgiving lockdown....

1329146931482910724 2020-11-19 03:38:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass Who is being this dickish over digital comics?
1329146807008587778 2020-11-19 03:37:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Joe_Kach Hibbs is such a schmuck and I'm so tired of the bloody doomsaying and the encouraging of said doomsaying
1329146665027198979 2020-11-19 03:37:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JeremyOkelley me neither
1329133450851454978 2020-11-19 02:44:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @FINALLEVEL At this point of my life as a New Yorker, the weird stuff I've seen on the subway just blurs together.
1329132961070002178 2020-11-19 02:42:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RyanHigginsRyan Hibbs and his ilk really give comic shop owners AND fans a bad name
1329132557074640896 2020-11-19 02:41:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SebastianPiriz DM me the specifics please?
1329132508366200839 2020-11-19 02:40:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Eskivoart tell me about it.
1329132442960220160 2020-11-19 02:40:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RyanHigginsRyan FF7R!
1329132333098786820 2020-11-19 02:40:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @nytimes Sue her into complying. Jail her if she won't.
1329131750992326656 2020-11-19 02:37:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RyanHigginsRyan Hibbs is such a putz
1329130957941706756 2020-11-19 02:34:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SebastianPiriz But you see, it has to be THEIR way, or NOTHING!!!  We're dealing with people who don't deal with change very well.
1329130788630171651 2020-11-19 02:34:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Eskivoart yep!  (Which one specifically?)
1329130686259879936 2020-11-19 02:33:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman yep
1329126966637850625 2020-11-19 02:18:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheVillainist yep
1329126232852717570 2020-11-19 02:16:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheVillainist oh definitely.  And I think we can agree the ZS fans went about it the wrong way.
1329123404805517316 2020-11-19 02:04:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheVillainist that's fair, but take it out on it, not the film.  Also, doesn't that make those that reacted to the Sonic CGI ALSO toxic? Why do THEY get a pass?
1329114477271392258 2020-11-19 01:29:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @matthewplmurphy Fair. Lol
1329108869231095810 2020-11-19 01:07:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> He's a freaking ghoul and should have his license revoked.  https://t.co/ScZ3UfI4Lx
1329104712852000768 2020-11-19 00:50:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeanIzaakse @DanSlott Problem is fan toxicity, across all fandoms, keeps increasing
1329104118150025216 2020-11-19 00:48:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter very nice!
1329094008178683905 2020-11-19 00:07:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DarthSCK I'm calling out just joining in the hate and being petty.  It's just...depressing that they can't be above it.  Though, given the harassment the ZS cult put them through, I can't blame them
1329092322051596291 2020-11-19 00:01:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DarthSCK we'll see.  If it turns out to be good (which I hope it does) I'm hoping for some honest mea culpas
1329081591918784512 2020-11-18 23:18:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Hehehe😈
1329079365544472579 2020-11-18 23:09:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby Dunno.
1329078748059029508 2020-11-18 23:07:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> The GOP are nuts
1329077263480983554 2020-11-18 23:01:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> So tired of the pettiness
1329077050158641154 2020-11-18 23:00:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams Yes
1329076958391541763 2020-11-18 23:00:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby From what I understand most of that money is going towards finishing the effects not to mention finalize the footage Snyder shot.  I think he meant 4 minutes in addition to the nearly 4 hours he had previously done?
1329075387805044737 2020-11-18 22:54:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby It's not just in regards to the ZS stuff (though those guys are certainly not helping).  It's just becoming the default. Look what happened with King and that Marvel editor this past weekend
1329074630909255683 2020-11-18 22:50:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby At the end of the day, it's the petty meanness from "fans" and pros that's depressing me
1329074352357208067 2020-11-18 22:49:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby And yet it could still be a good movie....
1329073949913665541 2020-11-18 22:48:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @VKMarion @ComicModern @SquareEnix @DCComics @finalfantasyvii Oooo!
1329073521562062856 2020-11-18 22:46:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby And what if it is good? Hmm?  Seems like they're not gonna give it a fair shot no matter what.
1329072568557559809 2020-11-18 22:42:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> The only thing more "edgy" than Steppenwolf is the ahole "takes" about it.  We get it, you hate Zack Snyder and won't give this new version a fair shot.  Kinda disappointed in seeing pros I respect add onto the pile on.
1329071933418213383 2020-11-18 22:40:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrianLHawkins Yep
1329070813421690880 2020-11-18 22:35:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> I just backed DON'T EVER BLINK Chapter 2 (Issue 2 of 5) on @Kickstarter  https://t.co/SeKgiiUG9G
1329070621649727488 2020-11-18 22:35:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @danmcdaid ?
1329069988238462976 2020-11-18 22:32:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> Arc 3 of American Dreams is outlined!   Just got to write all of arc 2 and get that edited first.
1329049023303573505 2020-11-18 21:09:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> Might outline some ideas for issues 10-13 of American Dreams when I can later today
1328899896682930177 2020-11-18 11:16:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> Okay, time for bed.  I got some script ideas brewing, but I'll have to wait for possibly my lunch break tomorrow to start on them.
1328897537416245248 2020-11-18 11:07:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos yep!
1328896767522459648 2020-11-18 11:04:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos I hope so.  I'm just worried that people are not going to give them fair chances because "it's DC, ergo it sucks"
1328895840174436356 2020-11-18 11:00:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos I hope so, but I fear a narrative has been baked into things and DC's gonna have an uphill climb because people are now programmed to bash.
1328894997823893506 2020-11-18 10:57:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone @HiltonCollins Finally, someone being POSITIVE!
1328894878353338370 2020-11-18 10:56:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos We'll see.
1328893572343619588 2020-11-18 10:51:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos Problem is they retroactively go back to play down the success of those movies.....  And yes, I've seen that happen.  DC is NOT getting a fair shake. Even post ZS, they're still not going to be given a fair shake.
1328891504560136195 2020-11-18 10:43:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos Well, allow me to play Devil's Advocate somewhat.  There is a large, vocal segment of fandom that ANY derivation from their preference is heresy.  Plus look at the organized hate campaign against BoP. People had WRONG notions about it, and that hurt the film.
1328890275348045825 2020-11-18 10:38:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos Well....I think N52 actually got the bashing train rolling tbh, imo.
1328890102387515392 2020-11-18 10:37:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> Me to those just bashing JL over and over again.  https://t.co/DyOoG9JUkz
1328889687059128323 2020-11-18 10:36:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos Eh, remember I'm only a fan of Batman Begins and not so much the other two :P
1328889525481975811 2020-11-18 10:35:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JacobLazaruslim @Bringlydingle @capsacapsa_ @JustSayXtian At the end of the day, I think I can safely seperate actual Catholics who are good people from whatever version of "Catholicism" you're espousing.  Pope Francis would be most disappointed in you. He'll feel better if he returns the Temple treasure to us Jews.
1328888943350337536 2020-11-18 10:33:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JacobLazaruslim @Bringlydingle @capsacapsa_ @JustSayXtian  https://t.co/NZ1d0TbUE4
1328888814790725634 2020-11-18 10:32:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos I think some (not many) dump on it because they hate Snyder, some because DC bashing is popular.  But yes, I do agree his cult does NOT help matters and they (and his) comments/behavior have definitely not helped.
1328888056649306112 2020-11-18 10:29:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos Doesn't exactly disprove my statement though ;)
1328886579448909828 2020-11-18 10:23:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> And I'm now bored of toying with this bigot....
1328885239070986241 2020-11-18 10:18:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JacobLazaruslim @Bringlydingle @capsacapsa_ @JustSayXtian pssst...that false messiah you worship an idol of was pretty damn socialist (see: the copyright infringing "New Testament") and early Christian communities were akin to communes (see: archaeology)
1328884116767584257 2020-11-18 10:13:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JacobLazaruslim @Bringlydingle @capsacapsa_ @JustSayXtian Genocide is genocide, no matter the century.  You are still excusing a crime against humanity.  You are a barbarian.
1328883483490611200 2020-11-18 10:11:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JacobLazaruslim @capsacapsa_ @Bringlydingle @JustSayXtian You are still defending genocide.  Not to mention anti-semetic orgs such as the Inquisition.
1328883016010248193 2020-11-18 10:09:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GLKnight83 Damn right! :D
1328882147407564801 2020-11-18 10:06:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JacobLazaruslim @capsacapsa_ @Bringlydingle @JustSayXtian Spanish conquistadors forced their faith onto another culture, and destroyed that culture AND enslaved its citizens.  Not to mention what Spain did to Jews, Arabs, other Christians, etc.  Just because it was "common" doesn't make it right.
1328881664915869696 2020-11-18 10:04:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JacobLazaruslim @Bringlydingle @capsacapsa_ @JustSayXtian seems like there wasn't much of a mind to make up
1328881560259538945 2020-11-18 10:03:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> So a hyper-Catholic tried to come at some of us Jewish Twitter folk and attempt to convert us.  Needless to say, it's not going well for him.   We got God and snark on our side!
1328879701088153601 2020-11-18 09:56:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JacobLazaruslim @capsacapsa_ @Bringlydingle @JustSayXtian you're insane
1328879645882716160 2020-11-18 09:56:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JacobLazaruslim @Bringlydingle @JustSayXtian @capsacapsa_ Don't you have a commandment to break by worshiping a false messiah, and another for bowing to an idol of that false messiah?
1328878407761932288 2020-11-18 09:51:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @NemesisFC2 yep

1328876765650038786 2020-11-18 09:44:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> I'll crack up if JL:TSC ends up being good, and all its bashers have to begrudgingly admit it.  But I have my doubts they will, even then. They'll go out of their way to bash. The narrative was pre-determined :/

1328876057076916227 2020-11-18 09:41:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone this is a horrid take
1328790031633354752 2020-11-18 04:00:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Johnbatusijack I mean, yes it SHOULD be empty.  But seeing it so empty compared to normal is a bit of a shock
1328789908895490048 2020-11-18 03:59:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Johnbatusijack Its creepy....
1328784364491173888 2020-11-18 03:37:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> Walking through Times Square on a delivery run and its so... empty.
1328781304528297985 2020-11-18 03:25:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> So sick and tired of people preemptively bashing things months before they are even released.  On the other hand, I get to rub it in their faces when they are wrong.

1328695569062178816 2020-11-17 21:44:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams I work one block away from Rockefeller so I'm nervous
1328694504786898944 2020-11-17 21:40:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> And they're putting in the rink at Rockefeller Center. Oy....
1328692442703556610 2020-11-17 21:32:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> Thinking the next "arc" of American Dreams will be two two part stories.  Already ran the concept by my editor @Team__BEAUTIFUL , just need to hear what she thinks.  I have drafted issue 6 and made notes for 7 through 9.

1328532724513189888 2020-11-17 10:57:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> The latest American Dreams pinup!  Introducing the Orchard Street Irregulars! Eli Gold, Julius Marx, and, the token gentile, Jimmy "Nose" Durante!   Don't worry, they have someone watching their backs.  https://t.co/uD938lPkbb
1328515160101838848 2020-11-17 09:47:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> So, a bit of an American Dreams update!  Issue 5 has b&amp;w art done up to page 20, with two pages remaining. Dody sent the layout for page 21 earlier this week and I'm excited!  And Warnia has colored up to page 4.  And I hope to have lettering start soon.  First arc's wrapping up!

1328506390072193025 2020-11-17 09:13:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @gbbloom I still got like 4 weeks (more depending on whether I get a delivery this week) to go before I'm "caught up" (having my pull mailed means I'll be behind by a week or so), but i'm getting there.  The next box has 17!! comics in it! :O
1328504181422960640 2020-11-17 09:04:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> 5 weeks worth of pull list read today.  Gonna go through more on Friday.
1328481019209637890 2020-11-17 07:32:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> You know what the best thing is about basically reading comics for most of the day?  I didn't pay attention to the news! A much more relaxed day.  ...So what kind of hellish BS did I miss?
1328473297621807109 2020-11-17 07:01:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> 4 boxes of pull list down, one on deck (only 7 books in it), 4 to go before I'm caught up*  *Unless more pull list shipments arrive this week.
1328435296829124610 2020-11-17 04:30:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @samskiski These are books from like September XD  Joker War is still good, for example (I read issue 99 earlier, gives you an idea how behind I am)  But for more indie work?  -Undiscovered Country by @Ssnyder1835 @CharlesSoule  -Bigs and Tiny from @BLACKBOXCOMICSP
1328433244254179331 2020-11-17 04:22:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @samskiski yep, in the middle of box 3, have box 4 open and ready to go.
1328352362835161094 2020-11-16 23:00:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> Trying to catch up on some of my comics today.  Thinking of getting through 4 weeks worth (40-50 books!) if possible.  If I do, I still have five weeks worth of pull list packages to get through.  ...Good thing I took off next week for vacation.
1328184191020920833 2020-11-16 11:52:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> While tossing and turning, I think I thought up a short pitch script for one of my comic book ideas. A short prologue if you will.
1328168634716401665 2020-11-16 10:50:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RAD_pencils cool!
1328162971936231427 2020-11-16 10:28:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> Year after I graduated Daemen College.  So glad to have been in the area for school during a "warm period"

1328158858250956801 2020-11-16 10:12:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @gbbloom Yeah it's died down by now.  But it was roaring for a good 20 mins
1328158454985449474 2020-11-16 10:10:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @gbbloom yeah that was the case here too
1328158020145192960 2020-11-16 10:08:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @gbbloom Yeah its quieted down here in Brooklyn, so it must be roaring through the rest of Long Island

1328152404471197698 2020-11-16 09:46:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> GEEZ the storm outside sounds bad.
1328152324905299970 2020-11-16 09:46:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MaxieZeusGod Im part of a creator's convo every week, where we talk some shop.  And I've shown some friends some of my ideas
1328152179455176705 2020-11-16 09:45:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brykotyk yep!
1328150940847845376 2020-11-16 09:40:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MaxieZeusGod yep!
1328150144886464524 2020-11-16 09:37:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> Going through my notes during this bought of self-pity.  I got some damn good ideas that I want to bring to life, when I can.
1328149885829476352 2020-11-16 09:36:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MaxieZeusGod I'm worried it also might be a mild case of burnout too :/  i still have tons of ideas...just no willpower to script them (pages of notes though)
1328149689414406149 2020-11-16 09:35:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cmdrofzed Definitely. Looking at some older idea sheets and I definitely have some fun stuff to pitch.  Just need either funds to create art for it or manage to pitch it based on the writing and THEN find an artist ^^;
1328148454049275905 2020-11-16 09:30:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cmdrofzed Yeah.  But I take my little writing victories when I can :)
1328147175155625991 2020-11-16 09:25:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cmdrofzed Yeah.  I mean I'm still into my projects etc; I dunno what's holding me back now.  $ of course is a major factor, but what's the psychological block? Burnout? I hope not :(
1328146144308977664 2020-11-16 09:21:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> I'm wondering of late if, when it comes to producing scripts, doing promotion, etc...I might be overly cautious and holding back?
1328145351124119552 2020-11-16 09:18:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cmdrofzed It's definitely caution, fear, etc.  It's also a lack of resources, true, but I guess something psychological or mental is holding me back of late?
1328144779713110017 2020-11-16 09:16:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cmdrofzed true.   I guess I'm overly cautious?
1328144221677752320 2020-11-16 09:13:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @eloisahilton Thanks! :D
1328144169135710214 2020-11-16 09:13:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cmdrofzed Yeah, my fear about writing every day is that I don't have the $$ to bring my ideas to life :(  But every couple days, I jot down a few notes here and there for something
1328143317905928194 2020-11-16 09:10:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cmdrofzed Yeah, but I think I can end up writing it during one of my work from home days this week
1328143070676856836 2020-11-16 09:09:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 I always say Batman Begins is the only superhero film in that trilogy and the rest are thrillers dressed up in Batman trappings.
1328141327591223306 2020-11-16 09:02:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cmdrofzed Well, I don't want to write the issue and then have to totally rewrite issue 6, which means issue 7 being written is all for naught.  But on the other hand, being further along with the scripts might be a boon in the long run...hmm....
1328140544522981381 2020-11-16 08:59:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cmdrofzed Well I'm waiting on the greenlight on issue 6 before I go full bore into 7.  On the other hand, doing it later this week can't hurt too much, can it?
1328139742161080320 2020-11-16 08:56:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> Waiting to hear back on the script for American Dreams issue 6 from my editors, but I just wrote some fun notes for issue 7. #writingcomics #amwriting #comics #indiecomics
1328134544126566400 2020-11-16 08:35:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone Batman.  No offense against Spidey, who is another character I love.  It's just that Batman was my entry into comics via the animated series so that tends to be in his favor.
1328119994081751044 2020-11-16 07:37:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter @BrenttHarshman No argument here.

1328099822625239040 2020-11-16 06:17:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeclusionStudio @BrenttHarshman Gotham is such a fun sandbox to write for.  Granted, there's a lot of corners of the DCU I'd love to write, but Gotham is my fave.  Most of the scripts I did for practice were Batman scripts
1328098969369649152 2020-11-16 06:14:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeclusionStudio @BrenttHarshman Let's just say I have ideas.  One of the characters I will be introducing to the mythos won't like those ideas, but I have ideas XD

1328067245029945345 2020-11-16 04:08:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @gbbloom @ArtOfTimBrown @ShortFuseMedia Well, this was the KS that wrapped this summer ^^;  But you should be able to purchase issues soon
1328066499051917312 2020-11-16 04:05:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @gbbloom @ArtOfTimBrown There is the FB page:  https://t.co/8NrPsIOh76  It is usually available at @ShortFuseMedia for purchase. It's currently not there though as we are wrapping up the recent KS before putting them back in the store.
1328064142046097415 2020-11-16 03:55:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @gbbloom Liberty, the main character of my comic, American Dreams.  I write him, I do not draw lol. This was drawn by Dody Eka, with inks by Tebe Andry and colors by @ArtOfTimBrown
1328053145633779718 2020-11-16 03:11:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brykotyk yep lol  And TDKR didn't exactly help.

1328018121244991488 2020-11-16 00:52:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mrcopilot More nastiness?
1328016429560557568 2020-11-16 00:46:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> I know I'm usually pretty snarky, but I think when it comes to comics, sincerity, imagination, a sense of wonder, etc is key. Even for darker characters like Batman.  Explains why I can't get into many comic work along the line of Ennis. WAY too cynical and nasty.

1327990123519225856 2020-11-15 23:01:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @matthewplmurphy Just an observation lol  He's the one who goes "Oh look, I saved Christmas, you can say 'Merry Christmas' again!"  And yet, because of his handling of the pandemic, he's pretty much strangled Christmas gatherings, etc.
1327989711177207812 2020-11-15 22:59:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @renfamous I'd love it if they'd be quiet for a while.  A good long while.  Eternity, even.
1327989163258499074 2020-11-15 22:57:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> Isn't it funny that Trump, in "defending Christmas" in "The War on Christmas" (which is actually Christmas' war on everyone else), is the one who ended up killing Christmas?

1327770775047245827 2020-11-15 08:29:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> There's so many characters I would love to write at DC and Marvel.  I'd probably end up pissing off some fanboys.  I welcome their hate. But it goes to show some people REALLY need to see therapy if they think lashing out at a writer over a comic book is an appropriate thing

Very Inception.....

1327025339923619842 2020-11-13 07:07:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @veronicacris @RyanHigginsRyan Of course they're exaggerating, they get LOTS of clicks from DC bashing

1327025133295427587 2020-11-13 07:07:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RyanHigginsRyan One of these days, DC has to sue him
1327024491353010181 2020-11-13 07:04:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RyanHigginsRyan It's such fearmongering and bashing BULLSHIT!!
1327024147248058369 2020-11-13 07:03:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RyanHigginsRyan did you see this BS BC is spouting?   https://t.co/IfhBhtx2Fm
1327023713125097474 2020-11-13 07:01:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 We'll see.
1327021426516385792 2020-11-13 06:52:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 We'll see.
1327020718236856325 2020-11-13 06:49:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 I meant in regards to fan reaction.  Since he was just, if not more, abusive according to reports, shouldn't he be getting the same reactions she gets?
1327020262420848641 2020-11-13 06:47:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 Selectively edited and leaked.  We aren't in the courtroom, we don't know the full story.  SHouldn't Depp get the SAME amount of hate for being JUST AS ABUSIVE?!
1327019928109641729 2020-11-13 06:46:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> yikes
1327019842076094468 2020-11-13 06:45:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 Consider the possibility of things we aren't privy of and that this may have been selectively leaked.
1327017990756446209 2020-11-13 06:38:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 And? Why is she getting the disproportionate amount of venom then?  Ruminate on that.
1327017468729184261 2020-11-13 06:36:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 And at the same time, he could have been the one who started the whole thing, which means she is still mainly the victim.  Doesn't excuse all that she SUPPOSEDLY (according to UNVERIFIED REPORTS) did, but she's still being slandered.
1327016287063728130 2020-11-13 06:31:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> Good.  She's been slandered by rabid Depp fans.

1326914371990265857 2020-11-12 23:46:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> *think, not thank.  *sigh* Twitter needs an edit function
1326911547088789506 2020-11-12 23:35:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> I thank fandom, ALL fandoms, need to start having a frank conversation about how toxic and obsessive nostalgia is hurting fandom, the things they are fans of, and themselves.
1326905555701686275 2020-11-12 23:11:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Joe_Kach Basically. Too many put "freedom" (which in their mind is an excuse to do whatever they want, consequences be damned) over the common good.  And that's all over this nation, and is rooted in so many various forms of BS.
1326904306726035459 2020-11-12 23:06:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Joe_Kach yes, but too many were just reckless *side eyes Texas*
1326903903456256002 2020-11-12 23:05:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> Potentially Unpopular Opinion:  Star Wars does not need to be "fixed", and I for one am so TIRED of the bashing (which is SO rooted in sexism and racism, not to mention toxic nostalgia) of the sequel trilogy.

1326200678193229827 2020-11-11 00:30:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> I'm calling on @GSAEmily at @USGSA to release the funds now to get the Biden/Harris transition underway! Join me here   https://t.co/M751SaLdxM

1326193535578738689 2020-11-11 00:02:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan oooo  Are we talking KOTOR adaptation or more the general era?  Personally, I'd love to play in the original trilogy era, but Old Republic era is also fun

1325964738770178048 2020-11-10 08:53:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @an9on Thanks!  Just a sneak peek at a little extra something American Dreams related for down the line
1325963806728740865 2020-11-10 08:49:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.

1325959587913150464 2020-11-10 08:32:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> 2 penciled pages and 3 inked to go, and it will be a wrap for Dody and Tebe for issue 5 AND the first arc of American Dreams!  But they'll definitely be coming back for issue 6 and beyond :D.  Plus they already drew a little something I'm going to try to include in vol 1!

1325774730595618817 2020-11-09 20:18:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> If the news coming out of Pfizer this morning is true, we could have a vaccine either end of this year or early next year!!
1325651506520092672 2020-11-09 12:08:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan Could they, please?!  Hell, come January 20th at noon, Twitter has no excuse not to permaban him
1325648997634220032 2020-11-09 11:58:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> President elect Biden must have people from the various Dem factions come to a sit down to hash out differences and find common ground so we can be united in saving our country from the GOP
1325646312411426817 2020-11-09 11:48:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ronmarz Yep
1325638769383510016 2020-11-09 11:18:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> I just saw a conspiracy theory about Kickstarter in a FB group and I have to facepalm.  No, they did not force Boom! Studios to give money to other Kickstarters.....
1325635350329438209 2020-11-09 11:04:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan And on that note, I need to get some sleep (new work schedule). TTYL
1325634392602136579 2020-11-09 11:00:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> Gah! Hate it when my pinky finger falls asleep (and yes, it's ALWAYS the pinky finger, the LEFT one to be exact)
1325633863863971840 2020-11-09 10:58:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan Oh no, all factions are being assholes to each other.  I admittedly shouldn't have called one faction out over the rest.  At the end of the day, we don't have time for moral self-righteousness when we still have work to do
1325632711244062721 2020-11-09 10:54:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan Did you forget the 2018 blue wave?  You shouldn't shit talk liberals "centrists" etc either.  Takes two to do a waltz, after all.
1325632516359921665 2020-11-09 10:53:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan That's how you view it. But that isn't what I'm talking about.  Let's be adults (unlike the GOP), agree to disagree, and move on
1325632175006502914 2020-11-09 10:51:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Therealmanos Same.  I'm more worried about his followers doing terrorist attacks the next four years TBH
1325631930210131969 2020-11-09 10:50:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan At the end of the day, the various Dem factions need to come together to save America from the rapacious Nazis of the GOP.  That does mean, passive aggressive sniping aside, we DO need to find the common ground between Dem factions so we can win more seats in Jan and later.
1325630948709453825 2020-11-09 10:47:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan You do realize I'm lumping myself in with that "assholes" remark too? Read the full sentence.  I just have a natural aversion to people who call for ideological purity. That never ends well imo.  Did she not attack "liberal" or "centrist" dems throughout the election?
1325630175468511233 2020-11-09 10:43:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan did you not see the part where I said "my fellow progressives"?   Yes, we're being assholes. So is the old guard.  Time to stop being assholes to each other. Every time we have this intra party bitch fest, the GOP gets another claw back.  (And yes, I needed to vent a little)
1325629615877001221 2020-11-09 10:41:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RobinCook yep
1325629408045125634 2020-11-09 10:40:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan And?  They're both right.  Like it or not, both AOC and the other Democrat have valid points.  They should stop sniping at each other and instead put their heads together to stop the GOP and get us those Senate seats.
1325625881772044288 2020-11-09 10:26:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> Arrest her!
1325623290820440064 2020-11-09 10:16:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @alex_segura yep. *sigh*
1325622391628836867 2020-11-09 10:13:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> Matzah Ball, like your grandma (or bubbe) used to make
1325622043027644416 2020-11-09 10:11:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> QT to edit and specify  I mean finding common ground amongst each other, not with the GOP/Trumpsters. Those schlemihls can go BLEEP themselves with a BLEEP BLEEP BLEEPITY BLEEP!
1325620462194397184 2020-11-09 10:05:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> A message to all factions of the Democratic Party:  We have two choices as a party  -Find common ground to forward greater good  OR  -Fight amongst ourselves and let the GOP get away with dirty tricks.  Be adults. Choose the first option.
1325619639662080001 2020-11-09 10:02:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @PELightning @TheOtherMarioC No, they both do.  ALL Dem factions need to stop the condescension etc toward each other and find common ground.   And I mean ALL.  I am sick of centrists and "neoliberals" (which a BS term) turning their nose up at progressives, and I'm sick of progressives being puritans.
1325619057136111617 2020-11-09 09:59:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @PELightning @TheOtherMarioC Look at the top tweet in the convo where I called for finding common ground between the various Dem factions instead of doing the intra-party sniping
1325618860477788160 2020-11-09 09:58:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @PELightning @TheOtherMarioC That's not what I said.  I said to find common ground. Use that to combat the GOP. Stop the purity BS.
1325618115607224321 2020-11-09 09:56:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattnick1983 @VKMarion @Seaborne_Inks ooo!!
1325617109070712832 2020-11-09 09:52:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC Yep, as is holier than thou attitudes and condescension XD  But I'm seeing AOC badmouthing older Dems and Dems who might be sympathetic but may not agree and I think "Lady, read the room. Do this AFTER we get the senate, not when Trump/GOP might kill us all!"
1325616479971270656 2020-11-09 09:49:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> Maybe my fellow progressives should stop being aholes and actually, y'know, talk to liberals, "centrists", etc and come to common ground to stop GOP BS instead of, y'know, waging an intra-party war at a time when we shouldn't!

1325090566623932416 2020-11-07 22:59:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrianLHawkins It will be amusing to watch.   I wonder if the Secret Service will bump his head when loading him into the police car. 😈
1325089949826347008 2020-11-07 22:57:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Joe_Kach yep.  And now these Trumpster gnats are threatening election workers, doing intimidation, attempting terrorist attacks, etc.  Just call it before it gets worse!

1324736574479806467 2020-11-06 23:33:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> Per NYT:  A Biden spokesman says that if Biden wins and Trump refuses to concede, “The United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.”

1324685305979506689 2020-11-06 20:09:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> Come on GA and PA! Bring it home today for Biden so we can kick Trump to the curb!

1324350621621886979 2020-11-05 21:59:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DJBawlzy @CNN Yeah.  Though Arizona isn't called by all networks.
1324349812997791744 2020-11-05 21:56:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> 50k votes left in Georgia, per @CNN .  If more than half goes Biden (possible as most are from blue areas), we get Georgia.
1324349007481737216 2020-11-05 21:53:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass I just have my dad (who is a lawyer) look over my contracts
1324348920839970816 2020-11-05 21:52:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass I use the accountant at my old job; he charges me a minimum fee ^^; and he does GREAT work
1324346134773587977 2020-11-05 21:41:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @EdwardTHardy I hope so
1324345457980702720 2020-11-05 21:38:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass This is why I use an accountant ^^;
1324345288686010369 2020-11-05 21:38:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass exactly
1324345039724650497 2020-11-05 21:37:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @philchoart True.  Unless the Trumpsters riot.
1324344971265249282 2020-11-05 21:37:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass They must have been like "This is MY time!"  Coincidentally, had my first ever cronut recently.
1324344472596086784 2020-11-05 21:35:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @slimmyii2 @mkraju Bye bye!
1324344333869420545 2020-11-05 21:34:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter @Rschooley @ChuckWendig I wouldn't call what the Trumpsters are doing a protest.  I call it terrorist threats and intimidation, to be blunt.
1324344085314998273 2020-11-05 21:33:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass 1. So basically it's a cronut?  2. They are going after a VERY specific audience with this ad, aren't they? XD
1324343815986139136 2020-11-05 21:32:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mister_Walsh *raises hand*
1324343655046533123 2020-11-05 21:31:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Yep! Trumpsters are lunatics. (That's being nice)
1324343470484574208 2020-11-05 21:31:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter I see no reason That GOP Treason Should ever be forgot 😈  https://t.co/licIczdSyq
1324343273381597185 2020-11-05 21:30:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> Great interview on @CNN right now with @GovWhitmer
1324343037468835840 2020-11-05 21:29:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @philchoart According to analysis, they are VERY unjustified.
1324340034779160576 2020-11-05 21:17:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> I hope these Trump lawsuits are thrown out
1324337477256175618 2020-11-05 21:07:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> Remember Remember The 5th of November GOP Treason And Plot I see no reason That GOP Treason Should Ever Be Forgot.  https://t.co/WshhZRZqs3

1324297379869327365 2020-11-05 18:27:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MiltonAguiarArt yep, they know they're about to lose power, and therefore will face consequences
1324291730066280448 2020-11-05 18:05:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman Nevada supposedly at noon, Arizona by night.  Still looks good for Biden.  Plus GA or PA might go our way today
1324291481931259905 2020-11-05 18:04:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> Trumpsters are resorting to terrorism, threats, and intimidation as the vote continues to go Biden's way.
1324291159640969217 2020-11-05 18:03:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MaricopaVote @maricopacounty @mcsoaz I hope they arrested those Trumpster terrorists
1324164192887341056 2020-11-05 09:38:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> X-Wings, launch your proton torpedoes at Trump's Death Star.  Let's blow this thing and go home.  https://t.co/A7h4Pgi5rm

1324135809486856192 2020-11-05 07:45:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Inquisitive_Elf yep
1324127291144888328 2020-11-05 07:12:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> while I agree with the sentiment, the Trumpsters ARE enemies of the United States
1324126952815534084 2020-11-05 07:10:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RealKevinConroy You're Batman! Don't sell yourself short! :P
1324117394768408582 2020-11-05 06:32:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @realDonaldTrump Not how it works.  You lost.
1324117211431215107 2020-11-05 06:31:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter He's a bully. they tend to be sore losers when they lose power
1324116955603808256 2020-11-05 06:30:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MatthewKeysLive yikes

1324115934001401858 2020-11-05 06:26:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> Trump is having a meltdown
1324110385507667968 2020-11-05 06:04:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> TRUMP HAS NOT WON. PASS IT ON.
1324107920297074688 2020-11-05 05:55:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @salwangeorges @washingtonpost Fascist terrorists.   Too late now, Biden won.😈
1324106345092702208 2020-11-05 05:48:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter @jarredlujan New York Times
1324106070474825729 2020-11-05 05:47:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter @TonyVnrs Yeah. And it's likely both are in the bag.  We might also flip PA and GA when the final tally is done
1324105287142395904 2020-11-05 05:44:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter @jarredlujan AP/NYT just called it
1324105038311161857 2020-11-05 05:43:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter @jarredlujan Yep!
1324103871329873922 2020-11-05 05:38:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter @jarredlujan Michigan just went for Biden though. We won :D
1324103461768695812 2020-11-05 05:37:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> Next up, the Trump kids, including Barron
1324102424362012672 2020-11-05 05:33:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jpalmiotti Trumpsters are fascists
1324102036741378052 2020-11-05 05:31:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @rpace Awesome!
1324101959478087688 2020-11-05 05:31:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> Michigan appears to be called for Biden.
1324100709638438917 2020-11-05 05:26:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan GOP is fascist
1324097358339203073 2020-11-05 05:13:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 That WB hates fans or something.  @BrooklynBatman_ care to weigh in
1324097254257549315 2020-11-05 05:12:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ericpalicki No idea, @BrooklynBatman_ knows better than I would.  But apparantely it's along the lines of "WM HATES FANS!"
1324096197078978561 2020-11-05 05:08:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> Grace Randolph is making up BS to slander DC Comics...again
1324095637504380928 2020-11-05 05:06:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump That's not what reality says
1324095550334140416 2020-11-05 05:05:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrooklynBatman_ She's a DC bashing lunatic
1324095465042907138 2020-11-05 05:05:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @EricTrump Race is still being counted, schmuck!
1324087813395152901 2020-11-05 04:35:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Yep.  Apparantely GOPers are swarming where they're counting the ballots, attempting to disrupt the process   https://t.co/FsHymbS2fX

1324071283341053963 2020-11-05 03:29:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> AP/NYT officially calls Wisconsin for Biden! It's a flip!
1324063839894310912 2020-11-05 02:59:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> Well, my adrenal glands stopped hurting, now its just a dull ache
1324046321913835520 2020-11-05 01:50:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> Trumpy is having a meltdown!  He knows he's gonna lose.

1324035040884510722 2020-11-05 01:05:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 @KylerClodfelter WI is all but officially called for Biden. Michigan is likely.   PA might head into the column as well if the absentee votes overcome Trump's advantage.
1324033003069255681 2020-11-05 00:57:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MitchGerads Yep!

1324021491218948097 2020-11-05 00:11:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Yep.  Look at the NY breakdown.  Most NY counties are rural.and conservative. But the cities tend to balance them out, even if the county a city is in goes red
1324015750194077698 2020-11-04 23:48:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cloudwrangler @jarredlujan oh my adrenal glands are in agony from the stress

1324012970804944900 2020-11-04 23:37:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> We just need Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Michigan!  It's very doable!  Keep up the hope!  https://t.co/2JMu6KIpFD

1323943988697714688 2020-11-04 19:03:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> Up early.  Not a great night's sleep; too much stress/adrenaline.  Things are looking better though. We can still win!

1323719780461924353 2020-11-04 04:12:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> I asked my mom if I could get my free @TomKingTK and she went "you already do those things! Why do you need another you?"  Just as well, I don't know if I'm ready for comic book writer ownership. I mean, between feeding, walks, and major comic events...I'm not ready.

1323278426250399745 2020-11-02 22:58:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos @KatarHol5 I think that's what a narrative about her is. Doesnt mean that narrative (concocted by fans) is the truth

1323048220348604416 2020-11-02 07:44:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> Read this
1323048119278444544 2020-11-02 07:43:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> Seriously, do NOT defend Trumpster terrorism and police fascism on my posts.
1323047932514414593 2020-11-02 07:43:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CriticalBlast No, hate them for being terrorists.
1323047637680087042 2020-11-02 07:41:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CriticalBlast No, they just intimidate, threaten violence, attempt to suppress the vote, kill innocent people (Kenosha, etc)  Shows the police's hypocrisy and support for fascism
1323047417277751298 2020-11-02 07:40:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CriticalBlast yes.  But notice one more distinction:  BLM: blocks with bodies, can move to let vehicles etc pass in emergency.  Trump Terrorists: block with vehicles, making it impossible to pass.
1323046595617804290 2020-11-02 07:37:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CriticalBlast Also, funny how the police goes after one but not the other....
1323045966333779968 2020-11-02 07:35:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CriticalBlast And yet BLM had good reasons to protest.  Trumpsters just want to intimidate and troll.
1323045474220363778 2020-11-02 07:33:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CriticalBlast Point is the hypocrisy. Not to mention their calls for violence against BLM.  Meanwhile, they are proving Trumpsters ARE terrorists.
1323044451653222406 2020-11-02 07:29:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Philjimeneznyc they are INSANE!!

1323042897042853888 2020-11-02 07:23:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @NYPDnews You have turned into a fascist organization.  This is why the citizens of this city have lost their trust in you!  Want to regain it? ARREST THE TRUMPSTERS!
1323035505869672448 2020-11-02 06:53:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MitchellDStein1 the police, if they actually WERE doing their jobs and weren't white supremacist Trump agents, should have arrested them
1323033987523223553 2020-11-02 06:47:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RobinCook Either in the crowd or giving quiet support to these right wing terrorists
1323033555765702656 2020-11-02 06:45:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> So, Trumpsters are blocking bridges and highways in NY and NJ.... Weren't they attacking BLM for doing the same? Well, it's not like they're gonna get much support here anyways; but this is increasingly infantile and insane.....

1322623304826572806 2020-11-01 03:35:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Ssnyder1835 Uh oh....  Check for traps, hidden mazes, and mysterious masks!
1322620941696929793 2020-11-01 03:26:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> Something I noticed watching Sleepy Hollow today.  There is this five note motif.  When in a major key, it's symbolizing good, love, etc.  When in a minor key, it symbolizes evil, danger, etc.
1322566862627049473 2020-10-31 23:51:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> RIP Sir Sean Connery  https://t.co/2kQ4CkvTK0

1322546705347338241 2020-10-31 22:31:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> Something I want to do for American Dreams, when the first trade is finally released, is to eventually have an original orchestral soundtrack for it. A main theme, character themes, score for the big moments, etc.  Just need to figure out how to do that....

1321887951392002048 2020-10-30 02:53:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> Oh look, the ZS cult is believing an obvious biased butt kissing interview as "proof" of a coverup on a certain film.  I read that article, it's journalistic malpractice.

1321886954942857219 2020-10-30 02:49:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> The Forbes article about RF is such a biased POS buttkissing piece.
1321886736901906433 2020-10-30 02:48:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> Kinda irritating...no, INFURIATING, to see British leftists defend anti-Semitism.  So much for being allies to us Jews.....
1321886348907827200 2020-10-30 02:47:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RobinCook still waiting to see mine is. It's been marked "ballot recieved valid" for over a week

1321854877031686146 2020-10-30 00:42:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Hmm....I need to think on this. There's got to be something I could contribute (albeit in my more preferred genres)
1321854700304683008 2020-10-30 00:41:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AWaveBlueWorld Also, how do we sign up to write for it?

1321840859432759297 2020-10-29 23:46:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> I think the American Dreams issue 6 script I wrote yesterday was definitely a good one :) Definitely more of a story driven issue than action packed.  But don't worry, there's action in there too.

1321589522736533505 2020-10-29 07:07:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Johnbatusijack :D  I started writing it this morning, worked on it during lunch and breaks at work, and just finished it after dinner.
1321589161778962432 2020-10-29 07:06:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> The first draft of issue 6 of American Dreams is DONE!!!

1321417134686326789 2020-10-28 19:42:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> Ended up writing the first four pages (about 25% or so) of issue 6 of American Dreams this morning before heading out to work.   I could potentially have everything done by lunch if not tonight/tomorrow, depending how things are at work, at lunch, etc.
1321405055329832960 2020-10-28 18:54:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> Woke up, shaved, and immediately sat down to write the first page of issue 6 of American Dreams before breakfast. Mainly to get it out of my head and onto "paper" before I forgot what I wanted to do. I'll probably write more of it at lunch or after work tonight.

1321204307543363590 2020-10-28 05:37:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> I'm guessing that, going by the meme going around, Ivanka or a Kardashian did something very tone deaf and "Let Them Eat Cake"?
1321199817398341632 2020-10-28 05:19:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jason_stallman @HeatherAntos After Thanksgiving
1321199782451437574 2020-10-28 05:19:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AbbitJay @HeatherAntos it ALWAYS shot first
1321199726260342784 2020-10-28 05:18:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HeatherAntos Seriously, there needs to be a law: NOTHING Christmas until the day after Thanksgiving.
1321198748412923905 2020-10-28 05:15:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Joe_Kach ?
1321198534415233027 2020-10-28 05:14:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Demonpuppy cool!
1321198319599788032 2020-10-28 05:13:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> Just rolled up an awesome damage dealing character for my friend's D&amp;D game.  Given that I usually play healers, this is gonna be an interesting change.
1321193028372094976 2020-10-28 04:52:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CrusaderZero6 he certainly doesn't help
1321126647702183936 2020-10-28 00:28:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> Something BIG is coming to the Lower East Side in American Dreams #4. And not only will Jake Gold be in the fight of his life, it's the entire neighborhood, and the lives of his fellow immigrants, at stake.  Coming soon....  #comics #indiecomics #makingcomics #superhero  https://t.co/fnQo3ph2Ih
1321110974447951872 2020-10-27 23:26:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JamesGr84011323 @ComicsBookcase And thank you for proving my point.
1321110884333342720 2020-10-27 23:25:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> Kinda pissed at the ignorance of some people right now.  Seems that every time we Jews express a want for representation or a concern about something, it is hand waved and dismissed.   Its basically antisemitic behavior that is condoned by society.
1321107689817210881 2020-10-27 23:13:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> Going on a walk to run errands and to hopefully calm down.
1321103796852973569 2020-10-27 22:57:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 ...How Jewish is he?
1321092721470246913 2020-10-27 22:13:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsBookcase People are just going at that book to be nasty at this point
1321092029615656960 2020-10-27 22:10:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> Trying to explain to purposefully ignorant people why I wanted a Jewish actor for Moon Knight is exhausting.  And they don't seem to realize why their ignorance is insulting.
1321088465988128770 2020-10-27 21:56:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> So tempting....   https://t.co/uli9ePJUL4
1321087344624214022 2020-10-27 21:52:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsBookcase yeah
1321087293340454912 2020-10-27 21:52:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CriticalBlast @jpalmiotti @bleedingcool we'll see
1321085298856599559 2020-10-27 21:44:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsBookcase i just want to promote my own work and let it speak for itself, is that so hard?  Plus the taking constant potshots just comes off as mean
1321085125279571968 2020-10-27 21:43:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> “Without giving your age, name three of your earliest crushes.”  https://t.co/GCbl1eth9l
1321084461568634883 2020-10-27 21:40:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicsBookcase well, I'm boned
1321083266607304705 2020-10-27 21:36:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> So flipping angry!  But at least I voted so hopefully that helps!  That is, if the NYC Board of Elections has ACTUALLY counted my mailed in ballot!! They acknowledged they received and validated it, but I don't know if it's been counted.
1321079526668066818 2020-10-27 21:21:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @EdwardTHardy They're WILLFULLY blind. They'd rather attacked the "impure Dems" than actually go after the REAL enemy and put in the real work.
1321078059043299331 2020-10-27 21:15:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CriticalBlast @jpalmiotti @bleedingcool BTW, that "railroaded healthcare plan" gave me affordable, mostly free, healthcare until I could get a job that provided me with insurance. So I'd rather protect it for others than rip it up and put others in harms way.  Because, unlike GOPers, I'm not a sociopath!
1321077565579235334 2020-10-27 21:13:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CriticalBlast @jpalmiotti @bleedingcool That's BS.  Trump has already ignored Constitutional norms, as has the GOP.  The ENTIRE GOP must go.
1321075730990641154 2020-10-27 21:06:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CriticalBlast @jpalmiotti @bleedingcool And yet the descriptor is accurate.  What has the GOP done, IN MY LIFETIME, that has been good?  My entire life, I've seen them go from bad to worse.  Trump is their fascist endpoint.  They want to end HEALTHCARE for crying out loud!
1321074053592027138 2020-10-27 20:59:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CriticalBlast @jpalmiotti @bleedingcool Given how hateful and evil right wing dogma is now, why should it be tolerated?
1321073820393000960 2020-10-27 20:58:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MitchGerads Yeah, my ballot was received and verified here in NYC on the 21st and they STILL haven't verified/counted it yet.
1321073495774814208 2020-10-27 20:57:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ajplus Trumpsters are terrorists.
1321073474702610434 2020-10-27 20:57:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheNedBarnett @HeyJJLopez Trumpsters are terrorists.
1321073041506525185 2020-10-27 20:55:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DerfBackderf my condolences
1321072971834937345 2020-10-27 20:55:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TimBoard64 Nope!
1321072834928664576 2020-10-27 20:54:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DocShaner It's because Trumpism is a cult
1321064067549794305 2020-10-27 20:19:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jpalmiotti @bleedingcool It's almost as if writing/drawing heroes makes one want to support the greater good and not, oh I dunno...the Tangerine Tyrant?
1321063509149552640 2020-10-27 20:17:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby my condolences
1321051185797832705 2020-10-27 19:28:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @seankent @tomtificate Exactly! Thank you!  Too many people blame the Dems when they could have VOTED for more Dems into power to prevent this.
1321044844949753857 2020-10-27 19:03:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> Apparently Jewish erasure is okay in the minds of people for mass media adaptations....
1321044195302428672 2020-10-27 19:00:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> Had a dream last night that I got an artist alley badge for a con in Chicago...only to find out that due to miscommunication my publisher got a booth or something as well.  Well, it's the most convention anything related ANYTHING I've done in months.
1321040151137685504 2020-10-27 18:44:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @0_0_1_destruct Yep
1320919991202516992 2020-10-27 10:47:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 @whatname2016 Maybe? This is where it goes beyond my metaphorical paygrade.
1320916819624996865 2020-10-27 10:34:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 @whatname2016 It's his father's side and its further back in his family tree
1320914704735309826 2020-10-27 10:26:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 @whatname2016 To be considered a full Jew, it comes from the maternal bloodline
1320914576301502465 2020-10-27 10:25:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 @whatname2016 ? What is the question?
1320911126570348551 2020-10-27 10:12:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Steve_Petro Yep
1320909148339490819 2020-10-27 10:04:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ronmarz The purity progressives are Trump enablers and should be treated as such.
1320905947267694592 2020-10-27 09:51:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> Okay, need to lower my hackles so I can get some sleep instead of toss and turn all night.
1320903055773224961 2020-10-27 09:40:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> 10. Oh God, yes!
1320901720462024705 2020-10-27 09:34:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> check this out!  https://t.co/FPg8rdqpqb
1320900583843385348 2020-10-27 09:30:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Therealmanos The bet, not the election, to be clear
1320899388349337604 2020-10-27 09:25:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Therealmanos Can we TRY to be optimistic?  The enemy is the GOP, not the Dems.
1320898430353494016 2020-10-27 09:21:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> To say I'm angry and want to rain hellfire on the Neo Nazi terrorist group known as the GOP is to make a severe understatement.
1320895495997456384 2020-10-27 09:10:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DavidRF34 They'd rather attack Schumer because that's easier than actually putting in the work to stop GOP terrorism.
1320894620641972226 2020-10-27 09:06:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 yep.  And JAIL THE HELL out of Trump, his family, McConnell, etc.
1320892137899253760 2020-10-27 08:56:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RyanHigginsRyan We should.
1320891128204398592 2020-10-27 08:52:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> Time to go to war against the GOP.  Vote them ALL out, and extinguish their power for generations.
1320888085152935936 2020-10-27 08:40:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Therealmanos we'll see.
1320885170740887552 2020-10-27 08:29:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KatarHol5 @KamalaHarris There is no precedent saying we can't :)  Plus ACB was advanced to be nominated through a procedure that broke the judiciary committee rules.
1320884807195365378 2020-10-27 08:27:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> ZS cult: We want directors to have creative freedom. But ONLY if its Zaddy and his glorious vision!  JFFM...these guys sound like Darkseid's lackies....
1320884585761222657 2020-10-27 08:26:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Dlund87 these people are deranged
1320884310568849410 2020-10-27 08:25:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KamalaHarris I hope once the Biden administration takes over, you will remove ALL Trump justices and judges.
1320884129446113280 2020-10-27 08:24:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 @KatarHol5 Nah, the weirdos were always here.
1320883639220129799 2020-10-27 08:22:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KatarHol5 @Mikey_hbk90 Not that I'm aware of; but these people are so dead set on hating anything that isn't blessed by Zaddy that they make up shit to slam the other DC films.
1320883403105968129 2020-10-27 08:21:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @nytimes She is illegitimate
1320883355353817088 2020-10-27 08:21:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @215Ink Doctor who?  https://t.co/Jb5FMI6cEW
1320882961470947334 2020-10-27 08:20:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrooklynBatman_ They are just nasty people who are part of a cult.
1320882501301186568 2020-10-27 08:18:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 It's a cult....
1320882223470596096 2020-10-27 08:17:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Jafleece if we don't hope, we give into Trump.
1320882144168845313 2020-10-27 08:16:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DerekLChase nice!
1320881720539971586 2020-10-27 08:15:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 We're dealing with deranged people
1320881565765931008 2020-10-27 08:14:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> ACB is illegitimate and will be removed from SCOTUS when Biden and the Dems take power.
1320879273482375169 2020-10-27 08:05:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> 9. American Dreams is inspired by Ragtime (the book/musical), my love of history, and my love of superhero comics.
1320879054296358918 2020-10-27 08:04:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> Died of the same condition he fought to deny benefits for for his employees.   https://t.co/FkwPMSEGOL
1320875889853403136 2020-10-27 07:52:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> 8. I write some romance. So far it's been heterosexual, so I should expand beyond that.
1320875723167567883 2020-10-27 07:51:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KatarHol5 *shrug*
1320855400217038848 2020-10-27 06:30:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> How about not doing this with the low hanging fruit to continue the non stop closed minded hate against it and put in an actual challenging one, like TDK
1320851363262304259 2020-10-27 06:14:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> Batman's greatest enemy is himself.  And I don't mean that in the smartass way certain people do.  He holds himself to extremely high standards, and beats himself up when he fails.  Which is why the Bat Family is so important; they help him shoulder the burden.
1320847513079980032 2020-10-27 05:59:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TomKingTK yep!!
1320846678220591106 2020-10-27 05:56:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @alex_segura @mattkrotzer Agreed. She's illegitimate.
1320846577741799424 2020-10-27 05:55:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JoshuaPotash Not to mention she could be technically there illegitimately.
1320831370915172353 2020-10-27 04:55:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HillaryClinton Happy Birthday!
1320831154921132032 2020-10-27 04:54:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> 7. You know...I dunno....
1320828298176376838 2020-10-27 04:43:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 yep
1320827122043281414 2020-10-27 04:38:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 I mean...have you seen extreme fans, in general?
1320825068981751808 2020-10-27 04:30:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner @HackinTimSeeley @declanshalvey @St3Caselli will do!
1320824732921593858 2020-10-27 04:28:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner @HackinTimSeeley @declanshalvey @St3Caselli Okay :) I'll try to pick that up when that time comes
1320823678792355842 2020-10-27 04:24:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner @HackinTimSeeley @declanshalvey @St3Caselli Yep, got ya! Realized that after I blew up the pic so I could read the details ^^:
1320823418795806721 2020-10-27 04:23:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HackinTimSeeley @GregoryEllner @declanshalvey @St3Caselli Yeah I realized that after I blew up the picture ^^; mea culpa.
1320823295814602752 2020-10-27 04:23:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner @HackinTimSeeley @declanshalvey @St3Caselli Ah I stand corrected :)
1320822966746308608 2020-10-27 04:21:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GregoryEllner @HackinTimSeeley @declanshalvey @St3Caselli you'd think the omnibi would be chronological order? XD  But yes I'll rely on that.
1320821667808116738 2020-10-27 04:16:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HackinTimSeeley @declanshalvey @St3Caselli Backed!   Never read H/S so I thought this would be a great way to start (plus @GregoryEllner keeps telling me to read it :) )
1320821409921335298 2020-10-27 04:15:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> Given how much @GregoryEllner keeps telling me to start reading Hack/Slash, I think this is a good way for me to start :)   https://t.co/najgJPs8BR
1320818667349807109 2020-10-27 04:04:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @theaginggeek @Demonpuppy Awesome!
1320817931387883520 2020-10-27 04:01:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> very telling
1320817724948418560 2020-10-27 04:00:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> 6. Drafting is definitely more enjoyable.
1320817396509216768 2020-10-27 03:59:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Paulie772 You're an apologist for hate, murder, and insanity. Blocking you now.
1320815612285902848 2020-10-27 03:52:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> 5. I think "just right", but I've been told I underwrite from time to time
1320815487136268294 2020-10-27 03:52:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @dan_raga @conorjrogers Which goes to show the lack of palate in that family.
1320815393926164481 2020-10-27 03:51:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Paulie772 From the far right National Review.  Doesn't count.   https://t.co/IGYMfi9h8s  You are an apologist for murderers
1320814654457864192 2020-10-27 03:48:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> 4. Plantser
1320814514821079047 2020-10-27 03:48:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> 3. Not enough ^^;
1320814266279174146 2020-10-27 03:47:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Paulie772 There is NUMEROUS evidence and historical records that back me up on their cruelty, especially towards MY people.  You are an antisemite.
1320811848103546884 2020-10-27 03:37:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Paulie772 @JustSayXtian BULLSHIT!
1320811299169861635 2020-10-27 03:35:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> 1. Superhero 2. WAY too many
1320811117095096321 2020-10-27 03:34:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @renfamous Not Jewish enough :P
1320809965171429388 2020-10-27 03:30:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> Stealing this from @jarredlujan   Let's do this  https://t.co/U5H2IYGpIK
1320809739606020096 2020-10-27 03:29:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kimota1977 yes
1320809582076301312 2020-10-27 03:28:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 Yeah. I mean, OI does have some Jewish ancestry, but I'd prefer a Jewish actor to break stereotypes.
1320809357966266370 2020-10-27 03:27:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 He's a Marvel zealot
1320799323320389634 2020-10-27 02:47:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> Three weeks of comics read.  Six boxes/weeks worth to go before I'm "caught up".
1320780808202919936 2020-10-27 01:34:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> Oscar Isaac is in talks to be Moon Knight.  I mean...he's a great actor, but they couldn't find anyone Jewish?

1320721232032129026 2020-10-26 21:37:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @danmcdaid I just can't believe that the BREXIT PARTY is actually on the side of decency for once.  What's the catch?
1320720247045951488 2020-10-26 21:33:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TylerWalpole I'm gonna catch up on my comic pull list backlog.  I got like 9 or so weeks worth I gotta get through.
1320699807057518592 2020-10-26 20:12:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> He's desperate.  https://t.co/cOCk5K4qHL
1320698098067406851 2020-10-26 20:05:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> resharing this little thread now that it's daylight hours.
1320640758819524608 2020-10-26 16:17:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CullyHamner @60Minutes Problem is too many people have bought into Reich wing agitprop
1320640278156464128 2020-10-26 16:15:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass Hehehe
1320639543176007680 2020-10-26 16:12:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @IVWall My condolences
1320639469326925826 2020-10-26 16:12:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> I've actually already written two shorts for it, and am ruminating on a third.  But I was wondering if anyone else would be eventually interested in trying their hands at a short for the Sourcebook? If interested, of course. There's plenty of characters and angles to explore.
1320639311277137920 2020-10-26 16:12:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> One of the myriad projects I want to do, and have been working on, is a Sourcebook for American Dreams. Think of it like the old DC Secret Files one shots. It has a ton of info on the characters and world, either through character sheets or various comic short stories.
1320520000046850048 2020-10-26 08:17:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CraigRozniecki he should have been fired
1320519245021794309 2020-10-26 08:14:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 awesome!
1320488748161839107 2020-10-26 06:13:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MiltonAguiarArt Just a certain person I noted being a nonstop grump
1320464691748102146 2020-10-26 04:38:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MiltonAguiarArt As I like to say, terrific art...terrible writing.
1320463897917349891 2020-10-26 04:35:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> Five days until I can apply to Fan Expo Boston.  And let's hope there's a vaccine or something done in time for the show to go on in August!
1320430623929098243 2020-10-26 02:22:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @NYPDnews Fire them! It's fascist BS by your officers going unpunished that is causing support and trust for the NYPD to plummet.
1320379030248579073 2020-10-25 22:57:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @theReheil_Deal yep
1320378367464488962 2020-10-25 22:55:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @theReheil_Deal definitely. DECADES of misuse and not being used with care...and mainly to prop up Wolverine.....
1320373953215516677 2020-10-25 22:37:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jhaasinterviews yeah, but the writers also did him a disservice.
1320373188241575938 2020-10-25 22:34:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jhaasinterviews well I said it was a FAN designed suit XD But yeah you have a point.  But it's also years of writers/artists having their pet characters (mainly Wolverine) and playing them up to Scott's detriment.
1320372455874174980 2020-10-25 22:31:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jhaasinterviews Possible.  But isn't Cyclops also a master martial artist? Why not play into that?  I once saw a fan designed suit where he could channel his power into his fists and feet as well.
1320369776196280321 2020-10-25 22:21:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @theReheil_Deal the movies, AND the comics. Mainly to play up Wolverine.
1320367478325841920 2020-10-25 22:11:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> Cyclops, with a good writer who finally shows what a badass he is.

1320359427816497152 2020-10-25 21:39:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> to be blunt, the GOP has been going down this dark road since Nixon. Gingrich made it go faster, the seditious GOP congress opposing Obama sped it up even more, and Trump is just the cancer metastasizing.
1320359405234327553 2020-10-25 21:39:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @nytimes to be blunt, the GOP has been going down this dark road since Nixon. Gingrich made it go faster, the seditious GOP congress opposing Obama sped it up even more, and Trump is just the cancer metastasizing.

1320356396014227458 2020-10-25 21:27:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> Another day, another day of a "fan" just being a freaking grouch about everything comics.  Does NOTHING bring them joy?
1320356065817538560 2020-10-25 21:26:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 yep!
1320349764370763782 2020-10-25 21:01:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> The GOP is a fascist death cult.  And that's the nicest way I can put it.

1320021238916501506 2020-10-24 23:16:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> When it comes to the Snyder Cut...I'm starting to find BOTH sides to be freaking annoying, for different reasons.
1320015174758268928 2020-10-24 22:51:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> Theoretically, I could do a Sherlock Holmes story set in Belle Epoche Paris, during the time he was considered dead, with a mystery at the Moulin Rouge.  But SHOULD I? I got a lot on my plate....
1320004558152663040 2020-10-24 22:09:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> I got some thoughts about what special things I'd want to do for an eventual American Dreams trade. But I want to see and hear what you think.  What kind of special things would you like in a crowdfunded trade of an indie comic?  #comics #indiecomics
1319834902251134978 2020-10-24 10:55:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC True. But still...I want that moment before its too late and I turn into Mama Rose! (Might want to look up that reference 😅)  But that might be me being anxious, neurotic, etc
1319833607859589120 2020-10-24 10:50:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC Yep. But some days I just want to scream "when is it MY turn!?"

1319822560457035780 2020-10-24 10:06:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> Unfortunately, given his recent high profile gig, people have gone digging in their crusades to continue the rite of perpetual anger...and so I might unfortunately be caught in the crossfire.  Just a heads up.
1319822215010000904 2020-10-24 10:05:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> So, some "woke" person (emphasis on quotes) has a screenshot from five years ago where I was in a discussion with a certain artist. I think their intent is to paint the latter as an antisemite, but in my experience said artist is not.

1319284882799906816 2020-10-22 22:30:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> As the Judiciary Committee violated their own rules to advance her, one could argue that even if she goes to the SCOTUS, their pet justice could be easily removed by Biden and a new Congress as illegitimate.
1319284576334721026 2020-10-22 22:28:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ABC In violation of rules and norms.  She is illegitimate!

1319280196717932547 2020-10-22 22:11:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> Does this mean....?
1319279780840099842 2020-10-22 22:09:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> Well, shit. That unqualified judge passed the committee.

1319224869683331073 2020-10-22 18:31:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> Woke up from a dream about the bad side to cons to feeling meh &amp; body aches (though the latter's from work, not necessarily a symptom). Meh.  BUT my ballot is officially at the Board of Elections and is considered valid; so it should probably be counted today.
1319222877837811713 2020-10-22 18:23:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass yeah it's something they put in place for the election

1318306377434091520 2020-10-20 05:41:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> I swear, media won't give DC any win, kudos, positivity etc.  When they have to (like when Joker won those awards), it was with gritted teeth and barely concealed resentment.
1318275626915319813 2020-10-20 03:39:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> I wouldn't call Sonic a superhero movie.  Do you know what IS? BIRDS OF PREY!  But it's DC, and we CAN'T let them have a win.... https://t.co/a2D2WObRd8

1318192907363491840 2020-10-19 22:10:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> Read the comments.  Goes to show how there is overlap b/t extreme "RTSC" people and Trumpster lunatics.

1317664373142441987 2020-10-18 11:10:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> Thinking of selling a large chunk of my comic collection. 50 cents to a dollar an issue.  Mainly to clear space AND get some extra cash.  Probably can't start selling until after COVID though.
1317655295619891205 2020-10-18 10:34:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> I was just reminded that one year ago today was Baltimore Comic Con.   I miss cons....

1316383708962795520 2020-10-14 22:21:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @dan_raga Depends?  I mean, I'd need my publisher to ship the books up (if I don't have the books in stock at home). Any extraneous supplies I'd have to ship myself.  It's the books that's the big issue. If I can get the hotel (or my family nearby) to hold onto them for me, that's good.
1316381111111606272 2020-10-14 22:11:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> Im debating whether if I should attempt C2E2 in 2022.  Partly because I don't want to have to haul all my supplies etc on a plane/train....

1316345990782373888 2020-10-14 19:51:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> McConnell's latest "relief bill" proposal is BS.  He should just bring forth the proposal from MAY that's been on his desk the whole time.

1315765859248476160 2020-10-13 05:26:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> Okay, it doesn't have the FEEL/LOOK of the books, but watching the clips? I think it has the SPIRIT of them.   https://t.co/so7BvetILB
1315764165860970496 2020-10-13 05:19:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @nytimes Arrest the California GOP!
1315763142450991104 2020-10-13 05:15:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 It just feels like I could be doing so much more with my comics career and I'm not :(
1315760749365649411 2020-10-13 05:06:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 and that probably includes helping myself too ^^;
1315760289971941378 2020-10-13 05:04:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 Then why do I feel like I haven't achieved enough :(
1315760122690441217 2020-10-13 05:03:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @sketchygothandz @mattyglesias exactly, they don't want to put in the work
1315760066327392256 2020-10-13 05:03:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @sketchygothandz @mattyglesias mhmm
1315759624893726723 2020-10-13 05:01:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KnowN0thing1 Because they're the flip side of Trumpsters.
1315759220772540417 2020-10-13 05:00:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> Oy, feeling a bout of imposter syndrome....
1315759057203089409 2020-10-13 04:59:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> Then the CA GOP are criminals.
1315758865460400131 2020-10-13 04:58:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kylegriffin1 Arrest the CA GOP.  ALL of them.
1315758598836944896 2020-10-13 04:57:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @sketchygothandz @mattyglesias yep
1315758111035199493 2020-10-13 04:55:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jpalmiotti nope
1315758061777227776 2020-10-13 04:55:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @sketchygothandz @mattyglesias Sanders failed to build a strong coalition, period
1315757798949613573 2020-10-13 04:54:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TonyDanielx2 oh wow!
1315757397688885250 2020-10-13 04:53:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @sketchygothandz @mattyglesias yep.  It's a five alarm fire; the situation is putting it out, not complaining about the damn paint job
1315757143690276870 2020-10-13 04:52:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @sketchygothandz @mattyglesias Hell, they slandered and attacked other candidates for not, and I quote, "bending the knee to Bernie."
1315756997787222023 2020-10-13 04:51:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @sketchygothandz @mattyglesias They'd rather be pure martyrs than actually compromising and getting work done.  They are unrepentant Trump enablers and should be penalized as such.
1315755737390501888 2020-10-13 04:46:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @fierymaliha @iamchanteezy @all_the_Mindy They ARE a cult and they ARE Trump supporters.
1315755534507704321 2020-10-13 04:45:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @sketchygothandz @mattyglesias Pretty much; Brie and her ilk are Trump enablers and they don't care.
1315754317396271107 2020-10-13 04:40:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @leftist_logical @DanteAtkins They don't understand and they refuse to inform themselves.  Bernie extremists are Trump supporters.
1315733235951955969 2020-10-13 03:17:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> Don't be complacent. Vote for Biden/Harris!
1315731131615019009 2020-10-13 03:08:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> About time!  Now ban the Nazis, white supremacists, GOP, etc that are still on the platform.
1315730490180218880 2020-10-13 03:06:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @EEscovar23 yep.  They just want any DC film not helmed by their false idol to fail.
1315728744686944268 2020-10-13 02:59:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TonyDanielx2 Oh wow!!
1315728516831469568 2020-10-13 02:58:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass yep
1315705102406164480 2020-10-13 01:25:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ejcandel Exactly!  I swear the purity progressives are Trump enablers and they don't care.
1315703899098148864 2020-10-13 01:20:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Badassassassin Cool!
1315689722199580675 2020-10-13 00:24:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> The GOP is a criminal organization.
1315686317565652993 2020-10-13 00:10:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone Disturbing.
1315686185013043212 2020-10-13 00:10:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KurtBelcher Same.  Don't get why the purity crowd is going for her throat today
1315674597216354312 2020-10-12 23:24:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> THIS!
1315661183454777344 2020-10-12 22:30:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JohnCornyn You're a hypocrite, as is ALL GOP.
1315658876285579264 2020-10-12 22:21:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter ooo
1315625240945451010 2020-10-12 20:07:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JacobsQuest yep
1315621433901543430 2020-10-12 19:52:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GlebMelnikov8 @SpaceKingBobby Cool!
1315620865929891840 2020-10-12 19:50:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers Yes, but remember, these fans throw fits when things don't go their way, so they immediately attack the writers etc.
1315619644707868672 2020-10-12 19:45:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> I can understand WHY they did that...but at the same time, it's a stupid thing to do as it gives more ammo to their political enemies.
1315449707263594499 2020-10-12 08:30:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos It's happened a lot already....Charleton Heston ain't exactly of the Tribe.  But they're attacking her because she's a "Zionist".  I mean...how dare Jews have self determination! /s
1315440363730018304 2020-10-12 07:53:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @biologicalriley Purity Progressives are Trump enablers and should be shunned/treated as such
1315439843795705857 2020-10-12 07:51:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> Oh look, this Cleopatra news has brought out all the antisemites.....
1315395499395100674 2020-10-12 04:55:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Yazan22532087 @DiscussingFilm Wow, you're unhinged
1315351963417153536 2020-10-12 02:02:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> Voter suppression and intimidation is all the Trump campaign has left.  Be prepared.
1315345289209950214 2020-10-12 01:35:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Eskivoart cool!
1315343203533553664 2020-10-12 01:27:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> We are blessed.
1315335270443749376 2020-10-12 00:55:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Cinnam0nT0astle Oh look, an antisemite.
1315334124022960132 2020-10-12 00:51:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @theanglo_files @JAMALIGLE I like my little tripleplex on Coney Island Ave XD Sure the floors are sticky, but its cheap etc :)
1315315107040129025 2020-10-11 23:35:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JAMALIGLE That's the one on Court St by the B&amp;N, no?
1315305425257062402 2020-10-11 22:57:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ColinHanks You should have watched the videotaped stage production that aired on PBS when I was a kid ^^;
1315305219694223360 2020-10-11 22:56:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @danboy "Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better", for starters
1315290957408071682 2020-10-11 21:59:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CullyHamner @Rschooley Well, yes, but I was referring to its physical appearance
1315290159894667264 2020-10-11 21:56:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KatarHol5 :D
1315290064772108291 2020-10-11 21:56:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Rschooley wtf is going on with his mouth?!
1315289718708469761 2020-10-11 21:54:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KatarHol5 with the exception of when they glow blue :)
1315289090519191552 2020-10-11 21:52:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams yep, and now we have the Internet making the trash takes worse and spread farther.
1315288855722053644 2020-10-11 21:51:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> I have to agree, somewhat, with Doc Shaner re: the Superman glowing red eyes when angry thing.  But if I may offer a compromise?  Close up of his blue eyes, which have red reflecting off/in? them? Same effect without making him look evil; just angry/disappointed with you.
1315287908165865472 2020-10-11 21:47:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams he is such a--GAH!
1315274763384827904 2020-10-11 20:55:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KatarHol5 yep
1315269938010107905 2020-10-11 20:36:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KatarHol5 I don't think that's his style. He just wants to shock and provoke.  Not to mention DC would NEVER allow that to happen.
1315268183578771456 2020-10-11 20:29:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KatarHol5 Point is, even if he's "joking"...it's a really nasty one.
1315267506077081600 2020-10-11 20:26:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KatarHol5 Umm...that's a legit quote. He's being an edgelord ahole.
1315267310354132992 2020-10-11 20:25:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> WTF!   https://t.co/zShd6WVF2i
1315266811840077824 2020-10-11 20:23:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MiltonAguiarArt oh definitely
1315266764574470144 2020-10-11 20:23:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KatarHol5 Umm...read what Millar said; it IS quite disgusting
1315264834200629248 2020-10-11 20:15:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MiltonAguiarArt Definitely. It's warring cults!

1315027146939785220 2020-10-11 04:31:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SergAcuna oh wow!
1315026549373054976 2020-10-11 04:28:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> THIS!!
1315025596997603329 2020-10-11 04:25:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Demonpuppy I just watched this today, maybe this helps?  https://t.co/munCbu4k8o  My publisher uses Greko-Wellspring, and they do a good job too.
1315024565026816000 2020-10-11 04:21:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> Thanks, Trump.....

1314962678784430082 2020-10-11 00:15:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @smbwalker64 @JoeBiden Trump is already a pathetic sore loser.

1314626502294753280 2020-10-10 01:59:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JeremyOkelley yep

1314621038177726464 2020-10-10 01:37:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DavidlBennettII Yep!  All these people rag on the CW shows for BS reasons
1314618368809406478 2020-10-10 01:26:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MrNiceGuy18_58 Agreed
1314618303717965824 2020-10-10 01:26:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> Yes because the guy who made several successful DC shows is SUCH a bad choice.....  ZS cultists are insane....

1314579032479076352 2020-10-09 22:50:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DanSlott It's a sung through musical with elements of opera/operetta but it is, by ANY professional standard, a MUSICAL!  You are correct!
1314578187003846657 2020-10-09 22:47:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> Well, fuck!  Thanks Trump!

1314576593487048705 2020-10-09 22:40:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> I wish many in the industry weren't embarrassed by superhero books.  I mean....it isn't Wertham's era any more.

1314399647578939392 2020-10-09 10:57:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AustinBurrowsX @JimLee cool
1314386184580280321 2020-10-09 10:04:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> Well, the ZS cult once again freaking proved they are the FREAKING WORST and prove why WB maybe shouldn't have catered to them.
1314347230338449409 2020-10-09 07:29:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kimota1977 well, it IS a cult
1314347156761907200 2020-10-09 07:29:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @PatrickZircher GOP are really horrid
1314346682319077378 2020-10-09 07:27:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @leekassen Wait, what happened?
1314346508049879042 2020-10-09 07:26:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MiltonAguiarArt I mean, theoretically ^^;
1314345937779785728 2020-10-09 07:24:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> read this too
1314345875561480192 2020-10-09 07:24:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> read this
1314345555347243009 2020-10-09 07:22:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MiltonAguiarArt no idea, maybe the high from being sanctimonious?
1314345351688708097 2020-10-09 07:22:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MiltonAguiarArt they just want to be upset
1314341552500748288 2020-10-09 07:07:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KatarHol5 @zryanverse Those people are nostalgic and want things to be how THEY want it.
1314340633390313473 2020-10-09 07:03:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KatarHol5 @zryanverse I'm fine with it
1314339839987380225 2020-10-09 07:00:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GlebMelnikov8 Yep. (And I say that as a person with some slabs, one of them being my own book lol)
1314339735998009346 2020-10-09 06:59:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> Yep (and I say that as a person with some slabs ^^; )
1314338448858382338 2020-10-09 06:54:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers who the heck thinks that?!
1314338164719353862 2020-10-09 06:53:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Demonpuppy yep!
1314338116640149508 2020-10-09 06:53:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> COOL!
1314333960437215233 2020-10-09 06:36:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Ozymandias0_1 True, but after discussing it with others, and my team, we might go with Kickstarter to be safe
1314332794336706561 2020-10-09 06:32:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Ozymandias0_1 Unfortunately, it's sorta tainted by dint of being the preferred crowdfunder of certain alt right comic book people
1314331888702685185 2020-10-09 06:28:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Ozymandias0_1 Indiegogo
1314290907752132613 2020-10-09 03:45:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Phantomskyler good point.
1314282008575696897 2020-10-09 03:10:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Johnbatusijack also true
1314275387577372683 2020-10-09 02:44:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Johnbatusijack Yeah, that's part of my concern
1314274028857839619 2020-10-09 02:38:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RepGregMurphy You're a slanderer.
1314273673289912322 2020-10-09 02:37:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass Yeah, that's why I'm nervous
1314272451526832135 2020-10-09 02:32:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HackinTimSeeley Aww, cute kitty!  Still needs to find its meow though
1314272163252367361 2020-10-09 02:31:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Eskivoart :D
1314272134080978944 2020-10-09 02:31:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> Coming soon!  We're having a LOT of fun making this book!  #comics #indiecomics #makingcomics
1314269796469538817 2020-10-09 02:21:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GailSimone Lots and LOTS of musicals and oldies of all kinds :)
1314259970834210816 2020-10-09 01:42:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeclusionStudio True, but some people like to rush to judgement :/
1314259353260654592 2020-10-09 01:40:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeclusionStudio that's not the exact problem.   IGG happens to be the preferred platform of a certain reactionary group in comics, hence my apprehension
1314257824877350912 2020-10-09 01:34:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheMakCave @Ian_Face yep
1314256850028724230 2020-10-09 01:30:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheMakCave @Ian_Face Yep.   I'm also nervous b/c IGG is the preferred platform of a certain reactionary group
1314255922739449856 2020-10-09 01:26:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheMakCave @Ian_Face yep  And you can make it in demand etc so it isn't a winner take all thing
1314252633947897861 2020-10-09 01:13:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheMakCave @Ian_Face  https://t.co/6fAPMNGN1l
1314252446068334592 2020-10-09 01:12:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheMakCave @Ian_Face I believe so?
1314250366557585409 2020-10-09 01:04:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Ian_Face It's a suggestion my artist made to raise the needed funds over time etc.  Yeah definitely something to discuss tonight
1314250166397030402 2020-10-09 01:03:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @NemesisFC2 IndieGoGo
1314249102352408576 2020-10-09 00:59:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> Considering the possibility of doing an IGG for one of my in development comic book projects. Question is, is that something I should do?   Thoughts? I just don't want to be tarred with a certain brush because I did an IGG.
1314244368195358722 2020-10-09 00:40:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @chrisarrant Not yet.  I do feel like I have gotten some steps closer though, even if it's just getting my comics done and doing cons (pre COVID).
1314244244467601410 2020-10-09 00:40:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> Not yet.  I do feel like I have gotten some steps closer though, even if it's just getting my comics done and doing cons.

1314214220196532225 2020-10-08 22:41:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass @Ssnyder1835 yep.  I mean, as much as I love the elaborate cosplays, I think sometimes practicality might end up being better ^^; Especially if your elaborate costume makes it hard for you to see, move, etc.
1314213923889926147 2020-10-08 22:39:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @pittsed_off @Ssnyder1835 I mean, just getting inside must've been a challenge unto itself
1314213779412934663 2020-10-08 22:39:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter I agree with all but the too much Batman :)  But I'd argue that Batman comics needs to embrace the family more and stop kicking them to the curb for "drama".
1314213498398732288 2020-10-08 22:38:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Ssnyder1835 How did they manage to get around the convention in that?!
1314211212033355785 2020-10-08 22:29:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @marcorubio You are a liar
1314209090902519816 2020-10-08 22:20:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> Part of me is missing running around the Javits Center (esp. Artist Alley) for NYCC.  Part of me, knowing how much stuff I take to be signed along with how much more stuff I bring home, is relieved it's all online this year.  #NYCC2020 #NYCCMetaverse
1314207704739528712 2020-10-08 22:15:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ShaneMBailey oh wow!

1314200009412313088 2020-10-08 21:44:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass yep
1314199919146741761 2020-10-08 21:44:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @nytimes Trump is a coward
1314199880798294016 2020-10-08 21:44:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> Trump is a coward.  I say make it another Biden Town Hall.
1314178974612942848 2020-10-08 20:20:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> FB just reminded me that four years ago, at my first NYCC, I met Stan.  https://t.co/zT5yMB6dqQ
1314164560702701570 2020-10-08 19:23:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> Fans need to stop being such jaded freaking schmucks and throw fits over things going THEIR way and calling it bad just because THEY don't like it.

1313589277729665024 2020-10-07 05:17:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @PvtRomanticFart @ScarletWitch713 It's basically US Anglican IIRC?
1313588079605805056 2020-10-07 05:12:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @PvtRomanticFart @ScarletWitch713 yes, through the maternal line, he is considered Jewish under traditional Jewish line.  I thought he was more Episcopal?
1313586090650021890 2020-10-07 05:05:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> Comic fans need a freaking chill pill!
1313586020710068226 2020-10-07 05:04:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jessnevins @MWDanvers yep
1313585576709324800 2020-10-07 05:03:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @sapphicgeek @MWDanvers I definitely agree with that last sentence. It's like people are going out of their way to find something to be nasty about.
1313585343803858945 2020-10-07 05:02:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CarolineWazer @ObscureAaron It is very Caligula-ish of him, ain't it
1313583316478709760 2020-10-07 04:54:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @danthemcmahon Hopefully comes back as Robin with a writer that won't treat him like a punching bag
1313583232416448512 2020-10-07 04:53:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JAMALIGLE yep

1313578859485421569 2020-10-07 04:36:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @rpace Conan, by Crom!
1313578281799757829 2020-10-07 04:34:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> Batman is technically Jewish, per his mother's side of the family, and DC should stop being cowards and embrace that fact
1313577951452188673 2020-10-07 04:32:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> Batman needs to stop pushing away his family, especially for the reasons of "drama".  Embrace the family!
1313577819088224256 2020-10-07 04:32:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JAMALIGLE yep!
1313577785542279169 2020-10-07 04:32:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> This is true
1313572522806444038 2020-10-07 04:11:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 yes, but a lot of hate boiled down to "It's not what *I* want, ergo it's bad".  A mentality that has unfortunately stuck around
1313570314819899392 2020-10-07 04:02:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DarthSCK :P
1313569272925499402 2020-10-07 03:58:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> The N52 was actually good; people just kept bashing it because they didn't want to give it a fair shake
1313546201250312192 2020-10-07 02:26:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> Pet peeve: people blasting their music in their cars, with the windows down, so that the whole neighborhood can hear and the houses shake!  No one wants to hear your EDM, Kevin!!!
1313519765005234176 2020-10-07 00:41:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Cool!

1313501530960650241 2020-10-06 23:29:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TomKingTK @jfornes74 Cool!  And a timely quote.
1313484326600945666 2020-10-06 22:20:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Inquisitive_Elf Awesome! Enjoy!
1313464916473503752 2020-10-06 21:03:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Phantomskyler no idea. I see him pop up every now and then or referenced to.
1313457039973257217 2020-10-06 20:32:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Johnbatusijack @Terrificly_here MAG or JDG? XD  MAG kinda rage quit one group I was in (and kicked me out of groups he ran) when I and others called him out for his bigotry
1313309967886229505 2020-10-06 10:47:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SodaTelepaths Yeah, he is not a pleasant person
1313307841290285057 2020-10-06 10:39:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Johnbatusijack @Terrificly_here Pre MAG actually lol
1313305826308784128 2020-10-06 10:31:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SodaTelepaths James Dean Grimes.  IIRC. I haven't really given him much thought since I blocked him and FB groups we were both in kicked him.
1313304791054012418 2020-10-06 10:27:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Terrificly_here Well in this case, the schmuck was a right wing FB bully who just wanted to keep going at me before 1. I blocked him and 2. he was kicked out of SEVERAL FB groups that got tired of his BS
1313304316057448449 2020-10-06 10:25:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> So, The Batman will be an early Birthday treat for me...for my 33rd birthday.....
1313303736689848321 2020-10-06 10:23:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> Read an old piece of "hate mail" from someone gloating that I'll never have a comic published.  Well, who is laughing now? 😈
1313263847671652354 2020-10-06 07:44:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpideyGeek17 @BrooklynBatman_ fair

1313222113873063943 2020-10-06 04:58:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard @MakeMineAmalgam yep. As I said, the scene could have been better written
1313220601759305729 2020-10-06 04:52:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard @MakeMineAmalgam *snicker snort*  Look, I enjoy BvS etc....but even I can admit the writing could be better, etc.  (Plus I'm at the point where I want the ZS cult and their opposite numbers to both be quiet XD)
1313217622327033856 2020-10-06 04:40:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass ?

1313184265929216000 2020-10-06 02:28:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JoeyVazquezart @tomeu_morey Cool!
1313183938605703169 2020-10-06 02:27:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass Harper showed up, briefly, in the Anarky arc of Tynion's 'Tec run
1313178514623995905 2020-10-06 02:05:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> GOOD
1313175827836792835 2020-10-06 01:54:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> Don't I know that feeling.  I didn't even find a job (PART TIME) until my mid 20s
1313150620484984832 2020-10-06 00:14:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> Remember, just because a comic book company isn't featuring your preferred characters in a book (especially when they are and you choose to be uninformed), it doesn't mean they're incompetent or that they hate the characters.
1313147541928673282 2020-10-06 00:02:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @bywordofmaus @DCComics True, the current TT run wasn't as LGBT friendly as the pre Rebirth one. (I think Crush was the only one?)  In that case, when they do the eventual relaunch next year, I hope they correct that.
1313145962706198531 2020-10-05 23:56:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @bywordofmaus @DCComics Nor does it mean they hate the characters or are homophobes.  It means Bunker doesn't fit into a book at this point.  And you admitted to being ignorant of Aqualad's continual presence in Aquaman.
1313143972156641284 2020-10-05 23:48:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Clay_Mann_ Cool!
1313143453597999104 2020-10-05 23:46:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @bywordofmaus @DCComics And yet that does not mean it's intentional etc.
1313142228970336258 2020-10-05 23:41:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @bywordofmaus @DCComics Fair, but my point is he DID show up in more books.  As did Jackson.  You can't just assume.
1313140451604561923 2020-10-05 23:34:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @bywordofmaus @DCComics There were significantly more appearances by Bunker in that series.
1313139336058085377 2020-10-05 23:29:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @bywordofmaus @DCComics Well, it shows your claim is wrong, isn't it. There was recently an arc focusing on him too.  Plus Bunker showed up fairly recently in Red Hood.
1313138456080658439 2020-10-05 23:26:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @bywordofmaus @DCComics He's been in Aquaman (with a different haircut)
1313137335794577411 2020-10-05 23:21:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrooklynBatman_ or maybe both sides could stop being toxic...that would be a nice change.

1313127812065263617 2020-10-05 22:44:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Phantomskyler Yeah, I need a project where *I* am paid!
1313126574804303872 2020-10-05 22:39:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> Oh look...CG is attacking a certain editor. Again. And lying about the tattoo she's getting.  There is literally no low to which they will stoop.
1313126121643347970 2020-10-05 22:37:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> ...I still need to finish Witcher Season 1......

1313111966194561026 2020-10-05 21:41:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @tomtificate yep.
1313110439363055618 2020-10-05 21:34:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @tomtificate purity progressives are so blinded by their own cloud of smug that they don't care they've become the enemy of good.

1313099432892813312 2020-10-05 20:51:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> In all seriousness, I really am looking for more writing gigs. Just to have some more pocket change.
1312933664905408514 2020-10-05 09:52:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> Anyone have a comic book project that they need a writer for? ^^;
1312907914416394240 2020-10-05 08:10:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> hmm...I think I need to take on more work for hire ^^;

1312835590992388101 2020-10-05 03:22:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> A year ago, I was running around NYCC.  Today, it's been a quiet day of errands, gaming, and napping.  Disregarding the COVID, I dunno which is preferable ^^; Sometimes a quiet day is better than a raucous con.

1312789062177247234 2020-10-05 00:17:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ChrisShehanArt Exactly
1312784429115473920 2020-10-04 23:59:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ChrisShehanArt yep. Which I did enjoy ^^;
1312782898416758784 2020-10-04 23:53:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ChrisShehanArt People just want excuses to dump on the films for not meshing with the fan fic they wrote when they were 12.
1312781248306319362 2020-10-04 23:46:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HeatherAntos Hi, I'm Daniel.

1312731462198845441 2020-10-04 20:29:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> The White House is releasing obviously staged photos of Trump.  After the horrible press conference by his doctors yesterday, I'm assuming he's in rough shape and they're trying to hide it.  How like North Korea.....
1312563662851395586 2020-10-04 09:22:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JimZub @matthewmercer @SupergiantGames it's so fun
1312548249421713414 2020-10-04 08:21:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBlaquesmith Possibly, mainly because the larger the page count, the higher print cost.
1312542768347189249 2020-10-04 07:59:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> Just posted a photo  https://t.co/P8ZHoM4u9G

1312536884715773952 2020-10-04 07:35:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> I think I ate my feelings tonight ^^;  4 slices of pizza....I will likely pay for it in the morning.
1312524320460042240 2020-10-04 06:45:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman oh then I'm definitely writing every day, if only thinking/brainstorming :)
1312523386996748289 2020-10-04 06:42:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman And then I feel guilty because I'm not writing every day

1312521699812757504 2020-10-04 06:35:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman that helps lol. In my case, I dunno if I can afford one atm to look over random scripts ^^;
1312521370341842946 2020-10-04 06:34:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Demonpuppy hmm...should I brainstorm something? 😈
1312520905176670209 2020-10-04 06:32:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman Fair, lol.  But it would be nice to know what I could have approved on etc...

1312520567673610241 2020-10-04 06:31:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @abrahamjoseph Trump hasn't relinquished any power so it's still him.  VP Pence is quarantined, and Speaker Pelosi has been briefed on continuance.

1312075159252148225 2020-10-03 01:01:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Phantomskyler supposedly if spelled in full on FB, it hides the post

Which historical figures, who haven't appeared yet in the book, would you like to see appear in the series, even for a brief cameo?  Secondly, what kind of rewards would you like to see in future AD K*ckst*ters?

1311257563145670657 2020-09-30 18:52:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> Trump couldn't even CONDEMN white supremacists at the debate.  Instead, he told them to await his orders.  He is truly a second Hitler.

1311056066382311424 2020-09-30 05:31:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos yeah I mean...if true, it's probably ALREADY in the script and it's a question of WB wanting them for brief cameos instead of resorting to manipulating footage or have stand ins and sound alikes.
1311055269439430657 2020-09-30 05:28:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos I mean, even if they're in the film, it could be all of three seconds with stock footage
1311053755069140993 2020-09-30 05:22:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos There's an article that supposedly says Kilmer, Clooney, and Bale will cameo in the FLash film. Without proof, of course.  But everyone is assuming the worse.
1311051617312157698 2020-09-30 05:13:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos I just find it interesting that people immediately assume the worse about anything DC does instead of seeing if it is true or not

1311004443337469952 2020-09-30 02:06:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jhaasinterviews Oh I've made that observation already
1311003021321670657 2020-09-30 02:00:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> You know that article about the Flash movie getting more Batman actors is BS, right? And its sole purpose is to make you angry and bash DC while they get $ from clicks, right?
1311001903506092032 2020-09-30 01:56:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman Ah got ya.  Because I saw some people reacting to an obviously BS article....
1311001185059569664 2020-09-30 01:53:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RobinCook Fan of John Waters?
1311000929341190145 2020-09-30 01:52:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman I don't think that's actually happening.  But it's a good article to stir up anti DC sentiment.
1310999574677540864 2020-09-30 01:47:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip Yes, THAT is fair.  But far too many people go "I don't like this, ergo it MUST be bad, and now I must go through all his past work and rip it a new one to show what a bad writer he is!"
1310998490751827969 2020-09-30 01:42:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> Do you realize how offensive and anti-Semitic you are being?  Of course you don't.....
1310997709449572352 2020-09-30 01:39:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip That's somewhat more sane than the kvetching, et al, that I've seen today which boils down to "I don't like it, so it MUST be bad, and therefore ALL his past work must be bad!"
1310996146802888705 2020-09-30 01:33:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @harmdoer Do you realize how MASSIVELY offensive you are being?!
1310995382852354048 2020-09-30 01:30:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> So basically people are being revisionist and attacking GJ's past work for BS reasons because they either don't like his most recent work (again, acting like their personal views are fact) OR they're part of the ZS cult and they're going after him b/c he's on their enemies list?
1310994714829762566 2020-09-30 01:27:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JeremySimser This isn't actually happen; yet you fall for it.....
1310979376067022849 2020-09-30 00:26:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Peposed @THR @AfterShockComix @lucacasalanguid @socialmyth Definitely sounds like it! :D
1310977404995862528 2020-09-30 00:19:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ChrystalWRox yep
1310976465597542403 2020-09-30 00:15:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ChrystalWRox because that kind of "progressive" must ALWAYS be right, no matter what.  They're the flip side of the Trump coin, basically.
1310975608780881920 2020-09-30 00:11:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ChrystalWRox Thanks.  And yeah, it definitely sucks when our supposed allies turn their backs on us for BS reasons
1310975418976083969 2020-09-30 00:11:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MiltonAguiarArt thanks!
1310974637040373760 2020-09-30 00:08:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ChrystalWRox Yeah, that's gotta be annoying.  I mean, I KNOW it's annoying (we Jews get shat on by both sides for BS reasons); but it stings the most when it comes from supposed allies.
1310973953817677827 2020-09-30 00:05:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ChrystalWRox Based on my personal experience, red rose Twitter/purity progressives tend to be just as bigoted and closed minded as the Trumpsters.....
1310973338655825921 2020-09-30 00:02:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> And of COURSE I come up with a new idea for a miniseries!   And a non superhero one at that!  Just dunno when I'll have the time or $$ for it.
1310964131974053896 2020-09-29 23:26:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @lilsarg Should be a life sentence, IMO. His being a Nazi should make it an AUTOMATIC life sentence.
1310963235147919361 2020-09-29 23:22:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Peposed @THR @AfterShockComix @lucacasalanguid @socialmyth cool!
1310955773745397762 2020-09-29 22:53:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> At this point, I don't think I won the @MadCaveStudios talent search.  Ah well, always next year!  Grats to the winners, whoever you are!
1310955173909495810 2020-09-29 22:50:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC @jarredlujan I went to college in Buffalo...I DON'T miss that arctic lake effect everything! XD  And that was during a WARM period.
1310954320209338372 2020-09-29 22:47:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HiltonCollins @BrooklynBatman_ yep
1310950221728358404 2020-09-29 22:31:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> So glad I'll be playing DC RPG instead of watching the debates tonight ^^;

1310940649324187655 2020-09-29 21:53:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ShaneMBailey Probably one of my all time fave comics:  https://t.co/BmLK5ugzk5
1310938678466940929 2020-09-29 21:45:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> Can we PLEASE rid fandom of cynical jaded fans who just go out of their way to kvetch and throw tantrums when things aren't how THEY want it?
1310938128350314496 2020-09-29 21:43:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> I got SIX weeks of pull list I need to start getting through!  HELP!!!  https://t.co/YDvM3aIwMC

1310742078515752962 2020-09-29 08:43:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 @ArtOfTimBrown XD
1310741519318409216 2020-09-29 08:41:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 @ArtOfTimBrown But I already started the Atlas Studios thingie XD
1310740754122366977 2020-09-29 08:38:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 @ArtOfTimBrown yep, gotta put in the work first ^^:
1310739365413490690 2020-09-29 08:33:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 @ArtOfTimBrown Yep.   Though there is some debate whether how much of it was like that after a certain point. But yeah, it would be fun to have a central location just to collab
1310739209792237571 2020-09-29 08:32:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ArtOfTimBrown @Kheme51  https://t.co/VIWH3IjNzN
1310739115634167808 2020-09-29 08:32:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 @ArtOfTimBrown :D  Cool! The penciller thought of it! He's working on a logo
1310737975484076038 2020-09-29 08:27:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 @ArtOfTimBrown Well I recently started an informal one with an artist and an inker that we're tentatively calling Atlas Studios.
1310737717941219328 2020-09-29 08:26:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ArtOfTimBrown @Kheme51 Not with my bad motor skills!
1310736044782911488 2020-09-29 08:20:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ArtOfTimBrown @Kheme51 YEAH! Sleeping's for us writers! :P  (Why do you think I'm incommunicado after 10 or 11 at night?)
1310734269862604801 2020-09-29 08:12:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ArtOfTimBrown @Kheme51 DO IT!!
1310732606523269120 2020-09-29 08:06:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 Well, in a pinch, you could move to Quebec, where French is used almost as much as English ^^;  But overall, it takes practice.
1310729810394648578 2020-09-29 07:55:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ComicBookYeti My laptop...which makes sense ;)
1310729558052790272 2020-09-29 07:54:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 (meaning people who grew up with English SUPPOSEDLY as their first language, not that they are Native Americans)
1310729404167880704 2020-09-29 07:53:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 Hey, it's better than some native English speakers here in the US XD
1310715734956408833 2020-09-29 06:59:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> Yom Kippur is over!  Feast, fellow Jews, feast!

1310584439534243840 2020-09-28 22:17:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @theanglo_files @JosephGlass I mean, my pull list is MAINLY DC ^^;  But yes, N52/DC You was full of glorious experimentation...which DC seems to be afraid to do now.

1310549116435521536 2020-09-28 19:57:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ShaneMBailey Yep.  One of my personal pet peeves is when people skip cutscenes and then have no idea where to go. And I'm like "You would have known if you WATCHED THE CUT SCENE!"
1310548673294721025 2020-09-28 19:55:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @wes_greer I just read issue 1...what is the problem now?
1310548081713315840 2020-09-28 19:53:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheMakCave yeah I've been noticing it too.  WTF is going on at WB's sound mixing department?

1310547433416527872 2020-09-28 19:50:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass Yeah, you'd think Quentin Quire would be saying something.....
1310400358217322496 2020-09-28 10:06:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> Off to bed.  To my fellow Jews, have an easy fast.  To my non Jewish friends, apologies in advance if I'm curt/cranky tomorrow.
1310398168081797122 2020-09-28 09:57:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> One of the best films I have ever seen!  Also, F. Murray Abraham lived a few apartment buildings down from me when I was a little kid. My dad once saw him walking two massive poodles down Eastern Parkway.

1310352485794619395 2020-09-28 06:55:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 Well I wasn't expecting the Times to obtain his tax returns.  It's a Yom Kippur miracle!
1310343139333468160 2020-09-28 06:18:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> Oh, look, Trump is a tax cheat and a FRAUD!   #TrumpTaxReturns
1310342481100320775 2020-09-28 06:16:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> It is Erev Yom Kippur, which means its Kol Nidre night.  This is a solemn night for Jews.  Here it is sung by Al Jolson, as part of the climax of The Jazz Singer, where the titular character sings the Kol Nidre in the place of his ailing father   https://t.co/sLUsOPiOFi
1310330642744446976 2020-09-28 05:29:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> Trump isn't even gonna show up at the debate on Tuesday :P  He's too much of a chickenshit coward.
1310322703384092673 2020-09-28 04:57:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> Theatrical Cut of JL isn't as bad as people (esp. the ZS cult) make it out to be. It's actually enjoyable.

1310280032732971008 2020-09-28 02:07:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 Probably not, because too many toxic fans will complain
1310279556981456896 2020-09-28 02:06:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Cheekierbobcat yep
1310276409974304769 2020-09-28 01:53:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Cheekierbobcat yes, but they don't get that nuance
1310253091325915139 2020-09-28 00:20:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @theanglo_files DM me?
1310251071856549889 2020-09-28 00:12:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DerekLChase yep.  A LOT of criticism of Israel quickly turns into antisemitism.
1310247696159125506 2020-09-27 23:59:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @theanglo_files oooo? Who?
1310247490705330180 2020-09-27 23:58:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> Nothing more aggravating than a fellow Jew trying to say Israel doesn't have a right to exist and that Jews don't have a right to self determination.  Surprised they weren't spouting the Khazar BS.
1310246666851803140 2020-09-27 23:55:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @p4wst @LACityOfStars Yep, you hate your own people.  Blocking you now.
1310241140373958657 2020-09-27 23:33:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @p4wst @LACityOfStars Doesn't always work like that.  And again, you're being extremist AND defamatory when Israel was defending itself.  But then again, ANY nuance can't be discussed. Israel must ALWAYS be bashed....
1310238145284313090 2020-09-27 23:21:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> @p4wst @LACityOfStars And?  You're defaming her for doing MANDATORY military service, a service she does not wish her daughters to do.  Not to mention implying she killed kids is also defamatory.
1310233744129830913 2020-09-27 23:04:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams One of my fave novels! I actually have my copy (TECHNICALLY my dad's) signed by Chabon!
1310229635817451520 2020-09-27 22:47:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @NYCSpeakerCoJo @katerone Cut the NYPD funding!
1310228095669080065 2020-09-27 22:41:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @realDonaldTrump You're the one who should be drug tested.  Resign!
1310227730429026304 2020-09-27 22:40:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @p4wst @LACityOfStars Oh look, an antisemite.....
1310196396755124224 2020-09-27 20:35:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @theanglo_files @MarkBrooksArt Definitely feels like it.....
1310195806436241409 2020-09-27 20:33:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @theanglo_files @MarkBrooksArt Yep. Look at their handles with their "Associate Producer" "titles".....
1310194908934832130 2020-09-27 20:29:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KateHarding Yep.  Red Rose Twitter/Purity Progressives/Et Al are SEXIST!  Also, racist given their attacks on the African American voters who went for Biden.....
1310194885375520769 2020-09-27 20:29:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> Yep.  Red Rose Twitter/Purity Progressives/Et Al are SEXIST!  Also, racist given their attacks on the African American voters who went for Biden.....
1310188162908651520 2020-09-27 20:02:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MarkBrooksArt As I keep saying, his fans are a CULT! And they're turning off even sympathetic people from watching his version because of their behavior.
1310186516388417536 2020-09-27 19:56:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> The JL movie we got is fine (keyword: FINE) and the ZS Cult won't accept that fact because they're a bunch of extremists that are turning off even sympathetic people from watching the ZS Cut due to their behavior.
1310185418697183232 2020-09-27 19:52:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeanIzaakse Isn't Endless Winter an event in the mainline books though?
1310185261268119553 2020-09-27 19:51:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan Who the hell is doing that?! 😡  Seriously, some people are just aholes
1310184882426048514 2020-09-27 19:49:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> The NYPD just went out and beat up RANDOM PEDESTRIANS last night?! WTF!  And they wonder why most NYCers do NOT trust them anymore.....
1310184530557521922 2020-09-27 19:48:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> I posted this VERY late last night, so here it is again! :D  An AWESOME review from Todd Dave and Co about American Dreams issues 1-3! Give it a listen!   https://t.co/sGmMEkEmU8  #comics #indiecomics #makingcomics #comicreview

1310048723406385152 2020-09-27 10:48:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> Watched the 1931 German film version (with subtitles) of The Threepenny Opera tonight.  Haven't seen it since my senior year of high school.
1310009118200127489 2020-09-27 08:11:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Demonpuppy Speaking as a progressive person who is a member of a religious and ethnic minority; I am SO FREAKING FED UP with the "Christian" right trying to shove their religious beliefs down our throats.
1309993507344592904 2020-09-27 07:09:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @dano_cosmic He is such a schmuck

1309988040752889858 2020-09-27 06:47:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Robwilliams71 Cool!  Is that the Plaza Hotel in the background?
1309985861908475910 2020-09-27 06:39:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> *looks at trending list*  ...What insane conspiracy drivel is the right wing up to now with their attacks on YouTube?
1309985343932895233 2020-09-27 06:36:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> Might have been younger when I did my 1.5 issues worth of webcomic though
1309984732428591104 2020-09-27 06:34:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @VKMarion @DCComics @ComicModern NP!

1309973706249207813 2020-09-27 05:50:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> Maybe the cops should stop enabling these right wing terrorists and actually do their job and arrest said terrorists!
1309973690117959686 2020-09-27 05:50:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @nytimes Maybe the cops should stop enabling these right wing terrorists and actually do their job and arrest said terrorists!

1309972764015628289 2020-09-27 05:46:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> read this thread!
1309971160046723073 2020-09-27 05:40:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @NakatomiTim Yeah, and they STILL won't admit what they have done
1309917298317295616 2020-09-27 02:06:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @thehill Why call Pelosi out? She's RIGHT! Trump supporters are henchmen, thugs, and terrorists.
1309916885283151872 2020-09-27 02:04:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @LeftyGimpclaw @JerryOrdway Oh that is awesome!!

1309911429919711233 2020-09-27 01:43:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @GlebMelnikov8 Each has their pluses and minuses.  But Jim is a gentleman and a nice guy while Byrne is...not.
1309909806287859718 2020-09-27 01:36:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard Thanks! :D
1309906611285229569 2020-09-27 01:24:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard I won't lie, I'm nervous about the talent hunt winners reveal ^^;
1309906355973652481 2020-09-27 01:23:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JAMALIGLE Should we have someone do a mental health check on him?
1309905005617582082 2020-09-27 01:17:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeanIzaakse @thejasonmasters @LuversanGerard  https://t.co/LkuzduSQcD
1309904661101662214 2020-09-27 01:16:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> I was 29 when I finally published my first comic. (Or 28, depending on your definition of published, etc)  Still a relatively late bloomer AND I still am in many respects.
1309903547102830593 2020-09-27 01:11:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RyanHigginsRyan Some people just don't seem to get what worked 30-40 years ago won't work now.  Things have changed!
1309890791087669249 2020-09-27 00:21:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Joe_Kach yep
1309874448162578432 2020-09-26 23:16:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> Thanks, Jill Stein.  You and your purity voters set back women's rights and body autonomy DECADES.
1309868765304295430 2020-09-26 22:53:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> Explore Bruce Wayne/Batman's Jewish ancestry more, you cowards!!!
1309859548862255107 2020-09-26 22:17:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos Speaking as one? TELL ME ABOUT IT!  I mean, I must be "Reform" compared to these fanatics.
1309858889077317633 2020-09-26 22:14:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos Yes, but again, I'm being snarky towards the crazy people ;)
1309858588609912833 2020-09-26 22:13:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @LennyBernstein I saw the film first as a kid, projected on a MASSIVE screen at the Prospect Park Bandshell
1309856607795376128 2020-09-26 22:05:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> @wolfblitzer @washingtonpost @nytimes yes
1309856045335031808 2020-09-26 22:03:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos that's fair; but this is more of a rebuke towards the "DISNEY DESTROYED MY CHILDHOOD" thing
1309855425748238336 2020-09-26 22:00:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Joe_Kach The alt right douches may be sad and pathetic; but they ARE a threat to others. And the COPS are protecting them!
1309852225817239554 2020-09-26 21:48:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> The sequel trilogy is fine; you're just upset because it wasn't your personal fanfic
1309844109151019008 2020-09-26 21:15:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> thread
1309843364452470785 2020-09-26 21:12:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AndrewClemson @BrenttHarshman got ya.  Par for the course for Byrne though, no? I mean, he has a rep for being a bigot.
1309842110242320386 2020-09-26 21:07:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman What did he do now?
1309841144713564166 2020-09-26 21:03:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Glad to hear you're feeling better!

1309840656555290626 2020-09-26 21:02:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KurtBelcher that I've seen?  Theatre Of Blood (one of his personal faves apparently)
1309674918183870467 2020-09-26 10:03:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kimota1977 @JosephGlass yikes, again!
1309637837248180225 2020-09-26 07:36:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kimota1977 @JosephGlass yikes! Which one?
1309636824281874440 2020-09-26 07:32:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JustSayXtian They just assume Israel=Bad, without doing a bit of research or having any nuance.
1309635680054792192 2020-09-26 07:27:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MWDanvers He's such an unprofessional jerk.

1309601822970130433 2020-09-26 05:13:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @declanshalvey Oh cool!

1309595993143480322 2020-09-26 04:49:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DougaWood1 yep!!
1309590427306205184 2020-09-26 04:27:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> In case you missed this!

1309563185633153024 2020-09-26 02:39:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kimota1977 Awesome! Enjoy!

1309547115169935360 2020-09-26 01:35:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @VoteMarsha Well, aren't you an antisemite and a liar.
1309546999591718916 2020-09-26 01:35:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> This #NationalComicBookDay , I'm so glad I get to work in this medium, this industry, and seeing people enjoy whatever spark of madness comes out of my brain!  Read comics! Get lost in whole new worlds!  https://t.co/hqfLTtV3KX
1309546022083928067 2020-09-26 01:31:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RyanHigginsRyan Wow...they are SO wrong.  WB controls the purse strings when it comes to films. AT&amp;T is just the parent company.  ZS zealots are unhinged
1309545710782746625 2020-09-26 01:30:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jpalmiotti That was me this morning
1309545612933816323 2020-09-26 01:29:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @AtomicBuchner @KrsJams Also true.  Midtown seems to be a lot more on the ball in appealing to a broader clientele than many comic shops
1309544784630030338 2020-09-26 01:26:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams Agreed
1309544649892265987 2020-09-26 01:25:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KrsJams I've seen plenty of kids at Midtown Comics though
1309544329619402757 2020-09-26 01:24:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @vascogeorgiev Torn b/t Red Hood/Winter Soldier and DD/Batman
1309544101067608064 2020-09-26 01:23:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kimota1977 Incredibly nervous XD  I haven't been in Manhattan since March 19th!
1309541059760975873 2020-09-26 01:11:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kimota1977 Well, I'm remote most of the week, they just want me in one day a week to help keep things organized etc. It's not like my usual main task of running all over NYC dropping off documents is happening
1309538000985042946 2020-09-26 00:59:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> So, I'll be going back to the office one day a week starting next week.
1309534784121704454 2020-09-26 00:46:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheMakCave Yes and yes ;)  More details soon
1309534714752045062 2020-09-26 00:46:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheMakCave Can't wait to hear what you think of them!
1309487038744461313 2020-09-25 21:36:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MiltonAguiarArt Well yes, I was directing that more at those who ARE toxic ;)
1309484547185180674 2020-09-25 21:26:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos That's a fair reaction.
1309484010461171712 2020-09-25 21:24:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos yeah, but doesn't exactly disprove my point.  There are people who are LITERALLY saying WB should have put that $ to COVID research....  I'm starting to hate the toxicity on both sides, including when I go overboard.
1309482942197043200 2020-09-25 21:20:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos Yes, but remember a good chunk of that 70 mill is going VFX artists, etc.  Plus people are acting WB should be funding COVID vaccines.  There IS a grey area here. Im just starting to get freaking tired.....
1309482101385854978 2020-09-25 21:17:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> To be FAIR, the freakout over the reshoots budget is also BS.  (Seriously, both sides need a SERIOUS chill pill, and I include myself in that regard)
1309481084523106305 2020-09-25 21:13:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HamillHimself Happy Birthday!
1309479508416880640 2020-09-25 21:06:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> ZS Fans need a GOOD long look in the mirror as to why many people, especially comics pros, are being hard on the ZS Cut  Hint: They're fed up with your toxic behavior and constant harassment over a difference of opinion.
1309478221809954817 2020-09-25 21:01:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard @TheComicBurrito It might be easier to do it as a parody of "People" from Funny Girl  https://t.co/go3Gkd1HiT

And then they claim the writers/publisher are killing the character, etc.  No, it's just not how YOU like it. Stop the tantrums!
1308747989922578432 2020-09-23 20:40:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> Why do ZS fans always bring up that last bit as if it excuses their bad behavior?!
1308746072941101056 2020-09-23 20:32:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan I remember reading in a mystery by Agatha Christie that an evil person will have a peaceful slumber and a good person will toss and turn.  I doubt Trump is tossing and turning. The man probably sleeps still with an evil grin across his face. He doesn't care about COVID victims.
1308745523457908737 2020-09-23 20:30:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @schiekapedia Cool!

1308540018047188992 2020-09-23 06:53:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KatarHol5 yep.  Someone's going "We know they HATE Kara because they canceled her on her fictional birthday!"  I don't think CW is even AWARE of that.  Plus its ending because the star wants to raise a family.
1308538137103208451 2020-09-23 06:46:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheLastGorgon I actually enjoyed Evolution more as a kid than I did the 90s show.
1308537707254157313 2020-09-23 06:44:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> Seriously...some "fans" look for ill intent when a show is canceled when there is actually none....
1308532161818099712 2020-09-23 06:22:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CianTormey Yep!  I love it when artists really go that extra mile of research!  I mean, if it was your hometown, and something portrayed in it wasn't accurate at all, it throws you a little.   (As much as I love Spider-Man 2, the elevated train sequence throws me off somewhat, for example)
1308531337045962752 2020-09-23 06:19:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Therealmanos Awesome!!  What did you think of issue 3?

1308407528494174210 2020-09-22 22:07:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JennyNichole4 well its my fault for forgetting there was no longer a chair where I was trying to sit XD
1308405860075532288 2020-09-22 22:00:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JennyNichole4 Well I'm resting.  But my lower back to my tailbone hurts and I got occasional radiating pains in my lower arms/wrists.
1308403103641808897 2020-09-22 21:49:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JennyNichole4 Thanks

1308392955225534464 2020-09-22 21:09:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> Toughie.  Hate to do this to my top two heroes...but Cap and WS take it.  But Batman and Nightwing don't go down easy
1308392639050534914 2020-09-22 21:08:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Hmmm....  I mean, decisions, decisions? ^^; As you said, digital might have to be the way to go. Just for ease/simplicity.  BUT maybe do the covers physically? (And sell THOSE for $$ ;) )

1308216793794838528 2020-09-22 09:29:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> One of my favorite pieces done for me by Dody, Tebe, and Tommy that is NOT American Dreams related. But it IS inspired by a story idea I have for Captain America.  https://t.co/2kSkkmIANy
1308190140377038848 2020-09-22 07:43:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> So I did something VERY stupid.  I went to sit on a chair...only to belatedly forget we had moved it to the OTHER end of the table.  So I landed straight on my tuchus...THE PAIN!!!!
1308095522683736065 2020-09-22 01:27:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> I really hope I get a space for next year's Fan Expo Boston.....

1308026081493037057 2020-09-21 20:51:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter Ah got ya!  I once splurged on a page from Superman Unchained (which I could afford because it wasn't a splashy page) which I wanted b/c it had one of my fave dramatic moments.  But yeah, getting pages is EXPENSIVE (unless you somehow luck out)
1308025520139964418 2020-09-21 20:49:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Barx46544314 @BenjaminPerezE @NaughtyFroggo @scottmarshall That's something you made up.
1308024938868154368 2020-09-21 20:47:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 Got ya.  Plus getting a commission from Brett is also luck of the draw.  I've won it ONCE.

1307770355839389701 2020-09-21 03:55:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @lachwriter I blame Nolan more. Apparantely he was being a prima donna and refuse to move the release date OR release it VOD

1307743220818903040 2020-09-21 02:07:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> Just got this DM from @Eskivo_ with the cover sketch shortly thereafter.  Oh, it's THAT good! :D  https://t.co/7R78rY8m42
1307742436752535552 2020-09-21 02:04:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Johnbatusijack Ah got ya! :)  I got like 4 weeks of pull list to go through (plus I would still be behind because of the rate of Midtown deliveries to my house)
1307742095357157378 2020-09-21 02:03:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan ah lol  I'm just indifferent to TDKR XD I prefer Year One.  Batman Begins I adore, I like TDK, meh on DKR...but the last two felt like they were ashamed to be comic films in retrospect
1307741642418540547 2020-09-21 02:01:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Johnbatusijack Geez, and I thought I was bad in being behind in reading!!
1307741353099571203 2020-09-21 02:00:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan ...Am I the only Bat-fan who is meh on Dark Knight Returns?  (As well as the back 2/3rds of the Nolan trilogy)
1307739941183594496 2020-09-21 01:54:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> After a late lunch, gonna catch up on my comics.  I got like 4 boxes/weeks worth I need to read ^^;

1307733312031657985 2020-09-21 01:28:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @willnevin Assange is a Russian agent and a complete jackass.  I don't know why ANYONE would defend him
1307730602557399047 2020-09-21 01:17:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> ZS Fandom just can't accept any other viewpoint of DC Characters.  They are a toxic cult of personality.

1307703877819600896 2020-09-20 23:31:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> Correction, 19ish years ago (since the tutoring started when I was 12)
1307703177316364288 2020-09-20 23:28:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> The gentleman who is blowing the shofar at today's (streaming) service, as he does every year, tutored me for my bar mitzvah portion. 18 years ago.  He was old then, and he's certainly no spring chicken now.  But he still delivers the best shofar blasts I ever heard.
1307702434077253633 2020-09-20 23:25:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TylerWalpole Because too many people are low on info and high on hatred.

1307699372201779200 2020-09-20 23:13:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brykotyk @Dagreenwell13 Oh right! (I think its even in my Grant Morrison Batman omnibus too lol)
1307699225191419908 2020-09-20 23:12:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrideOfDiablo Streaming my temple's Rosh Hashannah service, then probably an afternoon of reading comics after lunch
1307694786636374017 2020-09-20 22:55:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ida_skibenes They don't care.  They put their purity over the safety and rights of others.
1307694459346399232 2020-09-20 22:53:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brykotyk @Dagreenwell13 yep.  But why is Bruce vomiting up a symbiote?

1307692702159572993 2020-09-20 22:46:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MarkOStack yes.
1307691933251309569 2020-09-20 22:43:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrooklynBatman_ And those smearing Geoff Johns and Walter Hamada?
1307691822127493121 2020-09-20 22:43:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CullyHamner I mean, he's just the end result of Nixon's Southern Strategy, Reagan's devil deal with Evangelicals, and Gingrich's pure evil
1307691509370826752 2020-09-20 22:42:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrooklynBatman_ And ZS Twitter doesn't?  Their attacks on Patty Jenkins?
1307690813409853441 2020-09-20 22:39:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrooklynBatman_ A VERY large percentage is.  Hell, a mild criticism or saying "this is not how I see the characters" sets ZS Twitter off.
1307690138269626368 2020-09-20 22:36:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrooklynBatman_ And ZS Twitter ISN'T problematic?
1307689256966647811 2020-09-20 22:33:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> Well, you purity progressives shrieked "BERNIE OR BUST" in 2016, even though we warned you about the consequences of your tantrum.  Well...are you enjoying the consequences?  Vote Biden this year!  https://t.co/6UzyD9S7x4

1306687878030929921 2020-09-18 04:14:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 there are similarities, but it's not 1:1

1306665176331059201 2020-09-18 02:43:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brykotyk Exactly.   But for some reason, they just CAN'T!  Partially because they and their fans have been stewing in toxicity for years
1306662943812194306 2020-09-18 02:34:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattbo_0 This. It's VERY passive aggressive.  https://t.co/rWne6ICbFq
1306661848817774599 2020-09-18 02:30:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KinoFabino I remember those! *dissolves into a cloud of dust*
1306661390996955137 2020-09-18 02:28:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> JunkieXL is being VERY unprofessional in attacking Danny Elfman (and by extension, John Williams).  And of course the ZS extremists are eating it up.....
1306661194875502592 2020-09-18 02:28:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBatman_Flash @Mikey_hbk90 Yep
1306660702120226816 2020-09-18 02:26:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 They've been attacking him for years (and deliberately ignoring his massive body of musical masterpieces).  They're just hating him because he did the music for the theatrical cut of JL. Which he had to do on short notice, to storyboards

1306653722978779143 2020-09-18 01:58:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> There's been a HUGE uptick in comic book crowdfunding projects of late!  So many good books to check out.  But I'm worried some projects might be choked out :/

1306643677016662016 2020-09-18 01:18:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattkrotzer Well given that the other side already wants to literally tar and feather those he is accusing, no matter what the outcome is.....  It's just another entry in the ZS Extremists war on everyone else.
1306642807097118730 2020-09-18 01:14:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BrenttHarshman yep
1306642083789365248 2020-09-18 01:12:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @mattkrotzer Kinda simple.  I don't like toxic mobs...and he's certainly stirred one up.  Plus I'd rather a fair impartial investigation be done without someone making that investigation harder to do.

1306343568055861249 2020-09-17 05:25:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> Can we have a mental health check for Kanye West?  I mean, the man posted a video of him pissing on one of his Grammys that he tossed into the toilet. That's not the sign of a healthy mind.

1306313728686788610 2020-09-17 03:27:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> To say I'm upset and angry about my fellow Americans being ignorant of the Holocaust, and those handwaving or minimizing Jewish pain, would be a major UNDERSTATEMENT.  I'm freaking furious.

1306295810057961473 2020-09-17 02:16:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Demonpuppy The people complaining about the KS prices don't seem to get that they're higher so the project can actually get done.  Plus we're factoring in potential costs we don't foresee.  Plus Diamond rarely lists books by us little guys.  Also, $25 for a conventional floppy? $10 at most!
1306294845917605888 2020-09-17 02:12:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ShaneMBailey Nightwing!

1306292726565044225 2020-09-17 02:03:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Demonpuppy Works for me!  Just keep print and shipping costs in mind. On KS at least, you can factor that into the overall price (after KS reward price)
1306278120295665669 2020-09-17 01:05:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby @Kimota1977 The book specifically, the art, or the genre?
1306277302913900550 2020-09-17 01:02:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @215Ink My team and I are debating doing so for our project (or making an "artist's edition" a possible KS reward if not KS product)
1306273786614951936 2020-09-17 00:48:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> Would a B&amp;W "artist's edition" of a comic be something you would be interested in as a Kickstarter project or reward?  #comics #indiecomics #makingcomics

1306248702818955264 2020-09-16 23:08:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 Nope, this is not a comedy.  And more of a psychological thriller.
1306246193035571201 2020-09-16 22:58:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> Yesterday, I wanted to do a pirates book.  Today, I'm revising an older idea for a murder mystery/psychological thriller with a Broadway bent.  I got too many ideas that I want to do.

1306212928958468098 2020-09-16 20:46:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DailyRathaway Yeah my grandfather's family was from the Lvov region (which was constantly shifting borders), so they were in an area of what was then Poland. Far East Poland.  People from there were usually just rounded up and killed.
1306212016802103297 2020-09-16 20:43:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DailyRathaway Well, being Jewish, I learned about it VERY early on.  Took a college course just to expand my knowledge.  Let's just say I learned it's very likely my ancestors probably didn't even make it to the camps. They were probably shot and just thrown into a ditch.
1306210670061461504 2020-09-16 20:37:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TimBoard64 yep
1306210624792395776 2020-09-16 20:37:35 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DailyRathaway Probably because they don't want to "scare kids" or "offend Christians".  Meanwhile, I was taught about it from a YOUNG AGE! Hell, my middle names are masculinized and Anglicized versions of the names of my great aunts who were murdered in the Shoah!

1305978885654355968 2020-09-16 05:16:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> What unholy concoction is this?!
1305978446028382211 2020-09-16 05:15:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JennyNichole4 sounds disgusting
1305957687948193793 2020-09-16 03:52:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> Why do I want to do a pirates comic now?  Should I do a pirates comic down the line? (Since I got a TON of stuff going on at the moment)
1305956932251983873 2020-09-16 03:49:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 Doesn't exactly alter my points about this latest screed though
1305955767338627072 2020-09-16 03:44:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> Secondly, he only got the script the week OF Fandome and signed on a couple days later. There was no time to record an announcement.  Ray Fisher is lying out his tuchus on this. He needs to take down that post.  But I guess A&gt;E is only for those on the enemies list. 2/2
1305955423653163013 2020-09-16 03:43:31 +0800 <DanielKalban> So do ZS extremists no longer have critical thinking skills?  Ray Fisher's latest screed against WB doesn't work when you consider the timeline.  There's no way Ben would have announced his return at Fandome as he recorded his panels weeks before Fandome. 1/?
1305952914008137728 2020-09-16 03:33:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> And watch them be a bunch of edgelords who bash wearing masks, causing an uptick in cases

1305943687763984385 2020-09-16 02:56:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> Ray Fisher's latest smear of WB is just that, a smear.  There's no way that Affleck's return would have been revealed at Fandome as they prerecorded the panels etc WEEKS before they made that announcement.  What else is he lying about?

1305832700830461953 2020-09-15 19:35:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BatmanFiles tell me about it.  It's like as if DC doesn't do EXACTLY what the "fans" want, they just bash it non stop.

1304799969761808384 2020-09-12 23:12:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @brykotyk These days? People will just create an excuse that fits their bias as to why they "failed"
1304794572174831617 2020-09-12 22:50:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MiltonAguiarArt Yep
1304783404676853760 2020-09-12 22:06:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @adelso_corona @Demonpuppy @adalhouse Awesome!!
1304782961120866305 2020-09-12 22:04:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> Ya know, after making that vent post re Star Wars...I feel much better :)
1304780998345977856 2020-09-12 21:56:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> So people are bashing a movie starring Tom Holland because they're expecting him to be quippy and funny.  OFFS
1304780559214931968 2020-09-12 21:55:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @carmengoesthwip yep.  Let's be blunt, if it wasn't a 1:1 translation of the Thrawne trilogy or someone's fanfic, they would hate it
1304780387617583107 2020-09-12 21:54:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos yep, and in fandom
1304779553596936192 2020-09-12 21:51:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ny_raga that. Or the assorted other nonsense.  Fans these days are stewing in toxicity. Hell, some people think a character not being written EXACTLY how they want is a personal attack (see: multiple DC fan accounts....)
1304778579675435009 2020-09-12 21:47:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard yep.  And if it was a MALE executive, he would not be getting even a tenth of the same level of venom
1304777643594846210 2020-09-12 21:43:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ny_raga @ReelJuanMatos I have since posted it lol
1304777336420737024 2020-09-12 21:42:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> Okay, might as well get it off my chest.  So, everyone LOVES going after Kathleen Kennedy and make her out to be why the sequel trilogy "failed".   But they don't go after all the VARIOUS MEN who wrote it, directed it, also produced it, etc?
1304776785079529472 2020-09-12 21:40:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos Just a general observation I gotta kvetch about
1304775478209806337 2020-09-12 21:34:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> OFFS. I got something Star Wars related that I want to vent about...and I don't know a place or person I can SAFELY vent it to. Too many people with kneejerk hate for SW in general to have a rational discussion with after I get the vent out.....

1304593061016678400 2020-09-12 09:29:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> Some character fan accounts need to realize that how their fave characters are being written etc aren't personal attacks OR that the writers/editors/etc hate the character.  It's just one story out of many....

1304582665530740736 2020-09-12 08:48:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cullenbunn I had a Lost World: Jurassic Park one, but it acted more as a projector.
1304580562598928386 2020-09-12 08:40:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> Nothing like writing a bit of dialogue and getting a great response from your artists :D  Let's just say I skillfully subverted a trope :)

1304577506255740930 2020-09-12 08:28:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass Happy Birthday!
1304577165686640642 2020-09-12 08:26:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> hmm, food for thought
1304576238011527168 2020-09-12 08:23:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> WTF was Milo Manara thinking by posting that particular post, today of all freaking days?!
1304575826843836419 2020-09-12 08:21:29 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan YES!
1304526439631515657 2020-09-12 05:05:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> Hey all!  American Dreams packages should be on their way to you as we speak!  I'd love to see pics of you with the book(s) as they come in!
1304522172103352327 2020-09-12 04:48:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> Just started the first bits of lettering script of the new project as @Eskivo_ 's pages come in (since the original script was Marvel style, with me doing page by page breakdowns). I think it gives both of us plenty of creative challenges and freedom, not to mention collab.
1304502364112654337 2020-09-12 03:29:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> Look at what just arrived from @OminousPress !  @BartSears @ronmarz  https://t.co/iftbZGGRYL

1304473563471151105 2020-09-12 01:35:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MagsVisaggs Well I was going to say "The Monk", but that DOES predate WW2...I'll have to think on this.

1304424741848088577 2020-09-11 22:21:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> Enter the year you turned 10 years old into the GIF bar and see what was popular.  https://t.co/oj5B40RbJQ
1304419144130007042 2020-09-11 21:58:53 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheOtherMarioC Exactly. I mean, it stings a little, but as @frankee_white said, we had a 4% chance at best.  We just need to continue doing the work.
1304418623428194306 2020-09-11 21:56:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan Yep!  (Though these days, it's less writing, more project management ^^; )
1304404245874200576 2020-09-11 20:59:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> Today is the anniversary of one of the darkest days in American history.  I would say "Never Forget", but given a third of this nation learned the wrong lessons from that day and are willing to have a plague ravage us, it is clear we forgot.
1304190444700659717 2020-09-11 06:50:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> Yes please!   https://t.co/ZAaGyvo13D

1303852757166821389 2020-09-10 08:28:16 +0800 <DanielKalban> One of the more ridiculous Batman scenes I read.  WAY too wannabe noir, too Frank Miller. Over STEAK.  But it continues the trend of Bats being a TERRIBLE cook.  https://t.co/XvuG1xQN31
1303852011021111296 2020-09-10 08:25:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> Made a LOT of plans for one of my projects today as well as going over art for issue 5 of American Dreams.  Not much writing of late, but a LOT of project management.  I did do some major edits for something else earlier in the week though.
1303847145938837505 2020-09-10 08:05:58 +0800 <DanielKalban> Trump knew.  People died.  He should not get 4 more years in office.  He should face consequences for his actions and inaction.

1303492412677947392 2020-09-09 08:36:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @PatrickZircher yep.  This is the end result of the GOP's degredation since Nixon
1303491075886153730 2020-09-09 08:31:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jarredlujan Cheers!
1303491023306452992 2020-09-09 08:30:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Peposed Grats!!
1303420643808088069 2020-09-09 03:51:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TonyDimelo A little further out than I want though. ^^;
1303412090401685513 2020-09-09 03:17:13 +0800 <DanielKalban> @LuisGodoyII In NYC? It's the only kind!  All I want is a decent place to live on my own in a decent neighborhood with some decent subway access. Is that so much to ask for?
1303410418132627463 2020-09-09 03:10:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> Why am I looking at apartments I can barely afford?!
1303408425855053825 2020-09-09 03:02:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 @TheBatman_Flash there's always a loophole, or a "real Jimmy" moment
1303375950747500546 2020-09-09 00:53:36 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby pretty quiet. Not like I can do much b/c of COVID ^^;  Got a couple walks in though
1303374869778792450 2020-09-09 00:49:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby yep
1303374246811492352 2020-09-09 00:46:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby I read it. BRAVO!
1303365589671579648 2020-09-09 00:12:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby yep
1303365507618426883 2020-09-09 00:12:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby fair
1303358541735104513 2020-09-08 23:44:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SpaceKingBobby So do everyone who says it has to be Reeves or none at all.  There HAS to be a happy medium somewhere between the two.  (Hint: It's S:TAS!)
1303339985823764480 2020-09-08 22:30:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JorgeJimenezArt @JamesTheFourth Oh wow!
1303336456618995714 2020-09-08 22:16:40 +0800 <DanielKalban> Slowly catching up on the comics backlog again!
1303329418904047618 2020-09-08 21:48:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> Another sneak peek at American Dreams issue 4.  Crowley is up to something.  Then again, he's always up to something. And it's never good for most people.  #indiecomics #makingcomics  https://t.co/hoGwyAdrEb
1303306214399528960 2020-09-08 20:16:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> I just backed Ungodly Champion #1: A Mystical Tournament of Aether on @Kickstarter  https://t.co/t644oCvyyE
1303301242546982914 2020-09-08 19:56:45 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Johnbatusijack Introduce new characters to be part of the lore
1303145171647901696 2020-09-08 09:36:34 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DBAndry @TimDanielComics Did edits on a script
1303143870683897856 2020-09-08 09:31:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheAceblade Off the top of my head? The Wiz.
1303142209332621312 2020-09-08 09:24:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Rob_readscomics it wouldn't hurt
1303141446174769156 2020-09-08 09:21:46 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Ozymandias0_1 "Abusive on set behavior"  But again, vague details, if any
1303103806444630017 2020-09-08 06:52:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 that's the thing though.  The accused ARE cooperating, the accuser ISN'T
1303098487152750594 2020-09-08 06:31:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 It's like "It's beneath you to say the catch phrase that's been associated with the character due to a beloved show for nearly 20 years?!"
1303097437691805702 2020-09-08 06:26:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 yep
1303095159131865089 2020-09-08 06:17:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Ozymandias0_1 Seems like it.
1303094555173060610 2020-09-08 06:15:26 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Ozymandias0_1 He's the one making accusations towards Geoff Johns and others. BUT he's not even cooperating with the neutral investigator he demanded.  Instead, he's been making nonstop vague tweets and videos.
1303093171459629056 2020-09-08 06:09:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Ozymandias0_1  https://t.co/B0OQb7waND
1303092713705877508 2020-09-08 06:08:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> YIKES! That kind of threat isn't covered by freedom of speech.  If anything, police should have arrested the guy. But we know why the cops give the alt right a pass.
1303092224805269509 2020-09-08 06:06:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> I'll crack up when this investigation is done and the report is damning for Ray Fisher and clears Geoff Johns et al.  Not that it will change the minds of the ZS Cult who have already pronounced sentence instead of letting the investigation take its course.
1303085315897413638 2020-09-08 05:38:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> @CTropes they're nuts!
1303085099106344962 2020-09-08 05:37:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Hawkworld_ well, one of my faves is employed as:  https://t.co/1iLpgiKcPB
1303083827548614657 2020-09-08 05:32:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RueLineback ...wow, talk about someone who is not playing with a full deck.  Do they not realize there is a PANDEMIC
1303083355970338816 2020-09-08 05:30:56 +0800 <DanielKalban> @DCEUCraig @i_bugu @KalEl_fan49 Exactly.  They don't care about due process, etc. They just want their "enemies" destroyed.  If WB's investigation clears him, they'll still bash him, The narrative is set.
1303083123337572353 2020-09-08 05:30:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 @DCEUCraig And that shitty person might be actually innocent of what he's accused of.  The ZS extremists want creative control and freedom to be only in ZS's hands, and will come up with excuses to hate on other with flimsy pretexts.
1303082267682709511 2020-09-08 05:26:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @RueLineback ...what the frick was their thought process?!
1303081702680670215 2020-09-08 05:24:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @vascogeorgiev cool!
1303081630815449089 2020-09-08 05:24:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheBatman_Flash yep
1303077913328259075 2020-09-08 05:09:19 +0800 <DanielKalban> Just read the first four issues of WILDCats for the first time.  Quite fun, though a bit dated (due to the presence of Dan Quayle, among other aspects)
1303069915893694464 2020-09-08 04:37:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos I know, right?
1303062159556055041 2020-09-08 04:06:43 +0800 <DanielKalban> @cracksh0t @MidtownComics I've been having them ship my pull to me. It takes longer, etc, but safer than my having to hop onto the subway back and forth
1303061235416604672 2020-09-08 04:03:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @KylerClodfelter XD   Oh Alena is NOT amused!
1303060588214603785 2020-09-08 04:00:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HeatherAntos @embarkvet and 100% adorable!!
1303060478432808965 2020-09-08 04:00:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> oh like there'd be any other film I'd choose from my birth year  https://t.co/EpLJuE9IMi
1303060187121700864 2020-09-08 03:58:52 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TKOpresents Superhero. There's already too much cynicism etc in the world. Time to be a beacon of hope
1303059876659240968 2020-09-08 03:57:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Demonpuppy oh wow!
1303059820468146176 2020-09-08 03:57:25 +0800 <DanielKalban> this
1303032512386564099 2020-09-08 02:08:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @HYeahTeenSupers it gets worse
1303031056073920514 2020-09-08 02:03:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @VioletWanderers Wow, he's nutso
1303029780175040514 2020-09-08 01:58:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ChrisCade4 Agreed. Incredibly toxic people, who were basically in a Fox News bubble for years.  The "great people" could have put a pin in the toxicity early on, but they didn't.
1303022983561252864 2020-09-08 01:31:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @deadletterpoets @HYeahTeenSupers Like DCUO?
1303008119572885504 2020-09-08 00:31:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> @velekcity Quit making the rest of us look bad!!
1302995821814779905 2020-09-07 23:43:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 But RF may have made up the claim that Hamada want to throw people under the bus to save Johns.  If that is the case, shouldn't A&gt;E then apply to RF?
1302990511905689600 2020-09-07 23:22:01 +0800 <DanielKalban> @jakheerhussain @MrNiceGuy18_58 Yes, entitled.  And thank you for proving my point.
1302990331055607815 2020-09-07 23:21:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos @MrNiceGuy18_58 yep
1302984380391002113 2020-09-07 22:57:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Mikey_hbk90 Yep, but the ZS zealot narrative has been set. Hamada is now an "enemy". Even if proven innocent.  Hell, even if Johns turns out to be innocent as well, they'll still attack him. Because they will not derivate from their narrative.
1302979527187066882 2020-09-07 22:38:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @MrNiceGuy18_58 so many entitled people
1302979093990907907 2020-09-07 22:36:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> @NakatomiTim He is such an ass
1302978557111676928 2020-09-07 22:34:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Iron_Spike yep
1302976981651402752 2020-09-07 22:28:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> @TheCBMCringe Can I find both sides despicable?
1302976643921784833 2020-09-07 22:26:54 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JAMALIGLE This should be a bigger story in the comic book press; so far it seems to be crickets
1302963783783116802 2020-09-07 21:35:48 +0800 <DanielKalban> I dreamed last night of the Plaza Hotel. A place I've only been twice. Once as an infant, and once on the rounds for my job.  For some reason, I was inspired to look at the menus from there.  And I am having major sticker shock....
1302958083312943104 2020-09-07 21:13:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> Happy Labor Day! Thank a Union Member today!
1302893041745887234 2020-09-07 16:54:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 Electricity for the polling machines?
1302793839149752321 2020-09-07 10:20:30 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Joe_Kach Oh, it's a supermarket!  Weird that they don't have pita bread....
1302793674749890560 2020-09-07 10:19:51 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Joe_Kach HEB?
1302790968790396928 2020-09-07 10:09:06 +0800 <DanielKalban> Time to sleep, perchance to dream.
1302786424362631169 2020-09-07 09:51:02 +0800 <DanielKalban> @vascogeorgiev Awesome!
1302771904739250182 2020-09-07 08:53:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @LuisGodoyII No worries.
1302771225190690819 2020-09-07 08:50:39 +0800 <DanielKalban> @LuisGodoyII Yes, but as I said, any newer Jewish character (as in, any created during this culture war period we find ourselves in now, if any are out there) be attacked.
1302770087305281537 2020-09-07 08:46:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> Why do I got a feeling the same people complaining about Kamala would also complain about a character being Jewish as well? Like proudly Jewish, even if not observant.  Older Jewish characters seem to get a pass, but watch newer ones be attacked by the same bigots.
1302767118958632962 2020-09-07 08:34:20 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SebastianPiriz oh wow!
1302752147004706816 2020-09-07 07:34:50 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ANerdWonder And how often are people falsely accused of murder as well?  Funny how the people he accuses matches the enemies list of the toxic ZS fans.....
1302750832467861505 2020-09-07 07:29:37 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ANerdWonder So basically, assume guilt despite an investigation not being over.
1302749975361843200 2020-09-07 07:26:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ANerdWonder And if it turns out that he DIDN'T do what he's accused of doing?  Because it seems you already found him guilty before the investigation is even over.
1302749597383774209 2020-09-07 07:24:42 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ANerdWonder Did I not say I'm perfectly willing to eat crow?
1302748753376444421 2020-09-07 07:21:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> I'm trying to find any non spoilery page from issue 4 of American Dreams to preview what is coming eventually :)  Apparently, Jake Gold gets carsick.  Maybe it's Houdini's driving.....  https://t.co/OTLb7tCVHR
1302748205629804545 2020-09-07 07:19:10 +0800 <DanielKalban> Seriously, people, when someone (me) asks you a question, can you please stop tap dancing around it and ANSWER IT, especially when someone (me) has to ask it more than three freaking times.
1302747578992390144 2020-09-07 07:16:41 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ANerdWonder It's not a question of "devotion", it's a question of having an investigation, not a damn witch hunt.  YOUR hatred for Johns et al is palpable.  ANSWER. MY. QUESTION.
1302746667494539266 2020-09-07 07:13:04 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ANerdWonder Stop dancing around and answer the question. If Johns et al are cleared by the investigation, are you willing to admit you are wrong?
1302746452163284992 2020-09-07 07:12:12 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SuperWinterGirl @Salahbenghalem0 @BrooklynBatman_ So people claim. Doesn't mean they're telling the truth.
1302746238681481217 2020-09-07 07:11:21 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ANerdWonder "Numerous people"...are we pulling the Fox News tactics?  Answer my question. How will you react if Johns et al are cleared? Will you publicly apologize?  I know I'm willing to eat crow if *I* am wrong. Are you willing to as well?
1302745934145761280 2020-09-07 07:10:09 +0800 <DanielKalban> 5 Films...5 Tags...So many films  Singin' In The Rain Star Wars: ANH Beauty And The Beast Batman (1989) To Be Or Not To Be (the Mel Brooks version)  @KylerClodfelter @ArtOfTimBrown @jarredlujan @Kheme51 @Joe_Kach
1302745490396778496 2020-09-07 07:08:23 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ANerdWonder And your blind hatred for Johns et al isn't impacting yours?
1302745393311223808 2020-09-07 07:08:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ANerdWonder So he claims. Doesn't mean he's telling the truth.  It's ALWAYS about Zack.  If Johns et al are cleared, how will you react?
1302744846352908290 2020-09-07 07:05:49 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ANerdWonder So he claims.  What if it turns out the investigation clears Johns, Hamada, et al? What will you do?
1302744147510480897 2020-09-07 07:03:03 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SuperWinterGirl @Salahbenghalem0 @BrooklynBatman_ We're dealing with toxic, deranged people.  And I don't mean Johns or Hamada. I mean those slandering them.
1302743772825030657 2020-09-07 07:01:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Hypnotique89 @BrooklynBatman_ They were never about accountability. This is all solely to go after their "enemies".
1302742605294338050 2020-09-07 06:56:55 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ANerdWonder I trust Boyega's claims FAR more than Fisher's.  Fisher is refusing to go along with the neutral third party investigator he himself requested and is making social media videos making vague accusations. That doesn't look good no matter what.
1302741483829723143 2020-09-07 06:52:28 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Joe_Kach WTF...  What kind of monster does that?
1302741004710293506 2020-09-07 06:50:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ReelJuanMatos *sees pic* WTF!
1302739930800553984 2020-09-07 06:46:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> I can't wait for WB/DC to show its own receipts to counter RF's claims.  Not that ZS extremists will accept the facts. They already accept his version, facts be damned.
1302735654892306432 2020-09-07 06:29:18 +0800 <DanielKalban> @SeclusionStudio yep XD

1302679404439580675 2020-09-07 02:45:47 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Demonpuppy I backed it I think on the first day lol

1302400002933874692 2020-09-06 08:15:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 Fair.  Personal head canon has him as a Mets fan (but then again, that's the team I depressingly root for)
1302399159446769664 2020-09-06 08:12:11 +0800 <DanielKalban> @kevinpowers70 But he now roots for the Mets

1302217263576166400 2020-09-05 20:09:24 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Scottdiavolo @Variety Did you not read the article? He's refusing to cooperate WITH AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR that he himself requested
1302207408282972163 2020-09-05 19:30:14 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Shadowheart11 Accountability&gt;Entertainment   Applies to him too.  But he won't apply it to himself
1302167016934080512 2020-09-05 16:49:44 +0800 <DanielKalban> Given that the fact that Fisher refused to meet with the investigators he demanded, and "A&gt;E", shouldn't he be held accountable for smearing people? Fair is fair, right?  He will likely be fired and replaced.
1302162190795972610 2020-09-05 16:30:33 +0800 <DanielKalban> @comargs @Variety He will be recast
1302161931973861376 2020-09-05 16:29:32 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Variety Doesn't look good for Fisher.  The fact he isn't cooperating with the investigation he demanded is pretty damning.  There goes his career

1302013851748233216 2020-09-05 06:41:07 +0800 <DanielKalban> this
1302013604494016513 2020-09-05 06:40:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @BaldBeardedBard Exactly.  Because they're probably cooperating with the investigation, etc.  Fisher, however, is just muddying the waters to cause chaos.  Something doesn't smell right with his recent post
1302013354211528704 2020-09-05 06:39:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> Not to mention, this just makes the job of the third party investigators harder and muddies the waters.

1302010046168137731 2020-09-05 06:25:59 +0800 <DanielKalban> If it turns out Ray Fisher just blatantly lied, he can kiss what is left of his short lived career GOOD BYE!  Lying about the boss to go after perceived enemies to feed red meat to a toxic fan base? That is a quick way to be fired AND sued for defamation.

1301884240032919552 2020-09-04 22:06:05 +0800 <DanielKalban> @ShaneMBailey So basically there have been pretentious comic fans all this time, but before the internet they at least kept to their own corners? :)

1301875725864140802 2020-09-04 21:32:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> There's this guy in this FB group I'm in who just bashes a certain writer non stop. Day after day, hour after hour. He needs therapy. And he's not the only "fan" out there that does.... It's FICTION. Why be this hateful and obsessed over FICTION?!
1301618878171283456 2020-09-04 04:31:38 +0800 <DanielKalban> Hey @Joe_Kach ! Look what arrived! (Softcover on left for comparison)  https://t.co/UQkxBIJOV9

1301587082373140485 2020-09-04 02:25:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> Had a lovely package of art and prints from the Ed Benes Studio arrive today!

1301575004958711809 2020-09-04 01:37:17 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 @paninicomicsfra I mean, I can get a Marvel omnibi (at retail price) for $100-150 and that's usually twice the amount of pages  (That is...when they bother to keep said omnibi IN PRINT!)
1301571646285910016 2020-09-04 01:23:57 +0800 <DanielKalban> @frankee_white @firstaidtaylor This is why I'm glad I have my pull at Midtown. Even if it's not on the shelf, they'll special order it for me (and/or others).  I mean, it's basic customer service we're talking about people!!
1301569430565068801 2020-09-04 01:15:08 +0800 <DanielKalban> @Kheme51 @paninicomicsfra Geez, and I thought some of the prices here in the US were bad!

1301269761276379137 2020-09-03 05:24:22 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass I know what you mean, somewhat  I've written fan fic before where months later a similar story showed up (I like to joke either i or the other writer accidentally hacked into each other's thought pattern)

1300866880463417354 2020-09-02 02:43:27 +0800 <DanielKalban> @JosephGlass That is highway robbery

1300811651860623366 2020-09-01 23:04:00 +0800 <DanielKalban> Remember, the first "talkie" was a Jewish story, a story of assimilation vs tradition, of fathers vs sons.  And the big dramatic moment takes place during Erev Yom Kippur, during Kol Nidre   https://t.co/sLUsOPiOFi

1300770445097078785 2020-09-01 20:20:15 +0800 <DanielKalban> The downside to doing both scripts I had to do yesterday instead of saving one for today?  It leaves my day PRETTY wide open so now I have to figure out what to do to fill my day.
