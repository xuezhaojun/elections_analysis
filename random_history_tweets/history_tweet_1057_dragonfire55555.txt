The cover up was obvious and if it had happened today, the technology would be very revealing.  Kennedy was a victim of a massive $$power play. It is always about power and $$$.

People who say she was trying to escape the vehicle when he was shot are liars. she was trying to retrieve a piece of his skull. Jackie was deeply in love with Jack &amp; he visa versa.

We all knelt next to our desks and prayed for him. Kennedy was not a perfect man, but he was a good man, &amp; a true patriot.  And, this is why he was assassinated by evil forces.

I believe he needs to recover away from public view-Quarantine very convenient.  He uses doctors who lie for him. Mild symptoms? Like the flu as he claims. I need proof.

He is also a big man 7 feet &amp; could go ballistic at any moment in his condition.  Police have to protect themselves when going in that close to cuff him.

AND it is clear that all deaths have been "under-ported" attributing the deaths to other per-existing conditions that some people have,so the death toll of younger people is not accurate

1300622797668900866 2020-09-01 10:33:34 +0800 <dragonfire55555> To qualify this in 2020: Herd Immunity of the working poor.  Wealthy people (like Trump Crime Family) can afford to isolate, &amp; test people around them, until the plague is over. Heard immunity is a primitive concept originating from herds of animals, &amp; wealth does not factor in.
