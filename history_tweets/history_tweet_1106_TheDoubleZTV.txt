1344059553437114370 2020-12-30 07:15:43 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> A little preview of some of the videos planned so far when DoubleZWWE returns to YouTube.  https://t.co/lcuuADOtWc
1344015734775689217 2020-12-30 04:21:36 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @KariByron Well, there goes all of my photos.
1343993372630011904 2020-12-30 02:52:44 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @KliquidTV @TubbyEmu Love it, book it!
1343992578862100483 2020-12-30 02:49:35 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @TubbyEmu This would be an awesome setting for a match in WWE 2K Battlegrounds, throw the opponent out of the ring and into the water before scrambling back in.
1343981353478533120 2020-12-30 02:04:59 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Stuff like this is why @VelVelHoller is freaking awesome, still one my favorite YouTube video/channel intros of all-time.  https://t.co/nB6jmOx5Cx
1343924508919533571 2020-12-29 22:19:06 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Y‚Äôall just had to make Death Note trend.  https://t.co/97ZtgXTqZn
1343896734179741697 2020-12-29 20:28:44 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @WWEREALONE This has been his best overall year since 2007, 2013 being another really solid year for him.
1343887299873042439 2020-12-29 19:51:15 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> A forgotten match that was really good between Chris Benoit and Kurt Angle from Judgment Day 2001.  https://t.co/HwVsOb6Ovh
1343586394288041985 2020-12-28 23:55:33 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> One week away from the return of DoubleZWWE to YouTube, the anticipation is building.
1343536708013486080 2020-12-28 20:38:07 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> A letdown of a match and a sign that WWE preferred Edge over Matt Hardy, shortly after Matt Hardy's reinstatement (whether it was kayfabe or legit) in WWE.  https://t.co/J1GK4Ql3Nv

1343423558790369282 2020-12-28 13:08:30 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @LegitBossWRLD Shit like that is why wrestling fans get looked at as creeps.

1343202802429026304 2020-12-27 22:31:18 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Probably the greatest 6-Man Tag Team Match in WWE history.  https://t.co/XuoKsohKMp
1343059071344267266 2020-12-27 13:00:10 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The night where the Bludgeon Brothers walked out of Wrestlemania with the Smackdown Tag Team Championships.  https://t.co/j5IXCniv67
1343013841475674112 2020-12-27 10:00:26 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The man was way too young to pass, no doubt about it. Never got his fair share in WWE, never will be forgotten. #RIPBrodieLee
1342994012475686917 2020-12-27 08:41:38 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @crazyseandx 20 bucks well wasted.
1342991408316243970 2020-12-27 08:31:17 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @crazyseandx Sadly, bought it for 20 dollars on Black Friday.

1342940982111854606 2020-12-27 05:10:55 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Tonight‚Äôs stream will be of WWE 2K18 on the Xbox One. No way in hell I‚Äôm streaming the Nintendo Switch version, it‚Äôs not worth it.
1342883962839035907 2020-12-27 01:24:20 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Man, Orton's injury in this match was hard to watch. Randy was legit angry with the crowd afterwards and yelled at them to "SHUT THE FUCK UP!"  https://t.co/ERpGPdel4n
1342704578106707968 2020-12-26 13:31:32 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Napkin_Nexter No, my stream disconnected out of nowhere just like last Saturday's two WWE 2K Battlegrounds streams did. Not sure how it happens when my laptop is on an Ethernet connection during my streams, thought they'd be more stable than this.
1342621857980280838 2020-12-26 08:02:50 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV>  https://t.co/Fm32iCpRRC  It's a Grand Theft Auto Online Christmas! (live stream)
1342541542163152898 2020-12-26 02:43:41 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Looks like one of my internal hard drives on my PC has given out. It shows in Disk Management, but I can't access it in Windows Explorer. This is a big problem because I've got my DoubleZWWE videos on there.
1342504363030405120 2020-12-26 00:15:57 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @BigMikey813 Merry Christmas to you too Mike.
1342502664861589507 2020-12-26 00:09:12 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Stay tuned for tonight's stream, it's going to be a Grand Theft Auto Online Christmas stream!

1342472232665292800 2020-12-25 22:08:16 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I bet this chair brings back bad memories for my brother. Same chair he fell off when he was a toddler and broke his arm.  https://t.co/yMnJNg4aH7
1342441560970043392 2020-12-25 20:06:24 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays everyone. üéÑ‚ùÑÔ∏è
1342284592586371078 2020-12-25 09:42:39 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Dear prick in the truck who sped around us in this snow and blew a shitload of snow at us on this rough road, stop being in a rush. Never drive fast on a snowy road, it‚Äôs dangerous for all of us.
1342276502872846341 2020-12-25 09:10:31 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Due to myself still not being home, the stream of Pok√©mon Stadium 2 will happen on New Year‚Äôs Eve.
1342262314595188736 2020-12-25 08:14:08 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Stream is delayed tonight, not at home at the moment.
1342244459313065988 2020-12-25 07:03:11 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Donnachie11 The timing for reversals is frustrating due to the frame rate problems, I even beat AJ Styles in a quick match with a Snap Suplex. This port of the game is not worth it.
1342240927524540417 2020-12-25 06:49:09 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Donnachie11 It‚Äôs awful. The frame rate is TERRIBLE during the whole thing, models look bad.
1342230791787569152 2020-12-25 06:08:52 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Playing WWE 2K18 on the Nintendo Switch, I‚Äôm regretting this choice.
1342222905107750912 2020-12-25 05:37:32 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @WrestlingBios I‚Äôm lighting my fireplace this year, not letting Santa in for watching me while I sleep. Creeps me out.
1342195068707463168 2020-12-25 03:46:55 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @wrestlelamia This hasn't been a good year for YouTube involving wrestling footage. First MarkScan Enforcement goes on a tear with WWE content, now this with AEW.
1342165687440203776 2020-12-25 01:50:10 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RealPaladin1991 I would if I knew how.
1342164447381565447 2020-12-25 01:45:15 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> It‚Äôs not common where we have snow around Christmas in Michigan, but it‚Äôs finally here.  https://t.co/BLQDi10Z41
1342128250923974656 2020-12-24 23:21:25 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I voted for #coke, and you?! This is the final battle! PEPSI VS COKE! which one do you think is the winner of THE COLA WARS?! üçπ
1342121502632783876 2020-12-24 22:54:36 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The night where Eddie Guerrero won the Intercontinental Championship during his second run with WWE, damn good match on this night.  https://t.co/fEjkDOQsxs

1341823631974928389 2020-12-24 03:10:58 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @mareea_rose I could‚Äôve easily warned you about those apps. :P
1341803311327010818 2020-12-24 01:50:13 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> December 30, 2020: The WWE Slam Crate that came 8 months after I cancelled my subscription to them gets the unboxing video. Added a couple of treats in there as well. ;)
1341765158008459265 2020-12-23 23:18:37 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Great WWF Championship match in 1997, Mankind flying headfirst into the announce table was a great addition.  https://t.co/LBBFm6s5j4
1341703806296481796 2020-12-23 19:14:49 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Monsoon_Classic The future Balls Mahoney.

1341457777030557704 2020-12-23 02:57:11 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RAEraPodcast I bought it on Amazon after hearing about it in a YouTube video, haven't tried it out yet.
1341426868206112768 2020-12-23 00:54:22 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Poijz @PokemonGoApp Your Spirit Pokemon has arrived!
1341403728482582532 2020-12-22 23:22:25 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Had a WWE Slam Crate waiting around, finally rendering the unboxing as we speak.
1341386923391139840 2020-12-22 22:15:38 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Is this match remembered for anything other than Kharma's debut after Michelle lost?  https://t.co/DM9yWL017P
1341370809265385473 2020-12-22 21:11:37 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> And the award for being The Champ goes to... :P  https://t.co/RU8BhVsXUy
1341335592454529025 2020-12-22 18:51:40 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Vx1AlyxsWorld @WWE I asked that when Reigns wasn‚Äôt in jail for trying to end Braun Strowman with that ambulance at Great Balls of Fire. Doesn‚Äôt make sense from a storyline standpoint to get away with doing stuff like that.
1341332993655365634 2020-12-22 18:41:21 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Dear WWE, doing these Legends episodes of Raw aren‚Äôt always a ratings grab and aren‚Äôt a long term solution. Your focus should be on building your current stars, rather than relying on past stars in an ‚ÄúIn Case of Emergency, Break Glass‚Äù situation.
1341332311120470016 2020-12-22 18:38:38 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @ryansatin  https://t.co/Wrml5e6QKV
1341332107164041216 2020-12-22 18:37:49 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @MikkoMaestro I‚Äôve got every episode on my hard drive, I‚Äôve considered watching it at some point.
1341331865395990529 2020-12-22 18:36:52 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RateWork And I thought toddlers were annoying while throwing tantrums.
1341232811341213696 2020-12-22 12:03:15 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @OtherSmash97 @RMSTitanic_fan That was a secret!!!

1341094127568629764 2020-12-22 02:52:10 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @JayCondone This man has had his career revived with his Fiend character, he's not even close to being buried. But we're in an era where people think that one loss is detrimental to your career and you need to leave WWE if you EVER lose a match.
1341084359391113216 2020-12-22 02:13:22 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV>  https://t.co/U1OtCXXzDo  I've got a specific section on my Teespring store, 8 different styles of face masks with the custom nWo-like DoubleZWWE logo in different colors. 8 designs so far, possibly more to come depending on what colors work.
1341057784587141123 2020-12-22 00:27:46 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @CodyRayy119 I've got many different color variations of this custom logo. Deep pink, cyan, chocolate, etc.
1341055044939091970 2020-12-22 00:16:52 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> How do these nWo inspired DoubleZWWE logos look?  https://t.co/GubL13rU1O
1341049770647973893 2020-12-21 23:55:55 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @WrestlingBios Well, they are coming in RAW.
1341028038650306564 2020-12-21 22:29:34 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Donnachie11 I thought blocking their email address would stop this constant shit, yet I just notice that 5 new emails from them stating the SAME REPETITIVE SHIT has been moved to my Junk Mail folder. It's like that person that peaks in every window until you close every curtain.
1341026488620097543 2020-12-21 22:23:24 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Checked my junk mail, still somehow got these emails 8 months later. I guess blocking YouTube‚Äôs email address isn‚Äôt very effective after all.  https://t.co/o7u309FyR4

1340699141953957889 2020-12-21 00:42:39 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> A rather disappointing Hell in a Cell match from 2012, only remembered for its finish.  https://t.co/10yWNWrAIx

1340479429072609280 2020-12-20 10:09:35 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Stream disconnected on its own, sorry about that everyone. Trying again in just a moment.

1340349977952923649 2020-12-20 01:35:11 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Robbie1Kenobi Stock image that they had of him, they must not have had any other images from that period of him to use.
1340339132455923716 2020-12-20 00:52:06 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Man, Batista and Randy Orton just didn't click in the ring as opponent. Thank frick they didn't have the originally planned one-on-one match at Wrestlemania 30.  https://t.co/mzsdYVqE6C

1340142718706708480 2020-12-19 11:51:37 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Well, looks like work isn‚Äôt fully shutdown during this upcoming holiday season.
1340012558154162189 2020-12-19 03:14:24 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Maffewgregg So not even the email alerting you of the strike says who filed it against the video?
1339978058363756549 2020-12-19 00:57:19 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @VeeInfuso Happy birthday Vee. :)
1339959463034449920 2020-12-18 23:43:25 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RealPaladin1991 Judgment Day 2008. 2005 had everyone colored like they were reflecting off the Sun.
1339929244277813250 2020-12-18 21:43:21 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> A rare time during John Cena's time as the top guy of WWE where he opened a PPV.  https://t.co/1CiBsSkr2J

1339775487837687810 2020-12-18 11:32:22 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I think it‚Äôs time that I stop eating McDonald‚Äôs for a while.
1339769330880397314 2020-12-18 11:07:54 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @VeeInfuso Streamyard is an easy alternative.
1339640798716026882 2020-12-18 02:37:10 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @zmanbrianzane I know how factory work is, it can easily become headache-inducing (especially on a third shift schedule).
1339600395111297025 2020-12-17 23:56:37 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RealPaladin1991 The build to their Royal Rumble PPV match was awkward, built based on posing and doing some physical activities. Not exactly a great way to build excitement for a World Championship PPV match.
1339599089344729093 2020-12-17 23:51:26 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RealPaladin1991 The matches he had to start 2003 with Triple H REALLY spelled his demise until his release the next year.

1339292096839245826 2020-12-17 03:31:33 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Poijz It took me until today to FINALLY beat Giovanni. Persian, Kangaskhan, and Mewtwo for his team, Machamp, Dragonite, and Tyranitar for my team. Never thought I'd finally beat that nuisance.
1339280291085561864 2020-12-17 02:44:38 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Adding Nightbot commands for the chat in future YouTube live streams, this should be fun.

1339216796453376000 2020-12-16 22:32:20 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> A night that had a great feel good moment, just a shame that this moment would get destroyed once 2012 burst through Zack Ryder's door.  https://t.co/AP4LL2Jog3

1338892622799187972 2020-12-16 01:04:11 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Finally got most of my borrowed Switch games back, only missing one now.

1338500573587451907 2020-12-14 23:06:19 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I never thought Bret Hart could have a terrible match, but then this match happened at Wrestlemania 11.  https://t.co/4lVxW2Np8k
1338464684794589187 2020-12-14 20:43:42 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @brienutbutter_ Hope you feel better soon, please get as much rest as you can to fight this.

1338464292866318336 2020-12-14 20:42:09 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @ZahneYT It's working again now, everything associated with Google was down. I thought my email was hacked or something, almost had a heart attack not being able to log into Pokemon Go.
1338310434852630534 2020-12-14 10:30:46 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @bigthreefan441 No.
1338210688217591809 2020-12-14 03:54:25 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> January 4, 2021: Maybe?
1338143386402951172 2020-12-13 23:26:59 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Napkin_Nexter It could work, but sticking with DoubleZWWE works for name recognition.
1338109102380244992 2020-12-13 21:10:45 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> So uh, this odd match happened at In Your House: It's Time.  https://t.co/3LvyMYlpx4
1337965340031127554 2020-12-13 11:39:29 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Donnachie11 I've binge watched his videos over the years, classic stuff.
1337963999317594113 2020-12-13 11:34:10 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Donnachie11 But the downside to gaming back then is if a game had serious bugs in their programming, you couldn't download a patch to fix it.
1337961837023866882 2020-12-13 11:25:34 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Golly, 70 dollars for an SNES game in 1995 isn't cheap.  https://t.co/Ss2Egcshla

1337911037765562369 2020-12-13 08:03:43 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Tonight's scheduled stream of Pokemon Stadium 2 will be postponed to Christmas Eve. My apologies for this one folks, I'm absolutely exhausted from this week and I don't want to risk getting drowsy on stream for the 3rd time in 2 months.
1337798218013347841 2020-12-13 00:35:24 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @VeeInfuso Attention, I think.
1337767062358331393 2020-12-12 22:31:36 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @frozeintent That was a fun match, even though they botched the finish due to the timing of the pinfall count.
1337753887881760770 2020-12-12 21:39:15 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> One of only 2 or 3 watchable matches from Wrestlemania 16/2000, as well as being one of the best matches of that year.  https://t.co/JEzH1h0mwD
1337670180781105153 2020-12-12 16:06:38 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @wrestlelamia Since when does Vince care about work rate?
1337640611852283907 2020-12-12 14:09:08 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @mccusker86 Needs more liquor.
1337473873542078464 2020-12-12 03:06:35 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I've been debating this a lot: Should I make another DoubleZWWE YouTube channel?
1337432182483247104 2020-12-12 00:20:55 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RealPaladin1991 Well, it somewhat did. Helped start the whole story of Team Hell No and brought in the Dr. Shelby skits.
1337427518077493253 2020-12-12 00:02:23 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Let's be honest, none of us remember this match from Summerslam 2012. All we remember is what followed this PPV match in terms of the story.  https://t.co/H9HTTLRFYV
1337212926294454273 2020-12-11 09:49:40 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @TraceyMeyers13 Scream internally.
1337212875878920194 2020-12-11 09:49:28 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @jericholic8704 I had to go through old WWF shows before the PPV to find this one.
1337109116964237313 2020-12-11 02:57:10 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @THEPWSCENE It could honestly use a new look. It looks like a mini championship belt that you'd put on a wrestling action figure.
1337101802219728900 2020-12-11 02:28:06 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Absolutely incredible match from Survivor Series 1996. While their match at Wrestlemania 13 was a brawling classic, this was a technical classic. Watch this if you've forgotten how Stone Cold's style was before his neck was broken and if you want to see a 5-star classic match.  https://t.co/Az89HyPtAt
1337053570714267652 2020-12-10 23:16:27 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Good news, another scam call just took place and I get into an argument with the caller who claims I'm getting a rebate on my gas bill. Who wants to see that one come along? :D
1337020932397928449 2020-12-10 21:06:45 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> My brain is still back-and-forth on this, should I do this again?
1336985258152124417 2020-12-10 18:45:00 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @xviielie I believe so. My message to one of my friends didn't go through and on my PC, it's giving red text saying either "Connecting..." or "No Internet connection".
1336984677689733121 2020-12-10 18:42:41 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Do you remember when you joined Twitter? I do! #MyTwitterAnniversary  https://t.co/lZP2T4qFzT
1336738805706092544 2020-12-10 02:25:41 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @CutieStraw There's nothing to be ashamed of regarding that. I'm turning 29 in April and have been single for most of my 20s.
1336722598479212545 2020-12-10 01:21:17 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RezzananceTV Yikes! Scan your computer for malware if you do online shopping with your card, malware caused my card info to be stolen a few years ago by someone who ordered pizza on my card in NY/NJ.
1336719365299986434 2020-12-10 01:08:26 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Never knew this match card graphic from Elimination Chamber 2011 existed.  https://t.co/6QAbgiqyb8
1336668063815626752 2020-12-09 21:44:35 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The night where Christian got his big moment, it's a shame that it ended that same week though.  https://t.co/BEb3ccm0GI
1336627947860537344 2020-12-09 19:05:10 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Just saw a sign on a business in town that said Happy Festivus. Do they have the aluminum pole there?

1336354574517608452 2020-12-09 00:58:53 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @AEPodcast That moment when someone walks into the room with a cucumber.
1336338807080173576 2020-12-08 23:56:14 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> New scam call just happened, probably the shortest video I've got involving a scam call.
1336330492560302089 2020-12-08 23:23:11 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> We see through your plan Walrus, it's not going to work.
1336293363620962305 2020-12-08 20:55:39 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Back when the original plan for Payback 2013 saw Fandango compete for the Intercontinental Championship, but would be replaced by Curtis Axel due to a legit concussion.  https://t.co/y2N0fNm5wr
1336223776766365698 2020-12-08 16:19:08 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @ashreneemay One thing you hope to do in 2021?
1336223065609527296 2020-12-08 16:16:19 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @LiamIsOnYouTube Never heard of her.
1336020996726382595 2020-12-08 02:53:22 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Shiny Luxray in the team from Dynamax Adventures!
1335997943774638082 2020-12-08 01:21:46 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @CutieStraw Hard to say due to personally experiences. I somewhat believe that there's someone out there for everyone, but I have personal doubts for myself on that subject.
1335987696834113538 2020-12-08 00:41:03 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @DennisUltima I know, but I can't remember anything from this match at all.
1335986551826903043 2020-12-08 00:36:30 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I honestly have no recollection of this Fatal 4-Way match from Battleground 2014, at all. And yes, there was another version of the match card graphic.  https://t.co/sUrO5yIl7l
1335938372888629248 2020-12-07 21:25:03 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @MegaDap1 Just reading the year now REALLY makes me feel old.
1335935797606961153 2020-12-07 21:14:49 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @MegaDap1 Man, you're going WAY back if you can remember that. Now I'm feeling old.
1335934213246365696 2020-12-07 21:08:31 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @MegaDap1 @RateWork But then even stating under the image (and saying the source was YouTube) that it's an image of himself and his then-wife is rather odd.
1335932461130395650 2020-12-07 21:01:33 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @MegaDap1 @RateWork How the hell do they mix up who Del Rio's now ex-wife is and Eve Torres in that article?!
1335932090358112256 2020-12-07 21:00:05 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @tommy_vendetta @adamchuchu "Who's that jumping out the sky? Another guy!"  Stuff like that is just scary to be honest.
1335860824892715011 2020-12-07 16:16:54 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Isn‚Äôt it sad when someone feels the need to spam you on social media from many different accounts? It‚Äôs very pathetic use of your time.
1335827707205210113 2020-12-07 14:05:18 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @ZahneYT Welcome to the world Harvey.
1335596630708514818 2020-12-06 22:47:05 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I completely forgot that this match was supposed to happen at Cyber Sunday 2007. The match was scrapped due to Matt Hardy suffering a very serious cut in a Tag Team Match on Smackdown before the PPV, a laceration caused by Rey Mysterio's knee brace.  https://t.co/1ooknQSXpE
1335596359202779138 2020-12-06 22:46:00 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Fitz2016Matt Yes I am. :D
1335360707500630016 2020-12-06 07:09:37 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Marvinhrnndz Not much, relaxing until my stream begins. How have you been?
1335347452178800642 2020-12-06 06:16:56 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Napkin_Nexter I don‚Äôt want to spoil it, I‚Äôll just say that I recorded it almost 2 months ago and it‚Äôll be up a week from this upcoming Wednesday.
1335326069633785857 2020-12-06 04:51:58 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Currently rendering a 20-minute video that I recorded back in mid-October for a future upload, this one is more than a handful (literally).
1335291019160653824 2020-12-06 02:32:42 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The ONE bright spot from Royal Rumble 2015, this also being one of the best Triple Threat matches in WWE history.  https://t.co/5HBvIZP78F

1335192193674268673 2020-12-05 20:00:00 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> 2 matches originally penciled in for In Your House: Buried Alive, later changed. Marc Mero would face Goldust instead and Stone Cold would face Triple H in a Heel vs. Heel bout. This was also the night where Stone Cold debuted his iconic entrance music.  https://t.co/wVrs1jlwha
1335135977313083392 2020-12-05 16:16:37 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @wrestlelamia Jesus, I thought that was Jack Nicholson.
1335063809396969473 2020-12-05 11:29:51 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Got one of my unreleased videos rendered, should be on the gaming channel on January 5, 20201.
1335060270562078722 2020-12-05 11:15:47 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @WrestleCritic No, but I have it in my basement on VHS.
1334892835837980673 2020-12-05 00:10:27 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Donnachie11 I'm not 100% sure, I can't even remember how much I paid for mine.
1334890651188662272 2020-12-05 00:01:46 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Scrolling through my MacBook Pro, found some VERY old videos from DoubleZWWE and even one video from my original channel from August 2013.
1334848419152670720 2020-12-04 21:13:58 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The original plan was for Yokozuna and Vader to square off at Wrestlemania 12 in a singles match, but was changed to a 6-Man Tag Team Match with Owen Hart, British Bulldog, Ahmed Johnson, and Jake Roberts instead.  https://t.co/FN2e6BAg0W
1334823493217755138 2020-12-04 19:34:55 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> September 19, 2005 Raw: To my knowledge, the final time we'd see the Undisputed WWE Championship belt design on television. Kurt Angle's name was even on the nameplate when Eric Bischoff tried to strip John Cena of the WWE Championship after Unforgiven 2005.  https://t.co/NhVuuBoCjh

1334564732662140930 2020-12-04 02:26:41 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RezzananceTV I'd love to know that as well. I've been such a workaholic for years that I don't know how to relax or anything.
1334551781163065344 2020-12-04 01:35:14 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Found 3 rare Match Card Graphics from Vengeance: Night of Champions.  https://t.co/4c8zBaeqLo
1334502862810980353 2020-12-03 22:20:51 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Pretty good match from No Mercy 2003, rare time where John Cena lost via submission in his career.  https://t.co/i6b6dOafPz
1334411286432673792 2020-12-03 16:16:57 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @akfytwrestling Can‚Äôt really classify Sting as a ‚Äúreturn‚Äù, since he has never been in AEW before.
1334205903176945664 2020-12-03 02:40:50 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @TheAndreStarr Super Smash Hos.
1334182408942465031 2020-12-03 01:07:28 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Not a bad match from Summerslam 2002, could've been better. Felt like more should've been done to Jericho before going with the submission finish.  https://t.co/SepXihUNnI
1334170485245042695 2020-12-03 00:20:06 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @era_sONcEk I usually try to have Coca-Cola on hand during work, but it doesn't always work and I don't always have time to stop and take a drink due to the workload.
1334168654917808129 2020-12-03 00:12:49 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @era_sONcEk Now that's going to get me concerned. I had some instances where this happened a few years ago, but it has ramped up over the last few months.
1334163850430722049 2020-12-02 23:53:44 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @era_sONcEk But the weird thing though was that it wore off on its own. Felt off for most of my shift, suddenly felt fine again by 5 a.m.
1334144904252022784 2020-12-02 22:38:27 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Just what we needed, more bad news in 2020. R.I.P. Pat Patterson. :(
1334144614337490945 2020-12-02 22:37:17 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @crazyseandx Dating apps are the worst man, trust me.
1334087666887962629 2020-12-02 18:51:00 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @WrestleCritic His career is definitely Hall of Fame worthy, but the nearly 7 years of bad blood really is holding back that potential induction.
1334077119211638789 2020-12-02 18:09:05 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RezzananceTV My brain melted from trying to make sense of what he said. ü§Ø
1334076710002810880 2020-12-02 18:07:28 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Have you ever had those moments where you feel insanely drowsy/fatigued out of nowhere and have to fight to stay awake?

1333751166690332674 2020-12-01 20:33:52 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Looks like The Rock vs. Brock Lesnar from Summerslam 2002 also had a different Match Card Graphic, advertising the match.  https://t.co/JzWIgKKkAc
1333734370759356417 2020-12-01 19:27:08 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @MaracleMan The rules involving rope breaks for anything outside of standard matches never make sense.
1333734127728795649 2020-12-01 19:26:10 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RezzananceTV I hate it when people behave like that. Just because they have a crush on someone that they‚Äôve discovered on the Internet doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre going to date that person. And then when their crush gets into a relationship, they have a meltdown.
1333733335894532098 2020-12-01 19:23:01 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Found out what the video being blocked was about. There was a 16 second clip in the video with the intro with the Wrestlemania 27 logo in it.
1333623489723572233 2020-12-01 12:06:32 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Lovely, going to have to wait until I get home to figure this one out.  https://t.co/vvqDwLBDIb

1333406484076646403 2020-11-30 21:44:13 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Leafy @TeamYouTube Their policies never make sense. They age-restricted a video of mine 1-2 months ago on a channel that was terminated back in April. Even after my biggest channel was taken down, I was still receiving emails nonstop for a month about the strikes I received.
1333052246532165641 2020-11-29 22:16:37 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> A match that saw Brock Lesnar DESTROY Jeff Hardy at Backlash 2002.  https://t.co/D7WTEJ0DV8

1332703467689959426 2020-11-28 23:10:41 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Donnachie11 Claims without evidence to back up what he says, it's pathetic. That shows that he doesn't care about his reputation at all, all he cares about is getting by in life with the least amount of effort possible and look where it has gotten him: Nowhere.
1332701703418875905 2020-11-28 23:03:41 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Donnachie11 He'd try to get hard from the site of this image alone.
1332692677268213762 2020-11-28 22:27:49 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> An incredible match from Over The Limit 2012, this was more fitting of closing the PPV rather than Cena/Laurinaitis.  https://t.co/7lW7DuZNNl

1332081239151550471 2020-11-27 05:58:10 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @AyeChangNaing Weird GIF choice there. o_O
1332079699728666624 2020-11-27 05:52:03 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @AyeChangNaing Everyone has their breaking point and I hit mine when I was went off on him this morning. There's only one person in this world I give money to that I trust and that's the very woman that saved my life last year.
1332078317764276224 2020-11-27 05:46:34 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @AyeChangNaing He was one of the only people I thought I'd never blow up at, but this was a long time coming. First I had that dude sexually harassing me for 6 months, now I had my bro just taking and taking. I was the only one that had his damn back, he even said so himself.
1332076881244549124 2020-11-27 05:40:51 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @AyeChangNaing I had that boy's back for 9 years. When his ex left him (not She Devil), I picked him up and got his head on straight. When She Devil ran off with his bail money in January, I still helped bail him out. All I've done is give for him, yet he never gave back.
1332075691010093056 2020-11-27 05:36:08 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @AyeChangNaing I lost count of how many times he kept saying that he wouldn't ask me for anymore money, but then kept doing so. I don't care what his situation is, I can't keep bailing him out. Already bailed him out of jail twice in 3 months and his recent record has some explaining to do.
1332074372325126146 2020-11-27 05:30:53 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @AyeChangNaing I doubt he will. He bugged me for 30 dollars the other day so he could make it to work and not get fired, saying he'd pay me back that afternoon. Days later, still nothing. I even told him that I feel like his white daddy, rather than a friend.
1332073335547695106 2020-11-27 05:26:46 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @AyeChangNaing The boy had the audacity to ask why I'm so mad at him. Has he forgotten what he has put me through since last year? I have every reason to be mad at him when all he does is ask me for money on a constant basis.
1332047234490306561 2020-11-27 03:43:03 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Two words: Low Blow.  https://t.co/yl8jRJ9HUg
1332001172790644736 2020-11-27 00:40:01 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @WickedWizardC I had my friend's back for the past 9 years, but the last year has drained me (mentally, emotionally, and financially). He said he'd pay me back the other day, never did. Had to bail him out of jail twice in 3 months, said he'd never ask for money again, kept doing it.
1331992704931270660 2020-11-27 00:06:22 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Donnachie11 I know, this one being someone who I thought was a bro to me for the past 9 years. Fucking went off on him today after he asked for money again after not paying me back last time, now he unfriended me on Snapchat.
1331990593254404099 2020-11-26 23:57:59 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Quite the Thanksgiving already. I think I've just lost my friendship with a specific someone who just asks and asks me for stuff, but never gives back on his end of the deal.
1331982910900023296 2020-11-26 23:27:27 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @AyoItsJojo10 Can I vote for myself on this one?

1331729814789779456 2020-11-26 06:41:44 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> WWE Fun Fact: Kofi Kingston's Win-Loss record on television in 2013 was 30-48.
1331647587384889344 2020-11-26 01:15:00 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> WWE Fun Fact: Dean Ambrose had his United States Championship put on the line 15 times (on television) during his lengthy reign from 2013 to 2014.
1331609508033032194 2020-11-25 22:43:41 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> An Elimination Chamber match that didn't happen as advertised. Dolph Ziggler would be removed and replaced by Big Show after being fired from Smackdown 2 days before the PPV.  https://t.co/ww02galLz4
1331558657407012867 2020-11-25 19:21:37 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @WAPW_Wrestling Thank frick.
1331510134087032834 2020-11-25 16:08:48 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Raise your hand if you identify as a workaholic.
1331508820326100992 2020-11-25 16:03:35 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @MDickieDotcom I‚Äôd invest money into it.
1331312325211660291 2020-11-25 03:02:47 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @WrestlingBios Get some rest man, you need it.
1331284209391067141 2020-11-25 01:11:04 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Just got a shiny Basculin in the Dyanamax Adventures, almost missed it because its shiny variation is barely noticeable.
1331249723378982914 2020-11-24 22:54:02 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I understand that there are filler feuds in wrestling, but this filler feud accomplished NOTHING in 2012. All we saw was the downfall of Zack Ryder.  https://t.co/xvBZMiNRmy

1330845222503329793 2020-11-23 20:06:41 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Thank fuck it‚Äôs only a 3-day work week this week.
1330550050213212165 2020-11-23 00:33:47 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The original match to take place from Survivor Series 2007 of Team Triple H vs. Team Umaga had 2 changes before the PPV. The WWE Tag Team Titles changed hands to Miz &amp; John Morrison, as well as Matt Hardy being taken out of the match due to knee issues.  https://t.co/qAePpSfkac

1330496223946682372 2020-11-22 20:59:53 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I apologize for cutting last night's stream so short, being up for over 24 hours straight made me start to really doze off and I just couldn't keep going under that physical state.
1330340365770043395 2020-11-22 10:40:34 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Robbie1Kenobi Seeing the angle he was getting into after this, I don‚Äôt think so. They wouldn‚Äôt have a love quadrilateral like that with the Intercontinental Championship thrown into it.
1330275458097836034 2020-11-22 06:22:39 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Donnachie11 And it lead to a forgettable match at Money in the Bank 2018, now they faceoff on Sunday at Survivor Series.  https://t.co/GC3oW1i3HL
1330269328181260289 2020-11-22 05:58:17 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @CutieStraw I've got mine on video, just haven't posted it on my gaming channel yet. I've even got some consoles that are duplicates, but are modded and have alternative models (like the 3 models of the Sega Genesis).
1330268631553495041 2020-11-22 05:55:31 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @CutieStraw Are you trying to compete with my collection? :P
1330260594742751238 2020-11-22 05:23:35 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Donnachie11 As well as the angle with Dolph, Lana, and Summer Rae. Oh and let's not forget, the League of Nations.
1330254051443879938 2020-11-22 04:57:35 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Back when Rusev was supposed to be in the Intercontinental Championship Elimination Chamber Match in 2015, but was taken out due to a foot injury 3 days before the PPV.  https://t.co/kd9rhqjQrs
1330222248779780097 2020-11-22 02:51:13 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @ArtCarterYT @YouTube Trust me man, I know. You just need to sit down and ask yourself if you have the desire to get up and fight. If so, then keep on going and dispute everything. Anybody who's anybody can fight against the mess that you're in.
1330221551380279303 2020-11-22 02:48:26 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @ArtCarterYT @YouTube Man, don't walk away. If you truly enjoy making content on YouTube, then fight everything that comes your way with everything you've got.
1330217373954166787 2020-11-22 02:31:50 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @ArtCarterYT @YouTube More proof of YouTube's broken system.
1330215015652134918 2020-11-22 02:22:28 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @ArtCarterYT @YouTube Same video for the same reason?
1330182940463161344 2020-11-22 00:15:01 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @ArtCarterYT @YouTube That's how YouTube is, it's broken. They claim that things are slow on their end due to COVID, yet they were quick to take my channels down back in April and quick to deny my appeals.  The site is more broken than Matt Hardy.
1330181370644140036 2020-11-22 00:08:46 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Bradware_ It looks like chocolate.
1330180399939670019 2020-11-22 00:04:55 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @ArtCarterYT @YouTube Thank goodness, I thought you were hit with a strike by a certain company just because of the subject matter.
1330159143504711681 2020-11-21 22:40:27 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @PaulMaphologela If the time is right, I'm in. Only thing that is a factor is my work schedule.
1330156852169076738 2020-11-21 22:31:21 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @PaulMaphologela @CMPunk And it shows that he's not really a bad guy, he's truly loyal to his friends. That act was one of the most remarkable things I've ever heard of.
1330155720910786560 2020-11-21 22:26:51 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @PaulMaphologela I know, he was so lucky to have CM Punk there by his side to save his house.
1330155052288315394 2020-11-21 22:24:12 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @PaulMaphologela And it took him a while to recover from not only the injuries, but the demons that came with those injuries.
1330154268951769094 2020-11-21 22:21:05 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @PaulMaphologela Might've been for the best due to Joey Mercury being advertised for this rematch and we all remember what happened to him at Armageddon 2006.
1330144598358941698 2020-11-21 21:42:39 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @PaulMaphologela I didn't know that it was the original plan until I tried looking for more match card graphics for the No Way Out 2007 PPV.
1330132664637067265 2020-11-21 20:55:14 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The original plan for the WWE Tag Team Championships at No Way Out 2007 was a rematch from Armageddon 2006. However, plans would change and the Tag Team Titles were defended against Deuce 'n Domino.  https://t.co/crry8Nhidb
1330125767292940289 2020-11-21 20:27:50 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @MDickieDotcom It's like when Chris Jericho and Randy Orton knocked JBL out of his chair at Armageddon 2007.
1330000116837720065 2020-11-21 12:08:32 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> So thanks to miscommunications at work, myself and 2 others showed up 2 hours earlier than we were supposed to tonight because nobody told us if we started at our normal time or the early time like we‚Äôve been doing all week.
1329853466181849096 2020-11-21 02:25:48 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The Boogeyman and Finlay were originally going to have a one-on-one match against each other at No Way Out 2007 until Little Bastard (Hornswoggle) and Lil Boogeyman were added in to make it a Tag Team Match.  https://t.co/SoAMSQZ58Q
1329781458752442369 2020-11-20 21:39:40 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Found 3 confirmed Match Card Graphics so far for Survivor Series, others either haven't come along yet or aren't fully confirmed matches.  https://t.co/74vbOOXcbM
1329766186284965888 2020-11-20 20:38:59 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The very night where the original Women's Championship was retired once and for all.  https://t.co/4ahPr1J9EI
1329700631171444736 2020-11-20 16:18:29 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @x_Beast17_x Not always when you look at how they‚Äôre booked. Not easy to take cowardly heel characters seriously as World Champions or if they lose a lot on random televised shows.

1329494847078748160 2020-11-20 02:40:47 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> "Grand Theft Auto fans are disappointed to hear that GTA Online's "biggest update ever", teasing a map expansion, is not GTA 6."  How the frick do people find a connection between a game update and the release of a new game?! Y'all are obsessed with GTA 6, it's not even funny.
1329479281265823752 2020-11-20 01:38:55 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Donnachie11 I wish I knew about battery replacements. My old Samsung Galaxy S5's battery drained like a bathtub, my iPhone 6S+ needed a backup battery, and my iPhone XR is draining a bit.
1329478330438049794 2020-11-20 01:35:09 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Donnachie11 I've got the iPod Touch 4th Gen, 5th Gen, and 6th Gen devices, never got the 7th Gen. Only my 4th Gen is a mess, as I dropped it at work and the screen got the cracks.
1329473927307988994 2020-11-20 01:17:39 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Donnachie11 It's a fine device, it has its own exclusive apps compared to an iPod Touch/iPhone device.
1329381534495805440 2020-11-19 19:10:31 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @The_Killswitch5 That channel has no limits on what shit it‚Äôll post.

1329082794857795588 2020-11-18 23:23:26 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Scam caller called back from a different number, I answered like the last time. "Sir, I was just talking to your wife on the phone."  A. My voice is too damn deep for you to think you were suckering in a woman.  B. There is no woman in my house, moron.
1329078015171588096 2020-11-18 23:04:26 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Well, looks like another Amazon scam caller wanted to talk. Video coming soon on that call.
1328878936361750528 2020-11-18 09:53:22 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @WrestleCritic I make it look good.  https://t.co/yOfxVLmb1A
1328878259627577347 2020-11-18 09:50:41 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Something suddenly arrived in the mail today.  https://t.co/aNmFRqtRyE
1328777602685939716 2020-11-18 03:10:42 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Well, got a response from Voov Media. Their email was in reference to my main channel and for whatever reason, they've withdrawn their offer of a working relationship because upon further review, my content isn't a good fit for their audience.  Lovely.
1328773536450801671 2020-11-18 02:54:33 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @vipregan I can't help it, I'm weird and I know it.
1328766739354619905 2020-11-18 02:27:32 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> That moment when someone yells at you for no reason on a bad day.  https://t.co/v12Y2bVbwh
1328760996110999557 2020-11-18 02:04:43 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RezzananceTV I don‚Äôt have hate for them, I‚Äôm just indifferent on the subject.
1328760360711696395 2020-11-18 02:02:11 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RezzananceTV Boobie streamers are "meh" in my book. :P  And I can't help it, I don't configure Twitter. D:
1328759727153684481 2020-11-18 01:59:40 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RezzananceTV Oh, no wonder. I didn't get it because I don't listen to Trump. :P

1328759346952548354 2020-11-18 01:58:10 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RezzananceTV For some reason, a quote appeared under your tweet that claimed that tweet was misleading for some reason (must be some odd update on this website).
1328759042379034627 2020-11-18 01:56:57 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RezzananceTV Where in the world did that circle saying, "Official sources stated that is false and misleading" under the tweet? That's factual in my book.
1328735226365956096 2020-11-18 00:22:19 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Adrianboy27 I'm not sure, I wouldn't know if any Sting videos are on YouTube due to the channel terminations and I don't search videos that often on Dailymotion to know about that site either.
1328725341993627648 2020-11-17 23:43:02 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Looks like WWE found time to update Chris Jericho's image for Wrestlemania 20 from what we saw on Heat before the PPV and what was shown during the PPV.  https://t.co/K5YA8ZojbK
1328699116453552129 2020-11-17 21:58:50 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Not a bad match from Backlash 2000, but the finish didn't feel right.  https://t.co/MdPHhYfA5o
1328610468055937026 2020-11-17 16:06:34 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @arye_abrahom Nobody cares, not going to stop people from doing it.
1328397372997726211 2020-11-17 01:59:48 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Dev2Dust Nope. I remember their Summerslam 2011 match more, but only because Sheamus got blasted through the barricade.  https://t.co/eY4pwgX7g1

1328316466718978048 2020-11-16 20:38:19 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Back when Big Show was first penciled in to take on Triple H on his own at Wrestlemania 2000/16.  https://t.co/wPxnraFXNm
1328218666190725120 2020-11-16 14:09:41 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @realDonaldTrump You couldn‚Äôt win a butt kicking contest against a one-legged man, accept your loss already.
1328041021129838592 2020-11-16 02:23:47 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @vipregan It's a mixed bag. Some have questions, other say they have no issues.
1328038375526436864 2020-11-16 02:13:17 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @vipregan I'm just waiting to hear back from them, not sure what channel of mine lead to them contacting me. I mean, a bit of money per month isn't a bad thing (since I can't earn YouTube ad revenue right now), but I'm not 100% sure just yet.
1328036601327390728 2020-11-16 02:06:14 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @vipregan I found one person on YouTube promoting it and saying she doesn't have any issues with them, even proving that she got ad revenue from their services.
1328019583517798401 2020-11-16 00:58:36 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @TommyWoolard That's why I've emailed them back, asking what channel they found since I've had a specific email address connected to my channels.
1327985566546325511 2020-11-15 22:43:26 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Has anybody else been contacted by Voov Media for some sort of working agreement? Just got one a few hours ago and I'm not sure on the validity of it. I'm on their website, but their email said they have 50 million+ Facebook followers despite their Facebook page not existing.
1327807823921762305 2020-11-15 10:57:09 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> WWE Fun Fact: The original plan for Billy Gunn at No Mercy 2000 involved him facing Eddie Guerrero for the IC Championship. However, Eddie wasn't cleared to compete before the PPV and the match was changed to Billy &amp; Chyna vs. Steven Richards &amp; Val Venis.
1327734031136518145 2020-11-15 06:03:55 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @WWEonFOX @undertaker Nobody, he has done more than enough for the company. He has nothing to prove by getting in the ring again, the Wrestlemania 36 match was the perfect ending.
1327692373086834689 2020-11-15 03:18:23 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Ah yes, when the Wrestlemania 35 main event had more than one change since it was first announced.  https://t.co/yeo4avEQHt
1327691917098938368 2020-11-15 03:16:35 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @AyeChangNaing The only symptom I've head of her having as of late was a fever.
1327645116773900293 2020-11-15 00:10:36 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> WWE Network Note: August 23, 1999 Raw is War. At 50:50 on that episode of Raw, The Rock cuts a promo after his match with Gangrel and the words "cow shit" are uncensored.
1327634159024697347 2020-11-14 23:27:04 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @TherealAmyWeber Don't let people try to get under your skin, people who choose to be toxic 100% of the time on this platform have their heads in the wrong places.

1327310532156809218 2020-11-14 02:01:05 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> A match that was honestly a letdown and only really memorable due to Randy Orton messing up his shoulder while pounding the ring canvas.  https://t.co/L9IrSlMfqb
1327273536881369088 2020-11-13 23:34:05 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Back when the original 6-Pack Challenge for Unforgiven 1999 had 2 different members to the match itself.  https://t.co/gh8qpNdk9i

1326873162693439490 2020-11-12 21:03:08 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Wasn't this feud started when Big Show stopped Snitsky from admiring Maria's feet backstage?  https://t.co/G7uD2V4FEE
1326851629900029952 2020-11-12 19:37:34 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Might have to return to certain roots once 2021 comes around.

1326602342419009543 2020-11-12 03:07:00 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @freep Good, now leave our state alone.
1326602195035443203 2020-11-12 03:06:25 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @EntropyProds CashApp is another easy alternative.
1326600539191259137 2020-11-12 02:59:50 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @FriendsWrestle And Emily is still in hiding.
1326589826087464961 2020-11-12 02:17:16 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Donnachie11 Just like the ECW brand in 2006. "Big Show is our ECW Champion and he's going to face talent from the other brands, rather than those from the ECW brand."
1326580208984608769 2020-11-12 01:39:03 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @FriendsWrestle It kills over 1 Americans every year!
1326505539262685184 2020-11-11 20:42:20 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The originally scheduled 6-Pack Challenge from Night of Champions 2009 included Big Show. However, he was taken out and replaced by Primo when he was announced that same night as Chris Jericho's mystery partner against Legacy.  https://t.co/Icyw773CGI
1326323871813939207 2020-11-11 08:40:27 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RandomPWthought I know, I‚Äôve learned that the hard way after pretty much getting scammed over the last month.
1326229025010888704 2020-11-11 02:23:34 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Dev2Dust Yeah, this was tough to sit through. Crowd hijacked the match and they just didn't click.
1326228640812720139 2020-11-11 02:22:02 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @zmanbrianzane We need to go back in time!
1326218920353738753 2020-11-11 01:43:25 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @WrestlingJebus That Chavo Guerrero did an interview with WWE Magazine about details with the Benoit incident, despite the fact that they were erasing Benoit from history following the incident.
1326218594372431873 2020-11-11 01:42:07 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @wrestlelamia Better than the short-lived trophy concept from the Bragging Rights PPV.
1326205722431025153 2020-11-11 00:50:58 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Well, seems like my trip to the police station yesterday about what I needed to discuss brought back a grim revelation. I should've known that I was being scammed over the last month, someone has some explaining to do.
1326202243738185728 2020-11-11 00:37:09 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The original plan for TLC 2012 until CM Punk had to undergo knee surgery, still happened after he was brought back sooner than he honestly should have been brought back.  https://t.co/lwDQaJrm5O
1326158880527806465 2020-11-10 21:44:50 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @VeeInfuso @zmanbrianzane Yes it is.  https://t.co/htwkMu9aHb

1325803774959624194 2020-11-09 22:13:46 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Yeah, this match was totally useful in 2006.  https://t.co/f6qOT97d7j

1325051521273372673 2020-11-07 20:24:35 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Dear App Store, if your ads that tell people to download games that will win you real money don't say in the ad what game they're promoting, I'm not going to download the fucking app.

1324780827012726784 2020-11-07 02:28:57 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @DanielsGameplay And Kane being added made sense, since he was already the #1 contender to the World Heavyweight Championship.  https://t.co/1KDqR0Xw2q
1324773077687902208 2020-11-07 01:58:09 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Weird to think that this was the original plan for The Great American Bash 2007 until a pec injury caused Edge to vacate the World Heavyweight Championship.  https://t.co/u5bexxltGO

1323995839363252224 2020-11-04 22:29:41 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Donnachie11 Probably due to the booking of the angle. The Alliance was rarely booked to look like a threat to the WWF and adding Shane and Stephanie to the mix made it less about Alliance vs. WWF and more of Vince vs. Shane and Stephanie.

1323944294386982913 2020-11-04 19:04:52 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Inside_TheRopes @RealMickFoley So far, in terms of mainstream names, Rhyno.
1323943784061767680 2020-11-04 19:02:50 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @MaracleMan Big Show turned 6 times between face and heel in his first year and a half in the WWE.
1323943501529272321 2020-11-04 19:01:43 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @GoodMicWork I wish I was Canadian.

1323624006969425920 2020-11-03 21:52:09 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Jon_Kage_ I haven't seen shiny Vulpix yet, still got a good amount of Charmander from its Community Day event.
1323471613975793664 2020-11-03 11:46:36 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Touchdown!  https://t.co/LBRPVDe3p5
1323338267736068098 2020-11-03 02:56:44 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @CodyRayy119 Better than the Ladder match they had the night after Unforgiven 2000, which saw the original mid-air Spear by Edge to Jeff Hardy (before it became famously known at Wrestlemania 17).
1323337195994972168 2020-11-03 02:52:28 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> One of, if not the best match, the WWF/WWE produced in 1999.  https://t.co/6N1BwMRR6H
1323327667312025600 2020-11-03 02:14:36 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @callumburgess14 I've got to record it first, it's one of the many videos I've jotted notes down for but haven't recorded yet. I still have to edit the video I recorded in 2016 that's on my computer right now.
1323320402869919744 2020-11-03 01:45:44 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @KEEMSTAR I don't really follow Nelk, but that's really messed up.
1323304695243415553 2020-11-03 00:43:19 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Went through a LOT of my old notebooks here in my room, found a lot of notes I took for video ideas and reviews that I had made videos of on the original TheDoubleZTV channel. One of them even includes a Wrestlemania 11 review that I haven't recorded.
1323261750339342337 2020-11-02 21:52:40 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Sablelicious1 I hope so, things have been so messed up over the last year and especially the last few weeks.
1323196571903733761 2020-11-02 17:33:41 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> If I‚Äôm feeling up to it, I‚Äôll stream Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare this Saturday night and Perfect Dark next week.
1322985953338773504 2020-11-02 03:36:45 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> JUST GOT A FREAKING SHINY TAPU KOKO IN DYNAMAX ADVENTURES!
1322968865706573824 2020-11-02 02:28:51 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Napkin_Nexter Or at least ones where it's possible to get matches, rather than feeling alone.
1322967697878142977 2020-11-02 02:24:13 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Napkin_Nexter The website/service is a complete waste. Rarely ever had any conversations with real women (if I did, they didn't last long), lost count of how many bots I came across.

1322958527548264448 2020-11-02 01:47:47 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @ringsidenews_ Bastion Booger.
1322948680203292673 2020-11-02 01:08:39 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @WrestlingBios Lost his smile the night he was supposed to compete against Sycho Sid, who was proclaiming he'd unveil a new finisher in the match.  https://t.co/xUP9gvVBPB
1322931909278736385 2020-11-02 00:02:00 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Finally got rid of my POF account, wasted almost 2 years with that platform. Like I said on my vlog channel folks, the POF service is not worth it.
1322922182004133889 2020-11-01 23:23:21 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Anyone else feel that this match is underappreciated?  https://t.co/GjGyy492Rl
1322740164364566531 2020-11-01 11:20:05 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @bigthreefan441 I've still got a listing of my sale of the first Wrestlemania 15 re-released DVDs.
1322681867129290757 2020-11-01 07:28:26 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Sorry everyone, I have no energy to get a stream done tonight. Either because it's been a long day due to work or because of sleep deprivation. Also, my anxiety is acting up due to serious ongoing financial issues at the moment.  If you wish to help with that, please let me know.
1322602689574903811 2020-11-01 02:13:48 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Thank you to whoever has that DNS Server set in the DS/3DS for Pokemon in Gen 5, already got a couple of shiny Legendary Pokemon thanks to that.
1322536506913923072 2020-10-31 21:50:49 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The night where Jeff Jarrett got his hair cut.  https://t.co/SWBVu26jBc
1322421740690153473 2020-10-31 14:14:47 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Due to my financial situation, I‚Äôm having to withdraw from my Patreon pledges for the time being.
1322404934449532929 2020-10-31 13:08:00 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RezzananceTV That‚Äôs the way the Internet is, it‚Äôs full of people who don‚Äôt know what they want.
1322371404587827201 2020-10-31 10:54:45 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs phony.  https://t.co/QPkNG5rpRo
1322211508126945282 2020-10-31 00:19:23 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> After going through shows between 1997 and 1999, I've got my Match Cards folder up to 2,663 Match Card Graphics. Matches that happened, some that didn't/were changed, and some that had alternative graphics in WWE.
1322174658200952833 2020-10-30 21:52:57 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The night where the King of Europe was dethroned.  https://t.co/tOGdoxy6Eh
1322130843033313282 2020-10-30 18:58:51 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Another Friday night at work, fuck me.
1321887167967338496 2020-10-30 02:50:34 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Weird to see Billy Gunn's image for his advertised match from King of the Ring 1999, despite not being Tag Team Champion at the time of the PPV.  https://t.co/CuyUmLKcHV
1321883300911341571 2020-10-30 02:35:12 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RealPaladin1991 As well as this?  https://t.co/QupkVsm3KZ
1321882931141464070 2020-10-30 02:33:44 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RealPaladin1991 Was this one fake?  https://t.co/xmQOrdg6XC
1321881952056651777 2020-10-30 02:29:51 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Yeah, this match from Wrestlemania 15 was forgettable.  https://t.co/LW5A7zyPQm
1321869492348198913 2020-10-30 01:40:20 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RezzananceTV Yeah, but they're ones that I can't repeat outloud.
1321857169164275712 2020-10-30 00:51:22 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Just got a shiny Polteageist in the Dyanamax Adventures for Pokemon Sword, but it's Phony Form. Damn, heartbreaking right there. At least I can say that I got 2 shiny Pokemon in one day.
1321815545080143879 2020-10-29 22:05:58 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @ZahneYT Hope you feel better man.
1321815480970235905 2020-10-29 22:05:43 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> MY FIRST LEGENDARY SHINY!!! Shiny Suicune on screen!!!  https://t.co/rB1VYt9qSW
1321780515666595840 2020-10-29 19:46:47 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The original plan was supposed to be Ahmed Johnson vs. Faarooq at Summerslam 1996 for the IC Championship, but Ahmed's kidney issues cancelled those plans.  https://t.co/IIUaPrZDmw
1321774624368152576 2020-10-29 19:23:22 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @we_are_stardom I‚Äôm not arriving anywhere.
1321774509402267649 2020-10-29 19:22:55 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Fitz2016Matt Saved yourself over 10 grand there.
1321773854709157888 2020-10-29 19:20:18 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @WrestleCritic It was too soon when he got his first shot. WWE backed themselves into a corner with the booking of his match with CM Punk at Hell in a Cell 2012.

1321452746973859840 2020-10-28 22:04:20 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The match that couldn't happen due to Brian Pillman's sudden passing 23 years ago this very month.  https://t.co/4Icp8BiWk0
1321434538820730880 2020-10-28 20:51:59 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Before Undertaker squared off against Vader at In Your House: Canadian Stampede, he was originally scheduled to face Ahmed Johnson instead. However, a knee injury caused those plans to change.  https://t.co/GLiOaYi8pD
1321413254103683072 2020-10-28 19:27:25 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Why have I never heard of the old WWF show, Blast Off?
1321388582989344768 2020-10-28 17:49:23 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @TheElitistonYT That honestly is a great feeling moment. Becky‚Äôs announcement and getting embraced by Asuka was a touching thing to see during times like these.
1321388222522494977 2020-10-28 17:47:57 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Any Nintendo DS games that I should play on the gaming channel?
1321159781470638083 2020-10-28 02:40:12 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @AaronOrion At least he has a goal going forward, which is a great sign.
1320956031439089664 2020-10-27 13:10:34 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @ringsidenews_ No, let that dream go. It‚Äôs been 6 years, it‚Äôs time to let the man live his life the way he wants to live it.
1320955771761364993 2020-10-27 13:09:32 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @TubbyEmu Thank you TTE.
1320955664840216578 2020-10-27 13:09:07 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @mareea_rose I think so. I‚Äôm still friends with 3 or 4 of mine.
1320911253926236160 2020-10-27 10:12:38 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Wow, that recent like truly is surprising. Thank you Dixie.  https://t.co/fu26VES8j8
1320592783632158720 2020-10-26 13:07:09 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> It‚Äôs been exactly one year now since my life turned upside down. I lost the one person that never stopped showing me love and support in my life, which still hurts. I love you grandma, nothing has been the same without you. #RIPGrandma  https://t.co/NhBtpkJC5v
1320437971598876673 2020-10-26 02:51:59 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @GilmourINC The dating services have become a waste, I‚Äôve only been on them for 2 reasons: Recommendation and convenience due to my work schedule.
1320436159504359424 2020-10-26 02:44:47 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @GilmourINC I‚Äôve tried 12 different services in the last 2 years, nothing works. Already going to ditch POF/POS in a week.
1320404629574868993 2020-10-26 00:39:30 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> eHarmoney profile: Deleted. Honestly, that service feels like a waste.

1320342833853759495 2020-10-25 20:33:57 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I just realized something a moment ago in the form of a question: How many fucking tag teams has R-Truth been in during his time with WWE?!!
1320324331617005568 2020-10-25 19:20:25 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @crazyseandx You're welcome. Just remember, Keldeo is shiny locked.
1320225477215354881 2020-10-25 12:47:37 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @crazyseandx Cook the correct type of curry through Pokemon Camp, it'll then lead to the appearance of Keldeo.
1320117829140611073 2020-10-25 05:39:51 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Midnight EST on the gaming channel.  https://t.co/Nm2dIaOXFd
1320112695534866442 2020-10-25 05:19:27 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @crazyseandx I‚Äôm still hunting for a shiny legendary. Found Kangaskhan along the way so far.
1320030670404653058 2020-10-24 23:53:31 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @girloncinema I'll check that out shortly, title easily has my attention there.
1320030118660722693 2020-10-24 23:51:19 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> New channel banner has been set on my main channel, good symbolism behind it.   https://t.co/YT0uEcTVYO
1320006204324761601 2020-10-24 22:16:18 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Well, shoot.  https://t.co/PMSRQm4N9r
1319997506617511937 2020-10-24 21:41:44 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> It‚Äôs been exactly one year since my grandmother was admitted to the hospital for double pneumonia, passing away 2 days later. I love and miss you grandma, wish you were still here.
1319898177236094976 2020-10-24 15:07:02 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @MikkoMaestro You mean from the exact same scripture/plaque that's found in Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time?
1319841444706832385 2020-10-24 11:21:36 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @WWENetwork Classic. I understand the red representing the color of Hell, but the concept/design of the original being an extension of a mesh Steel Cage makes the original color more fitting.
1319840772515090432 2020-10-24 11:18:56 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Looks like I came into work for nothing tonight, hilarious.
1319698070607679490 2020-10-24 01:51:53 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Taking part in Pokemon Sword's Crown of Tundra Dynamax Adventures system, just took out Chansey with one Dynamicpunch from a Machoke!
1319684846092943360 2020-10-24 00:59:20 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Glad I could put this one together. :P  https://t.co/VcqsnagO7r
1319638776977784832 2020-10-23 21:56:16 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @UlyssesPerry I'm positive that a paper bag will help me.
1319638248847794176 2020-10-23 21:54:10 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @UlyssesPerry Only way I can make myself better is if I put a paper bag on my head. :P
1319591821442506752 2020-10-23 18:49:41 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I‚Äôm not sexy and I know it.  https://t.co/h5yiZStq7x
1319579639673749504 2020-10-23 18:01:17 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @90sWrestlingPod Yeah, that happened to me earlier when I tried to just retweet the insane backflip that Ricochet retweeted of himself.
1319563644334723073 2020-10-23 16:57:43 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Wow!
1319516393218449409 2020-10-23 13:49:58 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I guess YouTube is on a new practice to find a video to age-restrict on the vlog channel everyday. Not going to stop me from putting the words ‚ÄúFuck You‚Äù in certain video titles.
1319486757897932801 2020-10-23 11:52:12 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Going to be changing my main channel‚Äôs banner in the near future, thought of a good idea for how I want the next one to look.
1319453161271267328 2020-10-23 09:38:42 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @LiamFromYouTube Yep, it has been sold and shipped.
1319326126192381953 2020-10-23 01:13:55 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Johntopaz2017 And the odd thing I've seen is that the only channel that has still posted during this time consistently is ORTON IS GOD. I don't get how his channel is still up, while everyone else has been getting wiped out.
1319324931717394433 2020-10-23 01:09:10 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Johntopaz2017 And now, it's all exclusive to Dailymotion.
1319305317193310208 2020-10-22 23:51:13 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Adrianboy27 They fell out of love with posting after this whole debacle took place. Just wondering how long until MSE ruins the fun once again.
1319304850048487425 2020-10-22 23:49:22 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> To anyone asking, no. I will not be making another DoubleZWWE YouTube channel as long as MarkScan Enforcement is tearing the website apart. I know BOD22 and AttitudePOP have returned, but I can't afford to lose another channel without my sanity going out the window.
1319302574605033472 2020-10-22 23:40:19 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Adrianboy27 I've heard, I talked to BOD the other day about it and I know why they're back to uploading.
1319296165482008576 2020-10-22 23:14:51 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Adrianboy27 Thank you good sir. I'd easily make a new DoubleZWWE channel if there was a guarantee that MarkScan Enforcement would permanently stay away, but their reign on YouTube is making myself and others fear for our channels going forward.
1319288686731644935 2020-10-22 22:45:08 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Goodbye IC Championship Commemorative Belt.
1319251466008354817 2020-10-22 20:17:14 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @foreverslime_x They‚Äôll find any reason to affect videos.
1319250431403560961 2020-10-22 20:13:07 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @foreverslime_x They did the same thing to my video on Windows 10, which is pretty funny.
1319246370474233857 2020-10-22 19:56:59 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Just saw a piece of paper on the kitchen table and realized what it was. My grandmother kept a piece of paper that I wrote the names of 1st Gen Pokemon on about 20 years ago. I honestly can't believe she kept that after all of this time.
1319176537741119488 2020-10-22 15:19:30 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @AyeChangNaing I guess.
1319175763166482434 2020-10-22 15:16:25 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @AyeChangNaing Try what out?

1319172788255625217 2020-10-22 15:04:36 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @AyeChangNaing That‚Äôs one odd description of doing that.  https://t.co/Y1jPbpq3N3
1319148707112169472 2020-10-22 13:28:55 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @AyeChangNaing I‚Äôll have to set that up, I never knew how that worked.
1319146148175687680 2020-10-22 13:18:44 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @AyeChangNaing I forgot about that feature, I‚Äôve never used it before.
1319143603705446401 2020-10-22 13:08:38 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @AyeChangNaing Only other thing I have that I know works is Venmo.
1319143005253754880 2020-10-22 13:06:15 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @AyeChangNaing Yeah. I‚Äôm trying to get the shipping and label charge covered for one of my eBay items that sold yesterday.
1319107060685037568 2020-10-22 10:43:25 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Anybody got 20 dollars that they can send my way? I can pay it back on Friday.
1318977739244843008 2020-10-22 02:09:33 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @LEGACY_2014 I always have my videos under that setting. The only positive thing about that is the underage fanboys of those channels that my videos are on can't come after me.
1318977163673128963 2020-10-22 02:07:15 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RAEraPodcast And 1999 was a close second.
1318947254456254464 2020-10-22 00:08:24 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @fOriRoAm_sONcEk The one time I've heard someone bring religion into play that irked me was from that show, The 700 Club. Someone told them they were injured from a broken bone and they told the person that "God is healing that". I think the body's ability to heal itself is more logical.
1318943205140946944 2020-10-21 23:52:19 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @fOriRoAm_sONcEk That's why I'm glad that I'm an Atheist. I don't have strict beliefs or force anything onto others. My rules are 2 simple things: Don't force beliefs on others and just live life without breaking the law.

1317470444564500480 2020-10-17 22:20:06 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @DickVanKlondike Yeah, totally legit. Everyone gets caught in the shower with their clothes on.

1317420331099967488 2020-10-17 19:00:58 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @BrokenBlackYT Working third shift hasn't done my life any favors. Only been in 2 relationships since I started at my job 7 years ago (been on 3rd shift the entire time) and both fell apart due to this schedule. Not easy to keep things stable when your schedule is the opposite of others.
1317388897526185984 2020-10-17 16:56:03 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> It‚Äôs now been exactly 4 years since my last relationship ended. She couldn‚Äôt handle being with someone who works 3rd shift and it‚Äôs something that has been a thorn in my side ever since.

1317257537293529091 2020-10-17 08:14:05 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RealPaladin1991 To give Big Show a random reason to turn heel.

1317187200145084421 2020-10-17 03:34:35 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> ANOTHER "Apple Support" call, these scam callers don't know when to quit.
1317181244828979201 2020-10-17 03:10:55 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> We've gotten at least 2 or 3 "Apple Support" calls already today, this is getting ridiculous. Already screamed at 2 of them to get a real job.

1316477158555082752 2020-10-15 04:33:08 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Pretty good main event of King of the Ring 2001, I primarily remember it for the lackluster finish and Booker T driving Stone Cold through the announce table.  https://t.co/ZQCZA38PYp
1316450371007639555 2020-10-15 02:46:41 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RezzananceTV That's how the Internet gets, they'll look past someone's actions as long as they find the individual entertaining.

1316213027692216320 2020-10-14 11:03:34 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @crazyseandx The Mexican Wave, that whole act where the crowd does the big wave around the arena when they‚Äôre bored like a chain effect. Same thing that was done during the Orton/Sheamus match the night after Wrestlemania 29.
1316065413424447489 2020-10-14 01:17:00 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Is this match remembered for anything other than the fans doing the Mexican Wave during the encounter?  https://t.co/x4eDbwsYqC
1315999153076531201 2020-10-13 20:53:42 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @fOriRoAm_sONcEk Same here. 4 events in 5 years have brought me down surrounding this month and it‚Äôs not fun.
1315996906401738753 2020-10-13 20:44:47 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @fOriRoAm_sONcEk I‚Äôve found something bad happening every October since 2016 (excluding 2018 unless my memory is slipping a bit), so the curse lives on in my eyes.
1315955823412117509 2020-10-13 18:01:32 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> It seems like this month truly is cursed.

1315741071255764992 2020-10-13 03:48:11 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> One POSITIVE thing about New Day splitting up: We don't need to keep seeing more matches between them and The Usos.

1314906584452038656 2020-10-10 20:32:14 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I legit don‚Äôt know what to stream tonight.
1314763504432427010 2020-10-10 11:03:41 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> How in the frick have I survived today with only 3 hours of sleep?

1314705497598177282 2020-10-10 07:13:11 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Kind of weird to see two different versions of the match graphic for Daniel Bryan vs. Sheamus at Wrestlemania 28.  https://t.co/rzTAr2WESQ

1314664657853054978 2020-10-10 04:30:54 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Napkin_Nexter I'm lucky if I can get much time to sit for lunch.
1314662156449783813 2020-10-10 04:20:57 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Napkin_Nexter Stood up for most of the 8+ hour shift recently, only sat down for 3 minutes and they were when I went to the bathroom during one of my breaks.
1314618183874117634 2020-10-10 01:26:14 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Good Lord, how many match graphics out there have the same old Photoshop job with the World Heavyweight Championship?  https://t.co/Af9bF4awFv

1314589383119511559 2020-10-09 23:31:47 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @mckenzieas93V2 The only WWE programming you could watch if you wanted a break from Michael Cole was Superstars, which nobody watched.
1314589126268784646 2020-10-09 23:30:46 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @HmoodWrestling And to think, it was on this exact day where he competed against Batista in his final PPV match.
1314588850296172545 2020-10-09 23:29:40 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I‚Äôm going to get rid of my POF account on November 1, 2020. That service isn‚Äôt worth it one bit, just like I said in my video on my vlogging channel.

1314195419665174528 2020-10-08 21:26:19 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @fOr_i_RoAm We're hundreds of years past that period of time, yet people still haven't learned how to grow and accept others for idiotic reasons. This isn't the 1700s anymore, this isn't the 1950s anymore.
1314192679195086859 2020-10-08 21:15:25 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @fOr_i_RoAm I wonder if either her mom was under the influence a lot during pregnancy or if her mom didn't smack her hard enough to beat some sense into her.

1314174654664278016 2020-10-08 20:03:48 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> This is the kind of woman who resorts to going to the family reunion, hoping to find a man.

1314131983505731584 2020-10-08 17:14:14 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @MaracleMan I can confirm this.
1314102337263337472 2020-10-08 15:16:26 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @ISMASTYLES11 That‚Äôs just being done to take the piss out of the nonstop ‚ÄúCM PUNK RETURN TO WWE‚Äù clickbait videos.

1313945164721926152 2020-10-08 04:51:53 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @ISMASTYLES11 Can't argue with those ratings, might rate his in-ring rating a bit higher.
1313944028128448512 2020-10-08 04:47:22 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @OKayFabe I'd create one from scratch, buy all the specific parts and put it together. Helps you get a general understanding of how to put one together and be able to replace parts in case of an upgrade. That's how I've got my 2 desktop PCs here in my office.
1313942846928494600 2020-10-08 04:42:41 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Rumors going around about WWE possibly taking the MITB contract off Otis, that's honestly a mistake. Only reason someone should have the briefcase taken away is if they're injured/suspended, don't do that to Otis. Have him cash-in, either successfully or not.
1313905377357049857 2020-10-08 02:13:47 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @ThisPeterxx I was wondering who in WWE was in need of a Wellness Policy test.

1313881665949835267 2020-10-08 00:39:34 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The original plans saw King Booker vs. Lashley and Batista vs. Finlay at No Mercy 2006 before they were combined into a Fatal 4-Way. I kind of wonder how those two matches would've been if they were kept separately from each other, rather than combined.  https://t.co/lWRUKuNd6q

1313522695733161986 2020-10-07 00:53:09 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Donnachie11 The crowd was weird that night. They did the Mexican Wave during JBL/Undertaker and booed Edge that night, despite being in his hometown of Toronto.
1313506624913526798 2020-10-06 23:49:17 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @LiamFromYouTube Which doesn't make sense, they had images of him with the belt in past match graphics.  https://t.co/FKMQFVR2Z4
1313503585636945921 2020-10-06 23:37:13 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> This really was a great main event to Summerslam 2004.  https://t.co/Pk8IXoviYV

1313137892886228992 2020-10-05 23:24:05 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> An awesome Hell in a Cell match, but the fact that Foley was brought back for one more match at Wrestlemania 2000 despite the retirement stipulation kind of took the wind out of this match when I look back on it.  https://t.co/3nxXFt9lqI
1313071481937637378 2020-10-05 19:00:11 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @LiamFromYouTube So in other words, content nobody wants to see from him on top of his current content.

1312386710010036230 2020-10-03 21:39:09 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The 3rd or 4th best one-on-one match between CM Punk and John Cena over the years.  https://t.co/7EOZ5kUKwo
1312370525717630976 2020-10-03 20:34:50 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @LiamFromYouTube Yeah, that was a while ago. Lost my response video to it when I lost my channel in April.
1312204342972178435 2020-10-03 09:34:29 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Wouldn't it be cool if the Dishonored games were to be released on the Nintendo Switch? I'd be thrilled if that happened.

1312035034732298241 2020-10-02 22:21:43 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @WAPW_Wrestling Not much of an improvement, especially if someone back in the day wanted to play the Sega Nomad on a plane ride.
1312034746856288256 2020-10-02 22:20:34 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @LiamFromYouTube It's the Sega Nomad, which is pretty much a portable version of the Sega Genesis.
1312034236958990344 2020-10-02 22:18:33 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @WAPW_Wrestling That's why portable consoles are better when they're either played through an outlet or have a rechargeable battery, like the Game Boy Advance SP.

1310561834353790976 2020-09-28 20:47:45 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> One of the biggest letdowns in Wrestlemania history. The rule about the WWE Championship being able to change hands via DQ or Count Out really hurt this match. Hard to tell a story with such an intense build with limitations like that.  https://t.co/QTYe81FCXg

1310245955111997440 2020-09-27 23:52:33 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @crazyseandx That was the following year (Royal Family vs. Clowns R Us). This was supposed to be Hart Family vs. Jerry Lawler and His Knights, but Shawn Michaels took Lawler's spot due to certain legal allegations that came about Lawler before the PPV.

1309881470559948807 2020-09-26 23:44:13 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I'm at a toss-up here. Should I play GTA Online or Super Mario Sunshine tonight in the live stream?

1307790755193401345 2020-09-21 05:16:28 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Final update from #PokemonGo: Ended today's event with a total of 23 captured shiny Porygon, only failed 1 encounter due to the game locking up on me.
1307771807525728257 2020-09-21 04:01:10 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I don't feel human, 19 shiny Porygon caught today in #PokemonGo!
1307766600515321856 2020-09-21 03:40:29 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @070guy 16 so far for me.
1307751682713976833 2020-09-21 02:41:12 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @LiamFromYouTube The very Pokemon involved in the anime's controversial episode that sent a lot of children in Japan to the hospital due to rapidly flashing colored lights. Just look up the info on the episode, "Electric Soldier Porygon".
1307750456391806980 2020-09-21 02:36:20 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Already caught 13 of the 14 shiny Porygon I've come across today on #PokemonGo, holy cow.
1307703442517962759 2020-09-20 23:29:31 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> 2 shiny Porygon caught so far in #PokemonGo, not stopping now!
1307681757790167040 2020-09-20 22:03:21 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Donnachie11 In terms of one-on-one matches (not counting the Gauntlet match from the September 28, 2009 Raw), this was their 11th televised singles match against each other.
1307677586420641792 2020-09-20 21:46:46 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> If there hadn't been the stipulation of John Laurinaitis' job being on the line, there would've been no real interest in this match.  https://t.co/k2EIS3udvP
1307535963090976768 2020-09-20 12:24:01 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Dylanmmoore1994 My only guess would be due to the stripper's ass being visible in the thumbnail (despite her having underwear on). Now I had to censor that part out in the new thumbnail.
1307534926942818305 2020-09-20 12:19:54 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Lovely, my ‚ÄúPARTY LIKE A ROCKSTAR - Grand Theft Auto Online‚Äù video‚Äôs thumbnail got removed.  https://t.co/Me9FXkmNF7
1307486665909383169 2020-09-20 09:08:07 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @davidbix Here's the screenshot mentioned earlier of their deleted tweet. They're supposed to be an anti-piracy organization, yet they tweeted a link to a third party website that let you download episodes of an Indian TV show for free. Sounds like a site they should be AGAINST.  https://t.co/koMt24YKAi
1307481371603075072 2020-09-20 08:47:05 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @davidbix I've got an entire folder on my Google Drive account, which has a lot of screenshots of everything I've documented since this drama with MSE began. Including a tweet where they promoted a site that let you download a show from India for free, which was CLEARLY piracy.
1307480661272473602 2020-09-20 08:44:16 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @davidbix I've personally emailed them 4 times since April, as that was when I lost my channels because of MSE, asking about the strikes given by them. I received 22 strikes from them on my DoubleZWWE channel, so I reached out to them. To this day, they've never emailed me back.
1307479664827473921 2020-09-20 08:40:18 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @davidbix About the lack of response from MSE or about the strikes that WWE issued themselves in 2012?
1307479127512043522 2020-09-20 08:38:10 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @davidbix And how do we know there's really any working relationship there when MSE doesn't even answer emails, asking about their actions?
1307479020792147969 2020-09-20 08:37:44 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @davidbix That's what I've said. When they were on a mass copyright strike spree in September 2012, every strike/takedown was done by WWE themselves and not some third party company. Why would they hire a company at the same time that they're trying to save money by releasing talent?
1307470392924266496 2020-09-20 08:03:27 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @mccusker86 Ricky Steamboat (if former wrestlers are counted).
1307336893693071360 2020-09-19 23:12:59 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Not as good as the first Elimination Chamber match, ending really felt anti-climatic after seeing Goldberg's domination throughout this match.  https://t.co/XNohd7phU4
1307308512511512577 2020-09-19 21:20:12 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @WAPW_Wrestling I‚Äôve got to get the Super Mario game as soon as I can, I‚Äôm going to get lost in Super Mario Sunshine.
1307301662378336257 2020-09-19 20:52:59 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Barely beat Walrein on my own with time to spare.  https://t.co/BtG8lKynDW
1307116099566215174 2020-09-19 08:35:37 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @pinkoIogy And this is why Twitter isn‚Äôt fun. As soon as someone is announced to debut or return to a company, someone has to come along and find some way to bring negativity to the subject at hand. Last time, it was Miro getting negativity, now Melina.
1307114727382888449 2020-09-19 08:30:10 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Walk_With_Joe He took inspiration from Randy Orton.
1307035407696171009 2020-09-19 03:14:59 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I'm going to do my best to forget that this match ever happened.  https://t.co/tO9EFs35Ff

1307004572192452609 2020-09-19 01:12:27 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @TheElitistonYT Definitely 1995. Terrible shows, awful booking, poorly thought out characters, and no reason to get invested in the product at that time.
1306999844217794560 2020-09-19 00:53:40 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Found 2 unboxing videos from last year on an SD card, so those shall be coming soon.
1306973089616494592 2020-09-18 23:07:21 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Phone call.  Caller: Is this State Farm?  Me: No.  I'm not Jake.
1306949807974633473 2020-09-18 21:34:50 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Poijz I got mine a bit ago, used my spare Master Ball on it.

1306734530443784193 2020-09-18 07:19:24 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @KrisZellner @RWH1978 @Monsoon_Classic Interesting! And one thing I even realized lately as well. WWE released talent/employees this year for financial reasons. Would they really hire a third party company to take videos down for them during a time where they're trying to work on finances during this pandemic?
1306733325839630347 2020-09-18 07:14:37 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @KrisZellner @RWH1978 @Monsoon_Classic So he got a strike by WWE themselves, rather than MarkScan Enforcement?
1306728323721166850 2020-09-18 06:54:44 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @KrisZellner @RWH1978 @Monsoon_Classic Wait, what do you mean?
1306715041446744065 2020-09-18 06:01:58 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RWH1978 @KrisZellner @Monsoon_Classic All I know is that nothing has made sense since April. MSE caused me to receive a combined total of 22 strikes once everything was said and done, so it feels more like someone's goal was to ensure my channel's termination.
1306653568775204864 2020-09-18 01:57:41 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @KrisZellner @Monsoon_Classic And to prove their hypocrisy: This deleted tweet. They're supposed to be an anti-piracy organization, yet they tweeted a link to a third party site that lets you download a show from India for free, which is CLEARLY piracy right there.  https://t.co/jZqzrgO6Pm
1306650946043342848 2020-09-18 01:47:16 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @KrisZellner @Monsoon_Classic That's what I've been saying. I lost 4 channels between August 2012 and February 2013 and all strikes were issued by WWE themselves, that was when they were striking EVERYTHING like a lightning storm.
1306649951015968769 2020-09-18 01:43:19 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @KrisZellner @Monsoon_Classic Nobody honestly knows if they really have one, since they've been silent about all of this. I lost 3 channels in April connected to this mess and I've emailed them 4 times for answers, yet they never responded.
1306649501491486720 2020-09-18 01:41:32 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @KrisZellner @Monsoon_Classic It's some anti-piracy company from India, a company that has been running rough shot all over YouTube this year and has been taking down MANY channels that have posted WWE content.
1306641471957864448 2020-09-18 01:09:37 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Today's scheduled posting of That Wrestling Club December 2016 Unboxing is pushed to tomorrow, got a video coming today to the main channel regarding Monsoon Classic's sudden takedown by MSE. And an article will be included regarding this sham of a company.
1306636211071660035 2020-09-18 00:48:43 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @TheConstableTLJ @JoeMashups @JANELABABY They've been on a rampage since around April. Lost DoubleZWWE in April and my two personal channels the next day due to YouTube's rules, which I still question. They don't even reply to emails when asked about this whole debacle. Then again, they are hypocritical.
1306635743293583364 2020-09-18 00:46:51 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @kingrozzi @JoeMashups @mikeVSphilly @JANELABABY @Monsoon_Classic @zmanbrianzane WWE still gets revenue if their content is found in a video, no matter what. If someone does a review of a WWE show and enough footage is used in that review to be detected through YouTube's Content ID system, WWE will earn ad revenue. It's all about policies and Content ID.
1306630455509291009 2020-09-18 00:25:51 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Monsoon_Classic Are you freaking kidding me?! Another one gone because of that company?!
1306592014817992705 2020-09-17 21:53:06 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Whenever I watch this match, I keep remembering Jericho's match at Royal Rumble earlier that year due to 2 spots being repeated: Suicide Dive countered with a chair and the Walls of Jericho on a ladder.  https://t.co/di0Tl9wcN9

1305571242389495809 2020-09-15 02:16:55 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RealPaladin1991 With my insomnia, I doubt that.

1305210776827957251 2020-09-14 02:24:33 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> 415 Charmander eggs hatched, still nothing. Come on you lizard, be shiny!
1305162564582739969 2020-09-13 23:12:58 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> This honestly shouldn't have happened the way it happened.  https://t.co/lBHWhz2YFR
1305024702298173442 2020-09-13 14:05:09 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> 280 eggs hatched, still no shiny Charmander. Maybe I'll have better luck in the morning.

1304806300350545920 2020-09-12 23:37:18 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @BrokenBlackYT *waiting for my life to get cancelled by MSE*
1304805986788614149 2020-09-12 23:36:04 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @BrokenBlackYT Put it on a shirt!
1304805599423725568 2020-09-12 23:34:31 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @BrokenBlackYT We could get a strike for anything because MSE won't back off. They're attacking on YouTube, as well as here on Twitter. We're walking on eggshells with anything that we do.
1304804908982468608 2020-09-12 23:31:47 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @BrokenBlackYT I only use AE when I'm doing personally customized intros, lost count of how many I've had set aside for now, yet I've rarely opened AE as well.
1304804593440903168 2020-09-12 23:30:31 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @BrokenBlackYT I've barely even opened my editing software at all since April. I've even got podcast topics written down, yet I'm not motivated to record for them.
1304804129806651392 2020-09-12 23:28:41 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @BrokenBlackYT The one I lost to MSE happened during Wrestlemania 36 Night Two, right around the time of Orton/Edge beginning. All of this garbage has made it hard to stay motivated.
1304803348592422916 2020-09-12 23:25:35 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @BrokenBlackYT I've lost 7 channels overall since 2012, starting over is aggravating. 4 from WWE, 1 from MSE, and 2 from YouTube's dumb rule regarding that loss to MSE.
1304802875118419969 2020-09-12 23:23:42 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @BrokenBlackYT Imagine having to start over on one after losing your original one after almost 8 years of existence.
1304768289009291270 2020-09-12 21:06:16 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> My channel‚Äôs Impressions stats, quite the drop there.  https://t.co/eLKLNCXFSx
1304752229061218304 2020-09-12 20:02:27 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @maskedbabyface It‚Äôs an annoying cry for attention. Both on here and on Facebook get so annoying.
1304468261006868481 2020-09-12 01:14:03 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @_JTwoH If memory serves me right, it either has something to do with an impact with a trash can or the steel steps.
1304467124845412354 2020-09-12 01:09:33 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @_JTwoH One eye, this is why we need a fawking edit feature for tweets.
1304461047798079492 2020-09-12 00:45:24 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The night where Shawn Michaels started having a problem with one.  https://t.co/0m2qZuCwBC
1304414972915732480 2020-09-11 21:42:19 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @stylopz And filing a counter-notice doesn't work either. YouTube wouldn't forward my counter-notices (my reason was stated that I believed the strikes were made in error) because I don't own the footage, so everyone is left up a creek without a paddle. Lost 3 channels in 2 days from it.
1304414234621739008 2020-09-11 21:39:23 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @stylopz Myself and many others have been trying to figure all of this out for months. Once they took me down, it became a domino effect. If they're really working with WWE, then why won't they answer emails to inform people of that? Instead, it's just the freaking silent treatment.
1304413653895196672 2020-09-11 21:37:04 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @stylopz I wish I knew. This company even proved their hypocrisy. They're supposed to be against copyright infringement, yet a tweet from May that they posted was promoting a 3rd party site where people could download a TV show from India for free.
1304413222049640449 2020-09-11 21:35:21 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @stylopz When myself and others lost their channels in the Fall of 2012, all strikes were issued by WWE. This company popped up out of nowhere and started wreaking havoc like they're looking for their child in a crowded mall. My channel was taken down with a total of 22 strikes from MSE.
1304411702948134914 2020-09-11 21:29:19 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @stylopz But that still doesn't make sense. WWE had no problem striking every video they could find in 2012 on their own.
1304409023731597312 2020-09-11 21:18:40 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @stylopz And channels (like mine) that posted WWE matches and segments were wiped out too. The company doesn't even reply to emails regarding any of this mayhem.
1304407295846162432 2020-09-11 21:11:48 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @stylopz Ah, that explains it. I thought we had another channel taken down due to MarkScan Enforcement due to everything that has happened on YouTube since April.
1304395323062792193 2020-09-11 20:24:14 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Fuck, just remembered what yesterday was. Yesterday was 3 years since I last heard from Deanna...September 10, 2017, that day will forever be etched into my brain.
1304392626880290816 2020-09-11 20:13:31 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @stylopz Was it because of MarkScan Enforcement?
1304246092461215744 2020-09-11 10:31:14 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> 230 eggs hatched, still no shiny Charmander. Cross my fingers that the luck comes back tomorrow.
1304085425309593600 2020-09-10 23:52:48 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Second shiny in one day. First Nidoran male, now my second shiny Treecko. #PokemonGo #PokemonGoShiny  https://t.co/3Wc3jPl8NL
1304043700406890501 2020-09-10 21:07:00 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Killswitch_2 We all are, we can't do anything without the fear of that company creeping up to kick us all off the Internet. What kind of company gets this abusive and acts like they can dictate how the Internet functions? Last I checked, SOPA isn't around.
1304043125934100485 2020-09-10 21:04:43 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> If you post wrestling videos/clips here on Twitter, might want to delete them. I've heard from a reliable source here that MarkScan Enforcement has taken videos down through a DMCA Takedown Notice here on Twitter.
1304017550934716418 2020-09-10 19:23:06 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> The shiny luck is back, shiny Nidoran male! #PokemonGo #PokemonGoShiny  https://t.co/SH7HMb6Dwl

1303826416174276610 2020-09-10 06:43:36 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Robbie1Kenobi That segment was better than expected.
1303757133985599493 2020-09-10 02:08:18 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @SuperRetroTBR @wbpictures First they attack on YouTube, now on Twitter?!
1303751573504512000 2020-09-10 01:46:12 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> 179 Charmander eggs hatched, still no shiny Charmander to be seen yet.

1303392479484485632 2020-09-09 01:59:17 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> 56 eggs hatched so far, no shiny Charmander. Cross my fingers that a shiny one hatches soon with the Solar Power Hidden Ability.
1303335252975329285 2020-09-08 22:11:53 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I don't remember much of this match, but it did have the same finish of the Steel Cage match between X-Pac and Chris Jericho at No Mercy 2000.  https://t.co/poL7a5XtT7

1302608945329188865 2020-09-06 22:05:48 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> After all of this time waiting, I FINALLY got a shiny Scyther in Pokemon Sword and Shield!  https://t.co/Tv4ATrQQp8

1302396473523535873 2020-09-06 08:01:31 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @RandomPWthought No, I just got home after having dinner at my mom's new house and I don't really follow AEW all that much.
1302396176906493953 2020-09-06 08:00:20 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Due to AEW's PPV tonight, I'll delay tonight's stream to tomorrow night instead.
1302354276279349248 2020-09-06 05:13:50 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I remember when we first visited this house when it was on the market almost 15 years ago, crazy to think it‚Äôs about to belong to someone else.  https://t.co/xDeFkpNTgl
1302337148964818944 2020-09-06 04:05:47 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> At the old house, mom is finally selling it. Not sure if I can go in to take photos of it for the last time.

1302253425170710528 2020-09-05 22:33:05 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Well, this match didn't go over well in 2001.  https://t.co/AhTRKKLjkV
1302088593582759937 2020-09-05 11:38:07 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> I'm 412% sure that anyone who posts videos on YouTube that's recorded with Bandicam in 2020 need psychological help.

1301580533483343873 2020-09-04 01:59:16 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @nikoexxtra Is JD happy about ANYTHING involving wrestling anymore? Is there anything that brings legit joy to him that happens in the world of wrestling? This overwhelming negativity isn't doing him any good.

1301387167395196928 2020-09-03 13:10:53 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @Taylorr1114 Least favorite wrestling match that you‚Äôve seen on tv?

1301192700818055169 2020-09-03 00:18:09 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Jason Sensation's impression of Shawn Michaels was so good that it's scary.  https://t.co/h0vOCq24LE
1301182063702401024 2020-09-02 23:35:53 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @crazyseandx Yes (reference to what Shawn Michaels said during the match after eliminating Mike Knox very easily in the start of the match).
1301181692179296263 2020-09-02 23:34:24 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @dubyacbub It leaves one show on a cliffhanger and gives you something huge to look forward to in the following week's episode. That's a great thing to do to build up interest in the future.
1301156178689482752 2020-09-02 21:53:01 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> Only one question comes to mind with this match: Who was that guy?  https://t.co/oK40ljta8T

1300750769323466752 2020-09-01 19:02:04 +0800 <TheDoubleZTV> @ItsStillRealBro He‚Äôs overly negative, honestly. I admire his passion for wrestling, but it feels like nothing pleases him at this point. When is he not yelling about something or blocking someone for having a different opinion?
