1342746124201979905 2020-12-26 16:16:37 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @JArquire Right there with you, Blue - especially this time of year is hard, and I know you're having to cope with your surgery coming up, but you aren't alone. I hope you have some better days ahead. It's so courageous of you to talk about how you really feel. It helps me manage, too.
1342721285030293504 2020-12-26 14:37:55 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @fearnoMAGAt I'm so sorry. I know it feels completely overwhelming right now. You are a good person, and you can get through this - I know, because it's happened to me, nobody expects it and nobody deserves it. But I promise you, things will get better. Just breathe, for right now.

Somehow, you have to believe that this pain won't last forever, that you are strong enough to bear this grief. I am sorry that you're having to part with your dog, at this same time. My heart goes out to you. Hold on.
1318990525362483201 2020-10-22 03:00:21 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @ArmsControlWonk Actually, it is correct to say 'who' stood in my way. Sorry about the thesis.

1316639289749516289 2020-10-15 15:17:23 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @JeffFlake Mr. Flake, as you sit there at home with your A+ pension plan and life-long healthcare for you and your family provided by we the taxpayers, I want you to know that your opinion is completely worthless.

He needs to reimburse the Treasury for this and all others he has probably billed to us. GRIFTER!!

1311131486691749888 2020-09-30 10:31:20 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @gildy61 @AynRandPaulRyan When Trump keeps butting in, talking over, and taking the time away from Joe because he is such a bully -- CUT HIS G.D. MIC WHEN TRUMP DOES THIS!! CHRIS YOU NEED TO GET THIS THING UNDER CONTROL BECAUSE TRUMP IS BEING ALLOWED TO BE A TOTAL SHIT!!!
1310823236725334016 2020-09-29 14:06:28 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @TheWarMonitor Former husband used the program "smokestoppers" offered by local hospital - took 5 days of nightly meetings &amp; daily follow-through - stopped his 20 yr. habit - in 1981, and he's still Smoke-Free!! It guarantees that you quit or you can take course again at N/C. It works!
1310113119763673088 2020-09-27 15:04:43 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @JemisonJaclyn My deepest sympathy to you - I'm so sorry you're having to experience this terrible loss. Do you have family or friends who can be with you at this time?  I'll be thinking of you, and praying that God will give you strength and courage during this difficult time.

1309832102062456835 2020-09-26 20:28:03 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @RexChapman @yugtahtmai I would have reacted the exact same way as he did, I mean, Really, folks!! I hear some big crashing sounds around my front door in the middle of the night?? Nothing like the sound of rackin' back my 12 ga. as I'm coming down the hall --- Po-po went wild...
1309830107373207552 2020-09-26 20:20:07 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @yugtahtmai @TTChilders Thank you for this recommendation!! I am so happy to have found this young man! He sings country 'The old way'!

I have been so furious about that sow tearing out everything that was beautiful, as well as a legacy from all the previous Ladies - if It can't be done by Exec. Order, I will start a GoFundMe and WE THE PEOPLE WILL FIX IT! (SOW!!)
1309813693144858624 2020-09-26 19:14:54 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @ladyjh3535 @grandmagrit And while we're at it, can anybody tell me what's going on w/ her EYES?? Has she had the whole way they're set in the sockets completely revamped and set back in there at an ANGLE, going dorsolaterally?? The eyes don't normally point up on an angle, or is it just mine??  üé™

1309770920748363776 2020-09-26 16:24:56 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @tateroutofhere I never thought about relocating until he was elected, and if he's installed in the office again, I don't know what we're going to do. I am getting a passport and looking into Germany- if they'll even be letting us in. But I'm getting mentally overwhelmed --üò∂üò∑üôÑüë©üèª‚Äçüé§

Only a rich-selfish -assh*le totally indifferent to the original old and unreplicable homes next door would DESTROY THE PERIOD HOUSE THAT WAS PROBABLY FINE TO TAKE ON AS A RESTORATION - and stuffs this monstrosity into the small lot!

1309680840696385538 2020-09-26 10:26:59 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @morethanmySLE @DougJones Senator @DougJones, I am so grateful and proud to see all the good works and principled decisions that you've made, in the Senate so far! I am donating (again) to your campaign even though I now live in Okla. I want to get a T-shirt!! Any left?? Well worth the $60.00 donation!!
1309643320180838401 2020-09-26 07:57:54 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @rvnewton53 @BetteMidler I've started being unable to sleep - currently am at 3 days of just getting through it - my mind refuses to shut off, I am just so worried about the possibility that we will be unable to get him out of office -if he doesn't accept  results of the election, if he loses.
1309640836666318848 2020-09-26 07:48:02 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @JaneMella01 @BetteMidler I thought I was going to fall to the floor when I heard that she had passed - and I've never fainted in my life. I was absolutely devastated and It felt as though she was a personal loss for me. I have so much grief over this. As you said:  GOD HELP US.    and SAVE US FROM EVIL.
1309382748952461312 2020-09-25 14:42:29 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @NaplesLeslie How lovely of you! Thank you so very much for this unexpected donation!  I hope you can get in touch directly with the Pound Hounds group from theirTwitter posts, and get the process completed. I am honored! And I'll send them some $ to help out, too. Blessings to you!
1309353760829964288 2020-09-25 12:47:17 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @138HybridStreet I'm so sorry for the loss of your Dad. Please know that there are many here on Twitter who are thinking of you and holding you in supportive prayers. I know how grief can just collapse you, and all I can offer is from my experience - it does ease, it will get better. Hold On.

1309313412577583109 2020-09-25 10:06:58 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> JESUS H. CHRIST.  I have never seen any of the armed home-grown terror groups up close and this experience was absolutely shocking to see. The meanness &amp; contempt shown by both JimTom and thsting-to-the-teeth PoPo man is -   I don't know what to even say. TY for posting this.
1309301812147695616 2020-09-25 09:20:52 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> It looks to me as though he has "Keratitis Sica," or "Dry Eye." His tear production is not sufficient to keep the surface of his eyes moist enough to protect it - so he starts forming excessive amounts of mucus to try to moisten the surface. Just a guess, w/out exam.

I bookmarked this Tweet so I can look at it anytime I feel  overwhelmed by 2020 - I hope you will do a replica photo every year on Gritty's birthday!!

1309190563460190210 2020-09-25 01:58:48 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @FeralFreaky I want a patch!! Where can I get one? This is awesome!
1309151828379131911 2020-09-24 23:24:53 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @waltshaub I haven't been able to sleep for the past two days, and am so keyed up about the ongoing events/possible Trump Coup going to happen - I may make 72 hours at this rate. I have tried to remain calm, but I was raised to believe in democracy, and they offered CIVICS CLASSES back then
1309112043367288834 2020-09-24 20:46:47 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @PRINZESKIM Thank you from the bottom of my heart for this affirmation today, I appreciate you so much for helping me feel better during this time - I am going to say your words every day and receive this blessing! Please, pray for me?  Blessings to you!

1308996781963960325 2020-09-24 13:08:47 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @kathrynw5 @what a BULLSHIT article!! Who asked your opinion about Mr. Biden' s schedule adherence - we have people getting beat up or shot down like dogs in the streets AND THIS IS WHAT YOU THINK IS IMPORTANT TO MENTION?? Are you kidding me??! JFC!!

1308935196473987073 2020-09-24 09:04:04 +0800 <JaneSepmeier> @kingminotaurs @ElkeHollings @ericgarland Oh. Well, I see you're right! I take back my agreement on a "Flat Tax!"  How can we ever get laws that will force these wealthy people to pay taxes in proportion to their absolutely exorbitant/unneeded amounts of money?  It is NOT RIGHT! I remember when tax rate = 70+%!

So don't feel like you're alone. I don't know what we're going to face if he's re-elected.
