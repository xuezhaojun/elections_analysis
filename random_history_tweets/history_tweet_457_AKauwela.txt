1341679087060807680 2020-12-23 17:36:36 +0800 <AKauwela> I thought I was going to bed early,, then I looked at my 150 year old clock and thought it was wrong again.  It's seriously alrdy 1:35am.

1341564077949165568 2020-12-23 09:59:35 +0800 <AKauwela> @KATUNews Such a complete fuck. Fuck him all the hell.
1341563788001067008 2020-12-23 09:58:26 +0800 <AKauwela> Any ideas of what to get a 16 year old girl that loves everything but hates everything and hates people and yeah

1341455617517449218 2020-12-23 02:48:36 +0800 <AKauwela> @FunPolls19 How about your USPS Driver?  The houses that leave bottled water and snacks are a godsend sometimes.
1341453375368392705 2020-12-23 02:39:42 +0800 <AKauwela> If you still don't know how to spell at the age of 32, are you really an "adult"? 🙄
1341287321979691008 2020-12-22 15:39:52 +0800 <AKauwela> Piggle &amp; Azikia (Iziykea is how D2 wanted it spelled) live in the bathtub now. Like many cats before them. I want them to be together bc they love each other, and have for the last 6 of her 7 years. I wish I knew what happened to her. Dammit. Poor kitty.
1341286019358806017 2020-12-22 15:34:41 +0800 <AKauwela> @FunPolls19 So sad. It's not like we'll be alive to see the next one 😅

1341247308986347520 2020-12-22 13:00:52 +0800 <AKauwela> @peteetchou Does it have a root system?
1341218527068344320 2020-12-22 11:06:30 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali No. Her kidneys show too much damage. Our only option is to treat her 24-hrs a day, or put her to sleep. The 1 bill today was over 500$, and we're poor, so I can't afford more 😞
1341185998370140161 2020-12-22 08:57:14 +0800 <AKauwela> @SawyerHackett @pdxali Oh, I'm sorry I didn't tag @SenJoniErnst.  B!tch

1341167089814360064 2020-12-22 07:42:06 +0800 <AKauwela> She's in the bathtub w her husband Piggle bc he should be w his dying wife 😭 She's drinking alot, so that's good I guess.
1341142458273472512 2020-12-22 06:04:13 +0800 <AKauwela> This bill was $500, and I can't afford that for multiple days to sustain her.. Breaks my god damn heart.
1341142203314257920 2020-12-22 06:03:13 +0800 <AKauwela> Fuck.  We're going to put her to sleep.
1341134318135988224 2020-12-22 05:31:53 +0800 <AKauwela> Her kidney levels came back off the charts... Looks like she got into antifreeze
1341119007345164288 2020-12-22 04:31:02 +0800 <AKauwela> She's extremely hypothermic, extremely dehydrated, and has broken teeth😭  Unltrasound looks good, no internal trauma. Waiting for blood work.  She has to be transfered to a 24-hour emergency vet hospital.  AZIKIA WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN??? 😭
1341103321361174528 2020-12-22 03:28:42 +0800 <AKauwela> D2 found her this morning drenched inside one of their houses and she looks like death ☹️Dropping her at my neighbor friends vet rn.. She is NOT herself  https://t.co/OWzfiy4J2S
1341103306567897088 2020-12-22 03:28:39 +0800 <AKauwela> So Azikia isn't well. I'm not sure what happened, but Saturday morning when I got home she was meowing w extreme alert and didn't act normal. I picked her up w a towel to see if she was hurt, but couldn't find anything. Since I was gone all day yesterday...? Idk.
1341015138447417344 2020-12-21 21:38:18 +0800 <AKauwela> Ok. So 21 ? hours away from home. I wish I didn't have to work. Came home to our tree decorated, and my girls had made cookies..  Brownie points if you see what I see  https://t.co/KGgQaBsM94

1340919102869626880 2020-12-21 15:16:41 +0800 <AKauwela> Oh, and if I didn't make that clear,,, I haven't been home since this morning. Rolling into work w my rain-hair, bloodshot eyes, and muddy boots.

1340918102452625410 2020-12-21 15:12:43 +0800 <AKauwela> What a shit ass day. I've been awake since 7:40am, and won't be able to sleep until about 10am tomorrow. BUT I CAN'T SLEEP BC IT'S ALMOST FING CHRISTMAS So,, that's what..  26 hours awake. And that's after 3h of sleep this morning after work last night/this morning. Fuck you life
1340884118851207168 2020-12-21 12:57:41 +0800 <AKauwela> Not even close to doing Christmas shopping I haven't even been able to decorate the tree haven't been able to think about making cookies for friends this year and I got one day off this week and that's Tuesday
1340883987854667776 2020-12-21 12:57:09 +0800 <AKauwela> It looks like I am pulling a 48-hour work shift because I'm working a double tonight into tomorrow until about 9 and I've been delivering parcels since 8 this morning not even close to being done so I'm going to be going directly from post office turn my first job this F sucks

1340440772747751426 2020-12-20 07:35:59 +0800 <AKauwela> I'm baffled as what to get D3 for Christmas. She's so difficult to shop for. She likes everything, but nothing, and needs nothing.
1340440329393033219 2020-12-20 07:34:13 +0800 <AKauwela> @WashCoScanner @peteetchou I dislike that jetty! Always feels weird when I've walked it. Not to mention all of the tombstones.

1340136278868729856 2020-12-19 11:26:02 +0800 <AKauwela> @PollInTheField I typically go against jumping on bandwagons. Seems like such a cultish thing to do.

1339075983530291200 2020-12-16 13:12:47 +0800 <AKauwela> Will I take $50 for something listed at $100 that's literally worth over $200?  No.
1338890137137160192 2020-12-16 00:54:18 +0800 <AKauwela> @AEO do you sell any Jersey Knit Constructed face masks for WOMEN? I've only found them for MEN on your website.

1338882871252041728 2020-12-16 00:25:26 +0800 <AKauwela> Placed an online / store pick-up order @target last night and now they (&amp; surrounding areas) are out of the toilet paper we use, so I guess that means we'll keep using separated paper towels for a while! 🤣🙄😩
1338811671272275969 2020-12-15 19:42:31 +0800 <AKauwela> @FunToVote Didn't even know abt it. But it's raining.
1338811047080128513 2020-12-15 19:40:02 +0800 <AKauwela> Apparently sleeping all night last night and missing my 2 work shifts made it OK to stay up all night tonight when I DON'T HAVE TO WORK.

1338526625294532609 2020-12-15 00:49:50 +0800 <AKauwela> So you know that lady I have to work with every other Sunday? The one who's not nice that I hate to work with?  Her cancer returned. And it's in her brain. 😔
1338525659367292928 2020-12-15 00:46:00 +0800 <AKauwela> @DrBiden So basically, they're saying they support ALL  non-medical doctorates being removed, right? EVEN FOR THE MEN ...? Ok🤨
1338519091665981444 2020-12-15 00:19:54 +0800 <AKauwela> That's 9 hours of unpaid time 😢
1338516222279700489 2020-12-15 00:08:30 +0800 <AKauwela> Well. THAT didn't go well. I slept all the way until right now - I missed BOTH of my shifts.
1338343351674793985 2020-12-14 12:41:34 +0800 <AKauwela> Anyway. I have to be back at Job 1 in less than 3 hours for a 9 hour shift 😭  So, I've been awake since Saturday at 3pm-5am, 8am-9pm tonight🤞🏼, and then hopefully so earlier than 10:40pm tonight, unless 10am TOMORROW 😭
1338343350831759360 2020-12-14 12:41:34 +0800 <AKauwela> Just got home. 12 hours of delivering Amazon for USPS. Four of which were in the DARK. People! Turn on some damn lights so we can see your house &amp; get some damn numbers up!
1338058454292828161 2020-12-13 17:49:30 +0800 <AKauwela> @sarcasmbully @fractal74 I would totally get microchipped! If I got taken (or esp any of my children!) I would want (them) to be found!

He needs to tell her F off until she can figure out what she wants. She's going to break him &amp; turn him into an assh*le.

1337823448089808901 2020-12-13 02:15:40 +0800 <AKauwela> @fractal74 I do 3 of those, so maybe I'm OK 😅
1337814613803462657 2020-12-13 01:40:33 +0800 <AKauwela> Third daughter is the most selfish child I've ever known. And she has absolutely no empathy.  How did that happen??
1337727176200732672 2020-12-12 19:53:07 +0800 <AKauwela> 30m break before my next 5 hr shift 😴  And everything that I ate in November caught up w me. Nothing fits 😳 I miss all the exercise I used to get here. I was so f*ing fit!

1337586925301972997 2020-12-12 10:35:48 +0800 <AKauwela> @FunToVote I had no idea. My parents had Toyotas 70s-current and the old ones never had it. I've had &amp; driven 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s cars/trucks, and none of them had it either.

1336970283974967298 2020-12-10 17:45:30 +0800 <AKauwela> @imkwazy42 Could be either the CBU parcel boxes were full, or the pkg was oversize. Other than that, it could also be bc the carrier was swamped. If they left a notice, usually there's an option to have it re-delivered.
1336881042435702785 2020-12-10 11:50:53 +0800 <AKauwela> @litewaitdad @amazon 😅Maybe? 🤷🏻‍♀️ We think they aren't reporting them or something.

Yes we were both wearing masks. No, they DIDN'T SEE US bc the area we were in DOESN'T HAVE SECURITY CAMERAS.  https://t.co/oVVdEnjA3h

1336382954545659906 2020-12-09 02:51:39 +0800 <AKauwela> I wish my stupid Motorola had a better camera 🙄  https://t.co/Oa9PBGordQ
1336377269091102721 2020-12-09 02:29:04 +0800 <AKauwela> @SpaceX @Space_Station How'd you like to be on the airplane who took that footage 😮  😉
1336376505102790656 2020-12-09 02:26:02 +0800 <AKauwela> Srsly what IS this sh!t?!! 😂
1336375926343417856 2020-12-09 02:23:44 +0800 <AKauwela> @jilevin @Katiohead @nuzzel I thought initially it was an apology about Alabama being a racist state.
1336375031463510016 2020-12-09 02:20:10 +0800 <AKauwela> @realDonaldTrump You really need to take a long walk off a short pier.
1336361273915633664 2020-12-09 01:25:30 +0800 <AKauwela> @peteetchou Awww😣 Dammit.  I'm sure mine aren't nearly as bad as yours, but mine stick around w this weather, I think I'm getting used to them and sneezing and itchy throat/ears.
1336358339999977473 2020-12-09 01:13:51 +0800 <AKauwela> @fox12oregon It needs a new name 😅 Bc "Break Dancing" is SO 1982!! 🤣🤣🤣
1336242639662825472 2020-12-08 17:34:06 +0800 <AKauwela> @peteetchou Lol, but they need a car 😁 D2 has been saving up and was abt to take driving lessons when Covid hit.
1336240798761771011 2020-12-08 17:26:47 +0800 <AKauwela> @peteetchou It's causing so much drama in our house rn 😣 Full on discussions. But D2 went to D3 and told her she could have it... W o talking to me first! And she's the one who wanted to discuss it as a family.
1336240285483814915 2020-12-08 17:24:44 +0800 <AKauwela> @peteetchou D2 feels weird abt taking such a huge gift,, bc she's just like that. She doesn't feel right abt it, even though the car's only worth like 1600$.
1336240047826194440 2020-12-08 17:23:48 +0800 <AKauwela> @peteetchou Oh they know. My dad's wife asked if any of them drive, D3 said she has her permit, and that sisters do public transportation (bc they do). They just want the car to be gone and not have to sell it before they both move.
1336236893625708545 2020-12-08 17:11:16 +0800 <AKauwela> For instance,, if my late father-in-law had given my twins a car - It would be THEIR car bc they are HIS grandchildren. If D3's grandfather gave D3 a car - It would be HER car bc she is HIS grandchild. But this is coming from MY dad, and I have THREE daughters.
1336236150730547201 2020-12-08 17:08:19 +0800 <AKauwela> I really really really wish I had a Significant Other to discuss matters with. Someone to have my back. Someone to be an adult with. No one takes me seriously, and I have no say, and no weight in regards to major issues!
1336234205898964995 2020-12-08 17:00:35 +0800 <AKauwela> So much drama in my house right now!!
1336217202865795074 2020-12-08 15:53:01 +0800 <AKauwela> Will I take $30 for an item listed for $125?  Fuck you. No.  I swear people just msg me to F w me.
1336199995981066241 2020-12-08 14:44:39 +0800 <AKauwela> @Katiohead I had a bunch of people stop yesterday when I put LLV front wheel into the ditch and was stuck for an hour 😅 They were way more concerned abt it than I was.
1336199314025037824 2020-12-08 14:41:56 +0800 <AKauwela> @FunToVote It's a mandate.. Everyone wears masks in public
1336156833606582272 2020-12-08 11:53:08 +0800 <AKauwela> But then I'm thinking - I have THREE daughters. They are ALL his grandchildren. Why her? Just bc she has her permit? D2 wants a car. She's saving up for one.
1336131611071410178 2020-12-08 10:12:54 +0800 <AKauwela> @comicsandsdaily @GeorgeTakei Srsly. Bc what if you were switched at birth BY YOUR OWN PARENT(S)?? 😳
1336130307779485698 2020-12-08 10:07:44 +0800 <AKauwela> So apparently my mom talked to my my dad (estranged) 's wife today. He's going to Assisted Living bc he apparently had a stroke in September. Which is weird bc my mom told me a cple wks ago that she talked to him. Anyway, he's giving his car to D3. But *SHHH* don't tell anyone.
1336100764683358208 2020-12-08 08:10:20 +0800 <AKauwela> @Katiohead YES! I CAN'T MAKE THAT WORD BIG ENOUGH!! It's just so damn RUDE!
1336086178215292929 2020-12-08 07:12:22 +0800 <AKauwela> Helpful hint - If your store is out of the Christmas stuff you want - Go back every day. Walk the surrounding isles,, guaranteed you'll find what you're looking for 😂  https://t.co/4a691FZeGX

1336048613445648384 2020-12-08 04:43:06 +0800 <AKauwela> @RawStory Nope. Definitely not.
1336048392758149121 2020-12-08 04:42:14 +0800 <AKauwela> @Xfinity Love it! Even before I looked it up to verify, and heard the voice, Supertramp has a VERY significant sound. #NameThatBandin4Notes
1336033559526588417 2020-12-08 03:43:17 +0800 <AKauwela> 🤣 Because it IS #Supertramp!!  https://t.co/j8RspN0nua
1336029119570579457 2020-12-08 03:25:38 +0800 <AKauwela> Why does it sound like #Supertramp on the new @Xfinity Christmas commercial? 😅🎅🏻🤶
1336013212077060097 2020-12-08 02:22:26 +0800 <AKauwela> @NBCNightlyNews Prices though?

1336012421312344066 2020-12-08 02:19:17 +0800 <AKauwela> @KATUNews Let the small red towns open their schools if they don't give a sh!t. The larger cities can follow the guidelines to keep everyone safe. Parent who are worn out should SUCK IT THE F UP and shut their piehole.
1336011721559822338 2020-12-08 02:16:30 +0800 <AKauwela> @GeorgeTakei I think you've been posting this for several years now.  Seen it.

1336009260199624704 2020-12-08 02:06:44 +0800 <AKauwela> @Katiohead 🤔 Money to pay living expenses is super tight ; Waking up / Coming home from work &amp; children have destroyed my clean house ; Side double gate won't close bc it's not built correctly ; Have done/don't have $ for Xmas gifts ; Too much stuff in my house that's not mine😖
1336007711096406017 2020-12-08 02:00:34 +0800 <AKauwela> Slept right through my work shift. 8pm-9am SOLID SLEEP.  That puts my next paycheck (my living expenses) at a disadvantage 😏
1336007319298031617 2020-12-08 01:59:01 +0800 <AKauwela> @DevinFauxCalf @nmeyersohn @cookiesinheaven Dried fruit, nuts, jerky, etc,, all too expensive. Makes me mad when I'm out and want something HEALTHY vs something I can afford.

1334906675384340482 2020-12-05 01:05:27 +0800 <AKauwela> @DameDurdin @darlakrusee @pdxali Inside? Outside yes,, new paint for the strip mall, but Joann itself inside,,, nada.
1334906436820684801 2020-12-05 01:04:30 +0800 <AKauwela> @darlakrusee @DameDurdin @pdxali Gotcha. Yeah, South Hillsboro or whatever it's called, is closer to Aloha / Reedville area,, where TVHwy Fred Meyer, Regal Cinema, Century HS, and the Goodwill outlet is. Plenty of room for retail to grow around there. Esplanade is closer to downtown Hillsboro. No more free land.

1334850391654068225 2020-12-04 21:21:48 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali @DameDurdin That Joann (Fabricland) location hasn't changed since the 90s. I'm not sure when the Esplanade was built, but it was there when I moved over here in 1991. They've never updated the interior, like, at ALL. I'm surprised it's survived.

1334214577542729731 2020-12-03 03:15:18 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali Exactly - thought I'd butt in and ask for you bc I thought that was the obviously situation dilemma
1334211954601193472 2020-12-03 03:04:53 +0800 <AKauwela> @AmazonHelp @pdxali But what if it was a GIFT and you don't know who it came from?
1334211854302801920 2020-12-03 03:04:29 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali @amazon @Chewy Definitely slipped out the bottom of the box. We find them under the belts all the time.

1334072122935627776 2020-12-02 17:49:14 +0800 <AKauwela> I am SO TIRED of sneezing my nose off. I have never sneezed so hard, continuously, in my life as I have the last few weeks. THIS WEATHER SUUUUUCKS. My face ears nose eyes throat itches, and Jesus Lord,,, did I mention the sneezing?? 😩😵🤧😖😣😤 Rx = crap👎🏼
1334070296127541248 2020-12-02 17:41:59 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali @amazon @Chewy Does the product box have a yellow or red sticker, or a round "inspected" sticker? That = warehouse / discounted product.
1334069274894209025 2020-12-02 17:37:55 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali @amazon @Chewy What warehouse did it go thru? It could have had a gift receipt and been lost if the og box was damaged. We can't reprint receipts and have no idea if there was one attached to the order. Receipts also go thru the folds and fall out.
1334068514722758656 2020-12-02 17:34:54 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali @amazon @Chewy It could have been damaged during transit &amp; gone to Problem Solve for repackaging. In that case it would've been decided whether to return the product if the contents were damaged, or continue delivery. But typically we don't use clear tape on our boxes. Was it a warehouse deal?
1334065663980158977 2020-12-02 17:23:34 +0800 <AKauwela> @Miercatte So very true! 🤗I don't have to be jealous/envious of anyone in my neighborhood anymore ☺️  Now,, about my kitchen that's barely a kitchen...

1332428835673915392 2020-11-28 04:59:24 +0800 <AKauwela> @peteetchou @IKEAUSA They do! Huge ones, and small ones. Fake, and real. Cacti, orchids, etc. They're beautiful, and plentiful,, but gotta check the damn root system. Bc literally the one in the blue died immediately and the sprigs looked like they had just been stuck in the soil, like JUST now.

1331497921431302145 2020-11-25 15:20:17 +0800 <AKauwela> @PollInTheField How hasn't.
1331496939725025280 2020-11-25 15:16:23 +0800 <AKauwela> I had ONE that came out perfectly,, and that was the first one. Now,,,, not so much
1331495898010927104 2020-11-25 15:12:14 +0800 <AKauwela> Since there's no directions, I have no clue how long to bake it, either.  I've never made waffles before 😂
1331495367842570241 2020-11-25 15:10:08 +0800 <AKauwela> How much batter do you put on a 7" iron? I have so many questions 😅
1331416617163526146 2020-11-25 09:57:12 +0800 <AKauwela> Finally brought the cute little antique Waffle Iron to my house. I can't find the exact one online, so THAT sucks. I want to know the year.  https://t.co/e9SE6KYw17

1331357597836869634 2020-11-25 06:02:41 +0800 <AKauwela> I WAS able to get one 😭 I can't believe how many people are in the line. It took 30 minutes to get thru, and there were JUST as many people behind us as there had been in front of us. Half of those people will be going home empty handed😞 #FoodInsecurity #FoodBox #Oregon
1331356564259700736 2020-11-25 05:58:34 +0800 <AKauwela> @gmail Thanks for checking in - I checked thru my browser and was able to access. It must've been something w the email app? But it's working now. Thanks!
1331345169946275840 2020-11-25 05:13:18 +0800 <AKauwela> Got here at 1pm. Distribution is 2-5. All the GD new cars in line for a #FoodBox. Bullshit. I saw the back of the semi when we pulled in - NO WAY will it be enough for the 200 cars in line. Esp since they're giving away more than 1 box. They need a better system! #Oregon @USDA
1331283534166716416 2020-11-25 01:08:23 +0800 <AKauwela> @AngelicaKATU @LincolnGraves @SchreiberEvan 😮
1331283129458323456 2020-11-25 01:06:46 +0800 <AKauwela> @DameDurdin Very true. They usually have to work a certain number of hours, so if they finish early, they have to help w someone else's route. And, same! 😅
1331115488454221826 2020-11-24 14:00:38 +0800 <AKauwela> Usually, the #SciFi books that I read are from the 1950's. But these two just happen to be from the 70's 💁🏻‍♀️
1331115139836231680 2020-11-24 13:59:14 +0800 <AKauwela> So next up is this one from 1977. I don't have much time to read, or watch TV since going back to work, so tonight I've allotted myself an hour. #JamesPHogan #InheritTheStars #SciFi  https://t.co/wKcfzosEC6
1331114397691912192 2020-11-24 13:56:17 +0800 <AKauwela> This one,,, from 1973, is difficult to follow. 59 pages in, and it lost my attention. I'll try again another time🙄 #BenBova #ForwardInTime #SciFi  https://t.co/NThnOuSdAK
1331113778025357312 2020-11-24 13:53:50 +0800 <AKauwela> I like old #SciFi books. I feel like they NEED to be read. Some are easier to read than others. Some use the slang &amp; way of talk from the period in which they were written, some written how the author thinks people will sound in the future. I've found some REALLY good ones.

1331050990468907008 2020-11-24 09:44:20 +0800 <AKauwela> Sometimes I'm easily distracted.😅 Does that mean I have ADHD? 🤔
1331050591410262016 2020-11-24 09:42:45 +0800 <AKauwela> @realDonaldTrump "Prevail" doing WHAT, exactly? 🤔 Because you LOST, you loser.
1331043862152790017 2020-11-24 09:16:00 +0800 <AKauwela> @DameDurdin I'm not sure how many USPS delivery people there are in the Beaverton / Aloha area, but more &amp; more people are ordering online every day. It's crazy.
1331043168964407298 2020-11-24 09:13:15 +0800 <AKauwela> @DameDurdin I was out delivering USPS from 8:00am until 7:05pm yesterday. I had to finally stop bc it was literally too dark to deliver safely. I had delivered 115 packages, and had to put 15 on hold to be delivered today. People are freaking out again &amp; delivery quantity is HIGH, again.
1331022029735165952 2020-11-24 07:49:15 +0800 <AKauwela> @MikeDrucker @GeorgeTakei Well. They had the "Death" part right 🙄

LOTS of books are being returned to the FC. Unless you (requested) a receipt,, we have no way of knowing who the book is to be shipped to. 😏

1327770884128481280 2020-11-15 08:30:22 +0800 <AKauwela> @peteetchou @stacideshazer And PPS ClickList mgnt is ####! They maxed out at 16 orders per hour / 204 today, and 1 mgr was complaining abt not taking in MORE orders... They don't have enough workers to do that, AND D1 spent most of the day calling customers to say theirs would be 2hrs late. "HOW DARE YOU!"
1327765729945350144 2020-11-15 08:09:53 +0800 <AKauwela> @stacideshazer And speaking of... She just NOW got home after a TWELVE HOUR shift. She was there from 4 AM until 4 PM 😖 Left for work before I even got home from my work this morning!

1327744281117749249 2020-11-15 06:44:39 +0800 <AKauwela> @stacideshazer Yes please! My eldest works for ClickList and customers are CRAPPY!! They're stressed bc 1) enough pickers aren't scheduled ; 2) they don't have enough employees ; 3) Customers can be RUDE!! They don't get paid enough, esp NOW, to have to deal w your own personal issues.  https://t.co/JH7PDpv4VQ

1317515487119429632 2020-10-18 01:19:05 +0800 <AKauwela> Holy shit they (@burgerking) even gave me the WRONG ORDER. I ordered 4 breakfast sandwiches. I GOT 2 breakfast sandwiches, 1 fry, 1 hashbrown, &amp; what looks like a double hamburger😩 Come ON Man! I'm not going to drive 10m back to exchange the order. THIS IS THREE orders in a row.
1317512117788975110 2020-10-18 01:05:41 +0800 <AKauwela> 10 minutes waiting in front of @BurgerKing again for my order because they were only out of one biscuit so they sub a croissant. But why would it take 10 minutes to make one sandwich. Annoying ending to an almost 10 hour work night.

1310067279879577600 2020-09-27 12:02:34 +0800 <AKauwela> Twitter is my journal. If you don't like it - which apparently most people don't - just unfollow me alrdy. Don't make me hang on to hope. Bc that's just mean.
1310066959929585666 2020-09-27 12:01:17 +0800 <AKauwela> I'm just really sad that this is my birthday and it was worthless 😞 I wait all year for this ONE DAY. For maybe - just MAY BE - I'll be loved and pampered. Again. Will I be 80?90? when that happens again? If ever?
1310066250899283969 2020-09-27 11:58:28 +0800 <AKauwela> I'll be fine. Bc I'm always "fine". Regardless of my life and the shit that happens, What the hell else can I do abt it? Nothing. I can't find someone and make them love me. I can't beg for people to do things for me or to care. So why try?
1310065741203300352 2020-09-27 11:56:27 +0800 <AKauwela> FYI. I always have a happy face &amp; demeanor. Bc I am a happy person. If you know me, you know that much. Regardless of the shit I'm always dealt, I shove it down low &amp; blaze fwd. But Jesus Christ. A girl needs some GD love &amp; attention sometimes. I get jack shit. Funny. Not funny.

1308617848252633088 2020-09-23 12:03:02 +0800 <AKauwela> The beach was gorgeous until abt 4pm when the clouds started rolling in.  My mother-in-law put half of my father-in-law's ashes in the Cape Lookout ocean. We always camped there as a HUGE family group in the 90s. Before everyone started dying.

1306650867001511936 2020-09-18 01:46:57 +0800 <AKauwela> And of course he had to throw in "She is incorrect." Bc he LOVES telling other people that he is always right. Master manipulator.
1306650505020493824 2020-09-18 01:45:31 +0800 <AKauwela> Holy shit. D3's dad is making it worse. Saying that they only tell me IF they're going to to claim her. WHAT? He's never told me year-to-year if they're going to claim her. And that it would be as MUCH as 600$ if they do. WTF. It can end now thank you.
1306649742701543424 2020-09-18 01:42:29 +0800 <AKauwela> @worldmarket I miss your Rustic Mexican Pine look, and Ashanti figures from the last 90's!😭 Bring it ALL back 💜

1306644940710060032 2020-09-18 01:23:24 +0800 <AKauwela> @MarkMyMoi @WashCoScanner It must have a been a sight! 😂 I heard it was backed up to Hwy26 Tuesday evening when they opened back up, and police were directing traffic. The warehouse only has so many workers per shift, and people can only work so fast! 🤣
1306644445463326720 2020-09-18 01:21:26 +0800 <AKauwela> @MarkMyMoi @WashCoScanner The drivers though--They stay inside their cabs. The warehouse closes for the safety of the yard workers - the people who actually are outside the entire time - 24/7, all weather.
1306571040210911234 2020-09-17 20:29:45 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali Yes. She's heavily into tiktok (one of her posts has 19k likes), &amp; loves overblown teen drama shows. She had a really hard time w friends in elementary/middle, so I get that she got a backbone bc of it. But that prefrontal cortex can g2H!
1306472594225340416 2020-09-17 13:58:34 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali The TV shows that are out rn really bother me. No respect for parents, and them always having to be right. Sure, empower,, but not for every little thing. She love causing drama where there IS NO DRAMA
1306470718796832771 2020-09-17 13:51:07 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali Absolutely. Sometimes I see the girl she was/is/can be,, and it totally makes me worry abt what she'll do now - like alienating people - she straight up tells friends that they annoy her. Shes just a rude child. Which is pretty much what her dad does. Shock &amp; Awe.
1306469419942440960 2020-09-17 13:45:57 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali I hope so. I get it. But she seriously does NOT give a damn abt anyone, esp me.
1306469177872449536 2020-09-17 13:44:59 +0800 <AKauwela> It's been quite a few years since he screwed me over, guess he thought it was time. Like being estranged from him for 5 years wasn't good enough. Bc damn. It's been so peaceful.
1306468435308630017 2020-09-17 13:42:02 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali 16. Such a great age.
1306466532952690689 2020-09-17 13:34:29 +0800 <AKauwela> @AmerIndependent How fucking horrible is this. I wish "red states" would open their eyes.
1306466087706394626 2020-09-17 13:32:42 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali I sure hope so. She used to be very sensitive to everyone - Now, she is literally 90% brat. Could care less abt anyone's feelings, and usually makes sure she'll tell you so to your face. Horrible.
1306458347613253633 2020-09-17 13:01:57 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali ie. She has no empathy towards ANY one. And it's really sad.
1306457765074804736 2020-09-17 12:59:38 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali Ofcrse now D3 is pissed at me. Reason? Bc I'm mad at her dad bc he's an idiot? Yeah. Makes sense. She's a brat.
1306456741463244801 2020-09-17 12:55:34 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali Me either. He's claimed her for the last 14 years. It might not make a difference to him if he claims her, but it would make a difference to me. 😭
1306455849280315393 2020-09-17 12:52:01 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali Our tax person said the deduction is not worth the $600 we pay for it anymore at your age with the current tax code."
1306455692509732865 2020-09-17 12:51:24 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali "I only pay her if I’m buying the deduction. Otherwise I don’t pay her at all. So, that applies to every tax season. I have no idea what she means by paying double next tax season. To answer the question. No. I won’t be buying the deduction.
1306455582174453760 2020-09-17 12:50:58 +0800 <AKauwela> @pdxali Exactly! 😭I just lost out on so much money

1305929585641443328 2020-09-16 02:00:50 +0800 <AKauwela> My Shark 560 vacuum was SO destroyed from my mom's house, that I had to buy a new one (Shark 500). D1-2 can have the old one if they pay for it to get cleaned.  https://t.co/UCJgM7H30F

1305752304977494017 2020-09-15 14:16:23 +0800 <AKauwela> I guess I need to be thankful that it didn't happen on her own again. But dammit. She only had less than a week to roam around her new home!
1305751788042190850 2020-09-15 14:14:20 +0800 <AKauwela> Great. My mom fell and her back is sore, and their protocol is to take her to the hospital via ambulance. Which means not only $$$$, but she'll have to be in quarantine AGAIN for another TWO weeks when she gets back! She JUST got OUT of quarantine!

I have no idea how someone could miss 2 living creatures inside a cage. Can you imagine their horror. Also, testing - infertility, DNA #CRISPR, and heart valves.
