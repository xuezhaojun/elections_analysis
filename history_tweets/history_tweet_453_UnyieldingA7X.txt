Instead of showing the obvious, this will be used as a bludgeon to force more diversity. Quality decline.

1330874589665222658 2020-11-23 22:03:23 +0800 <UnyieldingA7X> @SolBrah When told by the American artist Benjamin West that Washington was going to resign, King George III of England said "If he does that, he will be the greatest man in the world."
1330874085421748224 2020-11-23 22:01:23 +0800 <UnyieldingA7X> @SolBrah Made me think of  George Washington being regarded as The Best President. He gave the position up willingly, and that is one of the best reasons he was suited for power.
1330873726334853122 2020-11-23 21:59:57 +0800 <UnyieldingA7X> @SolBrah was listening to rando Youtube vids and Alan Watts "Trust the Universe" came on, after hitting every green light on the way home "Walter Mitty" was  on.

Do they target people just because of their skin color?  No  Democrat &amp; "Republican" law makers profit more if trump isnt in office. Trump signed a EO for further stimulus, but he doesn't have control over purse.

"Protests" coupled with lockdown have killed small businesses and transferred wealth to politicians, their friends, and corporations. Thousands dying, stagnating, going broke, but sure these protests "fight the power".

"Peaceful Protests" run cover  whether intentional or not for scum, Bank Cartels, and Corporations. Also BLM in of itself is trash to begin with.

1301093880004313088 2020-09-02 17:45:28 +0800 <UnyieldingA7X> @mich_zoomer Don't understand the need to counter signal people on our side. Yes, some are limited by reach/audience to the extent of thier message, but that's why we all share the relevant information with each other.
1301093398074609665 2020-09-02 17:43:33 +0800 <UnyieldingA7X> @mich_zoomer Everyone has a part to play in the coming times. Nick introduces people to hard questions that need answers. There are other sources of information to fulfill higher needs.
