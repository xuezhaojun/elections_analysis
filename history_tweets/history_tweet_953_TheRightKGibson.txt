1344069014553767937 2020-12-30 07:53:19 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JesseKellyDC Just look at GA. I remember some of my conservative coworkers touting about ‘all the new businesses’.

1344034478000394241 2020-12-30 05:36:05 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @juneslili @LegendaryEnergy You won’t be able to fly without vaccine. You won’t be able to rent in a multi unit complex without vaccine. Children won’t be allowed to go to school without vaccine. You will be denied Medicare without vaccine.
1344033946888245250 2020-12-30 05:33:58 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @juneslili @LegendaryEnergy What makes you think you can say no? I predict the following, Insurance companies will charge employers more for employer funded insurance if they don’t mandate vaccines (they do it with drug tests). Employers will force employees because they can’t pass on the employer cost.

1344021922812735490 2020-12-30 04:46:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @EndTheOligarch @rising_serpent And did you know that this spending bill is the largest in history? Amazing how we’re able to send trillions to foreign countries during a ‘pandemic’ and businesses have shutdown but government never did.
1344021465239318529 2020-12-30 04:44:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @EndTheOligarch @rising_serpent Why wouldn’t the government just lift tax withholdings instead of throw you breadcrumbs every 6 months? Why is congress giving tobacco companies millions in covid relief? Why are parents paying for the internet for e learning while still paying property taxes?

The only way to get relief to those who were is a blanket ‘stimulus’.  If they really wanted to make an impact, why not just lift taxes during pandemic
1344014774447841282 2020-12-30 04:17:47 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @BarnettforAZ And people will let that go for a measly $2,000. Pathetic

1344007616876392451 2020-12-30 03:49:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> We need to hold an election to completely overhaul our government. Only then will we get our lives back

We’re literally funding other countries ridiculous programs while congress argues about giving the tax payers $2,000.  This is a sick joke. January 6th may turn into a government takeover!

1343770682157641735 2020-12-29 12:07:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> This is a form of propaganda to trick you into thinking YOU are the weapon. It isn’t enough to scare us of foreign invasion because there’s no way to falsify statistics. Using humans as weapons is easier to manipulate.
1343766626395693062 2020-12-29 11:51:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy It’s just the beginning. First it’ll be socialized healthcare. Then welfare state. If I knew how to send those checks back with an ‘I decline’ note attached I would!
1343764307314679811 2020-12-29 11:42:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @canine2 @1983JPK AND he was supposedly in the vehicle but used a recorded female voice to evacuate. Guess he didn’t want them to identify him lol
1343763955873939456 2020-12-29 11:41:07 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @canine2 @1983JPK And the single photo that looks like a mugshot although there are no arrest records since the 80s.  Not to mention, he never even bothered with cell towers but suddenly blows an entire city block
1343763339973963776 2020-12-29 11:38:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Everyone is saying @realDonaldTrump will save us from the NWO. I feel like if that was his plan we wouldn’t be spending so much $ to support it.  Please, prove me wrong. I have a family to worry about!
1343753771529220098 2020-12-29 11:00:39 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT So the SolarWinds hack runs far deeper than we can imagine, it gave someone access to some of our most critical ‘private’ data, quite possibly every public trading company 🤷‍♀️ That’s my theory
1343752716674363393 2020-12-29 10:56:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT We filed a report with the SEC, we’re a public trading company.  Despite all that, we are the largest food distributor in the country, and we are in the midst of a pandemic. Yet crickets. Andddd, we had just negotiated a contract to store vaccines. I kid you not!
1343751562628374528 2020-12-29 10:51:52 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT We are the largest food distributor in the world, not country. Our transportation software was taken. All 5 of our operating systems were taken. Our SAP was taken (financial management). Our PeopleSoft was taken (employee data/payroll).
1343750904621707264 2020-12-29 10:49:16 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT Because my guess is that is exactly what happened. Here’s why I believe it.  Our company was captured by ransomware the 2nd week of October. It happened through Microsoft Exchange (email). SolarWinds is a back door for Microsoft.  Here’s where it gets interesting
1343750162561249282 2020-12-29 10:46:19 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT It was a hub for SolarWinds, which recently had a security breach. God forbid we allow the public to find out what data was breached through an investigation. Imagine knowing that everything tied to your SS # has been given to say...Chy Nah
1343748351137820672 2020-12-29 10:39:07 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy I was happy up until covid. Whether by greed or by fear, he let covid destroy us
1343748050586628097 2020-12-29 10:37:55 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @stillgray You’re honestly buying the story that a lone suicide bomber blew himself and a city block up to fight 5G? He was smart enough to build a bomb but too stupid to know it wouldn’t stop 5G from growing? I’d like to know how active he was in protesting 5G before he blew himself up
1343746208486064129 2020-12-29 10:30:36 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @stillgray Imagine being so stressed about 5G you make a bomb that takes out a city block and blow yourself up with that bomb but left 10 towers standing within a 5 mile radius 🙄
1343745622227218432 2020-12-29 10:28:16 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT Imagine if everyone just understood what was in that bill they just passed. We’re supposedly shutdown for a deadly virus, yet more $ was spent on foreign countries than combating the virus.  Nothing will unite people like common suffering!
1343730706820820992 2020-12-29 09:29:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy This will cause the housing prices to fall creating panic.  BUT citizens, both republicans and democrat will finally start coming together and planning real active protests.
1343730236802936832 2020-12-29 09:27:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy People who’ve never needed federal assistance before will be applying. This will begin discussions around a welfare state. Gas will be $5 a gallon, car sales will drop even more. People will be putting houses on the market but due to unemployment they won’t sell.
1343729512085942273 2020-12-29 09:24:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy Biden is in office but makes no appearances. People from all sides start to question his mental and physical health. We are in another phase of lockdowns, this time more people are unemployed and falling behind. There will be talk/plans for federal healthcare.

1343707611242360838 2020-12-29 07:57:14 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @tomselliott It seems to me they’re targeting certain groups of people almost like they’re still ‘testing’ the vaccine
1343704958563201025 2020-12-29 07:46:41 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT It’ll start with employers. By the end of 2021 they’ll offer some kind of tax credit to businesses that enforce it. Then they’ll withhold federal funding to schools that don’t enforce it.  By 2022 it’ll be enforced for all

1343701346076262400 2020-12-29 07:32:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TBG9270584 If people only knew the truth about our food industry. If you can, buy from a local butcher. It may be a bit more expensive but the meat doesn’t cook down as much and it’s WAY more healthy.  I work in the food industry

It simply says if you want to send your child to the classroom, there will be $ to do so regardless of your zip code

1343698621712248834 2020-12-29 07:21:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @vicissitude1922 @DeAngelisCorey Public schools have been dismantling for a long time. When you have one township getting millions of $$ for a stadium, yet another school in the same county has concrete playgrounds there’s already a problem.

1343693486734901255 2020-12-29 07:01:06 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> What I’ve learned from 2020 politics, Nothing gets people involved like a pandemic. Never leave anything to chance. You don’t have to accept every policy your party endorses. Local politics are just as important as state &amp; federal. If you want to make a change, get involved.
1343681231351906305 2020-12-29 06:12:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy The MAGA movement is getting as bad as the liberal agenda. You can no longer claim to be a conservative and disagree with Trump. I’ll always agree that he woke people up and did some pretty great stuff prior to 2020, but he’s failed almost everything in 2020.
1343680418705502208 2020-12-29 06:09:10 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy We’ve been compartmentalized as ‘essential’ and ‘nonessential’ instead of ‘people’.  Unfortunately people will only see what they want to see. Trump was a ‘better choice’ but definitely not a savior.
1343679553328324616 2020-12-29 06:05:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy If Trump truly wanted to save the country, he would’ve called out the virus from the start. He wouldn’t have declared a national emergency which gave states the power to kill jobs. We are no longer a ‘right to work’ country.
1343678729093058562 2020-12-29 06:02:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy Honestly it took me a while to see through everything. The last straw was everything that was in the covid relief bill. Once people understand who has ties to all that pork, I hope they wake up.  This has been the mission pre 9/11.
1343677950479233024 2020-12-29 05:59:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JesseKellyDC We are in the final stages of The United States Of America. I’m thankful that I was a part of it, but broken because my grandchildren will never know the joy that came with true freedom.  RIP USA
1343675708632137729 2020-12-29 05:50:27 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @aubrey_huff Covid is the biggest lie told to the people.
1343675218649362432 2020-12-29 05:48:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @GypsyCeltic @MatthewMaryland @JoeSilverman7 @JesseKellyDC It’s the same where I live except in local restaurants. I think they’re so afraid of being shutdown they ask people to wear masks. They also do curbside because they know our community is set firm against masks.
1343674256870301697 2020-12-29 05:44:41 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @D_B_Harrison @PastorPaulK Tweets like that make me feel like I’ve been wrong in believing that my friends &amp; neighbors are really my friends because I’m white. I hope that’s completely false because I’d hate to lose friends 😢
1343673635375112196 2020-12-29 05:42:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jorymicah Stop trying to make white people uncomfortable around their black friends and neighbors and vice versa. Statements like this just make normal conversations hard to reach for fear of offending people.
1343672683309969410 2020-12-29 05:38:26 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Jim_Jordan 9/11 opened the door to where we are today. Nothing can stop what’s coming!
1343669511912873993 2020-12-29 05:25:50 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DirtyWhiteCoun1 I hate to disappoint you, but you might want to look into Blackrock &amp; how they’ve plaid a role in covid ‘relief’.  I am a staunch conservative and 100% Trump supporter, but I have to admit when someone doesn’t have my best interest at heart.
1343635346463072256 2020-12-29 03:10:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Guess who really got screwed in 2020!? We did!

1343633519105499138 2020-12-29 03:02:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MatthewMaryland @JoeSilverman7 @JesseKellyDC Do people have to wear a mask when they go into a restaurant? If so, that’s not a win
1343633067546705920 2020-12-29 03:01:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JesseKellyDC We’ve been sold to special interest, and WE let it happen through some stupid blind faith!
1343632865863610369 2020-12-29 03:00:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JesseKellyDC If any politician had the slightest intention to ‘save’ us, they would’ve spoke up before the very first lockdown was put in place. My guess is every single one of them saw $$, and that motivated them into allowing us to literally destroy our country.
1343632345505669122 2020-12-29 02:58:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JesseKellyDC I am literally shocked by everyone who still believes there is some ‘plan’ to save us! The only real plan was to use the virus to funnel more $ into special interests.
1343630778106839045 2020-12-29 02:51:55 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @PISDI94_96 I believe he was never registered to vote. It’s possible that it was not politically motivated 🤷‍♀️
1343629099315712003 2020-12-29 02:45:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DirtyWhiteCoun1 Believe me when I tell you, that ‘pork’ is not getting cut out.  We’ve just given more money to climate change than we ever have. People are going to be really mad when they find out who’s benefiting too
1343628523584565253 2020-12-29 02:42:58 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DoniTheDon_ We’re crapping plenty away in the country too. This is the largest amount of money ever allotted for climate change.

1343617180894638081 2020-12-29 01:57:53 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT I’m afraid it’s over. That covid bill just gave congress more power than they had going into covid. They’re not required to act on his ‘demands’, and they won’t.  Not sure why anyone thinks something good will come out of this, it will not.
1343613538296885253 2020-12-29 01:43:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @senatemajldr Are you excited about Pakistan getting millions of dollars to study private parts?
1343613276102537217 2020-12-29 01:42:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DirtyWhiteCoun1 Don’t do it, do not cave!
1343613135433961474 2020-12-29 01:41:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Hey everyone, the government just gave tobacco companies millions of dollars! Still think the masks &amp; shutdowns are for people’s health?
1343612563620302853 2020-12-29 01:39:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @QuickBTexas @toddstarnes @AMCTheatres Don’t be an idiot. The government just gave tobacco companies millions of dollars, why do people believe they give a shit about their health!?
1343611163494461448 2020-12-29 01:33:59 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy I go to Kroger’s and Walmart in my local city without a muzzle. The key is ignoring anyone who talks to you when you enter.  I’ve never worn a mask in a store, I don’t even own one 😂
1343589911690145792 2020-12-29 00:09:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealCandaceO And people thought House of Cards was fiction 😂😂😂
1343589279742754816 2020-12-29 00:07:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Jim_Jordan 😂😂😂 they just extended unemployment, canceled evictions &amp; gave random people $600. You really think that’s going to ‘stimulate’ the economy?
1343588076040421377 2020-12-29 00:02:14 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @AOC @RashidaTlaib I think you can chalk that one up. Pretty sure the swamp has other commitments with our tax money. And when I say swamp, I am referring to both parties.
1343587011765170176 2020-12-28 23:58:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I really hate grammar police, but I seriously can’t resist!
1343585805663666176 2020-12-28 23:53:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @stillgray This world is so f¥cked!
1343585063527710724 2020-12-28 23:50:16 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> These politicians know NOTHING about survival! They probably never even check their bank account
1343584757624545302 2020-12-28 23:49:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RepAdamSchiff Maybe, just maybe in the umteen weeks it took y’all to write this bill you could’ve thought more about the American people suffering and less about how you could rob them.  But sure, blame Trump and the republicans for congressional greed! #DrainTheSwamp  #congresssucks
1343583859179446272 2020-12-28 23:45:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ScottBaio I know you do birthday follows, it’s my birthday today ☺️
1343582271253700614 2020-12-28 23:39:10 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Terrenc43516485 @jLo4USA I can tell you that 5G paranoia runs deeper than ‘the right’. My son is more left learning and he has way more 5G theories than anyone I know
1343575164039131136 2020-12-28 23:10:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @llpatriot3 @EG4USA I’m not saying I don’t want the election fraud investigated, but no matter what happens I DON’T want to keep funneling money to congress via ‘bills’.
1343574882165153798 2020-12-28 23:09:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @llpatriot3 @EG4USA And what I find most appalling is that people are more concerned about section 230 and an investigation than they are about trillions of dollars wasted on things like gender studies, counting fish &amp; interviewing pot heads.
1343573875565744136 2020-12-28 23:05:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @llpatriot3 @EG4USA It’s a done deal. They MIGHT increase the covid relief checks, but I wouldn’t wager the $600 promised. This is the same congress that has fought against Trump from day one. Why would anyone believe he has more power now?
1343572766554021891 2020-12-28 23:01:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CalebJHull They’re also getting mad because ‘how dare you question POTUS’ on the stimulus package! Honest to God, if these people are so easily led by blind faith, how are they any different than the left with their media talking heads!?
1343420004428034048 2020-12-28 12:54:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I just want one person in the government to say ‘we don’t hate you and we won’t steal your money’ Is that too much to ask?
1343419123196375047 2020-12-28 12:50:53 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TomFitton She is not! How could this be overlooked!?

1343412834529632257 2020-12-28 12:25:53 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dm37514 @CalebJHull Our fight needs to be against lobbying and congressional overreach more than anything. Otherwise we’ll leave our kids a bankrupt country. Every year the globalists reach higher, and we’re paying dearly
1343412323499839490 2020-12-28 12:23:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ScottBaio I went to see you at the Indianapolis Convention Center a long time ago. I can’t remember if it was on my birthday or not. Do you remember a time in the 80s you were there?
1343409982373507072 2020-12-28 12:14:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @soulshine41 Yep
1343409707734732801 2020-12-28 12:13:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @IamJustJulie @JesseKellyDC Except he didn’t. He signed the bill, which is a shit ton of $ going to other countries
1343408957138882563 2020-12-28 12:10:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @fandrew15 @JesseKellyDC Tweet of the day
1343407840782905344 2020-12-28 12:06:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JesseKellyDC I may be completely disappointed by this bill, but I still remain steadfast in saying he has been the greatest president of my adult life. And even through my disappointment I hope there is some way he remains my president. I’m still extremely pissed about the bill tho 😡
1343406227204792320 2020-12-28 11:59:38 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I don’t want $600, I don’t want $2,000. I want someone to clean the spit off my face! F¥ck gender studies, be responsible with my money!
1343404936399376384 2020-12-28 11:54:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump please say it isn’t so 😢
1343404750377771008 2020-12-28 11:53:46 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealMattCouch @JourdainJudette The only way I’m going to DC is if that freaking bill is the #1 priority! #stopthepork
1343404187728683010 2020-12-28 11:51:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @KelemenCari @JourdainJudette I want to know about them NOW! No more damn secrets. This crap is for kids!
1343403926968803328 2020-12-28 11:50:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @catturd2 @JourdainJudette Had to give $ to study nose hair in dolphins this go round. Those damn lobbying dolphins get real loud
1343402391736102913 2020-12-28 11:44:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Jackie2work She is in a better place. I hope one day your heart will heal and you can live with the pain.  I don’t know your story, but no parent should have to bury their child. 💔🙏🙏🙏
1343401665202941952 2020-12-28 11:41:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy we Trump supporters are eating our own now 😂😂 Apparently I’m supposed to believe there will be some kind of rabbit pulled from a hat &amp; the government won’t spend trillions of $$ on nonsense
1343400957762273281 2020-12-28 11:38:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @reubing @JourdainJudette Because honestly I believed he was their only chance for a brighter future. Now it looks like I’ll be leaving them a huge tax burden I thought I was fighting against
1343400639083278338 2020-12-28 11:37:26 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @reubing @JourdainJudette It is not disloyal when you shift your energy toward yourself and away from someone who has abandoned the most important beliefs you once shared.  If the president wants to explain why he’s letting congress rob my children &amp; grandchildren, I’ll listen.
1343399665568514048 2020-12-28 11:33:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dm37514 @CalebJHull They have 100% control of what goes into the bills, no one else.

1343398574273523712 2020-12-28 11:29:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dm37514 @CalebJHull It’s written and passed by the house &amp; senate. What goes into those bills is heavily influenced by lobbyist, but only because they ‘buy’ members of congress
1343397257501159426 2020-12-28 11:23:59 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @monalisasmile37 The only way anything will come from this is if the president is still able to enforce it in 45 days. Say goodbye to the trillions of tax dollars. You will be paying interest on it for the rest of your life
1343396874884100096 2020-12-28 11:22:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @monalisasmile37 You can’t call people disloyal when they choose to stand for their principles. A lot of faith has been put into the president, he knows we would’ve been better served by a government shutdown forcing their hand.
1343394447313301512 2020-12-28 11:12:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Patrici10803022 @justatweeter69 @drchrxis @RussellOkung He has no history of ever being a registered voter. Maybe he was sending us a stronger message?
1343392114231676930 2020-12-28 11:03:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CalebJHull The only good that came from his speech was calling out congress for their wasteful spending. Unfortunately he didn’t name the members who wrote in each line so we know how to vote in the future
1343391134677139457 2020-12-28 10:59:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @3days3nights Congress isn’t going to be arrested Trillions of our tax dollars will go overseas and to special interest groups to be funneled right back to congress. In fact, you can bet they’ll find a way for you to pay back that measly $600 with interest.  We lost the battle
1343390295073968129 2020-12-28 10:56:19 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JFNYC1 @JourdainJudette I’m more worried about the trillions of money being wasted.  This is in NO way a win!
1343389053413187586 2020-12-28 10:51:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @2blrose @Maximus_4EVR No matter what happens now, that $ has been earmarked and is thus gone.  This is in no way whatsoever a win for the people, believe that!

1343387462140354561 2020-12-28 10:45:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Maximus_4EVR That was a totally shitty move, believe me.
1343387270792044545 2020-12-28 10:44:18 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @EvanAKilgore It’s that damn bill, I’m literally seething now!
1343387021298049030 2020-12-28 10:43:19 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> One thing is certain, we are 100% on our own. Our government has just put foreign countries above us.  We are nothing to them. Fact! @realDonaldTrump broke my heart
1343383666412675073 2020-12-28 10:29:59 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @GroveKilosdad73 @kwick1988 @realDonaldTrump He did not. He signed the bill with a ‘commitment from congress’ to reduce the pork, repeal 230 and increase covid relief’.  In other words, he gave up to avoid government shutdowns. Apparently it’s okay for us to shutdown but not them 🤷‍♀️
1343382634433568768 2020-12-28 10:25:53 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DirtyWhiteCoun1 I’m hearing it had to do with 5G, but that’s just a rumor so far
1343382375653367808 2020-12-28 10:24:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @oTVter @JoetteAlt @ali Especially when you’re in your last few weeks of your presidency. I hate to say it, but Trump was never going to be able to drain the swamp. I think he wanted to, but those people have killed for less
1343381166829793280 2020-12-28 10:20:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @enoughalready21 @ali They don’t have to follow through. In fact, if Joe is inaugurated next month it’s just an empty promise.  He signed it, it’s law. That’s how it works
1343380092672757761 2020-12-28 10:15:47 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoetteAlt @ali It’s an empty promise, once signed it’s law

1343375495975546880 2020-12-28 09:57:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I’m done funding congress special interest. I hope millions of Americans take to the streets to protest this robbery! #stoppayingtaxes  #DefundCongress
1343370356644405248 2020-12-28 09:37:06 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I truly can’t stand the media. They know nothing about the struggles of average Americans
1343370067438952449 2020-12-28 09:35:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @amandacarpenter I hope there comes a day when you are worried about keeping a roof over your children’s heads $ someone hands you $600 to get by for a year.

1343363124741742595 2020-12-28 09:08:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DirtyWhiteCoun1 He was 63  https://t.co/A1fNkLc3W4

1343360467746615297 2020-12-28 08:57:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DirtyWhiteCoun1 I think it is. I couldn’t find any photos by the press &amp; you know they’d be all over it if it were true

1343355812497002504 2020-12-28 08:39:18 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DirtyWhiteCoun1 From what I’ve read he was never a registered voter. I’m pretty sure anyone who was wearing a Trump 2020 had made sure to vote in this election. I think this photo is fake, but I’ve been wrong before
1343353880634077184 2020-12-28 08:31:38 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DirtyWhiteCoun1 Is this real?

1343309912978436098 2020-12-28 05:36:55 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris here’s how your voters feel about unity! You spent 4 years calling us racist bigots, how did you expect your followers to respond!?  https://t.co/GHDaZJccvu

You’ll be the death of this country, but since you’re advocating for mandates in the name of ‘public health’ you think you’re some kind of hero. Get a clue
1343300458786545666 2020-12-28 04:59:21 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @itzLuvMammoth @Wissa_P @BrandonStraka So you missed the fucking point you bigger idiot.  You believe the government is thinking about your health when they’re giving hundreds of millions of $$ to tobacco companies AND adding sales tax? Why would they worry about spreading a virus when they’re profiting from tobacco?
1343295772440334338 2020-12-28 04:40:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> What the hell is going on in Tennessee!?

1343284563456499714 2020-12-28 03:56:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Who’s the idiot here? Mask wearers are pathetic and they’re complicit in destroying our country. I am so fed up with the compliance! Lose the damn masks because YOU are the ones who are causing businesses to shutdown. Compliance is killing us!
1343283199041003521 2020-12-28 03:50:46 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LouiseM71436704 @DWAAAP @ElijahSchaffer Much like the measly covid relief package, they are basically saying ‘be happy with parks and streets being named after you’. I hope through all of this one thing is clear, the 2020 democrat candidates have NEVER advocated for black families and they certainly won’t start now!
1343281717621252102 2020-12-28 03:44:53 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LouiseM71436704 @DWAAAP @ElijahSchaffer Unfortunately your message was hijacked by a corrupt political party giving very bad advice. The presumably elected administration is refusing to make room in their cabinet for any effective members of the ACLU or BLM.
1343277861126418439 2020-12-28 03:29:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Someone please tell me who wrote in the funding for gender studies in Pakistan! I want a name, I’m pretty sure I can get the party affiliation.
1343275299270774786 2020-12-28 03:19:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> If we want to beat this government overreach, throw away your masks NOW, open your restaurants NOW. If you don’t, this virus nonsense is going to cost you a fortune in some way.

1343270421693669376 2020-12-28 02:59:59 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> You literally have to wear a mask to go into someplace to pay taxes on a pack of cigarettes. The worst part, people fall for it 🤦‍♀️
1343269924677017600 2020-12-28 02:58:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CourtCaseJunkie @BrandonStraka By showing people you care about them, do you mean allowing this nonsense to continue so more and more small businesses can be shutdown in the name of covid? Nah, it’s time we stand up for those who are losing everything over this stupid shit
1343269376246636545 2020-12-28 02:55:50 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Wissa_P @BrandonStraka Bet I could walk into that store &amp; buy cancer sticks tho
1343269137238339585 2020-12-28 02:54:53 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @BrandonStraka The government is so concerned for our health they want to give the tobacco industry millions in federal aid 🙄 The level of stupidity is mind blowing!

1343257420492136450 2020-12-28 02:08:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Just another rich person trying to tell the peasants what’s good for them #LetThemEatCake
1343257123216646150 2020-12-28 02:07:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DanRather I’m thinking about those poor people in Pakistan waiting on money from the US so they can do gender studies. wtf is wrong with you rich people!?
1343256239682310150 2020-12-28 02:03:38 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Just a reminder, prior to covid the #democrats had no path to victory. They destroyed our lives to steal the election!
1343254687290683392 2020-12-28 01:57:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RepKinzinger Funny you mention ‘burning the place down’ and ‘temper tantrum’.
1343253737050173440 2020-12-28 01:53:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @stevethompson99 @TeammateKelttab @gregkellyusa @BarackObama Politics isn’t about personal feelings, it’s about having a country that can support itself.  The division comes from those politicians who don’t prioritize that and those who do. And I’m not foolish enough to believe that the division doesn’t come from both sides.
1343244932119744514 2020-12-28 01:18:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Let’s be honest about this bill, there is a lot of fine print in it. It’s not about getting relief out to the people, it’s about how much interest the people will pay on that relief for decades to come.  #NoPork  @realDonaldTrump
1343242433803546627 2020-12-28 01:08:47 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> We’d like to go to DC on the 6th but not sure where to stay. Looking for suggestions for a hotel/area

1343237651135156226 2020-12-28 00:49:46 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @elenochle Can someone recommend a hotel/area to stay at? I’d like to go ahead and book. Preferably a Hilton or Marriott brand (I have rewards)
1343232663994380289 2020-12-28 00:29:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Due to covid, the next big street drug is going to be antibiotics. Wait and see
1343232257889349640 2020-12-28 00:28:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Virtue line dancing
1343231707701506048 2020-12-28 00:26:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy And I firmly believe that’s why there are so many Trump supporters, even with the ridiculous covid shutdowns. A lot of people felt personally attacked by the media and they feel like this is a way to ‘fight back’

You seriously believe the government plans on ever giving you back your freedom? If you voted for any progressive politicians, pat yourself on the back
1342859135755423746 2020-12-26 23:45:41 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump They’re literally pissing away trillions of OUR tax $. I will not sit back and let the government tax me to count fish, study genders, interview pot heads, etc.. This really needs to stop, the level of insanity is unreal! #DefundCongress
1342857811227770881 2020-12-26 23:40:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Imagine if they wanted to give millions of dollars to study economics and civics instead of genders? The left would be fuming!

1342847441599688705 2020-12-26 22:59:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I love President @realDonaldTrump as much as any true American, but while everyone is trying to #StopTheSteaI we really need to put some emphasis on the theft of our tax $ and our freedom too!
1342843551818936320 2020-12-26 22:43:46 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy That being said, you have the following necessary to put that out there (hint) 🙄
1342843271761047552 2020-12-26 22:42:39 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy We should really think about the message we could send on the 6th. Sure, we need election integrity, but we need to stop this government spending while it’s front &amp; center. #StopTheSteaI needs to be about our tax $ &amp; freedom more than anything!
1342842660470607872 2020-12-26 22:40:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy I don’t know about anyone else, but I’m more interested in stopping the government from funneling trillions of our tax money than I am about anything else. I feel like they used covid to steal more money.

I’m sure 1 in every 3 businesses around there were in some financial duress.  That was our first thought. Tragic, but 2020 has literally ruined lives and nothing would surprise me.
1342668661480452096 2020-12-26 11:08:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT I’m right there with ya. I’m so pissed off now that I know specifically how much they’re pissing away I seriously want to march in during a meeting and demand the fucking checkbook

1342325519090651136 2020-12-25 12:25:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy My guess is it started with one person, then one restaurant, then so on. If you can’t rally enough support to push against the lockdowns &amp; mandates, try doing it inside a place of business. You’d be amazed at how many are just waiting on that one person
1342324978998534144 2020-12-25 12:23:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy I’m not going to defend anyone here, but I am going to blame everyone who’s stuck in covid hell on themselves. Where I live, I never wear a mask. I go to restaurants, I shop local. There are some people here who believe the covid BS, but they’re the minority.

1342223159915900933 2020-12-25 05:38:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @SaintRPh If you tested negative you might have had a Tele health appointment depending on your symptoms/progress from the time of the test. I am almost certain that was all just an introduction to universal healthcare
1342222658629468160 2020-12-25 05:36:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @SaintRPh Covid was a way to introduce universal healthcare. If anyone went to the doctor during covid they first had to get a drive thru covid test then wait 5 to 7 days on the results to determine whether they got an actual doctor appointment.

1341955639141167105 2020-12-24 11:55:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DrewHolden360 Wish I could pull her up, she has some really good arguments on why her generation is so screwed up (not with drugs, just in general).  Too bad society can’t undo the unjust we created with the opioid crises. It’s really sad
1341955030543441923 2020-12-24 11:53:06 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DrewHolden360 First time smoking weed was 18, first time snorting heroin was 20. She speaks fluent Spanish and is just smart. She’s also been on probation for 4 years, rehab twice. She lives in shame because she’s ‘in the system’ and a ‘recovering addict’.
1341954340194570242 2020-12-24 11:50:21 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DrewHolden360 For example, one girl I know graduated with Presidential Honors and a 3.8 GPA. Good kid, didn’t date til she was 18. First in her family to go to a University.  She made the mistake of thinking she would never get hooked on anything, but she did.
1341953753797292033 2020-12-24 11:48:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DrewHolden360 Do you know, we have a lot of addicts who got wrapped up in their addiction and got caught doing petty crimes? Stealing, selling enough to get their share, possession, etc.. A lot of these kids are so wrapped up in the courts now that they feel hopeless.

There’s so much wasted spending in that bill, but they’re banking on the fact that Americans are so desperate they won’t care.  That’s your heroine for you, dumbass

They sat on this bill for God knows how long because they have so much wasteful spending they KNEW wouldn’t fly. Now they produce the bill right before Christmas hoping to appease the people without removing pork

Both parties in congress are corrupt, this bill makes that very clear! They know Americans are desperate so they give billions to special interest and pennies to us!
1341829464003633153 2020-12-24 03:34:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @KeithGrant09 @SenSchumer The most important thing here is that all voters see how corrupt both parties are. Just look at all the wasteful spending from both sides. If nothing else unites the peasants, this surely will!

1341828570876882945 2020-12-24 03:30:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @SenSchumer Maybe congress shouldn’t hold the Americans hostage so they can sneak in all that wasteful spending. Congratulations, your delaying the bill shows every voter how corrupt both parties are!
1341820825104691201 2020-12-24 02:59:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump needs to demand the covid relief is separate from any other spending.

1341819754336690183 2020-12-24 02:55:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @benshapiro They need separate bills.

1341814276751814656 2020-12-24 02:33:47 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Congress thinks that handing over $2,000 to everyone is going to make us forget about all the other government spending. Someone really needs to teach our government how to manage money!
1341813019295232001 2020-12-24 02:28:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @SpeakerPelosi But all the pork that’s in the bill. This is a debt that’s going to be passed down to our kids &amp; grandkids.  This bill is a clear indication of how out of control our government spending is! It needs to stop!

1341561510829678592 2020-12-23 09:49:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LindseyGrahamSC That bill is nothing but a slap in the face to the American people!

1341472597339418628 2020-12-23 03:56:05 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @tomselliott $23,000,000 for civil rights organizations  https://t.co/Q0TgUvFsJp
1341468970197655553 2020-12-23 03:41:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy I would also like to know who is responsible for each part of the bill. Is this something you can do? I think it’s time we learn who the swamp really is!
1341468383175426054 2020-12-23 03:39:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RandPaul Hold a press conference &amp; read it word for word. Disclose the party responsible for each part of the bill.  It’s time we all learn who the swamp really is!
1341467631333871618 2020-12-23 03:36:21 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @nypost President of what? Cheeseburger of the month club?

1341463237540376576 2020-12-23 03:18:53 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @AOC But did you vote yes? Stand for something or fall for anything
1341462878759612420 2020-12-23 03:17:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JesseKellyDC I’m not ready to explain why we’re all working in a CCP camp either. 🤷‍♀️
1341461421318664201 2020-12-23 03:11:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ScottBaio Imagine if all the pissed off people put in $5 of their $600 check and started a rebellion
1341460725450092544 2020-12-23 03:08:54 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @tedcruz Tell me PLEASE, how the fuck does this happen? Isn’t this our money?
1341460470318981121 2020-12-23 03:07:53 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @stillgray I don’t want or need the $600, but better me than foreign countries
1341458538640621570 2020-12-23 03:00:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @angela_ford @alexsalvinews Of course there’s this.  Think much?  https://t.co/FkxBpWjgjE

1341453137358573571 2020-12-23 02:38:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> First @realDonaldTrump needs to #VetoTheBill then he needs to wipe is *ss with it, then he needs to rip it up and shove it down congress’s throat! That would be a pretty bold statement
1341450436952395776 2020-12-23 02:28:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @tedcruz @CodyT17175464 To be fair, Biden’s space advisors probably got the positions because they had telescopes as kids
1341449880112402432 2020-12-23 02:25:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @tedcruz Unfortunately 2021 will be worse
1341447771530915841 2020-12-23 02:17:26 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RepAdamSchiff But had it been months ago would you get to call Biden ‘president elect’? Not likely, the bill is clearly a congressional slush fund
1341447171900633088 2020-12-23 02:15:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Jim_Jordan @Bostonianbatwa1 They already have. Look around
1341446990559887362 2020-12-23 02:14:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I personally do not need any covid relief. I’ve been able to work all year. But let’s be honest, that $600 won’t even cover the internet bill for those parents who’s kids had to do remote learning
1341443027550793728 2020-12-23 01:58:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @GeorgePapa19 Imagine if they’d signed off on this in October! The democrats couldn’t have come up 1/3 the v0tes they needed to steal the eLe€tion!

When a party crushes your economy and holds citizens hostage for votes, that’s cheating on another level.  The democrat party is getting really bad at cheating
1341437994205667329 2020-12-23 01:38:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jcsprenger @sky_walker2001 @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump In 2019 democrats had NO path to the presidency and everyone knows it. Up until ‘covid’ that was still the case. Now we know, had they signed off on the covid relief bill, Biden wouldn’t have got 10M votes.
1341436410033790987 2020-12-23 01:32:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CawthornforNC After that joke of a stimulus, no one should trust the election. It’s 100% clear now where the democrats priorities lie and it’s NOT for the American people!
1341435377886912512 2020-12-23 01:28:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump the most important statement you can make to the people right now is #VetoTheBill  Put Americans first!
1341434759889776643 2020-12-23 01:25:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino Meanwhile MSM and Hollywood applaud this
1341434576447676418 2020-12-23 01:25:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ScottPresler I blame the media and Hollywood never Trumpers. I hope they all tank!
1341433943032262666 2020-12-23 01:22:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy And instead of wearing condoms to get screwed, we wore masks 😂😂

1341430478117740547 2020-12-23 01:08:43 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Some really smart people I know actually believe the virus is ‘mutating’. Why didn’t it ‘mutate’ BEFORE the vaccine!? #idiocracy
1341429074464530433 2020-12-23 01:03:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Most people wear a condom when they get screwed. In 2020 it’s a mask  #StimulusJoke

1341416993761718274 2020-12-23 00:15:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @stillgray People are putting too much faith in the ‘solutions’ they’re reading on social media. Unless we all start getting truly active, we’re toast!

1340744323764248578 2020-12-21 03:42:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Everyone needs to remember Lady Gaga’s campaign tweet. Don’t forget how the democrats feel about working Americans
1340743500141355008 2020-12-21 03:38:54 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods To be fair, they don’t really know what they want unless the media tells them. I’m waiting for the day when the media giants start picking colors people wear each day. Companies will have to roll back start times to allow for dressing
1340742168005271552 2020-12-21 03:33:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I’ve interviewed plenty of people in my life and this woman shows ZERO confidence in any of her speeches. I’d be hesitant to hire her as a receptionist, just saying.

1340740617434001411 2020-12-21 03:27:27 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @KamalaHarris Climate crisis = democrats took millions from wealthy globalists to ‘win’ an election and eventually we’re going to have to start paying them back by giving them positions, government loans, regulations, etc.. #Solyndra  #DemocratsAreCorrupt  #ClimateChangeIsAScam

1340737409995186177 2020-12-21 03:14:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy Then again, I have to wonder if everything they say about the election fraud is real and we’re being told to live with it, what comes next? It’s all very confusing to be honest
1340736645356793858 2020-12-21 03:11:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy And I also agree, calling martial law would be stupid. If the voters feel they’ve been disenfranchised then they need to pick up the fight after Trump has exhausted his legal rights according to the constitution. Every citizen has a right to freedom no matter who you voted for
1340735853442850818 2020-12-21 03:08:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy Trump was too quick on a vaccine for a virus he knows damn well isn’t that bad. I’m not entirely sure of how the process works, but I feel like he should’ve brought the unconditional business closures to SCOTUS. I’d like for someone to weigh in on that.
1340734822533246982 2020-12-21 03:04:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy I agree with a lot of what you say, but I’m not sure I want any president overriding states mandates no matter how fucked up they are. I try to consider this in reverse, would Biden force states who stay open to close? I’m conflicted about the vaccines though.
1340733199840927745 2020-12-21 02:57:59 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MiamiFlorin @k_kissel @KimberStue @RepAndyBiggsAZ @HouseFloor @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump Plus, I think people should have to apply for stimulus money and prove they were affected by covid. Last time they just sent everyone $1,200 whether they needed it or not. I didn’t need it, but my neighbor sure could’ve used more since they were laid off!
1340732458761904134 2020-12-21 02:55:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MiamiFlorin @k_kissel @KimberStue @RepAndyBiggsAZ @HouseFloor @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump I don’t think anyone who hasn’t lost their job should get stimulus money. The more stimulus money they hand out, the higher our taxes will be in 2022. Hell, we could go up to 35% just to cover small businesses.
1340727162601664513 2020-12-21 02:33:59 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @stillgray My house just appraised 35k more than it did in 2018. I don’t know whether this is good or bad. Is it due to the exodus of the liberal cities? I live in a very red county and I hope it stays that way!

I’d say 15,000,000 So roughly 187,000,000 likely eligible voters. Now we’re over 82%. Even if everyone over 85 voted we’d be at 80%.

1340151592729923584 2020-12-19 12:26:53 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I have one thing to say. @JoeBiden your voters are defending this BECAUSE you have defended similar action.  This is why you shouldn’t be president, kids with cancer should get to see Christmas lights!

The only time you hear about the Proud Boys is when they’re reacting to some stupid ANTIFA/BLM shit. But go ahead, defend BLMs actions at this children’s cancer fundraiser of lights 🤦‍♀️

1340138620498403328 2020-12-19 11:35:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> We have medical professionals saying that people of color should get the vaccine first. This could be taken either way, you be the judge

1340126915970158592 2020-12-19 10:48:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ohcrapnowwhat @SarahPalinUSA Because Kamala disagreed with nearly every policy Biden stood for and called him a sexual predator. Now she wants to work hand in hand with him because he has something to offer.  Only a prostitute would lower her standards to that degree. Do try to keep up

1340119970898915328 2020-12-19 10:21:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @matthewdmarsden And if Biden really wore a mask everywhere he wouldn’t be tugging on it every time he speaks in public. People who actually have to wear them daily to work hardly notice their wearing them anymore.
1340119397822836737 2020-12-19 10:18:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @matthewdmarsden Nope, and no one else does either. People want a democrat president so bad they’ll lie about public health &amp; destroy our economy!

1339988230847029249 2020-12-19 01:37:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @NeilAxelrod @MatthewFoldi I agree. I grew up around guns but at 5 the only gun I’d ever fired was a BB gun. I think I was 15 before I handled a rifle. I’m all for 2A, but videos like this will surely have the adverse affect.

1339985710154190848 2020-12-19 01:27:43 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @stillgray The home is now empty as of 2 weeks ago. The worst part of it all was the wife was laid off in June, so they couldn’t keep the payments current for their primary home and the rental both.
1339984562106068992 2020-12-19 01:23:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @stillgray Our neighbors bought a rental investment 10 years ago. The previous tenants did NOT pay rent from December 2019 through December 2020. By time they could evict, covid hit so the tenants lived there until the homeowners were literally in pre foreclosure.
1339983933690306561 2020-12-19 01:20:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @stillgray Those statements need to be cross referenced by addresses to see if the homeowners are getting funding. If the homeowner did not file for funding, the rent payments need to go directly to the homeowners
1339983138165026816 2020-12-19 01:17:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @stillgray I think Businesses should provide statements showing they’re behind on payments Homeowners should provide documentation showing they’re unemployed and statements showing they’re behind on payments Renters should show statements showing they’re behind on rent AND

We tried funding green energy, Solyndra didn’t work out so good. Minimum wage jobs aren’t meant to be careers, they’re meant to be stepping stones. $15 an hour = $10 Big Mac

I think he believed getting a vaccine would force democrats to open states back up, but now they’re saying you’ll need a 2nd vaccine &amp; still won’t be back to normal.  Everyone knows, give them an inch &amp; they take a mile!
1339028639388676099 2020-12-16 10:04:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy I agree. It’s okay to like his policies from 2017 through the beginning of 2020, but we’d be stupid to say he pulled us through covid.  I’m waiting on someone with the guts to tell the truth about covid. Someone who has shit to lose.

1339017354068566018 2020-12-16 09:19:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I don’t think the vaccine is designed to be ‘unsafe’. I think it’s designed to get you into a system. For example, you’re now being told 2 doses are required, but my guess is this vaccine will require a lifetime of maintenance.

1338687914428010497 2020-12-15 11:30:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy my son in laws dad lost his job after 30 years due to covid shutdowns. He’s 64, he will never find a job equivalent to what he had.  He was almost ready to retire, I’m sure that was part of it too. This made me realize, absolutely no one is on our side 💔
1338686699623354369 2020-12-15 11:25:55 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy And I also told my employer I wouldn’t be taking any assignments that require me to fly because I won’t wear a mask. 30% of my work is travel, but if I am not willing to stand for my rights now, I won’t have a choice later.
1338686069546610690 2020-12-15 11:23:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy I care too! I’ve been ordering pickup way more than I should lately but I feel like I’m helping a little. I never wear a mask, sometimes I get dirty looks, but 1 in 5 I see a couple more people take theirs off too. People are braver in numbers.
1338685343575531526 2020-12-15 11:20:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy And I too would turn this on the governors, yet all along multiple states were literally destroying lives. The federal government should’ve stopped the state tyranny long ago.  @LegendaryEnergy is pretty sharp
1338684604249755649 2020-12-15 11:17:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy I cringe at the idea of Biden in office, but we would be in a far better place now had Trump called the virus out as a hoax long ago, before people’s livelihoods were destroyed. Instead he appears to have played into their hands.  This has been my only complaint about Trump
1338684088555810816 2020-12-15 11:15:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy I admit, I’m a Trump supporter but what AnOmaly says makes sense also. I think for a lot of Trump supporters we’d do better to admit that Trump hasn’t done his best to prevent the lockdowns and giving us a ridiculous vaccine.

1338219859583307777 2020-12-14 04:30:52 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DIRECTV why does my mom need so many cables in 2020? I’ll never get her new TV hooked up, this is nuts!  https://t.co/LOrI4ZCZqe
1338177417421197312 2020-12-14 01:42:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy Want an example, look at GA. This year several big tech companies moved their HQ to FL, TX &amp; TN. No one should be surprised if any of those states go blue in the next election
1338176177022922753 2020-12-14 01:37:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jackmjenkins Correction, they’re burning a BLM (ANTIFA) flag where the donor of the flag insisted their logo also be printed on the flag as proof of their support( virtue signaling).  Get it right

1338172730399723522 2020-12-14 01:23:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Flowersofsin @darcyspencer Trump was just the outside who gave the blue collars their voice. Don’t expect them to just roll over &amp; let the liberal elites take their jobs away so they can crush the middle class. Democrats want 2 classes, the haves and the have nots!
1338171636239962112 2020-12-14 01:19:14 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Flowersofsin @darcyspencer This has nothing to do with Trump, this is what happens after decades of verbal abuse. Liberal democrats calling on the world to hate the middle class accusing them of being ‘privileged’ when it’s really the industries they work in that gives liberal elites their privileges!
1338170585063501829 2020-12-14 01:15:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Flowersofsin @darcyspencer No, the liberal democrats have spent 20 years attacking the middle class industries, telling everyone we’re responsible for ‘killing the planet’. When that didn’t break us, they called us white supremacist because white trash was too harsh.
1338162863974854656 2020-12-14 00:44:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DefMohamedM @LegendaryEnergy I was giving it til 2023. My thought is people will pull through financially until 4th qt of 2021 then in 3rd qt 2022 loans will begin to default. Since people are buying now in an increased market, they will be short selling or foreclosing at the end of 2022
1338161904779485190 2020-12-14 00:40:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy 2021 Gas prices will rise 2021 Unemployment will rise 2021 Interest rates will rise 2022 Property value will fall 2022 The stock market will fall 2023 Recession 2023 Another housing crisis (because people are buying now in an increased market) 2024 Election year

If you work in healthcare you also know that the masks &amp; shutdowns have caused more mental and physical harm than the virus.

1337876397432446978 2020-12-13 05:46:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @chuckwoolery Look what happened to GA after tech giants &amp; media giants moved there. Could that be TX, TN and FL in 2024?
1337875513533214722 2020-12-13 05:42:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @fukushimaexpos2 @djvlad @TimRunsHisMouth Our nephew committed suicide, he was only 31. My brother in law was found dead in his home after 4 hours. He would’ve been at work if not for shutdowns. Our friend died of a stroke 2 days after a Tele health call. I’ve saw more deaths from shutdowns than I care to
1337874554815918084 2020-12-13 05:38:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @djvlad @TimRunsHisMouth Nope, not a single person. I don’t know anyone who’s had it either.  But, I see people who claim to have lost people on social media...how convenient

You’re not allowed to visit sick family members in the hospitals, however reporters are allowed to take pictures inside of hospitals so they can ensure the public that hospitals are overwhelmed? Makes perfect sense 🙄
1337872284468584453 2020-12-13 05:29:43 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @complainster @TimRunsHisMouth Here’s what happened when Trump banned travel.  But keep blaming him for not overreacting to a virus that literally has a 99% recovery rate.  PS, 81 million people didn’t vote for Biden, against Trump or otherwise.

1337869023577509888 2020-12-13 05:16:46 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @newsmax talking about gun buybacks right now. Since I never bought a gun from the government I guess that excludes me 🤷‍♀️
1337867655940812803 2020-12-13 05:11:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy But I know that if I didn’t make that choice for myself then I have no reason to complain. My hope is that others I work with who share my sentiments will follow. It has to start somewhere. And yes, I could be risking my job but it’s that important to me.
1337866694199537666 2020-12-13 05:07:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy I also wanted to share this with you. Part of my job requires me to travel. Recently I made the decision that I would no longer do projects that require traveling because I will not wear a mask or get a vaccine. I don’t know if I alone will make an impact
1337865596109729798 2020-12-13 05:03:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Also in Portland - human 💩 on public streets

1337864780409925638 2020-12-13 04:59:54 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy I live in Indiana and we’re a pretty conservative state. We had shutdowns &amp; masks mandates pretty early on. What’s interesting though is in my small town, we’ve been fairly loose with restrictions.

1337840758800470017 2020-12-13 03:24:27 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Within 2 years gas will be at least $3.50 a gallon. Many factories will be laying off if not fully closed. Utilities will be 25% higher and property value will be 25% lower while interest rates are 50% higher. Wait &amp; see
1337839817716011009 2020-12-13 03:20:43 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden Your voters better not take to Twitter complaining about gas prices and job losses next year. You can remind them exactly what they voted for, destroy the working class!
1337838644044963843 2020-12-13 03:16:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino I remember how excited Georgians were when tech giants &amp; media started moving to GA, now look at the state. Now I’m seeing the same enthusiasm for FL, TX and TN and I’m wondering how they’ll look in 2024. The damage may be irreversible
1337837814373879813 2020-12-13 03:12:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @justinamash @heather4liberty Whether you voted for Biden or Trump, everyone should be advocating for a countrywide audit to validate this election. Otherwise no matter the outcome, there will always be doubt about a legitimate Biden presidency. Isn’t that important?
1337836603964841985 2020-12-13 03:07:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @christina_bobb @kitty26355795 @realDonaldTrump If you look what happened to GA when the tech giants &amp; the media all moved their corporate headquarters there, you will get a glimpse at what TX and FL will look like in 2024. Now, imagine that on a much broader scale. At what point is it irreversible?
1337835143411666944 2020-12-13 03:02:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RepSwalwell @JasonMillerinDC Kinda hard for dads who aren’t working. Just more victims being claimed by the stupid covid lockdowns

1337829578761498626 2020-12-13 02:40:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @N1ckSandmann And since we’re so willing to look the other way on potential election fraud, states like MI, PA, AZ and WI will remain blue. Adding FL and TX to the mix only ensures that progressives remain in control.  You can’t be okay with that!?
1337828834754891779 2020-12-13 02:37:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @N1ckSandmann Look what happened to GA after big tech &amp; the media flooded their state. Now other big tech &amp; media giants are fleeing to FL and TX. I believe in 2024 those states will not be as reliably red as they were in 2020. I also believe it is part of the plan.
1337827809486643206 2020-12-13 02:33:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @N1ckSandmann Soon states like MI, PA, AZ and WI will resemble OR, WA and CA. Which states will be up for grab in 2024? How many states will even come close to resembling red states?
1337826843467145218 2020-12-13 02:29:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @N1ckSandmann Because make no mistake, Biden will not last a full term. Once a progressive woman with zero skills is in the Oval Office, everyone she owes her false successes to gets a say in the way our government is ran.
1337825987237720066 2020-12-13 02:25:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @N1ckSandmann Do we wait until all states are under democrat rules before this is a good idea? I think the question here is, what happens if our votes no longer count. It may be limited to a few states right now, but imagine how that might change under a Harris administration
1337824300431269894 2020-12-13 02:19:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @bsmitch007 Food don’t get shipped, potholes don’t get filled, vehicles don’t get repaired, medicine don’t get delivered.

1337228145708109824 2020-12-11 10:50:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @amandacarpenter Or we can just say your state entered a contract with multiple states &amp; broke that contract which resulted in a loss of shares in those states.
1337226922107944962 2020-12-11 10:45:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @amandacarpenter It works something like this. Say you build a structure that falls into my house, I can sue you. Now say you fly a structure that wipes our 2 states, both states can sue you. Now let’s say said structure belongs to your state
1337223900271423494 2020-12-11 10:33:16 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo The states can’t ignore their voters, that’s all there is to it. The voters flooded their voicemail &amp; email demanding that the election be investigated. We were told it would take weeks to learn the outcome, how did you think 75 M would act seeing this in just days!?  https://t.co/tEbScPEREv
1337218549304209413 2020-12-11 10:12:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @KatDelT @tirebob We have no choice but share this important election with every state. We should expect every state to enforce the integrity of their state’s voting processes so not to undermine the votes that come out of states who didn’t change their voting laws during an election year
1337216826074337282 2020-12-11 10:05:10 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @KatDelT @tirebob I think I speak for a lot of voters when I say I feel like my vote was watered down by states who changed their voting laws during the election year. They knowingly opened up the possibility for voting fraud, and by doing so the Presidential election fraud.
1337216270232674304 2020-12-11 10:02:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @KatDelT @tirebob Ted is awesome, but I’m afraid having him speak will appear to be an argument from the Party. I feel like the only way to win is if we voters represent ourselves in some regard.
1337215653372162055 2020-12-11 10:00:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @KatDelT @tirebob My thought is this. I’d like to see the case come from a citizen or citizens. This lawsuit is about the voters, and there’s no better way to show this than have some voters present to speak.
1337215117956706305 2020-12-11 09:58:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LLinWood @theunitedfree @tedcruz Most people want to do the right thing. This is going to come down to those people who were told to do things they may not have believed were a big deal. When people like that are facing their peers, they tend to want to tell what they felt was wrong
1337213967249383424 2020-12-11 09:53:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LLinWood @theunitedfree @tedcruz Then, and only then if there’s no evidence then I’ll move on. However if there’s a single case that was directed at a high level, we have a bigger problem
1337213618526560257 2020-12-11 09:52:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LLinWood @theunitedfree @tedcruz I’d like to ask the witness for the defense, were they directed to maintain 6 feet from observers and if so by whom.  I’d want the name of every person working the counting locations and do a full interview
1337213091512201217 2020-12-11 09:50:19 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LLinWood @theunitedfree @tedcruz I want to see if there are any indications of a secondary application running in the background and if so, what was its purpose. I want to see if at any point data was downloaded to or uploaded from a removable disk. If so, if so, where did the data from the latter go?
1337212270217211904 2020-12-11 09:47:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LLinWood @theunitedfree @tedcruz I’d like to see if there was ever any EDI transactions. I’d also like to look at the transactions of those tabulations and see if 1, any votes were removed for either candidate 2, if so where did they go.
1337211569600679937 2020-12-11 09:44:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LLinWood @theunitedfree @tedcruz As a citizen I’d like to hire my own team of people to validate voters 1, live where they voted, 2, are alive 3, are aware they voted 4, how their votes were recorded.  Then I’d like to hire my own IT developer to review the voting machines.
1337210885002186754 2020-12-11 09:41:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LLinWood @theunitedfree @tedcruz Now we see these impossible scenarios, but have never been granted access to the machines. We’ve (the voters) never been allowed to validate counts to tabulations. We’ve never been allowed to hear why ANTIFA/BLM was hired bouncers, we haven’t even got to witness a few of them.
1337210068463443968 2020-12-11 09:38:19 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LLinWood @theunitedfree @tedcruz We all went to bed, set our alarms for 5 AM so we wouldn’t miss counting. When we woke up and as soon as they began counting again, somehow the other candidate took a big lead. See, when I went to bed I told my husband they’re bringing in ballots or they wouldn’t have stopped.
1337209351916941312 2020-12-11 09:35:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LLinWood @theunitedfree @tedcruz Over 74 million people voted and were up watching the counts. As their candidate was leading by a good spread, they stopped counting in 4 battleground states.
1337208635093622793 2020-12-11 09:32:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LLinWood @theunitedfree @tedcruz Here’s my truth. It is no longer about either candidate, it is about being given a candidate that 1, nobody wanted and 2, there’s a chance he didn’t win the election. My argument is this,
1337207809251946496 2020-12-11 09:29:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LLinWood @theunitedfree @tedcruz I’d like to join the lawsuit

No matter the outcome, all voters from both parties deserve to know that no state will nullify their vote with bad practices. I think this is good
1336859638399184897 2020-12-10 10:25:50 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @imjdsharp That’s good because AZ went for Biden. This needs to be about all voters, not about a candidate or party. Everyone has a right to believe their votes are not compromised by other states.

1336508751856201734 2020-12-09 11:11:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> We call @CNN @NBCNews @ABC for gaslighting all summer by telling us ANTIFA/BLM was just an idea. Now they try turning the tables. Can’t they come up with something original? by the way this is gaslighting. There is no “office of president elect”. It’s #propaganda #Gaslighting  https://t.co/S8L8ewrCUe

1336507090148405250 2020-12-09 11:04:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy Trump needs to change course now, he will not lose support. He needs to admit that covid is a scam used to 1, steal an election then 2, bring in socialism. He needs to say that the vaccines are a choice and no state or corporation can legally mandate them. Same with masks.

1336153944981188608 2020-12-08 11:41:39 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @lmagri13 @seanhannity Be honest with us. What did you do with your first stimulus check? I know 3 families who wasted theirs, I’ve paid one of their car payments 4 times since March. Another was finally evicted for not paying rent sine April. Their rent was $600, they could’ve had 2 extra months.
1336152833989677056 2020-12-08 11:37:14 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @seanhannity @Cynthia_Jeanne3 Besides, how long has it been! It is high time people start learning to move on. The government isn’t supposed to be your lifeline, and they’re not going to be so people better have a plan b.

I don’t need some stupid academic survey, I know. I saw people blowing $ &amp; skipping utilities

This is just something the liberal talking heads made up when too many older people started showing up at gay pride rallies. You know, the reason so many gays are for Trump is because cancel culture is trying to cancel gays?

Since each number here represents a vote, there should only be whole numbers.

I tell the program that 108% = 100% because the top operator broke 100%. Each quarter we run a new productivity report, we take the highest % and use the difference to subtract from 100% for the new standard.

Since Trump didn’t do anything at the federal level, Biden will look like the tyrant if he tries to impose a federal mask mandate or lockdowns
1335728318814052355 2020-12-07 07:30:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy Our constitution is pretty clear about state representation.

1335045228055699456 2020-12-05 10:16:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @audreyy_kaye Scotland. My dad once said it’s the most beautiful country he’d ever seen
1335044990343450624 2020-12-05 10:15:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RudyGiuliani This is all great, and I’ve seen &amp; heard enough to make me believe there was quite a bit of fraud going on BUT, I’m not sure where we’re at with it or what to expect from it. Could you clear that up for some of us who may be slow?
1335044389626933249 2020-12-05 10:12:41 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @benshapiro Socialist don’t appreciate upward mobility
1335044212451123204 2020-12-05 10:11:58 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Someone who is advocating for free shit wants to tell us we don’t like hard work. Uh, if that were the case would we be fighting to keep our jobs instead of jumping on the socialism free shit lie?
1335043425520005120 2020-12-05 10:08:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @AOC And the place I waitresses at certainly wasn’t asking for some ‘sparkling’ water!
1335043164235845633 2020-12-05 10:07:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @AOC You ain’t shit! I was a widow with 2 young kids working full time with a part time job waitressing. I still found time to volunteer at church and took my kids with me knocking on doors to campaign. Guess what, I owned my home and never took a dime from the government!
1335041312043769856 2020-12-05 10:00:27 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MichaelCoudrey It is, and we’ve been told to ‘sit back &amp; trust the plan’ while I see nothing happening. How long do we wait on some miracle?
1335040364101726211 2020-12-05 09:56:41 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealBrandonDonk @StormWatchGirl In fact, I’d get ahead of it, get those shirts ordered &amp; start a Facebook group now! Make this an actual protest, for real!
1335040061667160066 2020-12-05 09:55:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealBrandonDonk @StormWatchGirl Nope, they can’t legally shut it down. All parents need to keep taking their kids to this, buy them all matching shirts that say something like ‘justice for kids’ and load videos, call news stations, etc.. Don’t stop, it will take root and others will follow!
1335038695922151425 2020-12-05 09:50:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden You literally abused your adopted dog!
1335033025764208641 2020-12-05 09:27:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Remember @TheDemocrats and the liberal media told us that ANTIFA/BLM didn’t exist and the riots were peaceful. They tell us we need to close the economy for a virus with a 99.9% recovery rate. They tell us we don’t need to audit an election with the largest turnout in history!
1335031983479664640 2020-12-05 09:23:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jaketapper You know why MAGA is so big? Because you liberal talking heads don’t know when to shut up! We want less government, not more. We don’t want socialism, we want to be willfully employed under capitalism. Not everyone gets paid to tweet!
1335031411636629504 2020-12-05 09:21:06 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @lisalaurenhere @jaketapper For God sake, you guys are truly insane!
1335031148125319168 2020-12-05 09:20:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @KMDRforOHIO I think we already have one, we call it MAGA, but I think MAGA goes much deeper than Trump. I think MAGA is the new Party
1335029926433591296 2020-12-05 09:15:12 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @momto2lowballs @JuliansRum Yep, I was working in that area for 3 days and one of those days the highway was shutdown from an accident

1335027497373741056 2020-12-05 09:05:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jakecoco Start by taking off the mask. I have no sympathy for anyone who gives an inch on this hoax of a virus. No masks, open your business and keep opening it until they arrest you. When you bond out, open it again.  Rinse &amp; repeat
1335026281084317696 2020-12-05 09:00:43 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> wtf, really WTF is wrong with everyone not questioning this!?

1335015319878897665 2020-12-05 08:17:10 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @FederRenea @nypost I think it’s more likely he had an ‘episode’ and knew someone would find out about his trip to the hospital so they used the dog to cover it up. Remember it started with ‘playing with the dog’, then the whole shower thing.
1335014719078490113 2020-12-05 08:14:47 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Pistonsbadboy22 @nypost Embarrassing!? Who pulls a f’ing dogs tail? That’s f’ing cruel!
1335014473975930880 2020-12-05 08:13:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Give me 30 minutes with someone and they’re more likely to catch conservatism from me than covid. That’s why they want us 6 ft apart &amp; wearing masks!
1335013888342028290 2020-12-05 08:11:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @williamlegate @charliekirk11 ‘Lives of their employees’ What a stupid f’ing statement. There’s a 99.9% recovery rate. You’re more likely to catch conservatism from me than covid, that’s why they want distance &amp; masks!
1335013228703834117 2020-12-05 08:08:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Silvergt @superma81301234 @RichardGrenell Not as close as Bill &amp; Hillary. If Trump caused Epstein’s suicide it would be all over MSM. Since it’s not, well you can do the process of elimination. By the way, there isn’t a Trump body count, just saying
1335010975230140417 2020-12-05 07:59:54 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Jim_Jordan In case you didn’t notice, Merry Christmas was canceled under Obama. When’s the last time you saw Merry Christmas in the department stores?
1335009568217321473 2020-12-05 07:54:18 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Our history books will tell us that 2020 was the year the MAGA Party was formed. @realDonaldTrump brought it to life, but it will go on as long as there’s a need to clean up Washington
1335006611631443968 2020-12-05 07:42:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @gatewaypundit @Cynthia_Jeanne3 @newsmax @GabrielSterling I can deal with a good debate, I won’t listen to lies about a stupid virus that should have 0 affect on the majority of the population
1335006363492216834 2020-12-05 07:41:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @gatewaypundit @Cynthia_Jeanne3 @newsmax @GabrielSterling I broke away from cable news because of the extensive coverage of coronavirus. I’m a firm believer that if it weren’t for MSM we wouldn’t know there was a virus. @newsmax has started covering the virus now so it’s a hard pass for me
1335004008084287489 2020-12-05 07:32:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @amandacarpenter Not good that the government is doing its job by enforcing voting laws? No, what wouldn’t be good is to ignore this and for the media to ignore it. Are you brave enough to disagree with your handlers?
1335002510692593669 2020-12-05 07:26:16 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Will there be another stimulus for people who won’t take the vaccine &amp; lose their jobs?
1335001881425403906 2020-12-05 07:23:46 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I personally would like to know why @JoeBiden was pulling his dogs tail! That’s just horrible 💔 he shouldn’t be allowed to own pets!
1334995107813134341 2020-12-05 06:56:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @kirstiealley And where schools are shutdown, no property taxes!
1334989303307530241 2020-12-05 06:33:47 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Whenever someone tries to convince me that the election wasn’t stolen from @realDonaldTrump I think of covid. If there’s any evidence at all, it’s the massive restrictions and changes in voting laws that resulted from a virus with a 99.9% recovery rate!
1334988554351603715 2020-12-05 06:30:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy How do you think a Biden/Harris admin will handle the vaccines? Lockdowns? Mask mandates? Or are you saying we’re taking the easy road and choosing the better of 2 evils?
1334983502622765059 2020-12-05 06:10:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DanCrenshawTX Then just maybe MAGA will ramp up the campaigning in GA. Let’s be honest, the GOP needs MAGA now more than ever. And I’m not talking about Trump, he just gave rise to the MAGA movement.
1334982145538977792 2020-12-05 06:05:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DanCrenshawTX So the only choice we have is to give those voters what they’re asking for. A full investigation and a full audit of the 2020 votes. And as a candidate who was elected BECAUSE of the MAGA movement, you owe the voters your full MAGA support!
1334981001005719556 2020-12-05 06:00:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DanCrenshawTX And for many of those donors, it was their first time donating to campaigns period. You don’t think we’re feeling a bit let down? We’re not asking you to say ‘oh yeah there’s definitely fraud’. We just want you to say ‘Biden cannot be president if there’s fraud’
1334980443553234944 2020-12-05 05:58:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DanCrenshawTX Not all of those donors cared if you won, they donated because Trump endorsed you. An endorsement from Trump led us to believe you too were against the corrupt establishment, that’s why we donated to your campaign.
1334979703631998977 2020-12-05 05:55:38 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DanCrenshawTX It’s like this. You may not agree with what the President is doing, you may actually believe that he should secede to Biden, BUT the majority of his 74M voters believe there may have been a great deal of fraud in this election. Many of those voters also donated to your campaign
1334973908290838529 2020-12-05 05:32:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JakeSherman Covid is a freaking swamp joke and a way to line their pockets and win votes. Nothing else.
1334972280221421571 2020-12-05 05:26:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ImaSwmchick @books_beaches Nothing, he had a bad mental episode and his family had to call for medical help. The dog thing is a cover up
1334971876112740353 2020-12-05 05:24:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT We’re f$cked
1334971668410888192 2020-12-05 05:23:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @aaronjcarpenter But...do you wear a mask?
1334971424793120768 2020-12-05 05:22:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy Because if we’re being honest, there are even some conservative voters who faithfully wear their masks because they watch cable news. Once this virus was labeled as a pandemic, he had no choice but find vaccines. Not sure what else he could’ve done without being impeached
1334970366771539971 2020-12-05 05:18:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy In the very beginning Trump was silent about covid because he knew it for what it is. Unfortunately too many people let MSM install fear, so he really had no choice but address it. Had he continued to ignore it, he would’ve definitely been impeached.
1334968152409698310 2020-12-05 05:09:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @BernieSanders Just let people go back to work. The recovery rate is 99.9%, pretty sure you’ll be ok.  Jesus, it’s not rocket science
1334962962017214464 2020-12-05 04:49:07 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> When democrats lie, they just keep adding to their lies until they’re just ridiculous
1334962461477384204 2020-12-05 04:47:07 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @benshapiro He’s a damn liar. 1, dogs don’t typically wait for people to get out of the shower. 2, the dog is an adult dog, if he were being pursued, he probably wouldn’t have given chase. Joe had a bad episode &amp; his family sought medical attention. They lied to cover it up!
1334956750915710987 2020-12-05 04:24:26 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> We’re supposed to believe that 77% of Americans between 18 and 80 voted in 2020
1334955506104995841 2020-12-05 04:19:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @INFJLOVE Nope
1334954881308880899 2020-12-05 04:17:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @BlairBrandt @MTJen_ But will it be granted?
1334954367754121216 2020-12-05 04:14:58 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MacDeMagnet @1983JPK I’m sorry, but she’d be more effective with a bit more humility. She makes a compelling argument but needs to be smoother on delivery

1334951624511459330 2020-12-05 04:04:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @henryrodgersdc @greg_price11 Why wouldn’t we start by having drug courts in all states? This seems like putting the cart b4 the horse. Our representatives are so out of touch, this just proves how little they understand about legalizing drugs!
1334950506985377794 2020-12-05 03:59:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> If Biden is inaugurated as the 46th president, Kamala Harris will be 47 by this time next year. By 2022 our 2A will be under fire. If we don’t win the 2 GA seats, they will pack the courts and 2020 will feel like ‘good ole days’.

1334354470503899137 2020-12-03 12:31:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @IlhanMN Yeah, like my neighbors who didn’t pay rent for 13 months. Now the homeowners are in foreclosure &amp; they HAVE to move.  So think before you withhold your rent if you can afford to pay it
1334353955158183938 2020-12-03 12:29:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump you need to reign in the legal team telling people not to vote in this GA race! We need those seats!
1334351978835701761 2020-12-03 12:21:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy @LLinWood @ali Right now our SCOTUS saves our 2A. If dems take both the senate and the presidency, there’s a huge risk in losing that. They’ll pack the courts, we’d be fucked for years to come..if not forever!
1334346737419489282 2020-12-03 12:00:27 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @GreenCastleGo @LLinWood Before or after he told you to hand the senate to the dems? Please, do NOT sit the GA vote out! We need those seats, our lives depend on it!
1334346250725052417 2020-12-03 11:58:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Dago70_2 @TaraRenee911 @LLinWood VOTE Republican no matter how upset you might be. Your life literally depends on those seats
1334346053349478402 2020-12-03 11:57:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Dago70_2 @TaraRenee911 @LLinWood Do NOT, I repeat do NOT listen to @LLinWood  I do not trust him! Losing the senate would most definitely result in packing the courts &amp; picking up states. There’d be no way back after that
1334344991083212801 2020-12-03 11:53:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @m_keenum Hooray for them! I’m so glad they showed up to support the business!
1334344543517499394 2020-12-03 11:51:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino Someone needs to get Lin Wood away from the Trump team. He’s a fake!
1334344062573416456 2020-12-03 11:49:50 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ScottBaio Why are people so mad you aren’t broke? Hell, I’m not rich but I’ll be retiring at 58 because 1, I’ve paid my house down enough 2, I saved in my retirement funds. It’s not hard!
1334343281250082816 2020-12-03 11:46:43 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ScottBaio The average American CAN afford to golf, it’s just not for everyone. My son golfed on a military salary, anyone can
1334339162246443009 2020-12-03 11:30:21 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @EWErickson I don’t think Lin Wood is really on our side
1334286388070649857 2020-12-03 08:00:39 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Acosta Poor Jim, that time of month again
1334282309122600963 2020-12-03 07:44:26 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @stillgray Lin Wood is doing the same!
1334281553590054913 2020-12-03 07:41:26 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Do NOT boycott the election! That would be the nail in the coffin
1334280996519358465 2020-12-03 07:39:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino I want Lin Wood to stop telling people not to vote for republicans in the GA race. Dudes straight batting for the other team!
1334280086481154048 2020-12-03 07:35:36 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @EWErickson Yeah, and advising republicans to sit this one out is a SUPER BAD idea. Wood is definitely batting for the other team
1334279343061798913 2020-12-03 07:32:39 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @SammySammyStagg Hard pass. I’ll take my chanced on that 99.9% recovery rate
1334272809703444482 2020-12-03 07:06:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @SammySammyStagg Look at what happened after the HPV vaccine. Drug addiction soared

1334246232152289280 2020-12-03 05:21:05 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @aubrey_huff I was a single mom of a really awesome boy. I dated a couple of single guys that I met at little league games.  Maybe it depends on the structure? I never had a problem finding a sitter, and my son was just an easy going kid.
1334241408178327553 2020-12-03 05:01:55 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ElectLucy @donaldbroom They’re jumping on the covid train! I’m already disappointed
1334240922507366402 2020-12-03 04:59:59 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT Wonder how many will check that ‘exempt’ box on their payroll info form?
1334239242831147008 2020-12-03 04:53:19 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Like everyone else, I became a fan of @newsmax on election night. However here lately I’m seeing way too much covid news. If I wanted a constant reminder of a stupid virus, I’d still be watching the same ole MSM!

1333965904707788800 2020-12-02 10:47:10 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> We’re supposed to believe 76% of the voting population actually voted 🙄 This includes all age groups between 18 and 80.
1333965136260980739 2020-12-02 10:44:07 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy I honestly don’t think this administration is pushing for mandatory vaccines. Are they pushing vaccines? Yes, but I think the feel cornered. Damned if ya do, damned if ya don’t
1333964568893255681 2020-12-02 10:41:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CalebJHull What he finds horrifying I find exhilarating!

1333864709171326978 2020-12-02 04:05:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Why do so many people rely on the government for help? When you take handouts from the government, you open up your life to them. Do people really choose to answer to the government?
1333863847418093570 2020-12-02 04:01:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden I can help myself, no one should ever rely on the government for help.

1333531340390723584 2020-12-01 06:00:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy Sorry, I don’t watch CNN (or any cable news).  I honestly don’t feel like anything is going to change the outcome of the election (although I’d love to be wrong). The one positive I see in all this, many more people will pay attention to our politics in the future.

Sitting out the actual election could potentially fuck America FOREVER. Seems a better strategy would be placing boots on the ground BEFORE counting starts
1333212160189673476 2020-11-30 08:52:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy If you’re waiting on some government to save you, you’ve already forgotten you are the government.  Don’t own a mask Walk into businesses without a mask If asked to put on a mask, ignore them Keep buying local, a quick phone call will prove that some small businesses are open

1333158369436327937 2020-11-30 05:18:18 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy And because of that, they’ll blame everyone from their city councilman to the president for shutdowns and mask mandates.  If we’re going to beat this, we have to do it as free citizens, period
1333157353135493120 2020-11-30 05:14:16 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy And I’m willing to bet that you’ve put on a mask to go into a place of business recently. If that’s the case, you’re as guilty as those who cling to their mask. It’s a simple fact, people aren’t willing to give up certain privileges.
1333156595493179396 2020-11-30 05:11:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy Many republicans miraculously got &amp; beat covid just weeks leading up to the election. I don’t believe in coincidences. I’m certain this was an attempt to prove the hoax, unfortunately there’s already too many people clinging to the covid gloom &amp; doom.
1333155959141765123 2020-11-30 05:08:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy Nothing anyone could’ve done in regards to covid would’ve been right because it’s a hoax that every globalist is involved in. There’s no way Trump could single handily stop what was happening, it is impossible to prove it doesn’t exist at the level ‘they’ want us to believe
1333153390445158401 2020-11-30 04:58:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @SharylAttkisson @LLinWood I agree, and I keep hearing they’re part of the swamp, but as a trainer I know that in order for a whole team to fail, no one on the team can want to succeed. All this back and forth has me questioning the competency of everyone involved!
1333152485201113089 2020-11-30 04:54:55 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LLinWood I think I speak for a lot of the MAGA team, either shit or get off the pot. I’m no attorney, but I’m pretty sure getting a court order to preserve evidence should’ve been first on any attorneys checklist
1333151891530846208 2020-11-30 04:52:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LLinWood I think the idea that a team of well known attorneys can’t succeed in preserving something so important as evidence seems ridiculous. Dragging it out isn’t helping. It’s like we keep getting fed pieces of evidence accompanied by legal jargon, but never the promised ‘bombshell’
1333150589606371328 2020-11-30 04:47:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LLinWood I’m pretty confused, which makes me think someone wants me to stay confused. Either the entire legal system in this country is excusing voter fraud or a smaller part of the legal system is having a difficult time proving it.
1333145031734161408 2020-11-30 04:25:18 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @777Shoe @PiamentaShimon It has a the face of a human, but wrinkled.
1333144611917877254 2020-11-30 04:23:38 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @777Shoe @PiamentaShimon I saw something I could only describe as a very skinny naked human standing on all fours in the median. Personally I don’t care if anyone believes me, I know what I saw and it was fucking creepy! I saw it so clearly I can describe the wrinkles in its skin.

See, I’ve never been racist in my life so I don’t feel the overwhelming need to apologize.  That’s the difference between the ‘woke’ crowd &amp; the rest of us, we’re not guilty!

1331623636726378497 2020-11-25 23:39:50 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Church is like a community.

That’s why they don’t want you in church

1331408126835380228 2020-11-25 09:23:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy Everyone should look into this in their communities. We picked the Mexican restaurant and first because they have 6 children. Hoping if it works out, we can help save businesses. Next it’s the Pancake House!
1331407570163163138 2020-11-25 09:21:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy We are gradually trying to get them as much business as possible without the health department or some shit. As long as we rent the space, we become responsible for crowd control but it’s more like a family party than normal business.
1331407142335680512 2020-11-25 09:19:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy Our next move is a local Mexican restaurant. They’ve been around about 10 years. We keep doing curbside, but their liquor sales is hurting. I’m going to see if we can ‘rent’ the place for a small party, then pass the baton to another in our group.
1331406598749769729 2020-11-25 09:17:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy We also have a small bakery/cafe. Every Wednesday we go for donuts. We used to just pick them up, but the owner started brewing fresh coffee as a symbol of welcome. Now we all sit &amp; have coffee &amp; a donut. Some of our own officers enjoy it too (on the house).
1331406035148566529 2020-11-25 09:15:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy So if you’re in a place of business, know that you’re not the only one who hates the masks. Have the courage to unmask, I almost guarantee you others will follow.  This is where we started.
1331405611918090240 2020-11-25 09:13:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy I feel so blessed to live in a town that takes them or leaves them. Masks are about 50/50 at our stores. I do see fewer people wearing them each time, I think they need encouragement so when they see others it’s masks off.

1331401551089426432 2020-11-25 08:57:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy There’s a movement, it’s the MAGA movement. This movement is no longer about Trump, it is about making America great again. That movement will continue, I have no doubt. It just took a President who wasn’t afraid to fight to start the movement.

1330579897409040384 2020-11-23 02:32:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @stillgray Honestly, couldn’t they just have an IT guru run a transaction history for the vote counts to see if there was truly any data dumps or count switches? It just seems like that would be a reasonable way to prove to everyone whether or not it really happened

1330210287446847490 2020-11-22 02:03:41 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealCandaceO @kenniciagreg So instead of a 100 unit apartment complex, they’ll have 200 unit complexes. Children will sleep in 6X6 rooms, family gatherings will be limited due to space. Since these units will heavily rely on solar, there’ll be many hot summer days, cold winter nights. With tiny windows.

Do enlighten us, what is the real danger in America if we bring the troops home, other than the government funneling billions of dollars toward ‘war efforts’? Don’t be a RINO!
1329456289433460736 2020-11-20 00:07:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy I think a lot of governors would prefer not to go into another lockdown, but are looking at the long term possibility of losing their ability to govern at the state level.  That’s just my opinion 🤷‍♀️
1329455634962657282 2020-11-20 00:04:58 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy I am amazed at the level of ignorance in this country. We are seeing red states start to go into lockdowns and voters are furious. However the likely reason why is to stop the federal government from enforcing a national mandate. Once that happens, states start to lose power.
1329454131757649923 2020-11-19 23:58:59 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy People need to understand that it’s more dangerous for the President to impose laws on states than allowing states to govern themselves. That’s how dictatorships take root. Biden’s plan is nationalism, plain &amp; simple. Any national mandates will cross the line into a dictatorship.
1329452586634768384 2020-11-19 23:52:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RachelM4JESUS @LegendaryEnergy However since the media insists on telling us that masks may not be enough, that in itself could be a good enough angle. Beat them at their own game. ‘I’m scared, therefore I can’t go to work’
1329452129854087168 2020-11-19 23:51:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RachelM4JESUS @LegendaryEnergy If you’re required to wear a mask to work, find legal ways of avoiding it. There are some health concerns regarding the over use of masks. One way to combat this is insisting the company provide associates with masks. Masks should also be changed multiple times per day.
1329451458958389254 2020-11-19 23:48:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RachelM4JESUS @LegendaryEnergy If your bread isn’t the freshest, make them change it out. Order individual fruits &amp; veggies rather than bulk. Again, be picky with the product.  When doing curbside dining, use small local businesses. Avoid big restaurant chains. Here is where your tips should go.
1329450800352022532 2020-11-19 23:45:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RachelM4JESUS @LegendaryEnergy Don’t tip. I know it sounds harsh, but it’s a way to grow the movement. People who profit may be inclined to side with the mandates. Use coupons, as many as you can. Take your time when picking up your items. Check and double check.
1329450339532214276 2020-11-19 23:43:55 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RachelM4JESUS @LegendaryEnergy If you’re part of a larger group of people, make sure you all stick together and don’t wear masks. Be prepared to be uncomfortable, you may be denied access to some places. Don’t use apps to order food &amp; necessities, flood their phones with curbside orders. Pay with cash
1329449692409769990 2020-11-19 23:41:21 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RachelM4JESUS @LegendaryEnergy First, you really don’t want the President to have power over your state. That’s how nationalism is created. America is a country that prides itself in state governments. The only way to defeat a state mandate is to rESisT it. But you can’t do it alone.

1329136547346702337 2020-11-19 02:57:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @bhol94 @catturd2 There was a time when students worked on campuses to help toward their tuition. But of course now they’d call that ‘slavery’
1329135769701724161 2020-11-19 02:53:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Why is there graffiti for China in Portland Oregon? No joke, I saw it in multiple places driving down the interstates!

The second is watching people in Portland step over discarded needles through throngs of homeless people while wearing masks

There’s as much poverty in rural America, which is what brought over 72 legitimate voters out to vote! Next time, try thinking of America as a whole. You might do better!

When people’s livelihoods are threatened, they tend to comply. If people aren’t even willing to take small steps, how can I believe they’ll take a giant leap?
1328104827004596225 2020-11-16 06:37:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @aaronjcarpenter My mother once told me that power corrupts the soul, and there is a very fine line between justice and power 🤷‍♀️

1328062874871357441 2020-11-16 03:50:38 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @atzuniga @DanScavino So if they’re really about helping people, then why are they planning to build more apartment complexes with smaller but more units? Of course they’ll tell you it’s for a global society, but let’s be honest, it’s about building up their voter rolls.
1328062102603505665 2020-11-16 03:47:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @atzuniga @DanScavino Do you think it’s just a coincidence that the democrats get the most votes in inner cities where there’s more low income housing and crime? Instead of offering opportunity to families to move toward home ownership they give them incentives to remain in low income apartments!
1328061217387270146 2020-11-16 03:44:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @atzuniga @DanScavino Only one party is trying to destroy the backbone of America and it’s definitely not Trump voters.  Those people you see, they spent their own money to rally to save this country. The only change they’re seeking is an honest government. This should be something everyone wants
1328056678462476288 2020-11-16 03:26:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @SinclaireU @sequinpants @ABC You know how to put down a conspiracy, transparency. An audit shouldn’t have to be won, it should be a given. It’s not the President who wants the audit, it’s the voters. Maybe it’s them who should start filing lawsuits?
1328054893286928385 2020-11-16 03:18:55 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @BenjiBacker What’s more frightening, the media thinking people are stupid enough not to question this, people actually believing it, or Joe who’s been in politics 47 years playing along? When did America start allowing propaganda to play a role in our politics? This is just scary!  https://t.co/9JEDNlkZZD
1328053789149028352 2020-11-16 03:14:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @BenjiBacker And their vote went to the President. If you quietly sit back and allow a process to be denied, and quite possibly an unfair election, how long do you think elections will still take place in this country. If you’re a conservative, you should care about this.
1328052890666217472 2020-11-16 03:10:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @BenjiBacker People who didn’t really care in 2016 were determined in 2020. When asked why, they said it started with Kavanaugh and only grew with the Russia hoax. The impeachment and covid was the last straw. The majority of the seniors I spoke to were more determined to vote this year.
1328051807315238917 2020-11-16 03:06:39 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @BenjiBacker The democrats and MSM spent 4 years attacking what they believed was the President, but what they were really doing was attacking everyone who voted for him. Those attacks only increased his support over the 4 years, trust me I went door knocking.
1328051257156784128 2020-11-16 03:04:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @BenjiBacker And don’t forget, we were all told it would be weeks before we knew the results, but within days the propaganda came heavy from the democrats and MSM. Did they all just think we’re too stupid to question this?  https://t.co/0IVlTDkR5H
1328050164679004160 2020-11-16 03:00:07 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @BenjiBacker There are 73 million people who want nothing more than full transparency in this election. There’s one party fighting against this. What the President is doing is NOT the reason people believe the election was rigged, it’s the complete and utter resistance against transparency!

1328037438275653634 2020-11-16 02:09:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Jim_Jordan If the democrats think this is JUST about the presidency, they’re wrong. We want transparency, we want an audit, and we want our President to finish what he started, draining the swamp! We the people are sick and tired of being manipulated by politicians and MSM.

Would you trust a financial institution that opposes an audit? Shouting I didn’t cheat while hiding the scorecard is not a good way to prove a fair game.

It seems to a lot of people that democrats can just about buy anything these days.  A legitimate question for everyone to ask is WHO is so invested in the democrat party to go this far?
1328025218254778373 2020-11-16 01:21:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @PeteButtigieg There was an overwhelming emphasis informing everyone that it would take weeks to call the winner, so what’s the hurry? The electoral colleges don’t even meet until December, or perhaps that’s the reason the democrats are so strongly opposing an all out audit?

Instead they anticipate a rise in low income areas, why?  Anyone who lives in low income housing should be paying close attention to the silent parts being spoken out loud.

This sounds a lot like jail, only slightly more free. But the end game is clear, to increase votes. Democrats have been in control in our most vulnerable neighborhoods for decades
1327685962072285184 2020-11-15 02:52:55 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Brimshack @BillyDi83775046 @KamVTV 4/ When you really analyze this, what it comes down to is this. Children will be sleeping in 6X6 rooms. Kitchens/dining areas will be non existent. The smaller units will make it impossible for family gatherings. Being mostly solar will lead to hotter summer days.

These units will be smaller, with smaller rooms, smaller windows. They will also be mostly solar.

These new complexes will be smaller, with tiny windows (his exact words). They’ll be ran mostly on solar.

1327461214260260864 2020-11-14 11:59:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CalebJHull 3/ But they never once asked, nor cared what made us choose him, or what policies benefit us.

1327375851978153986 2020-11-14 06:20:39 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I saved my grandson a ‘future voter’ sticker. I didn’t have the heart to give it to him because I’m so afraid it’s not true 💔🇺🇸
1327373087457882117 2020-11-14 06:09:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> There should be repercussions for such a dangerous lie! Anyone can go watch watch the WH briefing and see what the President said!

1327372067898085376 2020-11-14 06:05:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TurdlessF @JvittalTV This is the problem, the President didn’t say any such thing. He said that the governor has stated he will not give it to his citizens and in good conscience he could not send millions of doses where they won’t be given to the citizens.
1327371376945139712 2020-11-14 06:02:52 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JvittalTV LIAR  Stop trying to gaslight people. He said the governor said he wouldn’t give it to his people so in good conscience he couldn’t just send the vaccine to NY and not reach its citizens. He also said it’s disheartening that the governor would deny it to the citizens of NY!

1327107803438256130 2020-11-13 12:35:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @catturd2 The funny part is when I told my mom about it she said ‘welcome to socialized healthcare’. 😳
1327107011000082432 2020-11-13 12:32:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @catturd2 No meds, just take OTC. I ended up eating my dogs antibiotics when I started waking up with a bloody nose &amp; still had a fever after 6 days. The test came back negative! Thank god for the dogs meds, I had pneumonia! Yes, I got the dog new antibiotics once I could drive again
1327106023103074304 2020-11-13 12:28:27 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @catturd2 Personally I’m looking into filing some kind of charges. I had a horrible cold, when I went to the doctor I literally drove through a tent &amp; they stuck a q-tip up my nose. Sent me home with 101.2 temp &amp; said stay home until we ger the test back.
1327105372574855174 2020-11-13 12:25:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @catturd2 I don’t believe all the deaths listed as covid are really covid. I think the tests are designed to return false negatives to keep doctors believing they’re ‘doing the right thing’. Believe me, you don’t shut down a country for a virus with 99.8% recovery rate.
1327104721862225920 2020-11-13 12:23:16 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @catturd2 Coronavirus is the alternate propaganda so people don’t question this propaganda 👇  https://t.co/4YLYupDic8

This sounded a lot like a jail to me 💔only a little more free (since democrat cities can’t control their police) They’re basically stacking up votes, while the most vulnerable suffer!
1327101592596779009 2020-11-13 12:10:50 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ScottPresler 3/ the new low income apartments will be much smaller but they’ll have more tenants per complex. The units will be small, and smaller windows will mean less sunlight. With solar, there will be many hot summer days, cold winter nights. Children will be sleeping in a 6x6 room
1327100834283278336 2020-11-13 12:07:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ScottPresler 2/ when Joe got into details about the ‘green’ housing complexes, my stomach dropped. He said they’d build a bunch of complexes more energy efficient. They’d be smaller units with smaller windows and rely on solar. What this really means is this
1327099600617017344 2020-11-13 12:02:55 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ScottPresler 1/ Scott, talk to people in inner cities. Explain Joes plan on the ‘new building’. Let me explain what I mean. Democrats rely heavily on low income inner city areas because they’re heavily populated. Their largest bas is low income housing areas.

The fact that the democrats even ran with him confirm everything I thought to be true. It’s a power grab, Joes just the Trojan horse.

1327096185367171072 2020-11-13 11:49:21 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ValeriBarnes @EWErickson The media stopped talking about covid until 1, the vote counts for Joe became obviously ridiculous, 2 someone made Joe a stupid little sign so he could make some above ground appearances for propaganda sake.

1327075301743087618 2020-11-13 10:26:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @PeterAlexander More than 72 million voters are being told that the President is fighting to have votes audited. What all us working class ‘chumps’ would like to know is WHY would anyone deny a vote audit. See, outside of blue check fairy land, audits are a norm 🤷‍♀️ So why not just agree?

Since were only 11 votes, I doubt either candidate would care 🤷‍♀️ At this point, I think most people agree there needs to be an audit. Even if ole Joe is elected, it would seem invalid to a lot of people otherwise
1327059082151419909 2020-11-13 09:21:55 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MSNBC Then they won’t mind an audit by an independent party. Over 72 million voters insist.
1327058768807464961 2020-11-13 09:20:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Laurie_in_MA Well I don’t know what business you work in, but it would be a damn shame if people couldn’t get stuff they need...or want

1327058038457577474 2020-11-13 09:17:46 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jaketapper Then they should have no problem with an audit. Over 72 million people voted for the President, we want an audit. The only people who refuse an audit are the ones who broke the processes. FACT

1326730427911073792 2020-11-12 11:35:58 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ChristianWalk1r @JourdainJudette But they’ll have doubled their voter registration by cramming more struggling families on top of each other. Inner cities have been ran by democrats for decades. If they wanted to ‘fix things’ they would’ve done it by now.
1326729913077002240 2020-11-12 11:33:55 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ChristianWalk1r @JourdainJudette In Biden’s debate he talked about building new ‘smaller energy friendly apartment buildings’. What he really meant is they will build complexes with more smaller units that’ll rely on solar. They’ll be hotter in the summer &amp; cold in the winter. Children will sleep in 6x6 ‘rooms’
1326729220773572608 2020-11-12 11:31:10 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ChristianWalk1r @JourdainJudette Democrats get the majority of their votes from inner cities. It’s no mistake that they keep building low income apartments there. They use them like a super PAC. They need the people in those places to vote for them so they keep them dangling with empty promises.

If they really wanted to fix the problem they would. Research the cities where black men &amp; women are being shot, bet they’re all democrat ran cities.

1326722370900520967 2020-11-12 11:03:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @bajinka222 @ReaganWorld Know why democrats get most votes from the inner cities? Because they use low income apartments like a super PAC. Have you been listening to their plan to build ‘small energy efficient buildings for the greater good of the environment’!

Now imagine those same politicians did it to secure an election.  https://t.co/aJjTjHLihf

1326611083772170242 2020-11-12 03:41:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DineshDSouza Imagine millions of people contesting the IRS due to lack of election transparency? I mean, it’s only reasonable that we should have the same transparency for our taxes as we do our elected officials in charge of those taxes right? 🤔 They say I owe $10,000 but I say $0

I hear tens of millions will be contesting the IRS until an official audit is completed on the machines used to count the votes. I mean, how can tax payers feel secure if there’s no transparency across the board?
1326603591889641472 2020-11-12 03:11:58 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino This is the same corrupted political grab that has led us to where we are. Imagine how many such promises from previous administrations are still being upheld? This is the reason the democrats campaigned a mentally unstable man through media propaganda, they can’t afford to lose!
1326600272815271937 2020-11-12 02:58:46 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @kurtimus @RubinReport How many funeral processions are crowding the streets? How often is a hearse coming to collect bodies in your neighborhood? How many sick people are walking around begging for help?

1326593892540624896 2020-11-12 02:33:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @robbystarbuck Should we have confidence in the IRS if the same government’s not willing to audit our votes?
1326593351680987137 2020-11-12 02:31:16 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> So if they’re not willing to be transparent with our elections, should we trust the credibility of the IRS? 🤷‍♀️
1326577517898117120 2020-11-12 01:28:21 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jasooo @robbystarbuck Then MSM and the democrats tell us it will be weeks before we know the results. But! It didn’t take weeks for them to claim a Biden victory? Now they’re upset with us for filing suits for recounts and refusing to acknowledge all of the problems found with the votes
1326576663187120130 2020-11-12 01:24:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jasooo @robbystarbuck The Trump administration finds an effective vaccine, but now MSM act like it’s not good news. They’re starting to sway the success of the vaccine to a proposed Biden administration  Just months leading up to the election the democrats filed suits to change the voting process
1326575994870910977 2020-11-12 01:22:18 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jasooo @robbystarbuck People have committed suicide  People are struggling with depression  Addiction and overdoses have increased  Churches have been closed  Plus so much more over a virus with a 99.8% recovery rate.  MSM went from reporting deaths to cases 24/7, now they’re cutting back on coverage
1326575223475408897 2020-11-12 01:19:14 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jasooo @robbystarbuck We will never forget the Kavanaugh hearings or the impeachment hoax. The most troubling part of 2020 is how democrats and MSM used covid to destroy lives to gain votes.  Businesses were closed permanently  People lost jobs  Kids were kept from schools, parks, etc
1326574293690540032 2020-11-12 01:15:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jasooo @robbystarbuck Yes and no. I’ll never believe that Biden is legitimate because of what has happened since the President took office. There’s been a 4 year campaign against the President and the media played the biggest part. I feel like this election has been compromised on many levels
1326573364991979520 2020-11-12 01:11:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> 👇
1326569815692242949 2020-11-12 00:57:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> MSM is setting a narrative, but my guess is Joe is in much worse shape than they’re admitting. So, they shutdown the country, closed our schools and churches, caused businesses to go under for good, put millions out of work all for a guy who can’t take questions? Let that sink in
1326557538440130563 2020-11-12 00:08:58 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> By time they’re done counting our population is going to increase 20%. Bill Gates better get busy 😂
1326547527445827584 2020-11-11 23:29:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @samstein But I thought Joes supporters outnumbered the Presidents by about 5 million? #Gaslighting
1326547303839133697 2020-11-11 23:28:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> This is propaganda at it’s finest.

This isn’t going well for democrats
1326538475957465089 2020-11-11 22:53:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @amandacarpenter You believe that 5 years of insulting half the working class population would win an election?

I mean, this horrible virus that bankrupted towns, but sick people could stand in line to vote. Why? Covid was a hoax to screw with this election. Fact

1326201959280488448 2020-11-11 00:36:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> So apparently elections have nothing to do with law &amp; order and demanding audits is akin to a war cry?

Mine (and everyone else I know) went down and I’m in the middle bracket.  You can do a simple google search and compare 2016 to 2019 tax brackets 🤦‍♀️. Even low income earnings got a tax cut

However you’ll choose to call this a conspiracy because you let MSM decide your political leanings.

1326161210811822081 2020-11-10 21:54:06 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Blaise_Huskins @SomeBitchIKnow So when they were putting all this shit together, they were surrounded by ‘yes’ men. The President ran a multi million dollar empire, so he has a better understanding of where their weaknesses are.

1325842031793627137 2020-11-10 00:45:47 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @AnthonySabatini I expect my elected officials to stand up for me and my vote, period! I demand transparency!
1325841670995402752 2020-11-10 00:44:21 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @AnthonySabatini That’s why it’s so important to stand with the President. This isn’t just about him, it’s about the integrity of every vote. The government exist to represent the people. The minute that representation is denied, citizens will have no choice but to be heard!
1325840276439633923 2020-11-10 00:38:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @amandacarpenter Now the question is, how will all those families react?
1325839955948605440 2020-11-10 00:37:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @amandacarpenter Now a vaccine against this virus where the shutdowns destroyed more lives than the actual virus has been announced, MSM continue to politicize it rather than celebrate its success. This brings everything into light and you can’t undo what has been done to those people!
1325838877324677121 2020-11-10 00:33:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @amandacarpenter Suddenly MSM claims victory against the President they spent 4 years attacking, and people who couldn’t go vote in person take to the streets to celebrate. MSM reports this as a victory while more bankruptcies are being finalized, more overdoses, more depression.
1325838316399431685 2020-11-10 00:31:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @amandacarpenter Doctors who warned against the lockdowns were silenced by CNN and the rest of MSM, more businesses closed, more suicides, more overdoses yet CNN and MSM failed to report those ‘cases’. Instead they continued to report cases of the virus, blaming the President
1325837749648306178 2020-11-10 00:28:47 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @amandacarpenter Here’s exactly what I see happening in front of my eyes. For months CNN and the rest of MSM have reminded us of daily ‘case counts’ and blamed it on the President. People lost their businesses, suicides increased, drug overdoses increased, depression increased.
1325836469248913408 2020-11-10 00:23:41 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @benshapiro Families who have suffered from the lockdowns need to come out and speak. They need retribution for their losses big time!
1325835861255221249 2020-11-10 00:21:16 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jodikantor Meanwhile families suffer due to the affects of lockdowns and the media’s constant demand that businesses remain closed to save lives. Suicides, drug overdoses, bankruptcies, etc. all in the name of politics! The timing couldn’t be more damming for the democrats!
1325834975380451328 2020-11-10 00:17:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DonaldJTrumpJr Computer programs don’t ‘glitch’. When there’s an engineering error the application stops working. When a component fails in the application the program stops working. When data is input, the program does exactly what it’s told to do. Democrats really do think we’re stupid chumps

1325828932118130691 2020-11-09 23:53:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LibertyBlitz @DavidBCollum This is FAR from over. Their shutdowns have ruined the lives of so many Americans. This was a crime against humanity and someone needs to answer to that.  If the democrats believe this is going to play in their favor they couldn’t be more wrong!
1325824634932105217 2020-11-09 23:36:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DonaldJTrumpJr @StormWatchGirl I won’t stop until they are held accountable for their destruction. One of my family members was in rehab and doing well until the world shutdown. Life has been hell for us the past 3 months! This was a crime against humanity!
1325823364657766403 2020-11-09 23:31:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DonaldJTrumpJr @StormWatchGirl It’s a shame that people didn’t see the destruction the democrats were causing for politics. So many businesses lost, drug overdoses, suicides, drug addiction, depression, the list goes on. The world just sat by and let this propaganda machine destroy their neighbors!

1325623940446904321 2020-11-09 10:19:10 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ginaBoom1yes @ElijahSchaffer And people who want to ‘come together’ truly should put a lot of distance between themselves and crap like this. Since neither Biden, Harris OR MSM have openly addressed ‘the list’, it confirms what we already knew. They’re just a Trojan horse, nothing more.  https://t.co/UdzC4NX8ug

1325106305841967106 2020-11-08 00:02:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @FredTJoseph Except they won’t. It’s the people who pay property taxes that vote on their local school policies. Racism begins in the home. The more you try to influence people’s children the less effective you are. Try a more mature method if you really wanna make a difference.
1325104167690657792 2020-11-07 23:53:47 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> If AOC and the democrats come for us, we can just remove our masks. That’ll put at least 6 feet between us 😂
1325103800521265158 2020-11-07 23:52:19 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @marklevinshow Over 70 million people voted for Trump. I imagine the majority voted in person. I don’t think we have anything to fear by the party that insisted in mail in voting for fear of a virus with a 99.9% recovery rate. Just saying
1325102953359958017 2020-11-07 23:48:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Hey @AOC over 70 million people voted for Trump, most of us voted in person because we’re not afraid of covid. Let that sink in while you’re making your list!  https://t.co/LHtP3nrICL

They’re legalizing hard drugs and defunding our police. This is not about who is in the WH in January, it’s whether or not the WH has any meaning in January!

Who you wonder why ole Joe changed his platform from Build Back Better to The Soul of the Country? Because when they were polling, they found out they were losing voters for their socialist agenda.  Now, google build back better. We’ll wait

Ole Joe, he has a lot of ‘gaffes’, but this one here really takes the cake. If you’ll recall the 2nd debate where Joe tells us of a dark winter. That phrase though!

1324413325808197634 2020-11-06 02:08:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DonaldJTrumpJr Nor were they changing voting laws the same year as an election. That should’ve NEVER been allowed.  This just confirms my belief that this virus was all about politics! Prove me wrong!  https://t.co/B0BIL8V0vu
1324412644795817986 2020-11-06 02:05:55 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Remember the democrats pushing for additional postal workers, but not a word about additional staff for actually counting all those ballots!

1324388856498704401 2020-11-06 00:31:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> A Biden presidency would be a Harris presidency by Easter. The squad will move in and churches will burn on Easter as millions kneel to celebrate the rising of Christ. Look around the globe, they’re attacking Christianity everywhere!
1324387991578644480 2020-11-06 00:27:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @UnifiedSubtext Without a Trump win we’ll have a Harris presidency by Easter. The squad will move in and churches will be burning on Easter as millions of people kneel to celebrate rising of Christ. Think I’m crazy?
1324387052792745984 2020-11-06 00:24:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @BryanLlenas No voter ID? In 2020 you can’t enforce voter ID? Why?  I’m sorry but I have a hard time trusting any state who is against something so simple as voter ID in a time where you can pay for a soda by scanning your phone!

We’re still a red state but our capital elected a democrat mayor a while back. As you might imagine, that county has gone to shit &amp; property value decreased!
1324073652657283074 2020-11-05 03:38:53 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> We are too great of a country and this is an injustice to the people, regardless of how they voted. We should never be waiting up 30 plus hours to hear the results of a presidential election in 2020. This is unacceptable! People’s votes deserve better care!
1324072777889054728 2020-11-05 03:35:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Like many of us, I haven’t been to bed, and I’m working today. I feel like entitlement has taken over the backbone of this great country. If somehow this election is lost I have one last and important request from @realDonaldTrump I’d like to see voter ID in every state!
1324071263107796995 2020-11-05 03:29:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I feel cheated, I don’t believe we’ve lost, I don’t know if we won. Why do I feel cheated? I’m a law abiding tax paying hard working American, I voted IN PERSON using voter ID. Yet here I am, 30 hours later still waiting on results.
1324069907122671616 2020-11-05 03:24:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden Once again you’ve failed to recognize average citizens. Today is supposed to be a normal working day for us, but we appear to be caught up in some sick joke. This can never happen again! #VoterID

Why would he do that? I don’t know, but nothing the democrats have done the past 4 years makes any sense. It almost feels like a comedy and tragedy combined!  https://t.co/Wj4JGUHkFT

1323037151207038982 2020-11-02 07:00:12 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden While your son suffers addiction you run for president of the United States. The rest of the people who’s children suffer addiction can hardly function enough to cook dinner. Just maybe if we were rich politicians we could fix our kids so easily

1323030290374209536 2020-11-02 06:32:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> What the left don’t understand is that the police are actually welcome at Trump rallies!

1323019616545898506 2020-11-02 05:50:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @tomselliott So, when this is all over will we be able to trust the doctors who by all appearances seem to be complicit in all this? I certainly won’t. I feel like mine abandoned me over something he KNEW wasn’t right.
1323019098612289536 2020-11-02 05:48:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @tomselliott This is the honest truth. My dog had antibiotics for an ear infection so I took them! Don’t fret, I got her new antibiotics 3 days later. I’m just shocked that it’s easier to get my dog treatment than myself!
1323018369373712384 2020-11-02 05:45:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @tomselliott Roughly 5 days later I got the call. All they said was ‘your test was negative’ However during this time I got sicker, lots sicker. I had a fever for 3 days straight so I did the only thing I thought might keep me from pneumonia, I took my dogs antibiotics!
1323017722545004546 2020-11-02 05:43:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @tomselliott I had a real nasty cold for a couple weeks so I finally bit the bullet &amp; made an appointment. My appointment - I drove under a tent &amp; they swabbed me for covid. They told me it would be 5-7 days for the result and to stay home &amp; take Tylenol. They would call me with results.
1323016741102985217 2020-11-02 05:39:06 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @tomselliott Just yesterday I was asking myself ‘do I even trust my doctor anymore?’ The answer is no. He took an oath to do no harm and imo he broke that oath by not standing up against those who force fed us covid. Let me explain a little more.

1322922580299403266 2020-11-01 23:24:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LSperkowski @MaryUlinger But definitely not before the debates are finished, and it needs to be the same across all states.  I also think we need nationwide voter ID. My state scans your ID before you vote. I think it makes it go faster and I’m more secure with my vote. That’s just my opinion
1322922020976427011 2020-11-01 23:22:43 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LSperkowski @MaryUlinger If I were to weigh in on early voting, I’d say it’s good because my mother likes to vote in person but as she gets older, it may get harder for her to wait in long lines. It would be better if we had a hard start that applied to all states. Maybe like 10 days before?
1322921421018927109 2020-11-01 23:20:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LSperkowski @MaryUlinger The only issue with early voting here is some states started way too early. For example, we had states voting before the final debate. Lots of people wanted to change their vote in the past couple weeks, not all states allow it.

1322631108513714177 2020-11-01 04:06:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT Of course I planned it, the outer bill of both rolls were $100, but the rest wasn’t. I really am couch shopping, I’d just prefer to buy a couch without foggy glasses!
1322630626713939969 2020-11-01 04:04:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT So this just happened. I just went to a local store without a mask. I started sitting on couches testing them out. The sales girl was about to ask me to put on my mask, so I ‘accidentally’ dropped 2 rolls of bills. She didn’t say a word after that.

1322173549499551745 2020-10-30 21:48:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @robbystarbuck We can never undo the injustices done many years ago, and I think I can speak for everyone when I say it’s embarrassing that some ancestors of this country chose cruelty for profit. But constantly reminding white children of this will only make them resent their ancestors!
1322172441934921728 2020-10-30 21:44:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @robbystarbuck *White girl gives up family fortune to marry black man *Neighborhood embraces first black family into suburban neighborhood *White children and black children attend same school The list could go on, but these examples show how horrible it once was compared to now
1322171347322183682 2020-10-30 21:39:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @robbystarbuck But if we’re going to teach our kids about the history of it, we need to include these things as well as *White teens protest segregation by walk away from field trip at local pool after seeing black children looking through fences (this happened)
1322170513750478848 2020-10-30 21:36:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @robbystarbuck The fact that such a tribe existed gives a clear picture how many people even back then went through a lot of trouble (and danger) to oppose slavery. What has been done to black people in this country is appalling, but I don’t believe anyone alive today would be so cruel.
1322169651699306498 2020-10-30 21:33:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @robbystarbuck But for some reason academia want our kids to believe that everyone in America came from the South and all Southerners were for slavery and that’s simply not true. My family comes from the Melungeon tribes from the Appalachias.
1322167886673289216 2020-10-30 21:26:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @robbystarbuck The point is, the North was huge and the majority of the North was against slavery. It took almost 100 years to end slavery because it was difficult to assemble the abolitionist in the South, although there were many. Fewer people agreed with slavery than those who opposed it
1322166761026891777 2020-10-30 21:21:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @robbystarbuck This land was the British Colonies at that time. Second, after the French helped us win the Revolution, it was LaFayette who brought attention to slavery in the colonies. The idea to end slavery in the new America was planted then.
1322164979836030977 2020-10-30 21:14:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @robbystarbuck I would take notes from what I read then go back to the library and get books on certain subjects. One thing I find troubling is how this ‘newly written history’ teaches about the first Slave in America. Well, in 1619 there was no such thing as America.

Sure, they don’t owe you as much at the end of the year, but you get to decide how to invest your earnings each check rather than take a chance with the IRS!

The answer is, the police were called because someone feared for their own lives. Was it his own mother? When did we start focusing on the last chapter and ignoring the rest of the book?

This movement is no longer about families, it’s about appeasing The Party! No more GS cookies in this house. Being a scout used to mean something more

My first trip, one of the chaperones has a mental disability but was more than adequate for her roles. Every mother cheered her presence.

All they did was faded the count line! Is it another coincidence that it’s battleground states? Was it all part of the plan and we’re collateral damage?  https://t.co/q5L578xquH
1321283263898488832 2020-10-28 10:50:53 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ewarren Basically it comes to this. Is Joe a psychic or is Dark Winter just a continuation of covid in order to use the media (as was necessary during the operation) to keep spreading fear?

What does that say for the people who readily stand up for them? Does it make them stupid or complicit? Do you really want a country that is so easily manipulated by The Party and the media? It’s socialism

It’s the biggest crime on America and it was committed by the democrat party. Here’s a model from today where they’re reporting ‘spikes’. There’s no way we have spikes in most battleground states only. Surely even you agree?  https://t.co/DLKGLt3X7P

Read the article about Operation Dark Winter from 2001 In October 2019 both MSM and Biden tweeted about a pandemic.

We get banned from FB and Twitter if we toe the line. Some people are losing their jobs for supporting Trump. Others property is being destroyed for having Trump campaign signs up
1321181214431170561 2020-10-28 04:05:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @GenevieveEM @NationMis @MrAndyNgo MSM tells viewers ANTIFA/BLM isn’t organized, it’s an idea Trump supporters are responsible for a vast amount of unrest We need to defund our local police Trump created this because him and his voters are racist Now, if you hear all that 24/7, how would you vote?
1321179282899685376 2020-10-28 03:57:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @GenevieveEM @MrAndyNgo In the United States, if Trump sent in federal enforcement to stop this without being asked, they’d impeach him AGAIN. The democrats know this which is why you’re seeing so much of it. So much of what’s going on around the world is centered around our 11/3 election. Believe that!
1321174433399250948 2020-10-28 03:38:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Did Joe accidentally give something away during the debate? Was MSM groomed for this? @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr  https://t.co/EOLGFC529W

That phrase struck me as odd since in 2001 Operation Dark Winter was a REAL. I thought I’d share this with your fans. Note the key players in the 2001 project. THE MEDIA! Oh, and the October 2019 tweet predicting a pandemic  https://t.co/4X1jIuHDAB

If (🤮) Biden wins, it’ll stay in place long enough for them to do some shady shit while hidden. They’ll claim Joe got it with long term affects. Then put Harris in his place
1321155628547645446 2020-10-28 02:23:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods This has to be the dumbest year for democrats. It’s almost like they just give themselves away 🤷‍♀️

1320771466888175621 2020-10-27 00:57:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DonaldJTrumpJr If people really believe that they’re saving lives by staying home &amp; wearing masks if they go out, then they should wonder how many lives they’re responsible for pre covid.
1320770666195464192 2020-10-27 00:54:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @VoteBluAmerica @realDonaldTrump And then a few months later, here we are. Yet, I don’t know a single person who’s died, I mean REALLY died of covid. Do you believe you’ve killed someone in the past by not wearing a mask? Do you realize that your virtue signaling may very well push us all off the cliff?
1320769530382213121 2020-10-27 00:49:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @VoteBluAmerica @realDonaldTrump I found this interesting, since Joe mentioned Dark Winter in the last debate Imagine finding out that in 2001 there was a mock pandemic called Operation Dark Winter, and the media were key players.

Go check out a couple hospitals near your area, ask some actual nurses who work in hospitals.
1320758383121731585 2020-10-27 00:05:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DebbieSVA @DonaldJTrumpJr And you know this because MSM is telling you. I’m sitting at the VA right now. This is the SLOWEST I’ve ever seen the VA. My friend is a nurse &amp; her hours have been cut.  Why don’t you folks ever believe the people who actually witness/live through this everyday?
1320757596635222022 2020-10-27 00:02:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DonaldJTrumpJr 2001 - Operation Dark Winter October 2019 - Joe &amp; WP tweet about pandemic 2020 - Hit with pandemic October 2020 debate - Joe lets phrase Dark Winter slip Nothing to see here  https://t.co/0TENNwzIN7
1320756728129036288 2020-10-26 23:58:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jeffcampbell64 @DrewHolden360 So when ole Joe mentioned Dark Winter during the debate, I realized (with certainty) that we were all played. Now, how do we get out of this? Can we? My fear is that unless we really do something about the media we’re screwed!
1320756100510162944 2020-10-26 23:56:07 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jeffcampbell64 @DrewHolden360 I found Joes mention of Dark Winter ironic, chech this out In 2001 there was actually a mock pandemic. Know what they called it? You guessed it, Operation Dark Winter. Key players involved no other than THE MEDIA In October 2019, both the media and Joe tweeted about a pandemic 🤷‍♀️  https://t.co/B9Rddo4P9Y
1320755097459195907 2020-10-26 23:52:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DrewHolden360 He’s right. Ignoring the side affects of what the media and democrats are causing by keeping this fear going is more deadly than covid. New studies show that not only is this stressful, but now people are having dental issues caused by long term mask wearing
1320746514298376192 2020-10-26 23:18:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TeamTrump Let the, fact check this. During the last debate Biden refers to Dark Winter. In 2001 Operation Dark Winter was a mock reaction to a pandemic. Key participant - the media In October last year both WP and Biden tweet about a pandemic  https://t.co/GlhHsYmIqE

1320742482049699840 2020-10-26 23:02:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump And ironically, the media (which was a key player in ODW) thought a pandemic was worth mentioning just a few months before an actual pandemic.  Come on man, I cannot be the only one feeling like we’ve been played by the media and our own government! #DrainTheSwamp
1320741546673774592 2020-10-26 22:58:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump Let’s not forget ole Joes psychic ability. He did anticipate something was coming in October 2019. Just saying  https://t.co/XUgEH2tW0w
1320741222437298184 2020-10-26 22:57:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump Coincidence? Probably not. I mean ole Joe did drop reference to Dark Winter at the debate.  https://t.co/BR7Y4wj2nz
1320740801517883392 2020-10-26 22:55:19 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> If #Democrats really believed that everyone at Trump rallies were going to get covid &amp; die, they’d be more likely to stay silent than complaining on social media. Remember how they treated #POTUS when he had it!

1320737753064235009 2020-10-26 22:43:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> If anyone failed to notice @JoeBiden reference to Dark Winter, I suggest you research Operation Dark Winter. Why would Joe and the media even mention this months before an actual outbreak? Anyone who says this is ridiculous lives in a box!  https://t.co/C8aCMW6j9I

One challenge they faced during this mock pandemic was the media In fall of 2019 Biden tweeted that Trump was not prepared for a pandemic.  I’ll leave the thinking part to you

1320726239448092672 2020-10-26 21:57:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino So next time you go into a store, leave your mask behind. If they make you leave, convince people to leave with you. If you’re making an appointment or reservation, ask about masks. If they force masks, go someplace else
1320725719819919360 2020-10-26 21:55:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino Unless and until people STOP complying with these ridiculous mandates, they’re going to attack the president with those made up statistics.

1319808223239675910 2020-10-24 09:09:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @davidhogg111 But of course, you can advocate turning a blind eye, because you can’t see the horror that is inflicted by promises of a border crossing. Just because you want it to not be true don’t make it a lie

Additionally, a lot of women and children who are being brought in by coyotes are sexually abused in the process. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. We have to stop illegals period!

1319754050565451776 2020-10-24 05:34:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @msantiv7 @KamVTV Around 300,000 a year. That’s more than the amount of people who’ve died from covid, in case you’re doing the math
1319743000839397377 2020-10-24 04:50:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @PeteButtigieg That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. To suggest that it would be healthy to NEVER smile at someone is insane. You’re not stepping over dead bodies, your neighbors aren’t being carried away in hearses and you know it. To keep pushing covid restrictions is criminal
1319735028272812034 2020-10-24 04:18:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT -negative results allows system to place you in appointment queue  If you’ve recently taken ill and tried to see a doctor, it’s very likely you’ve been through a process similar to how universal healthcare works
1319734493750714369 2020-10-24 04:16:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT I will absolutely claim that covid was used as a political move! It was the ideal opportunity to push universal healthcare mandates -tent tests mirror prescreening for referrals -5 to 7 day wait mirror queue for service providers -positive result limits necessary actions

1319700579434856448 2020-10-24 02:01:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Stop over emphasizing college! Young adults need to be just as encouraged to learn trades, it’s what built this country.  Stop letting the government profit off your children’s future through student loan interest!

With flu season approaching, we can only assume that people may die between the time they begin processing and the time they are actually seen
1319631621327409153 2020-10-23 21:27:50 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @hucklebee_sarah @katev2018 I use the word queue here because this is a common phrase in universal healthcare. Some people will avoid the tent visit all together and never be seen. Some of those people will only become sicker.

I co-signed for my kids first loan because I’m not a multimillionaire. If I were I would’ve easily gave him money to invest, it’s what parents do. People acting like they don’t are lying

1319339373771526144 2020-10-23 02:06:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Watching democrats using covid to save themselves is like watching Hunter grasping for straws!  https://t.co/Y7ee05RNsb

1319331688636469250 2020-10-23 01:36:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino @realDonaldTrump If it’s so bad, why do you have to get a test to find out if you have it? If it’s so bad, why do they just tell you to quarantine with Tylenol if you do have it? This isn’t a deadly virus, it’s the media trying to control your mind and America needs a damn reality check!
1319331042805895168 2020-10-23 01:33:27 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino @realDonaldTrump If this virus was what they want you to believe it is, why aren’t we stepping over dead bodies in the streets, why aren’t your neighbors being carried out of their homes in hearses or at the very least ambulances?
1319330424817176576 2020-10-23 01:30:59 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino @realDonaldTrump The media don’t want covid to go away because they have absolutely NOTHING else to report on. If it weren’t for the media no one would even know there was a virus

1319302919741706241 2020-10-22 23:41:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy Exactly, they act as though advocating for people and handing over some money will somehow negate the fact that they’re wealthy &amp; never struggled. God forbid should they tell people they earned their wealth in a capitalist society through hard work &amp; responsible choices!

1319007433981857792 2020-10-22 04:07:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ProudSocialist This year I’m voting for Trump because I want to be able to vote on those issues in the future. I think the democrats would try to move toward these goals too quickly. But I believe it’s your vote and you should vote for the candidate you feel represents you best.
1319005880743067650 2020-10-22 04:01:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ProudSocialist And I agree that our healthcare isn’t perfect, but no one has been able to show me a universal plan that actually works the same for everyone, even in the Netherlands. When they come up with a plan that’s fair for all, I’ll definitely listen
1319005197239263232 2020-10-22 03:58:39 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ProudSocialist But I’m also conservative. I believe in a free market because the only other option is to trust a body of government to be fair, and well I just don’t see that happening. At least with a free market we control our own output.
1319004371947032576 2020-10-22 03:55:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ProudSocialist I also wholeheartedly believe that anyone should be allowed to love who they choose regardless of their sex, race, religion, etc. I know if I’m in my garage with the car running I’ll die and that just because I open the door, those toxins don’t just disappear
1319003629974683649 2020-10-22 03:52:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ProudSocialist I have a confession. I love the mountains and I don’t want to see them destroyed. For years I would argue with my husband about fracking. We still do, but I accept the fact that we can’t rely on other governments for energy and until we can accommodate everyone it’s necessary

1318998874833457152 2020-10-22 03:33:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Here’s what @TheDemocrats don’t want you to know. Parents who are deported have a choice to either take their kids back with them or leave them until the child’s case is decided. When the kids are separated it’s because the parents CHOSE to leave the children!
1318997574091755521 2020-10-22 03:28:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden Typical that the left isn’t asking why parents would illegally enter a foreign country with children then not claim those children when apprehended by authorities.  Countries have borders and immigration laws for a reason. No one can enter a foreign country illegally!

1318971915546038272 2020-10-22 01:46:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods Since we’re not stepping over dead bodies and the funeral homes aren’t collecting our neighbors bodies every week I think the gig is up. In fact. The only reason I even know covid exists is because the media reminds me every day, otherwise I couldn’t prove it
1318970771478355973 2020-10-22 01:41:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy I live in a town of just over 19,000 people and I personally know more than 10 kids that overdosed. It all started with prescription meds, then when those became impossible for them to find, they moved to heroin. It’s heartbreaking to see
1318969372426338309 2020-10-22 01:36:18 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy Purdue Pharma has destroyed more families than people can imagine. They’ve nearly destroyed an entire generation. I don’t know a single family who hasn’t been affected by opioid addiction in some way.
1318967613012271105 2020-10-22 01:29:18 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> So it could take til 2021 to get possession of the home again. My guess is they’re going to put the house on the market so they don’t have to go into foreclosure. What is most upsetting is the people bought a new vehicle 3 months ago!
1318966567552667649 2020-10-22 01:25:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> They were getting ready to start the process of eviction in March, then covid came into play. They couldn’t evict so the family lived there rent free. Of course mortgage still had to be paid. From what I understand the courts are now backed up.
1318965728284999680 2020-10-22 01:21:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> 4 years ago a couple bought a house across the street as an investment/rental. Cute old craftsman style, corner lot. They rented it out to a family late 2018, they haven’t paid rent since January. I just saw a realtor at the house. This is the stuff people don’t see

I’ve seen first hand what these shutdowns have done to people. My county alone has had more than 5 overdoses since March. When do we really start caring about human lives?

He had a doctors appointment by phone 2 days before that, he was 53
1318934014615523333 2020-10-21 23:15:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @SonnyBunch @benshapiro So it’s okay for men &amp; women to pleasure themselves at their desks at work? Some kind of line needs to be drawn here if working remotely is going to be the new normal, otherwise everything is going to end in chaos. Am I home or in the office? That’s the question of the year
1318932158661132288 2020-10-21 23:08:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Here in America some of us feel like the future of this country is on the line. I didn’t realize how other countries felt until I read a tweet from Italy (translated of course) No pressure here though 😟  https://t.co/XWU1UubyPH
1318930262596661248 2020-10-21 23:00:53 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @KKWAKG @jacobsoboroff @JuliaEAinsley One might argue that most parents would move mountains to ‘claim’ their children. Traffickers who risk getting caught on the other hand may choose to leave those children behind.
1318929219217461249 2020-10-21 22:56:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I’d like to remind people 1, this was happening under the Obama administration. I remember quite well 2, these ‘parents’ illegally dragged their children across the border of a foreign country 3, there are legal ways to enter foreign countries 4, actions have consequences
1318928023937310721 2020-10-21 22:52:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MeghanMcCain Yet no one is criticizing the parents who decided to illegally drag their children across the border of a foreign country? Just because you can walk across a border doesn’t negate the fact it’s illegal. Would you take your child with you to rob a bank because you’re hungry?
1318925219948646403 2020-10-21 22:40:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TroyAikman @lupe_bustillos So what’s your take on the fees the #NFL collects from our military to perform these flyovers &amp; spread our flag? I wonder, do the American people realize how much the NFL makes off of our military by labeling patriotism as advertisement?

I would definitely bring a group of friends to help &amp; get to know you &amp; the work you do. You have amazing energy!
1318915299907960832 2020-10-21 22:01:26 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Every Wednesday I buy pastries at our local bakery whether I want them or not. Are you all helping to keep your small businesses going?
1318914459587563522 2020-10-21 21:58:06 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @SWAtlasHoover If any of this were about our health, don’t you think they’d ban cigarettes? I mean, science proves that smoking will kill you sooner or later, yet the government STILL collects taxes on them. It’s not about your health nor has it ever been!

1318911477244448768 2020-10-21 21:46:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @kirstiealley @DonaldJTrumpJr As a mother of 2 kids, and one who’s battled addiction I’d definitely know what’s going on in their life. Parents become hyper sensitive to their kid when he/she is going through addiction. You notice a pimple, you’d definitely notice a wad of cash!
1318907574998151168 2020-10-21 21:30:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Does anyone else wish liberal Hollywood would stay out of our politics?
1318907004283400192 2020-10-21 21:28:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Alyssa_Milano Like you have any clue about how politicians affect the real world. We’d all be better off if washed up actors and actresses would stay out of our politics!
1318903877245292545 2020-10-21 21:16:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @numbers_truth @iseekken @blah69942620 @SueCar11 @drdavidsamadi @Regina07358768 Like I said, since I haven’t lost anyone to this, and I don’t know anyone that has and none of my neighbors have died from this, it’s not pandemic worthy. I will use my own judgment, not that of a heavily funded corporation who’s numbers change with the wind
1318902922994962434 2020-10-21 21:12:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Patriot31 People are either too stupid to let that sink in or they hate the president so much that covid absolutely has to stay real until after the election. It’s the latter because there’s no way we have that many stupid people

If there were a real pandemic you’d see at least a couple of neighbors carried out in body bags, attended at least one funeral a month, see people walking around sick begging for help.

1318651183846875140 2020-10-21 04:31:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> As much as they preach social distancing and masks you’d think they’d do better at virtue signaling 🤷‍♀️ Meanwhile they still won’t let you visit loved ones in senior living AND they’re planning to cancel YOUR Thanksgiving #VoteRedToSaveAmerica

1318343661671927808 2020-10-20 08:09:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @50cent I think that whole ‘Trump don’t like black people’ is just the democrats way of getting your taxes. Biden’s history for black Americans isn’t very strong imo
1318341241747214338 2020-10-20 08:00:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Oust451 @drjohnny__ Really? How many funerals are you attending each week because of this virus? How many of your neighbors have been carried out in body bags? This is the biggest joke on our country ever! No more, and I don’t care who tries to ‘cancel’ me
1318340554363645952 2020-10-20 07:57:36 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Do people really still believe this stuff? If this were real, wouldn’t we all be attending funerals every week, wouldn’t our neighbors be dying? Would you really not know you were sick with it without getting a test? This needs to stop, its ruing our lives!
1318339319174758401 2020-10-20 07:52:41 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @drjohnny__ I can’t wrap my head around why anyone is still afraid of this virus. We’re not stepping over dead bodies, people aren’t walking around sick. I just don’t understand how anyone still believes this shit 🤷‍♀️
1318338540481236992 2020-10-20 07:49:36 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @NurseVqn My faith in the future of America has been restored. Even if Biden should win, we can hold on to hope that some of those kids will one day be leaders of this country

1318335500353261569 2020-10-20 07:37:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @WalshFreedom If he’s such a fucking expert why does his opinions change with the wind? No, I’m going to have to side with the President on this one. I think Fauci is a puppet like the rest of them

1318308753675083778 2020-10-20 05:51:14 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @WalshFreedom Real men would belly crawl through covid infested water with an AR15 strapped to their back to save their family, not cower behind a media hyped muzzle
1318305427986198529 2020-10-20 05:38:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I’m almost shocked by the comments on here. I’ll never be able to sit in on another zoom meeting with a straight face

1318303624137789448 2020-10-20 05:30:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> This tweet tho, saying they’d prefer the guy who wears the mask against a virus with a 99.8% recovery rate than the guy who negotiates peace deals. You can’t get any dumber than this 😂
1318302822098702343 2020-10-20 05:27:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @WalshFreedom Clearly you’ve never been in a foxhole with someone. I prefer a dude who won’t hide behind a mask honestly
1318300680147402752 2020-10-20 05:19:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @atrupar You never ask about peace deals or how we can move forward with the economy. It’s almost like you NEED people to get sick &amp; die so you don’t have to rack your brains for a real story. You’re nothing more than fear mongering propaganda to us
1318300116936163328 2020-10-20 05:16:55 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @atrupar The truth is, people are actually stepping outside their homes and shockingly, we’re not stepping over dead bodies and people aren’t walking around like zombies. The whole covid thing is a bore now. Unfortunately that’s all the media and democrats want to talk about
1318297585602396167 2020-10-20 05:06:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT I’m anxious to see how our county handles this. We’re pretty red here and people are openly rebelling against masks

1318289109195128837 2020-10-20 04:33:10 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @QuietEnable @jjinmi @GeorgePapa19 The truth is usually somewhere in the middle. I’m not so quick to jump on all of the story, but I don’t rule out that there’s something to all this. I want a Trump victory next month, so I would urge caution to anyone in front of cameras speaking about this
1318275750684930048 2020-10-20 03:40:05 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> If climate change is so real, why do all these globalist live on the ever so threatening ocean?

1318260746640330753 2020-10-20 02:40:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> On a real serious note, if by chance Biden is elected as the next president Kamala Harris will take his place within a year. Imagine a country with Kamala Harris as the president, you think 2020 was bad

1318254214968205314 2020-10-20 02:14:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @deep_navy @RaheemKassam The media and democrats are milking covid for politics. You’re not stepping over dead bodies on the streets, people aren’t walking around like zombies, you’re not attending funerals every week. You know what I’m saying is true, but virtue signaling is more important than truth
1318250640213094401 2020-10-20 02:00:19 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @PeteButtigieg Joe Biden is too old and he’s been in way too long. Harris is too radical for most democrats. The people I talk to question the democrats choice for VP
1318250131532165121 2020-10-20 01:58:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @PeteButtigieg I’m a conservative, but I know some democrats that’ll be voting red this year because the democrats have gone way off the mark. I can honestly say had you been the candidate running, those people would probably still be voting democrat this year.

The roles have reversed, once the norm was you learned morals at home and life skills at school. Now they want to teach morals at school leaving out life skills.

Back in my day (sorry lol) we actually had to take home economics classes. We also had on campus trade school at our high school. I know a lot of people who built great futures from their trade
1317998944740364289 2020-10-19 09:20:10 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ShaneWorley4 @NBCNews I believe Trump said they needed to cut regulations to allow for keeping the forest clean...something to that degree

The more businesses there is the more competitive the job market is. We (the laborers) always feel cheated, but no ones going to interrupt my dinner to tell me stocks fell. That’s one positive 🙂 I have a feeling you’ll be just fine

I see advertisements for entry level clerks where a degree is now required. I think this is doing more harm than good seeing that it now cost a minimum of $30K to get an entry level position

If he’s certain of the validity of the laptop then YES bring it up. But as long as there’s 1/100 chance someone is meaning to make a mockery from it I’d tread lightly. The silence could be indicative of either scenario imo

But in order to do that, the government needs to figure out how to live without student loan debt

Sometime in our past there was apprenticeships where companies actually invested in young people. I imagine a lot of companies would go this way again if the government would loosen regulations

I’m sorry this happened, but I promise it was not conservative minded people like me.

1317939895478984704 2020-10-19 05:25:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dortepost @kimberae713 @SusanStJames3 I’ve talked to several voters who will be voting republican for the first time this year. Here are some reasons they gave Kavanaugh hearings Russia hoax Media bias against the President for 3 straight years Some turned in 16 because of Hillary These are just facts
1317937253772120066 2020-10-19 05:15:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @whitepatrick @RealJamesWoods Do you seriously have a profile pic of a naked boy smoking a blunt drinking a beer?

1317934865711497221 2020-10-19 05:05:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Stacy_g52 @tweettruth2me Abortion is not healthcare. Healthcare is about caring for ones health and ensuring their physical well being. The problem here is that you’re advocating for the death of a child due to your negligence. Try condoms or the pill, abortion is the murder of a child, not healthcare
1317933123804499969 2020-10-19 04:58:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Stacy_g52 @tweettruth2me That’s like saying you didn’t mean to jump out of the plane without a parachute
1317930614012694528 2020-10-19 04:48:39 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jennyrachelpal @KellyO You’re an idiot if you believe Trump does his own taxes using something like TurboTax
1317929940759814145 2020-10-19 04:45:58 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @cryanhyde @KellyO Actually it stems from a form of taxation. Long before federal taxes became law, tithing was a form of collecting ‘a tenth’ of someone’s income.  Almost no one gives 10% to their church now, but those who do do so by mail and are given a receipt for tax deductions
1317925991805833216 2020-10-19 04:30:16 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TickTockTuna @TysonTrump @realDonaldTrump Since she was born 35 years ago we’ve called it Downs. We’re not the type to find offensiveness by default. I once asked my dad why we never parked in handicap and he said ‘Am isn’t handicap, the rest of the world is’. He called it Downs as well
1317924662899245056 2020-10-19 04:25:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @acdc1027 @TheFarSideRight Funny you mention that. See, a lot of women get abortions because a man says ‘I’m not helping you, you need to abort the child’ So much for ‘my choice’ right?

1317915195021381632 2020-10-19 03:47:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ScottAdamsSays Or maybe people expected to walk out their doors and stepping over dead bodies after months of being told about a deadly virus by the media and the left. What a shock it must be for everyone to find out all their neighbors are still alive Get out of the house and smile

1317907153726935045 2020-10-19 03:15:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @sadydoyle I imagine ACB felt like she signed up for a book club only to find that the book of the month was 50 Shades of Gray when her personal library contain authors like Paine, Tolstoy, Faulkner, Shakespeare, Yeats, etc.

There’s not a day goes by where the parents aren’t troubled by their kids addiction. A parent would sell their soul to make their kid better.

1317894656374525952 2020-10-19 02:25:46 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TheDemocrats is this the plan? Or do we need to ask @JoeBiden if he denounces this fascist ideology? Read the comments of those who call for camps for those who support Trump and tell me this is not the direction you’re going
1317893850933899274 2020-10-19 02:22:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RBReich And finally, I think if @TheDemocrats do not publicly denounce people like you and those who are agreeing with this, many more people will be fleeing the democrat party this year. This type of thought and speech is just dangerous
1317893009820782594 2020-10-19 02:19:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RBReich However I feel like a line is being crossed when you and your followers wish to imprison anyone who doesn’t vote how you want them to. This tweet, followed by all the violence of the left leaves me to believe that America may truly be in trouble.
1317891927174483970 2020-10-19 02:14:55 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RBReich I thought maybe this was a joke, but sadly it’s not. I don’t wish harm on those who’s views I don’t share. Everyone has a right to vote how they like, no one should be punished for a difference in opinion.
1317891125164806144 2020-10-19 02:11:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I kid you not, this is an idea that A LOT of leftist #Democrats are openly supporting. They actually want to put political prisoners in re-education camps. History always repeats itself (even if you try to burn it down) #VoteRedLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt  #DemocratsAreEvil
1317887188886032385 2020-10-19 01:56:05 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods We went to Gatlinburg this week and it was packed. Guess what, no dead bodies in the streets, no zombie like creatures walking around. People were just out enjoying the last weeks before winter comes
1317886605957468160 2020-10-19 01:53:46 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jaketapper No one is buying this nonsense anymore. Get out and see for yourselves, people are not dropping dead in streets or walking around looking like they’re dying. They’re taking the opportunity to get out before winter comes and they’re out in droves and loving it!

1317839890424451072 2020-10-18 22:48:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TheDemocrats number 1 attack on Trump supporters are ‘they’re uneducated’.

Keep calling people uneducated because they choose to be a plumber or work in a factory. Call them racist because they were born white.

Now, this could be considered being financially responsible, but wouldn’t it be more responsible to manage your own interest on hand through equity? Or even savings?

1317649588640190464 2020-10-18 10:11:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden You compare him spending money his family left him to money you’ve somehow gained through half a century in politics. Are we supposed to be okay with the enormous wealth you gained as a politician on a $200,000 salary? Surely no one thinks this is okay?

1317467521348378625 2020-10-17 22:08:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Day 3 on our long weekend road trip. I’m still getting positive feedback on my shirts (I have a lot). I just can’t believe any polls where Biden is leading. We’re even seeing BILLBOARD paid for by businesses!

1317261925026271234 2020-10-17 08:31:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @seanhannity This is what happens when you elect a senator who can’t spell senator
1317256192020930560 2020-10-17 08:08:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MrMichaelBurkes They won’t, they like this capitalism too much
1317253042899722240 2020-10-17 07:56:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> On a weekend road trip and we’ve seen several shops and road side tents selling Trump gear. I’ve had people comment on my Trump shirts yesterday and today. Our Trump car magnets triggered massive honking in a tunnel. Feels pretty solid to me 🤷‍♀️
1317225650110013441 2020-10-17 06:07:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @conservmillen This is the most insane shit I’ve heard in my life. This country has lost all sense of reality
1317224410055626753 2020-10-17 06:02:26 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Jeffbez76067279 Looks like pot to me 🤷‍♀️
1317127884310532096 2020-10-16 23:38:53 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Maybe #Democrats should wonder if the children being murdered in the womb might be transgender 🤷‍♀️
1317125732313690113 2020-10-16 23:30:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DineshDSouza As though we actually care if they leave
1317125170558099457 2020-10-16 23:28:06 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden Let’s be honest Joe, what additional funding are the democrats asking for that’s NOT related to covid. When the democrats ask for non covid related funding it makes this all look like a tax scam!
1317122853720948736 2020-10-16 23:18:53 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT Very virtuous 😂😂
1317122537470496770 2020-10-16 23:17:38 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @WarrenPlatts The only issue I see with a universal healthcare is the funding. I think it’s time America start looking outside of income tax based programs and try shifting toward sales taxes imo
1316944773295595526 2020-10-16 11:31:16 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @soft1sheldon @RadioFreeTom Funny, since I have no interest in Biden I don’t tune into his town halls. Of course my life is good, I’m happy and I don’t look for reasons to hate someone I’m not voting for. You should try it
1316943796400230403 2020-10-16 11:27:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Acosta Shouldn’t you all be denouncing ANTIFA by now? We literally had to take a detour on our trip this week because ANTIFA/BLM destroyed our intended destination. There’s 3 other couples at our hotel who also had to change locations
1316942690081189892 2020-10-16 11:22:59 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Acosta Well, they did bring attention to all the trafficked kids that have been found and freed lately. Kinda hard to denounce something that advocates for something so good. Sure, they go overboard with their theories, but one must always acknowledge the good in people where it exists
1316941126994190336 2020-10-16 11:16:46 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @WarrenPlatts They called today and scheduled him for the 26th. All good
1316738034960826369 2020-10-15 21:49:46 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Is this real? 🤦‍♂️
1316737594265423872 2020-10-15 21:48:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Anyone from TN, we’re taking a weekend road trip today so I’m curious if we’re driving into a long weekend of mask policing?
1316737159399976966 2020-10-15 21:46:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Too all the Vets out there. The VA confirmed my son needs a surgery, how long does the VA have to schedule that surgery?
1316736452215164928 2020-10-15 21:43:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump how long does the VA have to schedule a necessary surgery under the new provision?
1316733107291197440 2020-10-15 21:30:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Veteran1Unknown Did you know studies show that people who get HIV without it going into full blown AIDS have traces of the bubonic plague in their genetic makeup? What I took from that was maybe there is a type of herd immunity? I just found that interesting, thought I would share
1316575027941257216 2020-10-15 11:02:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @KamalaHarris I once had an interview and the other candidate was in the lobby as I walked out. His shoelace had come undone and I took the time out to tell him. It’s called compassion, and thats something we believe you lack
1316573685315141632 2020-10-15 10:56:41 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JasonMillerinDC I’ve yet to see one play by the democrats that hasn’t backfired
1316572961768378369 2020-10-15 10:53:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Twitter and Facebook believe there’s room for both outlets in a socialist country. Why else would they so readily submit to The Party?
1316572289106878464 2020-10-15 10:51:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jack @nypost And secondly, I find it hard to believe a call from someone powerful didn’t play a role in the immediate action you took to suppress the information. You may one day live to regret the future you so enthusiastically advocate for. Typically only one outlet survives socialism
1316570997051490304 2020-10-15 10:46:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jack @nypost Sorry Jack, you can’t unring a bell

1316563998356246528 2020-10-15 10:18:12 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump @lupe_bustillos Covid was just a taste of how federal healthcare would work. Get sick, the doctor sends you through a drive thru test. If in 5 days you’re negative you get an actual appointment. Just hope it’s not an infection that spreads to your blood by then. Yep, that’s a real possibility
1316562331560669184 2020-10-15 10:11:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @44horrormovies @William0112_ @Tmeyer2008 Quite frankly this a reason I would NOT vote for Biden. No dead bodies lining the streets, the only covid funerals I’ve attended are 2 suicides and 1 accident where my brother in law laid for hours to be found dead. Covid restrictions are deadlier than the virus imo
1316561254916526081 2020-10-15 10:07:18 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden Will you pack the courts? Would you reconsider you VP choice? Will you abandoned the green new deal? Will you ban fracking? Will you reinforce Obamacare? Will you hand us back over to China? The country needs to feel safe Joe. Quite frankly your refusal to answer these is scary
1316558243930529792 2020-10-15 09:55:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @liquidlaugh You mean The Party? I’m afraid the answer might scare you
1316555614831734786 2020-10-15 09:44:53 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Sparks80079110 @liquidlaugh Saw this exact sign and of all places, someone had on their camper at a campground. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, I just wondered if the local republican office has to order new signs since out of the other 50is campsites there were at least 40 Trump signs 😂
1316554323103485953 2020-10-15 09:39:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I imagine ACB felt like she was invited to a book club only to find out the book of the week was 50 Shades of Gray while her own library collection contain the likes of Homer, Faulkner, Paine, Yeats, etc.
1316549982342832129 2020-10-15 09:22:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @chuckwoolery #KamalaHarris comes off as cheap and trashy. Her style is an embarrassment to women in positions across the country. She’s Taco Bell management at best
1316548255048765440 2020-10-15 09:15:38 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> They needed to destroy the thing Americans could agree on about Trumps presidency, the jobs were looking up and new small businesses were succeeding. The question is, what do other nations have to gain with Biden that they’d so readily follow and destroy their own economy
1316546443423944704 2020-10-15 09:08:27 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jjcharlesworth_ @LegendaryEnergy In short, for some politicians there is a need for ‘food chain’ while people in general were trying to come together in the workforce to establish better practices (lean/six sigma)
1316545701699112960 2020-10-15 09:05:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jjcharlesworth_ @LegendaryEnergy There’s a fine line between middle class and working class. This line used to be larger, and I believe it was their goal to remind us of that line and re-establish. The truth is, a lot of people were coming to realize the need for the workers far outweigh the need for clerical
1316539738644525059 2020-10-15 08:41:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino Nobody, and I mean nobody is ‘scandal free’

1316499009931010048 2020-10-15 05:59:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @KamalaHarris Why not use your platform to get out the message of drug addiction? While I disagree with excessive use of force, had the man actually put his family first he’d be home today.  You’ve used your platform to incite riots instead of actually addressing the root cause
1316483995958415367 2020-10-15 05:00:18 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @public_juan @dbongino Honestly it must feel an awful lot like listening to a discussion about 50 Shades of Gray then turning to another group to discuss Thomas Paine

1316446195984863236 2020-10-15 02:30:06 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> This year has proven #Democrats are getting too old to effectively campaign.

1316383303012945921 2020-10-14 22:20:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT I agree, and I see some people in biracial relationships or parents who’ve adopted black children submitting to liberal ideology because they’re being made to feel ‘guilty’.

1316217764298870785 2020-10-14 11:22:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @liquidlaugh If you look at the ‘reset’ platform across the globe, their slogan is Build Back Better. I doubt it’s a coincidence

1316205381123796992 2020-10-14 10:33:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Twitter I thought you banned people (like the President of the United States) for this same statement!? Bias much?

1316202866982481921 2020-10-14 10:23:12 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @robbystarbuck She can tell her kids what I tell my grandson when he says ‘who’s that grannie?’  I say ‘that’s a commie’
1316202043757989909 2020-10-14 10:19:55 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> That smug look when @SpeakerPelosi says ‘WHE’RE feeding them. Basically she’s admitting that @TheDemocrats hold the tax payers money and feed the hungry peasants when THEY decide they’re hungry enough. Who’s still stupid enough to vote for these vile creatures
1316200819323211783 2020-10-14 10:15:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @SpeakerPelosi You are the poster child for term limits. The more you talk, the more you validate the term ‘Crazy Nancy’

1316177488238784512 2020-10-14 08:42:21 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Cernovich It’s important to understand that there are states who wish to perform abortions up until the 9th month. I don’t think many conservatives had an issue until they kept pushing their right to the point of actually murdering an infant. 8 month is no longer cells, it’s an infant
1316176511704145921 2020-10-14 08:38:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Cernovich I know if someone is charged with murdering a pregnant woman, it’s double homicide. So......about those cells
1316176016843341825 2020-10-14 08:36:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @resistorange45 @Cernovich So you’re okay with someone aborting your child without your permission?

I hope the media is included in that lawsuit

1315831270333652992 2020-10-13 09:46:36 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @deray And Donald Trump don’t ‘expect your vote because your black’ or is it that Biden expects it because he’s democrat? Either way, it’s the same logic. No one should expect anything from you because of your race, they should earn it. If you feel that Biden has earned your vote, ok
1315830159371534341 2020-10-13 09:42:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @deray I’m blown away by the language here, I even heard the term ‘massa’. I encourage you to at least have a conversation with a conservative, I don’t recall seeing such racial bias in any conversations. Maybe there’s some connection (stronghold?) between democrats and racism?

1315757327618899969 2020-10-13 04:52:47 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @IfBarack @clairecmc If they could just figure out a way to stop someone from stealing my CC info from my phone apps then maybe we could trust big tech with our votes
1315755421693546496 2020-10-13 04:45:12 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @drdavidsamadi @NYLockdown If public health is the governments primary interest, why am I paying sales tax on cigarettes? They need to stop with this nonsense. Anyone thinking it’s about a virus is just gullible
1315752773493886977 2020-10-13 04:34:41 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Hey, do they still sell cigarettes or did they ban them?
1315752107392282624 2020-10-13 04:32:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @R0gu31tal14n @square24_root @SagarYogendra @JoeBiden Except that 1, they pay taxes (support people who don’t work) 2, they can retire after their service is up, 3 they get to vote, 4 can make purchases off base, 5 live off base, 6 own a personal firearm, 7 own property...and many more freedoms You have no idea how real socialism is

Still think it’s about a virus?
1315745213562970115 2020-10-13 04:04:38 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MissILmom @DineshDSouza We should all see it as a warning
1315744630756044801 2020-10-13 04:02:19 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LegendaryEnergy Here’s the scary part. Many liberals think that one world government is the right choice. Why? My guess is they have little to no knowledge of government. I mean what could go wrong if states lose their power? The hell with that, what about when a country loses its power!
1315741207931301893 2020-10-13 03:48:43 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @chicksonright If things keep going the way the democrats want, I’ll remind everyone of those ‘damn masks’ a year from now.

1315725580181164032 2020-10-13 02:46:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RepAdamSchiff I just want to know when the rules changed that the Presidents term is up during the election year.  2016 results-The American people voted for Donald Trump. His term is up January 2021. Get over it
1315724873612832768 2020-10-13 02:43:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ewarren Well it’s obvious who hasn’t worked a day in civilian life for decades. Women haven’t had to ‘sit down’ in a long time

1315666418688503809 2020-10-12 22:51:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I suggest we all leave Twitter for Parlor. No need to wait until closer to the election, just go now to reclaim your freedom of speech

He’s a conservative cop, she’s a democrat through inheritance. Before 2020 me &amp; my brother were like peas &amp; carrots. This year just sucks
1315631609190789121 2020-10-12 20:33:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Oh you gotta be kidding’ is exactly what the vast majority of people said when #JoeBiden tried to gaslight the people into believing the violence wasn’t real! Thank God we have @realDonaldTrump who isn’t afraid to stand up for us!

1315628543552950277 2020-10-12 20:21:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @davidicke Only one thing will keep Americans from the polls and that’s force.

I had to dip into savings to pay for some medical and taxes, lost a little in my retirement. Home values were still pretty low 2017 started looking up, and if 2017-2019 is indicative to another 4 years, I’ll take it!

It’s one thing to rally votes but quite another to rally votes by crushing your voters dreams. In America you can be anything you want if you study hard and work hard! I promise

The #HarrisBiden team are going to add new justices so that Biden (likely Harris) can appointment new justices who lean toward their political views.
1315303498507071490 2020-10-11 22:49:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> When you vote this year, don’t think about 2020. Instead think about what your life was like from 2017 - 2019.

Of course no one knew that until later.  People can and will be spiteful. You’ll never remove that human element
1315301329804431360 2020-10-11 22:40:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @SKYRIDER4538 @LindaHale8006 @Yelp I had to step back and evaluate everything I thought I knew about the manager because I believed no one would go out of their way to damage a persons reputation for spite. In the end, they found that she was falsely accused because of a reprimand.
1315300706664972289 2020-10-11 22:38:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @SKYRIDER4538 @LindaHale8006 @Yelp I have had to sit through an inquiry at work where a manager was accused of racist behavior. It was difficult for me because I looked up to this manager, but at the same time I worked with a real diverse group of people.
1315299680809615360 2020-10-11 22:34:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @R0gu31tal14n @square24_root @SagarYogendra @JoeBiden You’re lucky, my mother retired and draws from both my dad and her retirement, still under $20,000 a year tho. She pays $100 a month for her healthcare and a Dr visit is $120 out of pocket. Me &amp; my brother are still trying to figure out why

1315128731321675776 2020-10-11 11:14:58 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @liquidlaugh If the man was a security guard and this was just a heated argument, was there a need for mace? It’s just adding to the chaos imo.
1315128093439295488 2020-10-11 11:12:26 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @liquidlaugh Was this a security guard? If so, why did people say otherwise and why would he be arguing with the Patriot? If we want to maintain being the good guys, then we need to do everything in our power to do so
1315127544195231746 2020-10-11 11:10:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @liquidlaugh The truth? Because for some reason we everyday people can’t seem to stay out of the way now. From what I understand the recent shooting in Denver was reported as ANTIFA violence, only later to be announced as a security guard. Now I don’t even know what’s real anymore 🤷‍♀️
1315119004357455873 2020-10-11 10:36:19 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Okay people, if this don’t scare the daylights out of you nothing will. This IS the Thought Police and the Ministry of Truth in one instance

Well, that is exactly how universal healthcare would be. The VA was so bad the president had to sign a new law to stop people from dying while waiting on appointments

Go to the doctor for any ailments right now, you get tested, not treated. Upon the results of the test, you may enter the cycle of revolving doors.  Prove me wrong
1315066516610707457 2020-10-11 07:07:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> #Democrats are so desperate they’re bragging about endorsements from pre-teens from other countries.  You can’t make this up 😂😂

1315057456243003394 2020-10-11 06:31:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @VoteBluePA @JoeBiden Clearly you haven’t had to go to the doctors recently. Try going for say, headaches and you’ll see exactly how the democrats national healthcare will work. Surely you didn’t think they could slide it in without something like covid? Try analytical thinking, you’ll be surprised

The reason? In 2014 political scientists showed that our policies were no longer dictated by the public. This is why @realDonaldTrump keeps winning

1314570061672308737 2020-10-09 22:15:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealGrahamJudd @LoisLowrance Thank him from families across Indiana. My son served 10 years Army, we as parents can be very proud of them
1314568182259220499 2020-10-09 22:07:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> And I’ll leave it at that I’m still waiting on that one instance where my mom was actually wrong 🤷‍♀️
1314567994438225920 2020-10-09 22:06:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> So I text my mom to tell her I don’t have covid, so now I should be able to actually see the doctor and get antibiotics before it turns to pneumonia. I ended by saying after a damn week, this is ridiculous.  My mom responds ‘just wait on that National healthcare’
1314567369050779658 2020-10-09 22:04:18 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Instead of actually seeing a doctor I never left my car, I drove under a tent &amp; they swabbed me for covid. I was not given anything other than ‘have a nice day, keep taking Advil’ So, after 4 days of waiting I got the call, NOT Covid
1314566620493361152 2020-10-09 22:01:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> So, an interesting conversation just happened between me &amp; my mom. Let me start by saying, I find my mom is usually very spot on with her political opinions  I’ve been sick for about 3 weeks. Since I wasn’t getting better I went to the doctor
1314564271469101058 2020-10-09 21:52:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @kirstiealley 😂😂I think they even called my mom (who’s old) Q once. They’re so delusional

1314389000237576198 2020-10-09 10:15:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jwoodardcp @exjon And gets advice from people who know more about the issues as where democrats tend to think their ideas are best. I think Trump will work with families facing addiction and say, okay what are we missing instead of saying ‘we’re the government so we know best’
1314388453786873856 2020-10-09 10:13:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jwoodardcp @exjon And I don’t necessarily agree with all his policies, so I have to look at all 4 candidates. I want things to be like they were before covid, good jobs, no wars, good neighbors. I just feel like the republicans want that too. I also feel like Trump does listen to ideas
1314387796346499072 2020-10-09 10:10:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jwoodardcp @exjon But in all honesty Pence only blocked the funds for Planned Parenthood. I was upset at first, I’ve known a lot of kids getting hooked. But when I read the actual proposal I found the truth. I’m an advocate for all things addiction related, so I’m giving you an honest opinion
1314386560180252674 2020-10-09 10:05:50 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @BlueIceAngels @mindtab Was it though? Honestly I think they have invested everything into covid this year. That’s all the libs are focused on. That’s why the media hasn’t missed one day reporting on covid but ignored all the peace deals
1314385722640654338 2020-10-09 10:02:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realbdyess Both, my mom always calls it supper, my coworker say dinner so I’ll use both at random

1314385112319102976 2020-10-09 10:00:05 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CalebJHull We all better invest in some good headphones (or whatever youngins use these days)
1314384821603500039 2020-10-09 09:58:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @chicksonright It felt to me like they were hoping for a positive, cuz let me tell ya, I wasn’t looking so good. I would’ve been good propaganda since I’m only 40ish
1314383809715023872 2020-10-09 09:54:54 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @chicksonright My point is, they put so much attention on covid, they seriously didn’t consider it would be safer to give me an antibiotic I didn’t need than withhold an antibiotic I did need. Now the question is, how strong an antibiotic is it going to take after 4 days of setting in!
1314382331461992449 2020-10-09 09:49:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @chicksonright So I called the Dr and said hey, I’m really sick. I hate to ask but under the circumstances could you not call in an antibiotic. No, they could not unless my test came back negative. So here’s day 4, I’m sicker, my fever is not breaking.
1314381606887608320 2020-10-09 09:46:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @chicksonright I gotta say something about this covid regime. I have been sick, went to the doctor and of course they tested for covid. I didn’t actually see a doctor, in fact I never got out of my car. They told me they’d call in 4 to 5 days. What they meant was ‘you’re done, drive along’
1314380652809269265 2020-10-09 09:42:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods @Patriot31 I think I just made that up too 😬

1314334959801454593 2020-10-09 06:40:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CorrieLdn I’m not exaggerating this either. I literally waited 5 days to find out I need antibiotics because I didn’t have rona. Now I’m hoping the antibiotics work!
1314334027227246593 2020-10-09 06:37:05 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CorrieLdn Well now that you ask, no I have not. I got sick tho, and since it took so long to find out I didn’t have rona...I got SICKER. See, you don’t get meds with rona, so they test you. If you have say, pneumonia, you just let it fester until that negative test comes back!

1314192403230871554 2020-10-08 21:14:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @NurseVqn They all probably passed right by the condom aisle when buying their masks

1314191325131137025 2020-10-08 21:10:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RepBarbaraLee You’re all for masks to prevent covid but apparently have something against condoms.  Don’t be stupid

1314186634804506624 2020-10-08 20:51:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Just think, you’ll be able to tell your grandchildren about the time you voted in a Presidential election that was based on a virus! Your grandchildren will probably ask you what a Presidential election was...but you’ll have those memories
1314186076718870530 2020-10-08 20:49:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods No one ever asks about all these peace deals taking place that’s keeping us out of endless wars. All they want to talk about is a damn virus!
1314185411992915968 2020-10-08 20:46:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino I was so proud of @VP for standing up to her like he did. He’s a great man of God so I know it’s not easy for him to play dirty but last night he was great!

1314180175580598275 2020-10-08 20:25:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LionelMedia @RowannRoy Not one question regarding the Presidents peace deals. Yeah, this is not an election, this is a performance to make us all believe there will be an elected President. This is nothing less than a quiet and slippery switch to socialism
1314176819881533441 2020-10-08 20:12:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> In 1999 my dad was 1 of 563,000 people who died of cancer that year.  On December 21st 1999 my dad was 1 of 1,500 people who died of cancer that day. Where’s the outrage?

1314031663962361857 2020-10-08 10:35:36 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Last question Through the eyes of an 8th grader she heard from @VP ‘hey kid, we adults disagree but play nice in the end.  From @KamalaHarris she heard it’ll be fixed if Joe wins. We need votes.

1313896830871179264 2020-10-08 01:39:50 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> In a nutshell, we let the government convince us to pimp out our kids so they could collect on that student loan interest.

1313285460597276672 2020-10-06 09:10:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Yr_Obt_Svt @robbystarbuck @realDonaldTrump Suppose those cages were built by Obama, that leaves us with covid. Would you agree that in the first few weeks everything Donald Trump said or did was contradicted by the media?
1313284877043761152 2020-10-06 09:08:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @_naptown @robbystarbuck @realDonaldTrump I don’t want to be your enemy just because we may have different views, and I wholeheartedly believe many people have thought of those very bill he’s signed. I only wanted to point out the irony that a president who’s supposed to be so bad thinks like you &amp; I. What do we need!?
1313283798117888007 2020-10-06 09:03:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @_naptown @robbystarbuck @realDonaldTrump So would you agree that Donald Trump did what was in his power to get as much done for us little people while he could? I think that’s why the media hates him, he’s done nothing for their big media franchises.
1313283337713258497 2020-10-06 09:02:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @_naptown @robbystarbuck @realDonaldTrump Let’s say your right He surrounded himself with great advisors though, can we say that? He picked the bills that best benefit the people, can we say that? He apparently fought to get the democrats to let him sign them because they’ve been anything but agreeable to him in 4 years
1313275743460372480 2020-10-06 08:31:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> 73M viewers! Think about that. The audacity to tell 73M people that what you’re witnessing isn’t real.  Pretty soon the walls are going to fall on that house of cards
1313275034945888266 2020-10-06 08:29:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TheLastRefuge2 @BanditoTrue Oh but I think our President might just have debunked that story. I’m pretty sure this is the beginning of the end of the covid nazis

1313273796124651520 2020-10-06 08:24:07 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @McduffeyTc @liquidlaugh @EmilyLewis1983 Trump came out of WR on day 3, no oxygen and looking great Now the country is going to question the seriousness of a virus that’s had us all locked up and masked up How many positives were a systematic versus systematic How many deaths were due to comorbities

1313271143478878208 2020-10-06 08:13:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @liquidlaugh They’re soooo mad that they can’t claim a life to this virus. Now the world is going to demand more transparency about the reported cases, i.e. a systematic versus systematic, comorbidities, etc.. And now that our leader &amp; chief has experienced it, the truth may come out
1313269335209713664 2020-10-06 08:06:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> #CNN thinking it’s okay for the peasant to go to work to get food to the stores, liquor on your shelves, AND salons to make you presentable...but you can’t wear a mask and do reporting at the WH.

1313235294766993411 2020-10-06 05:51:07 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @KassyDillon I didn’t vote for Trump in the 2016 primaries, I didn’t think he had a chance against HRC. I did vote for him in the election and was surprised by the win.

No, we haven’t been to any rallies, but we all have Trump signs.  I do not wear an aluminum foil hat lol, but dang the timing is so strange

1313212953328586752 2020-10-06 04:22:21 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ginamarie295 @BrandonStraka I refuse to share the floor with anyone who deflects the violence being caused by ANTIFA by suggesting it is being done by someone else. You know for a fact that is not true, but God forbid should you disagree with The Party God bless, have a nice day. I’ll pray for you
1313212012919427078 2020-10-06 04:18:36 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MRSpinkston85 I don’t think anyone should be responsible for carrying other people. If a candidate says he’s increasing taxes for the wealthy I know he/she means anyone making over 40K a year. They may hide it by lowering my standard deductions but I’m not stupid At the same time EIC goes up🤦‍♂️
1313210384199946248 2020-10-06 04:12:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I wouldn’t dare give credence to this raging lunatic, but does anyone else get the impression she’s advocating for concentration camps for republicans?
1313209876517138443 2020-10-06 04:10:07 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JRubinBlogger Maybe we should just put all republicans in a camp until November. After all that’s pretty much in line with your ranting suggestions

1313119024243527680 2020-10-05 22:09:06 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ginamarie295 @BrandonStraka In fact, just last week on national television they told 73M people that it isn’t real, only an idea.  My only intent here is to give you facts
1313118645703368705 2020-10-05 22:07:36 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ginamarie295 @BrandonStraka Not trying to beat a dead horse, but I want to make sure you understand who you’re voting for. Did you know that the democrats called for people to ‘take to the streets’? Did you know that they’ve never publicly called it terrorism on innocent people? Or asked them to stop?
1313111460659310599 2020-10-05 21:39:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I’m sorry, but I feel like some kind of federal security laws have been broken when #NancyPelosi publicly creates doubt around our #POTUS health on national television. At some point these people need to put politics aside and put our nation’s security first.
1312933393311633408 2020-10-05 09:51:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MRSpinkston85 Raising taxes for middle class to increase tax benefits for those making below a living wage.  That literally means some people work 6 months out of a year. They must have goals to break the chains of poverty.
1312927480429281282 2020-10-05 09:27:59 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I can’t figure out if the media’s upset about the Presidents recovery because it makes covid less newsworthy, or because it means the show will go on..without covid 🤷‍♀️ I’m calling a lid

If only somehow we could get a few short clips of these truths into view of every American. That’s the problem, the media is in control of the narrative, and the progressive democrats are in control of the media

1312788245802090496 2020-10-05 00:14:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Just an FYI, this ‘idea’ is still going on
1312787796474687489 2020-10-05 00:12:55 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> This is destroying cities and suburbs alike. When people shop for housing, they look at the nearest city for shopping &amp; entertainment. When the attractions are no longer attractive it affects surrounding areas as much as the cities. Essentially the entire state is affected
1312785886191456257 2020-10-05 00:05:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @seanhannity For anyone who came to Indianapolis for the Super Bowl in 2012, you wouldn’t recognize it. The shutdowns hit it hard, the riots finished it off. Now crime is rising and Monument Circle is littered with homelessness and drugs. It’s so sad
1312783941062057984 2020-10-04 23:57:36 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DonaldJTrumpJr In every socialist society, the leaders always started by having the children denounce people. They created laws/rules that appealed to young people for this very reason

Any claims that there was a better way to do it is FALSE, no scientific proof to back the claim.

1312435506144112641 2020-10-04 00:53:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @QTAnon1 @liquidlaugh Donald Trump Being sick doesn’t disqualify someone from being president

1312421817492090880 2020-10-03 23:58:39 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @KamalaHarris Trump is the elected President until January 2021. That happened in January 2017...NOT November 2016 Do y’all understand how this actually works?
1312420611457781761 2020-10-03 23:53:52 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JackPosobiec The vast amount of intelligence displayed in this video tho 🙄

1312403281268953088 2020-10-03 22:45:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CalebJHull So, I had SARS in 1993, I was 22 and had just had a baby. It turned into double pneumonia and I was hospitalized with a BP of 30/20 (no lie) They never vented me, they only gave me oxygen but never an oxygen mask This vent thing bothered me from the start
1312396303654158336 2020-10-03 22:17:16 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jxwash1 @RealDonaldHumor @Jim_Jordan You think the answer is to wear a mask, social distance, forego sports, forego church, etc. forever is the answer? No, it is absolutely not the answer. Let’s see how our 74 year old President comes through then chat
1312092134691024897 2020-10-03 02:08:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CATTYCONSERVAT1 Right now every American needs to be hyper focused. Everything is starting to make sense
1312090439869235201 2020-10-03 02:01:52 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DonaldJTrumpJr @lupe_bustillos I pray that you’re hyper focused right now...just saying

I don’t want to sound like I’m wearing some kind of tin foil hat.....but Pelosi wished for their health while in the same breath discussed members of our military being ‘ready’ should someone need to step in AJ is starting to sound more sane everyday

1312057954196230144 2020-10-02 23:52:47 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino This is the most frightened I’ve been all year.  Last week a presidential candidate and a news anchor told the entire country that we’re imagining ANTIFA violence This week our president is being quarantined for 14 days
1312057078081556488 2020-10-02 23:49:18 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DineshDSouza Unfortunately he has to quarantine for 14 days. They literally have our P on lockdown, which is verrrrry troubling if you ask me
1312055951877386241 2020-10-02 23:44:50 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @davidicke From the US here. I’m concerned over the recent news that our -p - has tested positive for this ‘v’. Because I live here and I support him, I have to be careful with my statements.  My -p- is on -h o u s e a r r e s t- or is a -h o s t a g e-? I simply can’t shake this notion 🙏
1312047639618297856 2020-10-02 23:11:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> What I see here is a washed up #andersoncooper interviewing a jealous old acquaintance of our First Lady. What I heard was nothing, because any time I see coop, I scroll along

1312029944902496259 2020-10-02 22:01:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino When will you stop watching cable news? If we REALLY want to save this country we need to stop allowing these networks spread this socialist ideology.

I bought a home via a mortgage. Guess what else! I’ve never received ONE benefit from the government, not Medicaid, not food stamp....nothing. Never got a dime of child support either It’s called responsibility not privilege

1311844566182526984 2020-10-02 09:44:52 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Here is a tweet from #IlhanOmar telling people not to pay their housing. I’m blown away by how irresponsible our #Democrats are behaving right now. So many young lives being ruined in effort to crash the economy. Will we have a new housing crisis in 2 years? Pray for us all!
1311843013526683648 2020-10-02 09:38:41 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Winner‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️  Liberals b*tching about Trump claiming losses on his investments   Also liberals - we won’t pay rent because our landlords have other shit to fall back on 🤦‍♂️
1311842151207239680 2020-10-02 09:35:16 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @michaelakkarin @Ashgobert1 @VaporousVan @Ilhan @briebriejoy Did your parents not teach you this crap? And I like that ‘other investments’. Were y’all not just bitching about Trump claiming those very losses on his taxes? You can’t make this kinda stupid up
1311841671659819010 2020-10-02 09:33:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @michaelakkarin @Ashgobert1 @VaporousVan @Ilhan @briebriejoy That’s what they teach you in school? When you buy a house, you have to pay at least 5% down. For a $200,000 that’s $10,000. That leaves you with a $190,000 mortgage. With taxes &amp; insurance your payment is over $1,200 a month...FOR 30 YEARS
1311831649009704960 2020-10-02 08:53:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CurtisHouck Can I just say this....it’s all happening on the heels of legalizing marijuana 🤷‍♀️
1311824762130370562 2020-10-02 08:26:10 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> This link has directed people to the Biden/Harris website for months. If the Biden campaign didn’t want any ties to ANTIFA, they would’ve stopped this immediately. This is real, ANTIFA is NOT an idea. For them to deny their validity to 73M viewers is insane! #BidenRiots

Yet they did manage to tell 73M people ANTIFAs not real
1311821002259795968 2020-10-02 08:11:14 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @carrielukas @lupe_bustillos @CNN Pull your child out of school while you can. Imagine, in 2 years your own children will be forced to denounce you.  Sound like a conspiracy theory? A presidential candidate and a major news anchor just told 73 million people that ANTIFA is in our heads
1311819314769661953 2020-10-02 08:04:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MFrasca79 @realDonaldTrump Well you only have roughly 4M left to vote 🤦‍♂️
1311817105516507136 2020-10-02 07:55:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump Solyndra cost the American people $528,000,000..... My mom said to remind you to ask Biden about that. She’s still pretty pissed
1311815255929040903 2020-10-02 07:48:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @tedcruz @lupe_bustillos That in itself is THE scariest thing I’ve seen this year. 1 presidential candidate and one major media anchor telling over 73M people that things anyone and everyone can witness within a days drive is not real. Why would they do that? I’m glad my President stood up for me
1311813299000967168 2020-10-02 07:40:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @tedcruz @lupe_bustillos I heard that and waited a few seconds for SOMEONE to recant, and had it not been for the President I would’ve seriously believed I had lost my mind. Biden and Wallace both told the entire country that no, ANTIFAs not real, it’s 30 or so country boys doing all this violence
1311812452754100226 2020-10-02 07:37:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @tedcruz @lupe_bustillos -green economy-they know this is a lie because there’s no way they forgot Solyndra and the $535,000,000 it cost us (a lot of f*cking zeros) And this. Imagine being on a stage in front of over 73M people and being told that ANTIFA never happened
1311810918746120194 2020-10-02 07:31:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @tedcruz @lupe_bustillos -Trumps taxes-Donald Trump as a businessman didn’t use TurboTax. No CPA worth his salt is not going to use every exemption available -climate-they wanted him to answer truthfully because they know the truth. There are fires on the our west coast that miraculously stop at Canada
1311809662405181448 2020-10-02 07:26:10 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @tedcruz @lupe_bustillos -masks-again, there’s not one consistent report from anyone, medical or scientific, that provides or proves that masks have slowed, are slowing or will slow the spread -covid economy-other than sending businesses money for not providing a service, this was unavoidable
1311808254754934786 2020-10-02 07:20:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @tedcruz @lupe_bustillos I disagree  🧵  The topics that were selected clearly set the stage for the debate.  -covid-there’s not one fact that exist for covid. Even the reported deaths lack enough information to draw a conclusion. There’s nothing anyone can say or do to change the course
1311807291231002624 2020-10-02 07:16:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @atrupar If you don’t believe this is working, wait until November. People will not tolerate you labeling them anymore.  ANTIFA is an organization funded, fueled and supported by the media and the democrats and THAT is what’s destroying America!
1311806243149942784 2020-10-02 07:12:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @atrupar Here’s what you don’t get to do anymore. You don’t get to label Trump supporters as white supremacist. Every second, every tweet, every article you and your like spend on this I commit myself to take 5 more votes from democrats for Trump

1311723884140523521 2020-10-02 01:45:19 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DonaldJTrumpJr But the #DemocratsTheEnemyWithin instead chose to deflect his plea by claiming the violence was anyone but an imaginary violent organization. Unfortunately, they already created the mood for the stage so too many people recognized the presidents cry for help
1311723086660751363 2020-10-02 01:42:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DonaldJTrumpJr What the media and leftist audience chose not to hear, Proud Boys stand down- American citizens do not be violent! Stand by, but someone’s gotta do something about ANTIFA- Joe, media, help me get the message across to stop the violence!
1311720978435645440 2020-10-02 01:33:46 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @PressSec @johnrobertsFox The media  -covid -masks -race Also the media  -covid -masks -race Never the media -peace agreements -unemployment  -ANTIFA  Their sources -Twitter -Facebook

1311713953911902211 2020-10-02 01:05:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> This is the most INSANE behavior I’ve ever seen.  How about this, will the media denounce ANTIFA and admit they’ve created violence in our streets? #CNN  #NBC  #MSNBC  #ABC
1311712534597185536 2020-10-02 01:00:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> This SHIT right here is why our President has to play a strong defense. All the sudden we have a media full of financial and tax experts. Talk about super PACs 🤦‍♂️ #MAGA  #DefundTheMedia
1311710109819703299 2020-10-02 00:50:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dsando123 The thing that comes to mind is Twisted Sister. As a Trump supporter, just trying to live a normal life this year is difficult. I’m ridiculed on TV, social media, work, the store, the airport. I just want to scream ‘We’re not gonna take it anymore!’ Kinda glad I’m not alone 🙂
1311689496828706816 2020-10-01 23:28:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @thejtlewis I agree. I actually sat &amp; watched it alone last night. Trump KNEW he was going in to defend himself in the very beginning. The topics alone were a clear indication that it wasn’t a presidential debate but a campaign strategy for the democrats
1311688916978798592 2020-10-01 23:26:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RCalh @WarrenPlatts @ScottAdamsSays That was all just gaslighting from Biden AND the network

1311685423845068801 2020-10-01 23:12:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dsando123 Another thing I would like Trump to address-Biden says he plans to reverse Trumps tax cuts and all anyone wants to hear are the people making $400K and up. Well, the vast majority of people went from 25 and 28% to 22 and 24%, where does Biden stand on that?
1311682846109638659 2020-10-01 23:02:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @IamXenoMorph @MinnPatriot @JoeBiden Trumps tax cuts reduced mine from 25% to 22%. I don’t make 400K a year 🤷‍♀️
1311679216346370048 2020-10-01 22:47:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dsando123 Trump has yet to bring up Solyndra, that in itself would show the people that ‘green energy’ isn’t a solution to economic growth. In fact it’s unpredictability and very expensive
1311678544733405184 2020-10-01 22:45:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dsando123 They didn’t want him to bring up his peace deals, otherwise it would’ve been a topic. What I saw last night (alone) was a candidate being forced to defend himself against imaginary issues
1311677985632727041 2020-10-01 22:42:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dsando123 So after I watched it alone last night I saw a different debate. I saw a candidate who knew from the start he was setup come out with a STRONG defense. I imagine when his team saw the topics the knew. Had Trump been less aggravating, the slander would’ve stuck
1311676986503372800 2020-10-01 22:38:58 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dsando123 And the most damning-the riots. The station allowed the democrats to use the debate to campaign by gaslighting the people. It’s 100% clear that the violence is coming from ANTIFA, yet both Wallace and Biden used the debate to suggest otherwise
1311676098690899969 2020-10-01 22:35:26 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dsando123 Packing courts and eliminating filibuster- here was a valid question related to the agreed topics. Biden was given a free pass. Wallace should have stated that it was a yes or no question and when he refused to answer should’ve ended his 2 minutes and given the time to Trump
1311675570082721793 2020-10-01 22:33:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dsando123 Trumps taxes as a businessman - first of all, it hasn’t been established whether the documents were legally obtained. Had we been a jury this would be inadmissible
1311674744484368386 2020-10-01 22:30:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dsando123 The forest fires - they’ve arrested people starting fires on the west coast. I think it’s a bit exaggerated to attribute them to global warming. A key fact, they do stop at the Canadian border 🤷‍♀️
1311674269538148352 2020-10-01 22:28:10 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dsando123 The current economy- this was caused by the virus shutdowns. Again, completely out of everyone’s control. Shouldn’t have been up for debate Masks - unless I live on another planet, there’s been so many contradictions over the effectiveness that there’s no good answer period
1311667314996117511 2020-10-01 22:00:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dsando123 -Covid. Is a virus that no one knew anything about. No one could’ve predicted how many people became infected or who would die from the complications. Here, Wallace even allowed Biden to make a statement about future deaths 🤔
1311666705068748802 2020-10-01 21:58:06 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dsando123 Trump was keeping pretty calm in the first couple of segments, but it became clear to me that the debate had topics constructed just to make Trump look bad. I actually believe they (the democrats and network) wanted Trump to react worse!
1311665820062285828 2020-10-01 21:54:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dsando123 I recommend you watch it a second time. Tuesday I felt like Trump missed the chance to let Joe hang himself, but I watched again last night to see if I missed anything, I did.  🧵

1311663988485378048 2020-10-01 21:47:19 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @drjohnny__ The problem is these people seriously believe this is a popularity contest rather than an election for a leader. That party is running entirely on fear tactics, why else was a virus and forest fires topics? Vote for me so you can be healthy and the planet don’t burn 🤮
1311662746371592193 2020-10-01 21:42:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> #JoeBiden apparently got in the race to  -pack or not pack the courts? -get rid of or keep the filibuster? -disagree with his party’s manifesto? -create more jobs like those created through Solyndra -give $20M to the Amazon rainforest  -push forward with Obamacare
1311519007728640000 2020-10-01 12:11:12 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Oh look @realDonaldTrump fixing our crooked voting while he’s at it #4NobePeacePrize  #NoWars  #Jobs  #4MoreYears  #MAGA

1311514259428442112 2020-10-01 11:52:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CNN he’s not lying. They stopped turning your station on at the old folks home because the old folks h a t e your tactics
1311513395607351301 2020-10-01 11:48:54 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> And #JoeBiden had a trick up his sleeve. I recommend you roll the tape again
1311512553869185025 2020-10-01 11:45:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I just watched the entire debate for a second time. Hands down, @realDonaldTrump won. Joe may have appeared more calm last night but I highly recommend you watch again. Joes campaign is and always has been covid and green new deal #Solyndra  #JoeBidenIsTheSwamp

1311477323871461377 2020-10-01 09:25:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods Trump was more honest on the issues and he didn’t avoid questions. He came out like he had nothing to hide.  Joe appeared calmer and responsive (we didn’t expect) but he didn’t answer any question with finality. In fact, he actually raised some.  Courts, filibuster, GND to start

1311452480035860480 2020-10-01 07:46:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Do we need to remind #JoeBiden who’s shooting cops, looting businesses and burning down cities. #DemocratsLie tell the public that it’s not #AntifaTerrorist in fact he said they don’t exist.  #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt  #MAGA  #DemocratsHateAmerica
1311450942441750528 2020-10-01 07:40:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden This is why I’m voting for Trump. It’s why I have over 150 people who now say they’ll vote for Trump. Many of them believe you’re trying to brainwash them into thinking this is NOT left wing agitators. Hey, but keep preaching this nonsense
1311445284929654785 2020-10-01 07:18:16 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods An idea?
1311444652680196097 2020-10-01 07:15:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods This woman singlehandedly created every problem we have today. She publicly attacked our President and demanded that the rest of the country follow suit. She should be removed from office so we can have peace in this country again  #PelosiMustGo
1311440948451254273 2020-10-01 07:01:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> This statement here is what made me walk extra miles today talking to potential voters. I showed this recap to everyone I could making sure they know that not only does @JoeBiden deny their existence, he blames the violence on others
1311436517852708867 2020-10-01 06:43:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden I can’t be gaslighted
1311435173356073055 2020-10-01 06:38:05 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods Next weeks VP debate will be telling
1311434819805630464 2020-10-01 06:36:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden And you hate golf
1311434131344183300 2020-10-01 06:33:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden That you automatically enroll people into a government regulated healthcare program That you would increase taxes by moving forward with Obamacare That your only plan to combat covid &amp; the economy is a shutdown and clean energy I heard that WITH all the noise!
1311433155497336832 2020-10-01 06:30:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden What I didn’t hear is  Do you plan on packing courts and getting rid of filibuster You didn’t ask BLM/ANTIFA to stand down You denounced the Sanders/Biden manifesto for the first time ever You denounced the green new deal for the first time ever
1311432424497258497 2020-10-01 06:27:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden That it’s true that no one knows the facts behind covid reported cases and deaths He will create real job (see Solyndra) That it’s true the democrats have labeled all white people as white supremacist (critical race theory) That no one will be denied medical for pre-existing
1311431252390621191 2020-10-01 06:22:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden He wants the country open He wants kids in school He doesn’t want to give $20 billion to the Amazon He won’t fall for a clean energy scam like Solyndra He is lowering my medical cost that increased significantly under Obama When he ban travel to China you called him racist
1311428668238057474 2020-10-01 06:12:14 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> When asked a critical question, Biden immediately went to the camera urging people to vote. If one were not focused on the presidents outrage they would’ve noticed at least 3 times Biden was unable to respond during which time he took to the cameras with practiced speech
1311427137849655296 2020-10-01 06:06:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> -Biden believes the country (schools included) should embrace critical race theory  -Biden blamed the riots on American patriots calling them white supremacist -Biden said ANTIFA is an idea, not real  -Biden denied that the Obama/Biden crime bill hurt black Americans
1311424994229063680 2020-10-01 05:57:38 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> -Biden’s plan on the economy is green energy -Biden eluded on moving away from fracking over time -Biden wants to give $20 billion to the Amazon rainforest -Biden would have people automatically enrolled into Medicaid based on their income
1311423816430743552 2020-10-01 05:52:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Here’s what people might not have heard -Biden said he’s not for the green new deal -Biden refused to answer if he’d pack the courts &amp; get rid of filibuster -Biden denied there is a Sanders/Biden manifesto  -Biden said his plan on combatting covid is to shut down again
1311422718517145601 2020-10-01 05:48:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> This is 100% true. Biden’s responses didn’t answer the questions that were asked, in a couple of instances he lied. Unfortunately the world at large couldn’t recognize this because..well, there was too much noise.
1311419464332738563 2020-10-01 05:35:39 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump could’ve peed on the stage AND THIS would be enough to make me vote for him
1311419015261229056 2020-10-01 05:33:52 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Honestly, I h a t e  these people just for this.
1311418553061564420 2020-10-01 05:32:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DallasFlamesFan No, you’re not. It’s sooo easy for them to distract us with shit we can’t confirm. Before another person claims 200K covid deaths, I want clear proof. I want to know  Age Pre-existing conditions Otherwise I will consider it a rumor
1311338197012615168 2020-10-01 00:12:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @novinski0G @realDonaldTrump One thing we need to do is lower the cost for everyone, period. Premiums need to be affordable, deductibles need to be lowered and medicine needs to be easily accessible.  Our one true form of federal healthcare is our VA. I think that speaks volumes on how far we have yet to go
1311337568152289280 2020-10-01 00:10:14 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @novinski0G @realDonaldTrump I think many Americans can agree that we need better healthcare. But I think the best approach is to look at all other countries with federal healthcare and weed out the pros and cons. That could take a long time so there must be balance in the process
1311336823604629505 2020-10-01 00:07:16 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Where do they get this stuff? Now @realDonaldTrump is golfing us to death 🤦‍♂️ PS Bev, the story about Nero and his fiddle was debunked long ago. The viol (the instrument class in which the fiddle belongs) was introduced in the 11th century.
1311334176692621313 2020-09-30 23:56:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @bad021040 @atallnut @RepKevinBrady I think you’re reading too much on social media. Honestly you can love him or hate him, but I really doubt he’s golfing the US to death. That’s a pretty insane statement
1311328513161596930 2020-09-30 23:34:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @novinski0G @realDonaldTrump Under Obamacare my premiums and deductible increased and my cap was reduced. Last year my out of pocket decreased (not a lot but it did).  Healthcare is America’s # 1 industry in the global economy. Before we federalize healthcare we need to increase output in other industries
1311323739506831360 2020-09-30 23:15:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @liquidlaugh There’s only 3 year’s difference between Trump &amp; Biden. The reason Trump appears so much younger is because running businesses require physical activity. Being in politics only requires a mouth
1311322835671973888 2020-09-30 23:11:41 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods Honestly if Trump would’ve just let Biden’s answers drop, he’d have been better off. Biden’s instructions were - when you get overwhelmed look at the camera and talk to the people. That became clear in the first segment. All Trump had to do was let it happen. Just my opinion
1311319752288108544 2020-09-30 22:59:26 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TonyHil21347234 @realDonaldTrump It’s unfortunate that his personality overshadows what he’s actually accomplished in 3.5 years. There are a lot of good topics on both sides, but if I never turned on the TV or got on social media I’d say my life has ben better in the last few years (before the covid meltdown)
1311318271933714435 2020-09-30 22:53:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Our healthcare industry drives Americas economy. In order to truly go to federal healthcare, America would need to increase output in other industries
1311310123814580231 2020-09-30 22:21:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump We, YOUR SUPPORTERS kindly ask that the next time prove them all wrong. Let Biden’s answers speak for themselves, we all hear his lack of any real plans. They’re using your ‘energy’ against you. Don’t let them!
1311309333641285633 2020-09-30 22:18:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @SheriffReese I think you denouncing the President on social media is very telling. Your city is in ruin and your officers hands are tied. People are fleeing in droves because of this ongoing violence.  I think you’re for law &amp; order, and the fact you can’t say that is what’s telling
1311300659367612416 2020-09-30 21:43:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I’m of the opinion that if there are any undecided voters, they’re wondering who would fill the seat if Biden’s health declines. That being said, I honestly believe next weeks VP debate will play a critical role and might even sway some voters away from Biden #VPDebate #MAGA
1311299266174947329 2020-09-30 21:38:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RowannRoy @realDonaldTrump I’m going to be honest, Trump would’ve been better off to just let Biden give his bad answers. I think as far as addressing issues Trump did a better job, but his interruptions weren’t good on his part. Just how I feel, but I’m still voting for Trump, didn’t change my mind
1311294923786850305 2020-09-30 21:20:47 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ChrisAmass2 @CLO93_30 @CNBC You’re missing the point. Anything Trump did was not during his presidency. I have more issue with politicians going from $200,000 salary to multi millionaires while ‘looking out for the people’

1311167892604555265 2020-09-30 12:56:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RowannRoy I’ll meet you in the middle. Trump acted his normal self, no shock Biden on packing courts &amp; ending filibuster-I’m not answering  Biden on GND-denounced for first time today Biden on ANTIFA-it’s just an idea (like it’s not real) Biden on economic plan-GND (see 2)
1311161517618929665 2020-09-30 12:30:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @charliekirk11 @word1988 These were enough, Trump could’ve actually said nothing. Biden’s answers were all we needed
1311161288127586304 2020-09-30 12:29:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I’m ready for @Mike_Pence to debate Harris. I think this will be a slam dunk! It will decide a lot of votes because there are some democrat voters who are concerned she may have to step in as president. We need to show them she could never be either and our VP is the man to do it
1311160306660507649 2020-09-30 12:25:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump @word1988 Sir, I love you and I’m voting for you. In fact I’ve helped several people register for the first time.  That being said, let Joe have his 2 minutes. The answers he gives are either opposite from past answers, or not altogether true. The people know this, so keep calm, we know!
1311159547059372033 2020-09-30 12:22:50 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @bennyjohnson @word1988 The answer was LOUD AND CLEAR. ANTIFA isn’t real. In fact, they eluded to the right causing the violence
1311159184398974976 2020-09-30 12:21:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @kilmeade @word1988 @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Well to be fair....Trump dominated the interruption part lol. He should’ve just let Biden speak, a lot of his answers were opposite of what he’s been saying. Trump needs to let us be the judge while he gives the 2 minutes
1311158435585699840 2020-09-30 12:18:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @EricTrump I agree because I was afraid Trumps interruptions would cost him a lot. I know they came from both sides, but let’s face it when the President has something to say....he MUST. That could be his weakness at some point. Work with him on 2 minutes of meditation before the next one🙂
1311156616482488321 2020-09-30 12:11:12 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> So if you’re voting on performance personality, Biden stayed calm through most of it. Trumps personal attacks may have lost some points On the topics, Trump has a more realistic plans, and it’s already proven successful pre covid. Biden has more of a mix of ‘the party’s’ ideas
1311154240166006795 2020-09-30 12:01:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> To summarize, Biden came off more level headed, but it didn’t make is responses better. Trump has a lot of energy and got personal a couple of times. Overall debate topics, Trump had real solutions and past performance where Biden has only ideas from other party members
1311152801515479040 2020-09-30 11:56:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Yet Biden again flipped his position on healthcare, tonight he denounced the Sanders/Biden plan. He also stated that if you’re below a certain income, you would be automatically enrolled. I imagine most people wouldn’t care for government overreach on this and would prefer choice
1311151820203589632 2020-09-30 11:52:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> -Healthcare. The US is graded mostly on our healthcare across the globe. This is basically where our dollar sits. Without our healthcare, our economy would decline on the world stage. Trump only spoke to our bad national healthcare plan, he should’ve went more into the effect it
1311150922626719746 2020-09-30 11:48:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> -Climate change. Trump was able to recognize the need for cleaner energy while making it clear that we can’t eliminate jobs in the process. Biden denounced the green new deal for the first time today
1311150371071561728 2020-09-30 11:46:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> -Law and order. Trump has the endorsements from many police unions. Biden eluded to social workers, which speaks to defunding police  -Riots. Trump calls for law &amp; order. Biden (with moderators help) eluded to ‘patriots’ causing riots and said ANTIFA is non existent
1311149583951712257 2020-09-30 11:43:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> -covid issue on economy. Biden would shut the country down again, Trump wants to open -Pre covid economy. Trump already had the thumbs up on that. -race issues. Those issues are always sensitive, but Trump has reversed some bad policies. Biden’s only answer was we have a problem
1311148461782437889 2020-09-30 11:38:47 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> My take - all Trump needed to do is let Biden answer his questions -covid issue on health - people have already made up their mind about it. Nothing either candidate says at this point will change their minds
1311133130435309571 2020-09-30 10:37:52 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> This is such a lie. Why does Biden keep looking down at the podium!?
1311116656328966148 2020-09-30 09:32:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I’m so pissed off that the virus is even a topic

1311100228964175872 2020-09-30 08:27:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Does anyone else recall her deal with Putin to hit the reset button once she was elected?

1311097450011262976 2020-09-30 08:16:05 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CellBioProf @RepKevinBrady Yes, to slander Trumps travel ban

1311071580299067392 2020-09-30 06:33:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @atallnut @RepKevinBrady And they show how well they’ve been rewarded while in politics.  I’m troubled by the adults who are more upset about a businessman’s taxes than career politicians enormous wealth! I mean, is there anything more disgusting than people getting rich FROM politics?
1311070430967599104 2020-09-30 06:28:43 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Angelsfan4life @RepKevinBrady You’re not just a wee bit concerned why politicians with a $175,000 salary have a $3M tax bill? Yeah, let’s focus on Trump 🤦‍♂️

1311064402091679744 2020-09-30 06:04:46 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I certainly hope this is a lie @MSNBC  This is a debate, not a campaign for one presidential candidate over the other.
1311062400695758849 2020-09-30 05:56:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @AOC @donaldbroom You’re so corrupt you think you’re normal. Lady, you NEED TO GO
1311061133311258632 2020-09-30 05:51:47 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MustangMan_TX @donaldbroom Women are notorious for believing what their friends or parents do. I asked a friend once ‘would you vote for Eva Braun just so Trump would lose?’ Her answer was yes.  Pretty sure she don’t know who that is, nor would she take the trouble to find out. Not Trump was enough for her

1311051632176771072 2020-09-30 05:14:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Everyone acting like @realDonaldTrump using TurboTax 🤦‍♂️
1311049506239242243 2020-09-30 05:05:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ValentinePomMom @CNBC A president who’s salary is only $175,000 yet his tax bill is $3M. The Biden’s have gotten RICH off of the American people through government deals as where Trump actually has businesses 🤦‍♂️
1311048626769211394 2020-09-30 05:02:05 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @austonwilkinson @CNBC Technically Biden’s salary is only $175,000. Does it make you sick that his income exceeded that by 10,925,000? Career politicians are the worst crooks of all
1311048028984410113 2020-09-30 04:59:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @sueyellin @CNBC @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Never mind his salary is only $175,000. Where’s the rest of that $11M come from? Career politicians are the WORST. He’s making BANK from politics
1311047520479571973 2020-09-30 04:57:41 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CLO93_30 @CNBC And it should bother everyone because Joes been in politics 40+ years with a $175,000 salary. Basically he’s getting filthy rich in politics, Trump got his wealth in business
1311046672248602626 2020-09-30 04:54:19 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I don’t know about anyone else, but it irks me more that a 40+ year politician with a $175,000 income is showing an income of $11M. I’d rather have a businessman who avoids high taxes than a politician getting rich from politics!
1311004567988064271 2020-09-30 02:07:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JackPosobiec How someone who’s been a politician for 40 years and makes $175,000 had a $3M tax bill.  My mom wants to know 🙂

1311000247334731778 2020-09-30 01:49:50 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Beardy_Paj @FelixThePest @EricTrump Social security is a Ponzi scheme. My mother draws 3 times as much from her IRA than social security. Imagine if she’d only been able to put the money into her IRA that she put into social security.  She also pays for her healthcare, and her deductible is twice as mine
1310755778987425792 2020-09-29 09:38:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @AngelaC02832391 @JackPosobiec Now I see light, I owe less on my home than I have in 401K, both vehicles paid off (under 7 years old). Updating our home, very minimal CC debt. I did all this in 4 years, Gods truth!
1310755207136120837 2020-09-29 09:36:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @AngelaC02832391 @JackPosobiec I suffered from the housing crisis, newly divorced with 2 kids &amp; my home was worth 70% what I owed. Then suddenly I was in a ‘new’ tax bracket. I was a broke girl. Obamacare came, there went our weekly pizza party. I’ll tell ya, we were struggling
1310753926124371968 2020-09-29 09:31:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @AngelaC02832391 @JackPosobiec I am so much better off. I actually believe I’ll be able to pay off my house and retire within 10 years..I’m not even 50. 2018 (for 2017) was the first time in decades the IRS actually owed me! I was literally scheduled to have some much needed medical stuff done until covid

I am going to hold to my theory that we made college too readily available and we now have a society of uneducated college graduates who need jobs. Instead of admitting failure, we create problems so they can work on solutions

1310600118480109576 2020-09-28 23:19:52 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @SenSchumer If you paid more taxes than Trump it’s because you’re taking in more money than the American people agreed to pay you. In short, you’re getting rich off the government, at least Trump earned his!

Either way it’s a gamble, but I’ll go where odds are better

In fact, both have established their own ‘private’ charities. This too is one of those cringing tax write offs.

Yes, I do feel like our tax codes can be improved Now hear me out, like Trump or not, he became wealthy as a businessman, not a politician. The media is trying to paint him as a bad guy for taking advantage of tax credits
1310591890870464512 2020-09-28 22:47:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Since we’re on the topic of taxes  https://t.co/L1RRiqNE0u
1310583152885334016 2020-09-28 22:12:27 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Democrats want us to get mad because someone who owns businesses that serve the public and create jobs takes tax credits. But people who got rich off of politics and move their $ to their own private charities to avoid taxes is somehow better? #TrumpPence2020

Because he wants people to succeed, it’s good for the economy and raises everyone to the same level. Without bad neighborhoods there’s no them versus us.  That my friend is the opposite of racist imo
1310017956110381056 2020-09-27 08:46:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @KAG43210 The Republican that did increase the funding was Trump, the democrat that didn’t was Obama. However Obama did give $500M to a solar plant in California that went bankrupt within 5 years. See, here we have a president investing in people, where Obama invested in his Party
1310016909694435344 2020-09-27 08:42:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @KAG43210 With more opportunities they lose government funding. In short, the better people do for themselves the less they get paid.  -Why did a Republican increase the funding from $17M to $360M for HBCUs and not a democrat?
1310014971875598336 2020-09-27 08:34:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @KAG43210 -Their schools are often old and score very low on education. Yet they receive the largest amount of government funding, so why aren’t they pouring it into the community? Because it would draw a more diverse group of people and with them more opportunities.
1310014123477028864 2020-09-27 08:31:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @KAG43210 This will take a couple of replies, bare me -Why democrat ran cities with a high population of minorities are often ran down &amp; dangerous - take an inventory around a one of those cities and you’ll find a liquor store, check cashing, and gun/pawn shop every other block

1309951392128303105 2020-09-27 04:22:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden So what you’re saying is your platform is based on a virus? Sorry Joe, but @realDonaldTrump already did all those things you mentioned. The only way it could possibly turn out differently is if in fact it’s true the democrats and media were always working against him

A handmaiden is a woman who follows God, the term is ‘borrowed’ and gives reference to Mary, mother of Jesus.
1309900160848232449 2020-09-27 00:58:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @suncomingup @lupe_bustillos I imagine Soros has people so embedded in our government that it’ll be a mighty task for our President to bring him to justice. Maybe after he wins in November? One can hope
1309875543706394630 2020-09-26 23:20:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Correction, this is how the mob selected by the left, fueled by the media and funded by socialist reacted to Trumps last SCOTUS nominee
1309874690291269632 2020-09-26 23:17:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I love @realDonaldTrump because for the first time in decades I feel like we have a president who’s stepped outside of Washington and see what REAL American people need and want
1309861255201554433 2020-09-26 22:23:53 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @OD_ant @lupe_bustillos I believe some tragedy is going to happen by then, maybe more ‘wild fires’ or a sudden ‘surge in confirmed cases’, or something. I don’t think they’ll just cancel, but they won’t let it happen
1309860449299689474 2020-09-26 22:20:41 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @barr_support However, you won’t see that in my town lol. We’re less than 50 miles outside a big city, when the mob threatened to march in our area, all of our city trucks suddenly had work to do at our exits 😂

1309285904540934146 2020-09-25 08:17:39 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Why is it so hard for me to take the virus serious? Because there’s never been one shred of consistency from health agencies. Every effort made by the President was ridiculed, and let’s be real here, THAT would never happen in a pandemic. Not even in an election year
1309283620624924672 2020-09-25 08:08:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @marklevinshow So I’ll say it because I’m not afraid. It’s almost like this virus comes out of nowhere and someone seizes it so they can use it as a weapon in the 2020 campaign. We have mass riots, yet everyone is focused on an ever changing virus. Makes it hard to take it serious imo
1309282955735568384 2020-09-25 08:05:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @marklevinshow Since the CDC couldn’t decide whether masks work or not, whether the virus is airborne or not I’d say he did a damn good job. The way their advice and data kept changing with very move he made, it’s almost like they kept moving the goal post.
1309281185298812928 2020-09-25 07:58:54 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @marklevinshow This was NEVER about your health. If you believe you may have covid you’re to self quarantine and notify people you’ve been around so they can self quarantine. There’s paycheck protection for those who lost their jobs from shutdowns, nothing about if you miss work from being sick
1309280068963905543 2020-09-25 07:54:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @marklevinshow 3. The CDC started smoking could decrease your chance of survival, they never banned cigarettes? 4. Why were liquor stores essential? 5. Why can you go to McDonalds but mental therapy appointments Tele visits? 6. Why did in treatment drug abuse centers/AA meetings close?

1308948571941724160 2020-09-24 09:57:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @chicksonright I wonder, if she was an EMT did she ever have to save someone from an overdose from the drugs her man was selling?
1308946173969997826 2020-09-24 09:47:41 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @robbystarbuck I got one too. I welcome them because I swear to you I wouldn’t go easy

1308928450204446721 2020-09-24 08:37:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DonaldJTrumpJr are these officers getting hazard pay? I’d like for you to take a portion of my taxes and give it to these police officers.  Anyone else feel the same?

1308926494014672898 2020-09-24 08:29:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> And Eva Pelosi just keeps going. Who has time for compassion or concern when the election is on the line.  One more reason to believe they NEVER cared about our health, just our compliance

1308899356687437826 2020-09-24 06:41:39 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> THIS is what @TheDemocrats and the media have done to our police

1308884418032009222 2020-09-24 05:42:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Is anyone praying for the families who lost loved ones from drug overdoses? Did they get $12 million?  Our opioid crisis wasn’t killed by covid, it’s still very real and is spread through drug dealers
1308866717641252864 2020-09-24 04:31:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT @RampageRantz Is this real?

1308864881358233607 2020-09-24 04:24:39 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> This will spread fast. Living 100 miles from Louisville doesn’t make me comfortable

1308812490994745345 2020-09-24 00:56:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CalebJHull Like that’ll come up 🤦‍♂️
1308802765783785472 2020-09-24 00:17:50 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CNNPolitics Biden needs no help in that department
1308786830515621889 2020-09-23 23:14:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Get ready, you’re about to lose your right to kneel at the alter and be forced to kneel to the flag. Your world could quite literally be turned upside down.

1308763022781972480 2020-09-23 21:39:54 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CalebJHull Cigarettes kill more people in a month than guns do in a year. Yet no ones banning those
1308756275585585154 2020-09-23 21:13:06 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Sounds like he’s buying votes to me. Is this even legal?
1308754355382820872 2020-09-23 21:05:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @hrenee80 I don’t think they understand that when you steal signs from someone they just buy more, thus putting more funds into @realDonaldTrump campaign 🤣🤣 I have mine, plus my flag. I bought some for my neighbors too. And shirts, EVEN shoes! I am so ready when a rally is nearby
1308753459387265024 2020-09-23 21:01:54 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JesseKellyDC You’re lying! 900+ people slept with her?

1308752169391321088 2020-09-23 20:56:47 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Hey why not take our police while you’re at it?
1308751959139258368 2020-09-23 20:55:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> To say these protest are mostly peaceful is like saying the day was mostly peaceful before a tornado hits. It’s like saying a car ride was mostly peaceful before an accident. It’s like saying the virus is mostly peaceful 🤷‍♀️

1308580269226688512 2020-09-23 09:33:43 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> This Election Day I will be offering free rides to ballots for people who need it. I won’t ask who they’re voting for, my goal is that people get to vote if and how they wish. They’ll know my choice by my bumper sticker, but I will refuse no one! #vote
1308579036352966656 2020-09-23 09:28:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @zx101z @LoisLowrance if someone tells me they’re mailing theirs in I’m jumping in my car to go help them. If that’s how they wanna vote, that’s fine so long as they do it right and on time also offering free rides all day Nov 3rd to any polling place within 10 miles for ppl who need it no questions
1308577447907131392 2020-09-23 09:22:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @EUGENIOMARTINV1 @KassyDillon You should read Dan Brown’s Origin. It’s kinda creepy. In fact, I often think back to it when I see people losing jobs to AI. I’m not being melodramatic, but it is really happening on a scale larger than we imagined.
1308575929900445700 2020-09-23 09:16:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @KassyDillon But what’s the purpose? I’m thinking for that price I’d at least get a robot that looks like Brad Pitt
1308572379396870144 2020-09-23 09:02:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @robbystarbuck I wish she’d reimagine a new hairstyle

I think you all should sit the next 2 months out while you still have a foot in the race

When they put your elderly parents into a nursing home to die, will you tell them you just couldn’t vote republican? Look around you, it’s already happening
1308552687781384197 2020-09-23 07:44:07 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @HotepWithit @APatrioticAmer1 And women too! Come on man, tell us how you really feel 🤦‍♂️

1308518277522558976 2020-09-23 05:27:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @kimKBaltimore My husband’s a real romantic. When he proposed he said ‘I may not be able to offer the world, but I promise you’ll never have to live in a democrat ran city’.  He’s kept that promise so far 😉
1308497929913741312 2020-09-23 04:06:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> How did we let Christianity come under fire? Any media outlet who supports these attacks deserve the loss of viewers they will so deservingly get!
1308494190272282624 2020-09-23 03:51:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> How embarrassing 😂😂
1308492863626530818 2020-09-23 03:46:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> It’s quite possible that he’s afraid of his daughter
1308488731784085507 2020-09-23 03:29:58 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> But without covid, what will @NBCNews and the rest of the fake media talk about?

1308484226828972039 2020-09-23 03:12:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MayorJenny What you allowed to happen in your city is a disgrace, and it was all political. You could’ve saved lives, businesses and jobs but you chose to make a political statement instead. Now the American people are making a statement by demanding no bailout due to your own negligence!
1308482868956598272 2020-09-23 03:06:41 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @robbystarbuck So much for judging people based on their character

1308419005015785476 2020-09-22 22:52:54 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ReaganWorld Since she was a judge &amp; was somewhat familiar with the constitution I’d have to agree. I find it hard to believe that someone with her background would even suggest it

In other words, I think she knew the internet would become the primary source of information and parents would lose control 🤷‍♀️
1308227757072154625 2020-09-22 10:12:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I’ll help count ballots anywhere I’m needed @realDonaldTrump  We can’t give these people hope forever, let’s get counting

1308226252222980098 2020-09-22 10:06:58 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DineshDSouza I read United States of Socialism and I have a serious question. It’s obvious that the democrats are pulling for socialism, I just don’t understand WHY so many are buying into it. Do you have another book explaining why the wealthy as well as average Americans are?

1308222750360829953 2020-09-22 09:53:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> And the worst part is that they believe they’ll keep promises to fix the very thing they’ve created in the past DECADES! People like that don’t admit when they’re wrong, just look at Pelosis response to the salon scandal 🤷‍♀️

1308217905050464256 2020-09-22 09:33:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MetcalfeLinda @JoeBiden I am a Republican and I have a great health plan. Of course I’ve managed to keep my job and pay my premiums for 20 years. My priorities were benefits then pay, never the reverse.  So I guess the Republican health plan is to secure a job with benefits and keep it.

I’m not sure if this was forced under Obamacare or she did something wrong. In 2017 her premiums AND copay went down a lot. Don’t let them lie for your vote!

Why on earth would the top 10 EVER agree to give up wealth? The only reason would be to gain power! Don’t let the politicians tell you we are the people, THEY are the Party!

1308160002541191171 2020-09-22 05:43:43 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CalebJHull I still think it’s to hide the fact that he’s not really speaking and it’s prerecorded. In fact, I’m now wondering if that’s the whole reason behind the masks 🤷‍♀️
1308155913736511493 2020-09-22 05:27:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Good question
1308155464966963202 2020-09-22 05:25:41 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Just to be clear, covid is a health threat to our country but the media and @TheDemocrats have publicly spoke out AGAINST a future vaccine due to politics. So is the virus a public health threat or not because they’re giving mixed signals

1308132695571079172 2020-09-22 03:55:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Wondering if Biden often leaves his mask on while speaking so they can play prerecorded speeches without people noticing?

She didn’t just suddenly take ill and die, the democrats made sure she held on to that seat hoping she would make it to 2021. That party gets more disgusting every single day
1307336324261838848 2020-09-19 23:10:43 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MeghanMcCain I lost my dad to pancreatic cancer over 20 years ago. I used to think he was taken way too soon, but this year I believe God knew his time here was done.
1307333757129588736 2020-09-19 23:00:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden Unlike Obama in 2016? Is your memory failing that bad?

1307136467408490496 2020-09-19 09:56:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Lrihendry @LoisLowrance Well, her last 6 months might have been a wee bit political. God bless her, but she should’ve retired
1307135543965364224 2020-09-19 09:52:53 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RedMus3647 @TwitchyTeam Well, she has been declining rapidly for the past 6 months. Her death is a tragedy, but I’m thinking since she didn’t retire when she knew she had terminal cancer, it was politics

1307102220534587393 2020-09-19 07:40:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @SpiritAirlines I call your bluff. I’m pretty sure his mask is as effective as all those other homemade mask. Admit to the American people that your employee made it political or face a new hashtag

1307071957356208128 2020-09-19 05:40:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Did he seriously look under the podium then pull his mask out of his notebook?  Yeah, masks are becoming the joke of 2020 (if 2020 weren’t one big joke)
1307055910381064193 2020-09-19 04:36:27 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MeghanMcCain I’d leave the show, I have only ever watched enough to make me cringe. The other women on the show are always hateful and disrespectful. My grandma always said ‘do better’

1306674165513170944 2020-09-18 03:19:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DanCChamberlain Wonder how many people will be filing lawsuits for wrongful death from the suicides, drug overdoses and inability (or fear) to get medical attention for life threatening illnesses
1306673011253272578 2020-09-18 03:14:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> We won’t bring George Soros in this....after we bring George Soros in this 😂😂😂

1306672461241626624 2020-09-18 03:12:46 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @Mike_Pence Purposely or not, it’s poor management of something as important as our election. There seems to be a lot of damn mistakes happening that we’re just expected to ignore
1306672072194756608 2020-09-18 03:11:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @anitah_nderu @realDonaldTrump @Mike_Pence Deadly...right
1306652643629166592 2020-09-18 01:54:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> They believe we’re already a socialist country and everything belongs to the state
1306651370523701253 2020-09-18 01:48:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> They also believe the world is racist, west coast fires are from global warming, we’re all doomed from covid and Biden is mentally fit
1306646617026686978 2020-09-18 01:30:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Let’s mention it without mentioning it 😂
1306643643105673218 2020-09-18 01:18:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT Don’t count on it lol
1306643346576879617 2020-09-18 01:17:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> This should really be against the law. I mean, knowing that people have actually started fires makes citizens aware so they can report suspicious activity.
1306638813842812939 2020-09-18 00:59:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MikeyHippie But I don’t see how we can keep going like we are as a society without Gods wrath. We are morally bankrupt, we embrace pettiness and disregard what’s important. If the world catches on fire, it’ll be our lack of morals and values that causes, not cows
1306637933022187520 2020-09-18 00:55:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MikeyHippie We had 1 car, and the only people ‘flying’ to work were pilots and airline workers. The factories and such were closed on weekends, with occasional overtime.  Do I believe in climate change? I don’t believe the world is shifting off its axis or we’re overheating
1306637035084689408 2020-09-18 00:51:59 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MikeyHippie What I believe is that when I was a kid, we could get everything we needed Monday - Saturday. The drug store was open on Sunday, nothing else. My mom stayed home &amp; we ate what she cooked. A house was $35,000, a car $5,000.
1306635906632351744 2020-09-18 00:47:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> How can anyone in today’s society stand by their principles if colleges are clearly canceling them. It’s almost impossible to get a job today without a college education so what choice do people have without submitting to this garbage? #SorosFundedInsurgents
1306627228327981056 2020-09-18 00:13:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> This generation is a generation of instant gratification. They take the headline and run with it. Not only do they miss the story, they make themselves look uninformed. That’s why they’re stuck on the virus, it’s the headline for every outlet.

1305950009800654855 2020-09-16 03:22:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> So I can’t question the seriousness of a virus that people have supposedly tested positive for and asked to work from home (but still work), but it’s okay for politicians and the media to question a vaccine for that virus.

The democrats want him gone so bad they’re willing to wage war on their own citizens. If you fail to see who’s responsible for this anarchy it’s because you choose not to
1305510181569257472 2020-09-14 22:14:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods I learned almost everything about the IT part of my work on YouTube lol. That’s my degree in a nutshell 😂
1305507805445713922 2020-09-14 22:04:50 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT Yeah, I shredded mine and then used the shreds to absorb bacon grease in the trash lol
1305504505560272896 2020-09-14 21:51:43 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> As a result of the recent coverage from the left and their accomplices in the media, the neighborhood kids now believe I was a slave owner. wtf! You can’t make this up
1305503776720261121 2020-09-14 21:48:50 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> He said it! GUN CONTROL! Let that sit a minute

1305353445004709888 2020-09-14 11:51:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump One of the people I love most in this world is a police officer. Thank you for being on his side. He’s a wonderful man with a wonderful family

1305333985925574656 2020-09-14 10:34:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DrewHolden360 @CalebJHull Law enforcement was about enforcing laws, it’s your elected government officials that hand those laws to them. The wrong people are being blamed for enforcing laws you don’t like.
1305327991908642818 2020-09-14 10:10:19 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> As I see a small house fire in my area I’m reminded of those fighting wildfires on the west coast.

1305305301508403200 2020-09-14 08:40:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TheDemocrats want our ONLY protection from these rioters. Of course this has always been part of their agenda. Take away our police, then our personal protection and they have all the power! #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt #TrumpPence2020

1305277385303097346 2020-09-14 06:49:14 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Ask yourself this. Would you allow your daughters to behave like that in front of a known predator?

1305275648303419393 2020-09-14 06:42:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CNN the country is tired of your narrative. You refuse to denounce the violence across the country so you can hate on the president. People are more afraid of the violence than the virus but since it’s a democrat thing you won’t go there  Because of you #TrumpPence2020 victory
1305272779869171714 2020-09-14 06:30:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> These ‘protesters’ don’t actually have an agenda, they’re incapable of original thought. They’re there for opportunity only. The democrats created something and now they’ve lost control. This is what happens when you meddle in local politics! Next time stay out of it!
1305269023236554752 2020-09-14 06:16:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Should we prepare for this to happen at the polls?
1305268120630816771 2020-09-14 06:12:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @SylBobinski @marklevinshow I guess because I’m trying to see past the political greed and wonder if anyone on his campaign team has any real decency 🤷‍♀️

None over the age of 12. Normally I’d find it comical, but they kept doing it like it was somehow okay to taunt an old couple sitting on their porch on Sunday 🤦‍♂️
1305232404211290112 2020-09-14 03:50:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Real question, would you be more afraid to walk through Portland Oregon wearing a mask in the dark or walking into a crowd of 1000 people in an open field not wearing masks?

1305228363427127298 2020-09-14 03:34:26 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> There is so much hate in this world that people are actually excusing this as though it’s okay to walk up to someone’s car and open fire. What kind of world are we living in!?
1305225251840831488 2020-09-14 03:22:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Mom, dad...aren’t you so proud of me!?

1305221692814393351 2020-09-14 03:07:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> If I had a million to donate, I would give it to the people who’ve lost their jobs during the shutdown rather than donate to @TheDemocrats political campaign
1305220460012081153 2020-09-14 03:03:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Will @TheDemocrats denounce this organization in effort to stop the donations that fund the violence happening all around us? It’s one thing to stand for black lives, but outright anarchy is never the answer. We need peace and we need it now

1304941657209606144 2020-09-13 08:35:10 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT Yeah, it won’t happen. I’m worried about what natural disaster the democrats will create before then
1304930137796939776 2020-09-13 07:49:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @chicksonright @ErikaBlakely And the last I checked black people are perfectly capable of individual thinking. I would never assume that all black people think alike, that would be stupid if not racist.

1304807988717334530 2020-09-12 23:44:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Just like the democrats and the leftist media to dismiss the response of average American workers in favor of their wealthy co-conspirators. Don’t worry @realDonaldTrump us average people know who is working for us! #TrumpPence2020

1304540072948232200 2020-09-12 05:59:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> If they’re not worried about it then why is the media. That’s all they can talk about because everything before covid was a WIN
1304538600948760578 2020-09-12 05:53:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @izzysayz @chicksonright @cbshaffer53 Oh, the same one that gives us freedom of religion yet we can’t pray in school?
1304530778848714753 2020-09-12 05:22:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @OlGirl68 @chicksonright It’s why some animals eat their young 🙄
1304530580705619970 2020-09-12 05:21:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @izzysayz @chicksonright @cbshaffer53 High school students get an opinion when they pay their own bills and taxes.
1304528920495218689 2020-09-12 05:15:06 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Hey @TheDemocrats wonder why people are flocking to @realDonaldTrump  #BLMTerrrorist
1304525800788627459 2020-09-12 05:02:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump In all honesty, I’m tired of ‘bailing out’ cities. It’s up to their citizens to generate tax revenue. It’s not my fault that they cater to people who need the government over people who actually contribute to society
1304511431224758272 2020-09-12 04:05:36 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods @nytimes Telling people ‘you’re the best out of a percentage’ just don’t sound as rewarding
1304509505103953921 2020-09-12 03:57:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TeddyBearII1 Are you all this insensitive and bitter? It’s no wonder people avoid conversations with the liberal left, you’re always out to make people feel shitty no matter the topic. Go democrats!
1304500809963536392 2020-09-12 03:23:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Remember when football players were really cool athletes?
1304499753116405761 2020-09-12 03:19:12 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @seanmdav I know his kind....spoiled rotten privileged kid who’s never had to answer to anything in his life
1304499108984619009 2020-09-12 03:16:38 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @seanhannity More likely started by sparks from those peaceful protesters and their peaceful fires
1304497321170939904 2020-09-12 03:09:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Wonder if they charged the military for this...
1304496509027848193 2020-09-12 03:06:18 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Football players have never looked so opposite of sexy
1304496187383394307 2020-09-12 03:05:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> It’s sad how one party has destroyed a country so fast. For the love of this country vote @realDonaldTrump in November
1304492550431084545 2020-09-12 02:50:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Or maybe a huge landing strip?
1304491453511610368 2020-09-12 02:46:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> And everyone who died from H1N1 is Obama and Biden’s fault. Remember, absolutely NOTHING was done in response to that
1304490725674037255 2020-09-12 02:43:19 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> If it smells like smoke....
1304489642234966016 2020-09-12 02:39:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ThomDaugherty @AriFleischer I don’t know a single person who’s had covid....let alone died. I’ve known young men who didn’t come back from the war. Move on from covid

1304485232796725248 2020-09-12 02:21:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> The American people are SICK of hearing about ‘daily counts’ and masks mandates and distancing and blah blah blah. Why? Because the media has beat that horse dead! I’m still not stepping over bodies in the streets..MOVE ON
1304464845392183298 2020-09-12 01:00:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @chicksonright Don’t waste your breath with questions. They’ll never admit their ignorance
1304437607875706882 2020-09-11 23:12:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Will they ever learn?
1304437465541992449 2020-09-11 23:11:41 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Never forget the service men and women who volunteered to serve following this tragedy

1304435217919340545 2020-09-11 23:02:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CurtisHouck Do ya think it might be a bad time to be starting random fires on the west coast?
1304433376355594242 2020-09-11 22:55:26 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @EWErickson I was home sick with a virus....swear to God
1304427532956168193 2020-09-11 22:32:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TheDemocrats will NOT have this
1304427152918679560 2020-09-11 22:30:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> What virus 🤷‍♀️
1304423797894852614 2020-09-11 22:17:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump I couldn’t agree more! Human contact is natural and better for moral
1304420620525068289 2020-09-11 22:04:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> And I’ll blame the Obama administration for the influx of drug addiction and overdoses.  Anyone who denies that the opioid epidemic hasn’t affected more families than covid is stupid

1304259477152182272 2020-09-11 11:24:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TimJGraham @newsbusters @jaketapper Why bother with an interview, couldn’t they just call each other and whine?
1304259131625426945 2020-09-11 11:23:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> 2020 has made more @realDonaldTrump supporters than 2016. The reasons, the far left media, @TheDemocrats insane actions, RIOTS, and the instability of Biden. People see the democrats as an end to our country and POTUS as our only hope. We will win!
1304254757721251840 2020-09-11 11:05:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Lead_thru_Love @GratefulDaedal1 @Liberty_Belle04 @michpoligal Without birth there is no chance at life
1304239970098479111 2020-09-11 10:06:55 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump I have a DAMN big problem with this and I WILL not be encouraging public education for my grandson. You must fix this now, it’s unethical and goes against the values in our home. This can’t be legal!
1304238921853931521 2020-09-11 10:02:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Well that went well
1304238599815208960 2020-09-11 10:01:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump If by some mistake the media tells us Biden won, would it be appropriate for everyone to file exemptions on their 2021 taxes? Asking for a friend
1304236827612786689 2020-09-11 09:54:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CalebJHull Of course there is. You going to get us the answers we seek
1304236142796197888 2020-09-11 09:51:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @GratefulDaedal1 @Liberty_Belle04 @michpoligal A good way to lose fence sitters is to normalize killing infants or compare their intentional slaughter to a virus. Just because you’re okay with killing infants don’t mean everyone is. Think before you speak. This is THE thing that decided my vote
1304234080091934720 2020-09-11 09:43:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @patrici47462841 @michpoligal Did you just make that up? Just kidding, you’ve been writing it for hours.  PS, judge the rioters who are gathering in mass and defecating on sidewalks.
1304233265151315969 2020-09-11 09:40:16 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Mary047318411 @michpoligal On the contrary, she was blasting citizens for not wearing masks. She had no value to add as a journalist because she wasn’t there to report news worthy facts
1304232814695636997 2020-09-11 09:38:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @michpoligal It’s their very subtle way of saying GTFO, go to Biden’s basement
1304231520446676994 2020-09-11 09:33:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Can’t they just call each other over the phone &amp; bitch about @realDonaldTrump Why waste airtime that nobody’s watching?
1304230663000920066 2020-09-11 09:29:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> And just like that @TheDemocrats become anti-vaxxers
1304226164576313344 2020-09-11 09:12:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DonaldJTrumpJr You’ve reached the 911 cal center. Due to recent financial cutbacks and an influx of retiring enforcement officers, your shit out of luck
1304224148131115008 2020-09-11 09:04:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @bennyjohnson We’re all going to be told a big lie. It’ll be like Man In High Castle without the ability to transfer to a parallel universe

1304207845336940549 2020-09-11 07:59:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Still not stepping over dead bodies in the streets
1304202383753383942 2020-09-11 07:37:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> What she means is they’re not having an orgy
1304201826653425665 2020-09-11 07:35:21 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Still voting for @realDonaldTrump no matter how vile the media gets
1304201125986537473 2020-09-11 07:32:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> And still not stepping over dead bodies in the streets
1304198958533808128 2020-09-11 07:23:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TDucklo just confirmed for us that yes, @JoeBiden does use a teleprompter for interviews
1304193168410390528 2020-09-11 07:00:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> He wants people to envision the POTUS symbol on his mask. Dream on buddy, that belongs to @realDonaldTrump
1304176067792564224 2020-09-11 05:52:59 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Go figure
1304175578858295300 2020-09-11 05:51:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I’m sure the fireworks and outright cheering across the country will overpower Twitter when @realDonaldTrump wins
1304166125706645508 2020-09-11 05:13:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> So you’re telling me there’s such a powerful shift in the climate to change the color of the sky in just one state? Wouldn’t be all those fires would it? Yet you keep allowing ANTIFA/BLM to burn cities on the west coast 🙄
1304164983501189122 2020-09-11 05:08:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @PeonyFlor I’d send my child to school everyday in a MAGA shirt
1304162392264396806 2020-09-11 04:58:39 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Someone took her shopping
1304162229940629506 2020-09-11 04:58:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Again?
1304161404296060929 2020-09-11 04:54:43 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> All about that mostly
1304159998143062017 2020-09-11 04:49:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TruBluCatherine @jaketapper I may off here, but how convenient the guy didn’t make it to a cell where he might spill his guts. Strange things keep happening
1304159333543010306 2020-09-11 04:46:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @mollysmcdonough @jaketapper @DonaldJTrumpJr I know, isn’t it sweet how he managed to walk away from a violent attack on his life being outnumbered 3 to 1! You can’t threaten someone’s life in this country and be deemed innocent just because. It don’t work that way
1304158043962322944 2020-09-11 04:41:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> He tries so hard by starting out polite....
1304156886690824193 2020-09-11 04:36:46 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Are journalists capable of only one topic a year? All they ask about is a virus that doesn’t have millions of people dying on the streets
1304155807265816584 2020-09-11 04:32:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TheDemocrats have selective memory. Don’t forget @SpeakerPelosi and her Chinatown parade  https://t.co/Sa3r9kgN0J
1304154810665627648 2020-09-11 04:28:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Wonder if they’re stupid enough to try and tear down the light show
1304154355227152386 2020-09-11 04:26:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CalebJHull And we weren’t stepping over dead bodies in the street as a pandemic might suggest

1304153735048896519 2020-09-11 04:24:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Guess the salon washed this day right out of @TeamPelosi head.  Campaigning for @realDonaldTrump and too stupid to realize it  https://t.co/uRiFHDQ82T
1304085887777681408 2020-09-10 23:54:39 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ScottPresler @realDonaldTrump I’d love to be doing that!
1304085743598538757 2020-09-10 23:54:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> No mention of Hilarys emails. No felony there
1304081554537426946 2020-09-10 23:37:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> If this don’t send you running for the polls in November, nothing will. How do we stop this insanity? Vote for @realDonaldTrump
1304080800330199041 2020-09-10 23:34:26 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @chicksonright Well it’s not like they’ve produced anything truly award winning in a long time. When’s the last time you remember saying ‘oh I’ve got to see that!’?
1304079670086782976 2020-09-10 23:29:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Well there’s always the upside
1304062982025097216 2020-09-10 22:23:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> For the record, they’re OUR tax dollars and I stand with my president @realDonaldTrump I do not want MY tax dollars going anyone who will not manage it properly. It’s time for people to take responsibility for their actions
1304061716758695936 2020-09-10 22:18:36 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Disney is for children, so why are they making a political statement about killing babies? I’ll let Disney explain that to their audience
1304060762776907776 2020-09-10 22:14:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MamaLana2020 @nieto_phillip @CurtisHouck I give this advice from my ow experience. If I could change anything from my past it would be my going to work to add income. Of course I don’t get a do over
1304059663974047745 2020-09-10 22:10:26 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Out of all the holidays to cancel, they cancel the only one where you actually wear a mask 🤦‍♂️
1304057396470386690 2020-09-10 22:01:26 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MamaLana2020 @nieto_phillip @CurtisHouck I encourage every expecting family to sit down and weigh their priorities. If the family can survive on one income I’d highly encourage it. It will reduce stress and allow more family time. It worked for generations. Advocate for structure
1304056280043094016 2020-09-10 21:57:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Doranimated That’s all you have to say 😂

1304055724398518272 2020-09-10 21:54:47 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> If anyone is in need of anchors for their boats, I hear theirs some in Portland
1304055124130750466 2020-09-10 21:52:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Funny how @realDonaldTrump is getting support from those who value their lives and those who want to protect it. Vote Trump/Pence in November
1304054444242411521 2020-09-10 21:49:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Who in their right mind pays $100 for leggings? No one, that’s he answer. Fact check me, the average cost of leggings is $20.70
1304053627657564161 2020-09-10 21:46:27 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @P8R1OT Nah, just let him keep saying stupid stuff, the majority of the people are shaking their heads at him
1304052825484386306 2020-09-10 21:43:16 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Joy_Villa @realDonaldTrump Those democrats are going insane over the smart and beautiful women supporting Trump/Pence. They may have some good looking actors &amp; actresses but we have the brains to back it up
1304052216295313414 2020-09-10 21:40:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> These people are a special kind of stupid
1304051559484076032 2020-09-10 21:38:14 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @jason_howerton @netflix I’m boycotting Disney and Netflix. It’s time we the people force moral obligations on Hollywood
1304051138027761666 2020-09-10 21:36:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods On the contrary, this is why @realDonaldTrump will win. If you’ve lived to the age of a voter, you know your rights. @TheDemocrats just keep playing the country like we’re all stupid. Keep telling us how bad and stupid we are, that’ll fix us
1304050390183415809 2020-09-10 21:33:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump You can’t fix stupid, which is why I refuse to pick up any of these books that try to change my mind. Still voting for @realDonaldTrump in November....IN PERSON!
1304049871511531525 2020-09-10 21:31:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @bsmitch007 The devil’s spawn
1304049170916007937 2020-09-10 21:28:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Maybe it’s too simple, but what does pro-life have to do with filming movies?
1304048504533286912 2020-09-10 21:26:06 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Maybe I’m selfish, but I’d like to be able to work &amp; have a roof over my head &amp; food in my belly.  In November I will selfishly vote for @realDonaldTrump
1304048042094612480 2020-09-10 21:24:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump My guess is they couldn’t get all those people rioting to register so they need a way to get them to vote 🤷‍♀️
1304047423732568064 2020-09-10 21:21:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @EWErickson Since we’re not stepping over dead bodies in the streets I STILL think the reaction to the virus was OVERPLAYED not under
1304047021494546435 2020-09-10 21:20:12 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CalebJHull Where are all the fathers and big brothers!?
1304046861033123843 2020-09-10 21:19:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DonaldJTrumpJr We’re not stuck in a white privilege cage, we’re locked in a NPOC cell!
1304046436158496768 2020-09-10 21:17:53 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @nieto_phillip @CurtisHouck My dad wouldn’t let me take makeup with me on a vacation, I was 15. Every time I see something about this movie I wonder wear dads are
1304045089795330048 2020-09-10 21:12:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MaryMargOlohan @CurtisHouck I can’t even watch this full clip. How heart breaking for little girls 💔. This is NOT normal behavior for a child. sorry not sorry
1304044638395920384 2020-09-10 21:10:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @bennyjohnson Don’t forget about this  https://t.co/UPCaLVdpLT
1304044289647882245 2020-09-10 21:09:21 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I’m impressed with the way this virus reacts. Can’t break through cloth barriers, is able to measure distance, allows states time to prepare for it and NOW we’re finding out you must call it by a specific name
1303884446240829441 2020-09-10 10:34:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @henryrodgersdc @CurtisHouck I’m bout to find out lol
1303883456468987904 2020-09-10 10:30:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @bennyjohnson It’s the beginning phase of his upcoming covid to avoid debates. Mark my words

1303881971882504193 2020-09-10 10:24:21 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods I’m seeing a decline in the Catholic Church .. js
1303880844143136769 2020-09-10 10:19:52 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @osk1e @RisingPhoenix63 @SteveScalise Wrong as in it’s not your life to rebuild?
1303879328695029761 2020-09-10 10:13:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods People need to go to work, there IS work out there. You might have to do a job you didn’t imagine yourself doing, but it’s 2020...unimaginative things keep happening and no one is special
1303878707916963841 2020-09-10 10:11:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @InocencioMayumi @SteveScalise @ocmomforanthem Honestly? I don’t think anyone should ever rely on government anything since by law, everything has to come to a vote....and you don’t get a vote. Be self sufficient in everything you do, well open up much quicker with a self sufficient country
1303877320403492864 2020-09-10 10:05:52 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @mullenbe11 @SteveScalise @Gary36550288 Well, I’m sure it’s the wealthy who’re covering the expenses in one shape or form. If we told you we were taking 1/3 of your pay to help your neighbors....how fast would you quit?
1303876649134493696 2020-09-10 10:03:12 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MontyBoa99 @SteveScalise @EvanPower $200 is on top of your already benefits. If it’s not enough, supply chains are hiring around $20 an hour. Beats $200 a week. The catch is, you have to work
1303876212893376512 2020-09-10 10:01:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @mitruma @SteveScalise @jdrichmond2020 Most Americans would be doing just fine if they’d just apply for that job they don’t really want right now. Tough it up America, you may actually have to put some effort into moving forward yourself
1303875357402116096 2020-09-10 09:58:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RisingPhoenix63 @SteveScalise I know you may not believe this....but handing out $600 a week in addition to unemployment is super counterproductive. Folks, time to start rebuilding your lives because they are YOUR lives and YOUR responsibility
1303874712351772672 2020-09-10 09:55:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @NorseChieftain @SteveScalise The majority of people do NOT want federal money for our community schools. We prefer to have some control over our kids education. And I’m sorry, but Walmart is NOT hazardous
1303874119319027714 2020-09-10 09:53:09 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @NorseChieftain @SteveScalise There are job postings popping up around the country. You think just because some people didn’t live on unemployment during those months, they weren’t broke. Now you want them to pay more taxes for the unemployed. Time to work!
1303872344805576704 2020-09-10 09:46:06 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Oh so much trust

1303868846210772992 2020-09-10 09:32:12 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> First patriotic masks, now buy American. @JoeBiden campaign is original 🙄
1303868536088076288 2020-09-10 09:30:58 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CalebJHull @PressSec She’s just pissed that @PressSec is smarter,  enter looking and can wear pink &amp; get away with it
1303867706014339072 2020-09-10 09:27:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods THIS is why the movie theaters in open states aren’t doing so well. I just know it
1303867370382012421 2020-09-10 09:26:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @bennyjohnson I live in a predominantly red state. One of the few blue cities in this state hosts a festival every year. It’s the only festival that has multiple vendors selling stuff I consider discriminating.
1303852575914110976 2020-09-10 08:27:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> He says ‘let them go’. He needed a boost in his attendance
1303851769932505090 2020-09-10 08:24:21 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TheDemocrats have lost their minds. Have you seen the shelves of ‘newly acclaimed authors’ lately? Anyone who picks up this book, let alone reads it is clearly LOOKING for one good reason not to vote for @realDonaldTrump. Grow up
1303850794937126912 2020-09-10 08:20:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Sorry kids, were canceling all fun for the remainder of 2020. Just in case we don’t get our way, don’t count on the bunny either
1303849570628141057 2020-09-10 08:15:36 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> There’s a stark difference between how @TheDemocrats see average Americans and what @realDonaldTrump understands about average Americans
1303846478608297984 2020-09-10 08:03:19 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Andddddd America fights back!
1303845791497441280 2020-09-10 08:00:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CalebJHull He didn’t take questions from either one of the people in his audience
1303845345558966273 2020-09-10 07:58:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Based on yard sign activity, Biden is coming in 3rd right after Garage Sale  Vote @realDonaldTrump in November. No one likes to be on the losing team
1303843440359284737 2020-09-10 07:51:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> His only job was to read and he screwed that up 😂. You KNOW @realDonaldTrump doesn’t read from a script
1303841232414748672 2020-09-10 07:42:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Soon they’ll have hammocks made from masks 😷
1303840745095397377 2020-09-10 07:40:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RyanGirdusky Those democrats are fishing with salt now. They’re desperate

1303840299802914818 2020-09-10 07:38:46 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @AriFleischer I was going to comment on her entire professional attire. Way to represent
1303838925635624962 2020-09-10 07:33:18 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @BonillaJL @CurtisHouck @CNN Think these so called journalists have ever read ANYTHING that isn’t Trump bashing or written by Obama or the Clintons? PS, 50 Shades of Stupidity don’t count
1303838347450875905 2020-09-10 07:31:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> 20 years ago I might’ve taken words in a book seriously, but it’s impossible to do that now since any moron can get published. Thank God for classics
1303837862199209989 2020-09-10 07:29:05 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Unfortunately parents rely on school to for social skills. When schools remove socializing and replace it with their liberal hate this is the result. We used to get 3 recesses (including lunch period) in grade school, what do they get now?
1303836123110739969 2020-09-10 07:22:10 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @bennyjohnson This is what you get when you’ve canceled God
1303834016907489280 2020-09-10 07:13:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods I’m buying up books left and right while I still have a choice
1303833541319495680 2020-09-10 07:11:54 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @peterjhasson @CurtisHouck They were both being honest. In comparison to the flu... however it did cost us our freedom and jobs. As it turned out the threat was HUGE
1303829247627321346 2020-09-10 06:54:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @chicksonright @onetoughnerd He might listen....not that he’ll understand what he’s listening too. The left don’t care, so long as someone listens to them whine
1303828700333514753 2020-09-10 06:52:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods Guess they figured since rona didn’t wipe out 1/3 of the population they’d just cancel 2/3
1303812188650565638 2020-09-10 05:47:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @seanhannity In his defense, he does climb his basement steps
1303527247316430850 2020-09-09 10:54:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Who wants a physical race between @JoeBiden and @realDonaldTrump  🙋‍♀️🍿🍻
1303526826980057088 2020-09-09 10:53:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods wtf is no longer strong enough statement
1303518254900674560 2020-09-09 10:19:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @danielchaitin7 @CurtisHouck I’d rather have Trump as my president in jail than Biden as my president running freely...js
1303517218240593920 2020-09-09 10:14:57 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @seanhannity If it looks and smells like socialism....
1303514817093865472 2020-09-09 10:05:25 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden And the answer cannot involve the name Trump because that’s blame, not an answer
1303514341426294784 2020-09-09 10:03:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden Your party has forced me to deny my mother basic outings. I fear for her safety with this mob of rioters who have been publicly supported by @TheDemocrats. How do you all expect any reasonable person to vote for your party? This is an honest question
1303513551626293248 2020-09-09 10:00:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @HotepWithit Forget that, have him repeat the sentence

1303475796607107075 2020-09-09 07:30:21 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Sources say based on yard sign activity Biden is coming in 3rd, right after Garage Sale 😂😂😂
1303473741482151936 2020-09-09 07:22:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Biden - I know shit’s bad right now with all that starvin’ bullshit, runnin’ out of French fries &amp; burrito coverings, but I got a solution.  - South Carolina what’s up!
1303471252003319809 2020-09-09 07:12:18 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CurtisHouck Last month they couldn’t stop saying ‘until we get a vaccine’. Well folks, @realDonaldTrump says we may have one by Thanksgiving 😉 and now they’re telling us not to trust it. @TheDemocrats really don’t want us to be safe!

1303428709987291136 2020-09-09 04:23:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> This has got to STOP! People are afraid to even vacation for fear of running into violence.

1303148569529069568 2020-09-08 09:50:04 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> And they think we’re crazy 😝

1303132412952686594 2020-09-08 08:45:52 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @bennyjohnson That table tho 🤷‍♀️
1303132335664238593 2020-09-08 08:45:34 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Hey, I’m a nice lady and I want your respect - says no one as they steal your tea &amp; slam the glass at you feet. The only hope is there were meds in that tea
1303131484522414081 2020-09-08 08:42:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Do @TheDemocrats NOT want to win? It appears so.  Come on November so @realDonaldTrump can take us out of 2020 and back to sanity!  https://t.co/DHjof6f6bo
1303129960698257408 2020-09-08 08:36:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @MichelleNunn @HillaryClinton @madeleine @UN @TheAtlantic This is wonderful, 15 years ago I was wondering how I was going to feed my kids since jobs went overseas. 12 years ago I had to lose money on my house (same 2 kids) when it was worth half what I owed. @TheDemocrats have NOT been kind to folks like me.
1303100912039268353 2020-09-08 06:40:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Really, wtf is this?
1303100140199256065 2020-09-08 06:37:38 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> If anyone believes @realDonaldTrump is behind in the polls, they’re clearly sharing Joes basement. Before he announced Harris I saw 1 Biden sign. The day after he announced her it came down. Several Trump/Pence signs tho
1303099355424059392 2020-09-08 06:34:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Where’s Nancy Regan when you need her....JUST SAY NO
1303091638097637377 2020-09-08 06:03:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DonaldJTrumpJr These people should have their great grandkids show them basic technology
1303080967213658112 2020-09-08 05:21:27 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Labor president...labor party. Connection?
1303065433059229696 2020-09-08 04:19:43 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> So basically the shutdown was to force e-learning so teachers could gain access to our homes. It’s all coming together now, next they’ll want a tour of the rest of the house.
1303057470202445825 2020-09-08 03:48:05 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JohnEkdahl @CurtisHouck The same as the masks
1303055349839257600 2020-09-08 03:39:39 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods Some say the world will end in fire...this guy says ice would suffice
1303041155035205639 2020-09-08 02:43:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> No #GOYA beans to be found, now a predicted shortage of #HobbyLobby yarn due to sudden increase in sales. 2020 just keeps getting longer
1303039758285901830 2020-09-08 02:37:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> PRICELESS
1303037373010321414 2020-09-08 02:28:13 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods Was this Nancy’s spa 🤣🤣
1303036555838107648 2020-09-08 02:24:58 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Maybe businesses could stop paying their portion of employer based healthcare and see if it pleases the crown
1303035992157442050 2020-09-08 02:22:44 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> As though the media has any relevant questions
1303035564510400519 2020-09-08 02:21:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Parents, take a good look. If you recognize any of these children as your own, I suggest avoiding your neighbors for the unforeseeable future. Embarrassing
1303017387898343427 2020-09-08 01:08:48 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino Of course, they’re the ministry of enlightenment
1303015415522693122 2020-09-08 01:00:58 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CalebJHull Completely unaffected by the shutdowns but insist we remain closed
1303014766739361795 2020-09-08 00:58:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> 2020 presidential debate premiering February 2021
1303003465749233664 2020-09-08 00:13:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DoTheRi64781793 @djf510 @mkues65 They’re not 10. Kids (no matter what you preach) rarely wash practice cleanliness
1302980590724165637 2020-09-07 22:42:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Theissen_D @Smit876Michelle @TamsonO @iamcardib I am only stating the facts. During the civil rights movement the democrats supported the klan. They still want to keep the poor and minorities out of their neighborhoods, that’s why they give us low income apartments
1302977960027271170 2020-09-07 22:32:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TheRightMelissa I could watch him speak all day 🧠 and 👁 🍭
1302977388901552131 2020-09-07 22:29:52 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @chicksonright @JoeBiden Those nails tho 🤣🤣🤣
1302976441198542853 2020-09-07 22:26:06 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Theissen_D @Smit876Michelle @TamsonO @iamcardib The men running around with pillow cases on their heads were 100% democrat. The party never switched, just the narrative
1302973651491446784 2020-09-07 22:15:01 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @henryrodgersdc This is beyond insanity! I’m to the point where I feel like anyone even suggesting I wear one needs to see a therapist
1302948879776780288 2020-09-07 20:36:35 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> We’re not going to get jobs &amp; buy our own stuff, we’ll just come take your stuff
1302764619723931648 2020-09-07 08:24:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> People getting mad over them masks 🎭
1302764131431440386 2020-09-07 08:22:27 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> The mask won’t save you!
1302761765059649536 2020-09-07 08:13:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Americans are terrified to be targeted by ANTIFA. Tell us why we should feel safe in a theatre, seems the perfect target for the scare tactics
1302761375635308545 2020-09-07 08:11:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @rkylesmith I won’t go because I’m afraid to be ambushed by ANTIFA. Seems like the dems don’t want anything open so why would they let theaters be safe?
1302760447003762689 2020-09-07 08:07:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods A world where you let strangers jump on your car and blare music at you so you live to see another day
1302725167228104704 2020-09-07 05:47:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RandyRRQuaid Oh wouldn’t that just really piss Hollywood off 😂😂
1302724410810470402 2020-09-07 05:44:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> And here’s @JoeBiden quoting Trump. ‘Masks are patriotic’. Where are his handlers?
1302668178225532930 2020-09-07 02:01:10 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @LukeInSoCo @DeAnna4Congress The name is a bit racist don’t you think? Insinuating that Garcia is a cherry
1302636557623590915 2020-09-06 23:55:31 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CalebJHull I’m confused, this says 2018
1302634483200462848 2020-09-06 23:47:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @CalebJHull THEY want to take away YOUR police, then YOUR guns
1302617560681242625 2020-09-06 22:40:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Please tell me I’m not the only one who sees the irony here  https://t.co/pHkvdyJmDR
1302592274417815557 2020-09-06 20:59:33 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Just goes to show you, everyone is flammable
1302591478917738497 2020-09-06 20:56:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @PatriotsChris45 Congrats! Great job. Keep doing it for YOU because you’re what’s important in this discussion
1302590529000091648 2020-09-06 20:52:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @bennyjohnson Looks like he’s contemplating her suicide
1302410523078791173 2020-09-06 08:57:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Now they’re going to rename the horses. Running out of syrup I guess
1302410229330653184 2020-09-06 08:56:10 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @amber_athey It won’t ever become normal. Permanent maybe, but there’s nothing normal about a world of stupidity
1302409620686876673 2020-09-06 08:53:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump I’m inclined to agree to a certain point. I don’t believe anyone forced her to unmask, however you’d have to tie me down to keep me from blasting that all over social media. Setup? No. But never waste a good photo op
1302408949405298696 2020-09-06 08:51:05 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @azgal1922 @CalebJHull My girl Roxanne  https://t.co/R0GKOyWVwf
1302408742655479808 2020-09-06 08:50:16 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @ByronYork @JoeBiden gets blasted for opinions....because no one wants him to be fact checked. Pretty sure there wasn’t an elephant in his pop tart
1302408077619146756 2020-09-06 08:47:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @charliekirk11 @CNN My mother says if you lay with dogs you get fleas. Now, since Lucy (moms dog) just went to the salon (not Nancy’s), I’m inclined to say only certain dogs....but you get the point
1302407424037576704 2020-09-06 08:45:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Is there really that much dope in this country? These fu🤬rs have been going at it for 3 months. When’s the crash supposed to hit?
1302406104488513543 2020-09-06 08:39:47 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Th3Claude @CalebJHull It’s called sophisticated
1302405958086340608 2020-09-06 08:39:12 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @Trump2020LANDS7 They’re busy stealing people’s dinner &amp; apartments
1302405639558369291 2020-09-06 08:37:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> We can cancel history based on deception but visit a parenthood clinic so they can cancel your chance of that. Why don’t they just call it Plan C
1302402915269775360 2020-09-06 08:27:07 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino Didn’t the NAZIs start with something eerily similar?
1302360622777217024 2020-09-06 05:39:03 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Mostly, just mostly peaceful. Most does not mean the same as all just as mostly safe does not mean the same as safe

1302322189715341313 2020-09-06 03:06:20 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @BlairBrandt @dbongino Or are defenseless children in the womb
1302321966884495361 2020-09-06 03:05:27 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Or his wife
1302321635329028098 2020-09-06 03:04:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods Nothing holy or Godly about these people.

1302271392877105152 2020-09-05 23:44:29 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> A privilege has to be granted, pretty sure you’re stuck with being born
1302270440665210886 2020-09-05 23:40:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> And here I thought the U stood for United
1302268941629259776 2020-09-05 23:34:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> It’s like @TheDemocrats have forgotten about all those people struggling with addiction. Thank you @FLOTUS for keeping them in mind  #RecoveryMonth
1302267611359703040 2020-09-05 23:29:28 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Covid HAS taken 100 years. Small family owned businesses, diverse workforce, low unemployment, etc.. No argument there
1302265524399812608 2020-09-05 23:21:10 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @RealJamesWoods This is happening across the country, yet it’s no big deal to the media.
1302264139323187201 2020-09-05 23:15:40 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> What happened to journalism? Oh, Google...
1302263342627684353 2020-09-05 23:12:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @BonginoReport @dbongino As opposed to funding terror and violence in our streets? Yeah, I’d much rather fund education reform for journalists
1302261669314396160 2020-09-05 23:05:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino The house of cards is crumbling

1302260267812782080 2020-09-05 23:00:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Way to win @TheDemocrats
1302259093831323649 2020-09-05 22:55:37 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump If the democrats would stop attacking God they could atone for their sins of discrimination and segregation by asking forgiveness. Instead they want everyone to take responsibility for their crimes
1302257994579746817 2020-09-05 22:51:15 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DonaldJTrumpJr What, and lose all that money?
1302257664513191938 2020-09-05 22:49:56 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> ‘Not a single solitary reason in the world’. Joe and his sentences
1302014830971420672 2020-09-05 06:45:00 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Probably a good time for @SpeakerPelosi to go in hiding in @JoeBiden basement too. Pretty sure she debunked the country shutdown
1302014291101601792 2020-09-05 06:42:51 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @SpeakerPelosi @BobbyScott @SenateGOP Maybe the classrooms can be moved to salons? Would that help
1302014013967134720 2020-09-05 06:41:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Come November will @TheDemocrats blame @SpeakerPelosi for @realDonaldTrump victory 🤷‍♀️
1302012950539046913 2020-09-05 06:37:32 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> So what you’re saying was you visit to the salon was a deliberate attempt to spread the virus so @TheDemocrats could continue attacking @realDonaldTrump through November?
1302009248264708097 2020-09-05 06:22:49 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @seanhannity No such luck
1301883561465622531 2020-09-04 22:03:23 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @seanhannity Deplorable
1301882129375088640 2020-09-04 21:57:42 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> With ‘willing’ children. So now we can call them willing victims instead of innocent victims? Insane
1301756479435726848 2020-09-04 13:38:24 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @chicksonright This explains the reason the numbers keep going up. All these democrat politicians are breaking their covid ruled so they can spread it and keep us shut down til 2024
1301755746397220865 2020-09-04 13:35:30 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TwitchyTeam You’d need protection from the rats 🐀
1301754331775922181 2020-09-04 13:29:52 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DonaldJTrumpJr Ah, so that question about you being a hero and stopping bad guys wasn’t far off?
1301753930964062208 2020-09-04 13:28:17 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @DonaldJTrumpJr BUT what was her truth 🤷‍♀️
1301753539211849728 2020-09-04 13:26:43 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump @TheJusticeDept @FBI Because they’re afraid he’ll talk
1301748939155099648 2020-09-04 13:08:27 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> We haven’t said enough about this. Either @SpeakerPelosi was reckless in her thinking causing further spread, or deliberate to cause more finger pointing @realDonaldTrump, or she doesn’t think the masks are necessary. There’s only one answer here
1301693050876383232 2020-09-04 09:26:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> I’m so ready for a debate between @JoeBiden and @realDonaldTrump 🍿🍻
1301692466580520961 2020-09-04 09:24:02 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @chicksonright I love the examples he used, so simple and quick
1301688271458631681 2020-09-04 09:07:22 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino Idiocracy-a history documentary written before its time
1301687458363449344 2020-09-04 09:04:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @dbongino They’re not oblivious, they all have a hand out for something
1301686755725250562 2020-09-04 09:01:21 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @TeamTrump @kayleighmcenany Sorry democrats but if you can go to hair and nail salons, you CAN go to the polls. We need to STOP the mail in ballots now! We’ve had enough from the election bandits
1301686103544459264 2020-09-04 08:58:45 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> If you think you’ve been lied to, well it’s because you have!
1301684901377318912 2020-09-04 08:53:59 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> We have been so bamboozled by our government
1301683118378594304 2020-09-04 08:46:54 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @seanhannity Nice highlights 😂. Isn’t she a bit old for that?
1301682365022924800 2020-09-04 08:43:54 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> Isn’t @SpeakerPelosi a bit old for highlights?
1301681932644753408 2020-09-04 08:42:11 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> So, while I’m cutting my own hair so I can keep going to work so congress can keep getting paid @SpeakerPelosi gets the spa treatment. It’s time we the people take our country back from @TheDemocrats. Vote for @realDonaldTrump
1301363328019644418 2020-09-03 11:36:10 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @realDonaldTrump please don’t let them tear down our country while we’re working tomorrow
1301362818147516417 2020-09-03 11:34:08 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @elonmusk there’s 2 charging stations at my hotel but oddly enough they had no Tesla at the rental car facility 😔
1300614679056781312 2020-09-01 10:01:18 +0800 <TheRightKGibson> @JoeBiden asking us to ‘think about it’. Oh we are, believe that
