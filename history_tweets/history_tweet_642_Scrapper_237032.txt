Because while our nation has barely survived attempted coups by Dems, leftists, Hollyweird &amp; their bedfellow media partners &amp; now Biden selling out to foreign agents, he must denounce white supremacy. So sick &amp; tired of it!

LA has been Democrat run forever. Feds only come in if requested or absolutely necessary, and the LA mayor and council refuse federal help.
1305177600336171015 2020-09-14 00:12:43 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @JoeBiden You waited until the polls indicated your support of BLM and Antifa riots against law enforcement was wrong before whispering anything, rather describing riots as peaceful protests.

1302520531665563648 2020-09-06 16:14:29 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @tristalblair @KurtSchlichter @realDonaldTrump Bingo!
1302515911497191429 2020-09-06 15:56:07 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @jmd387 @PeteHegseth @realDonaldTrump Exactly! Imagine a time when anonymous sources are allowed to claim you commited robbery, murder, with no evidence, but by their word it is confirmed...no longer have the right to face your accusers.
1302511887712620546 2020-09-06 15:40:08 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @PeteHegseth @realDonaldTrump This hit job is like reporting on a story that 100 anonymous sources claim that, say, Griffin murdered someone, therefore, this has been confirmed. Oh, and just ignore the other 100 that claimed the opposite. Completely irresponsible reporting.
1302504355015192576 2020-09-06 15:10:12 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @ripcitynick @RationalAngels Being a bigot anywhere makes no sense, but here you are.
1302503935010242561 2020-09-06 15:08:32 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @kellymarie20209 @RationalAngels @PDXzane Hmmm...kids burned up from arsonists rioters versus someone shouting their babies don't have tear gas masks.
1302498717887426560 2020-09-06 14:47:48 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @MichelleGrabsky @TonightHere Thank you! You did us patriots a favor 🤗
1302491440136634368 2020-09-06 14:18:53 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @JoeBiden It was a video....you lied to the fallen heroes' families. Even now, you dishonor them.
1302488732784709632 2020-09-06 14:08:07 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @JoeBiden Joe, you may return to your basement.
1302486469039194113 2020-09-06 13:59:07 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @JoeBiden VP Biden, you couldn't lead anything, and you certainly don't respect America, our troops, or our Constitutional rights.
1302482386978893826 2020-09-06 13:42:54 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @PatriotCatArmy1 @JoeBiden PatriotCat, thanks for sharing.
1302478278557536258 2020-09-06 13:26:35 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @giaburke @theintercept @ggreenwald If 4 of your neighbors anonymously whisper that you have a child chained in your house, apparently this is as good as confirmed.
1302275126856040448 2020-09-05 23:59:20 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @EricHuseby4 @BretBaier @JenGriffinFNC Agree. I recall Griffin was assigned to join Hillary's pack of journalists on Hillary's 2016 campaign airplane. I don't recall Griffin ever reporting Hillary in a negative spin, even with the scandals. In fact, she seemed enamored and thrilled for Hillary, so no suprise here.
1302273521272287232 2020-09-05 23:52:57 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @BretBaier @JenGriffinFNC At least moderate your desire to throw shiny objects into your journalism for fame before actually confirming the story...anonymous sources can claim a lot of things not true or twisted. Btw, hope Griffin enjoyed her time on the 2016 Hillary campaign trail and flights.
1302272034177572866 2020-09-05 23:47:02 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @BretBaier @JenGriffinFNC So, you would be accepting that I have confirmed through an anonymous source that you sexually harrassed her last year? And you would be totally accepting me to go around reporting this anonymously confirmed sources' story on what she says you did? Think &amp; do the honorable thing!
1302260910291992578 2020-09-05 23:02:50 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @ArtValley818_ Love it! Patriot strong!

1301638132849278976 2020-09-04 05:48:08 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @DailyCaller 47 years and counting a career politician....and Biden will make it right this time.
1301635317624045570 2020-09-04 05:36:57 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @HulkHogan Lol really?
1301634599802433538 2020-09-04 05:34:06 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @kirstiealley How about human trafficking?
1301630174039924736 2020-09-04 05:16:31 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @FloridaRise @thehill Show the list.
1301628101101641728 2020-09-04 05:08:17 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @SpeakerPelosi Salon owners are working families, too, Nancy. And you owe them an apology for trying to put them and their families out!
1301611354164355072 2020-09-04 04:01:44 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @realDonaldTrump And Pelosi is in line for presidency? O...M........G. Actually, small business owners are so much smarter than Pelosi. I'd rather that owner replace Pelosi!
1301348003123404800 2020-09-03 10:35:16 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @tomselliott @SpeakerPelosi Omg really...
1301346818408677377 2020-09-03 10:30:34 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Major cities have been burned, looted, small business owners threatened and buildings burned, patriots murdered defending their property and our liberties, because of your support to riot; women with credible complaints against you for sexual harrassment...and you tweet taxes!
1301013750724481024 2020-09-02 12:27:04 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @DanScavino Where is Waldo..err I mean Biden...err I mean Harris.
1300811497170378754 2020-09-01 23:03:23 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @DSchwammenthal Keep up the great work toward peace in the Middle East!
1300810218238963712 2020-09-01 22:58:18 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @NPR Videos from multiple angles are evidence. And NPR just lied again.
1300807921928826884 2020-09-01 22:49:11 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @JoeBiden In Biden's world, everything is backwards. Self-defense is wrong. Looting is peaceful. Law enforcement is breaking the law while BLM anarchists are upholding justice.
1300603063380537345 2020-09-01 09:15:09 +0800 <Scrapper_237032> @JoeBiden When is the debate?
