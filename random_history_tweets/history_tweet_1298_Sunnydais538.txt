A REAL Covid19 bill would be ONLY for helping Americans who are suffering. No better stimulus than getting back to work. Small businesses are DYING!

1326284520530784256 2020-11-11 06:04:05 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @jaymierp Im giving a few Fox programs the benefit of the doubt...but on a short leash. #TheFive
1326283659855491075 2020-11-11 06:00:40 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @FredDobbs1990 Just thinking that. I might not even stay for #TheFive. Getting fed up with Fox. Opposite views are fine but not bashing 24/7.
1326259295353253890 2020-11-11 04:23:51 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @DC_Draino Pretty soon Fox will have no viewers. Social media (especially Twitter, Facebook and Instagram), will have no one on it and MSM won‚Äôt have any relevancy.
1326258613002903552 2020-11-11 04:21:08 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @catturd2 Just shows the lack of integrity of politicians. Boris Johnson pretended to be a friend of Trump‚Äôs...now kissing up to Biden. Has he no shame? No honesty? No moral compass?
1326257833160167435 2020-11-11 04:18:02 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @LuciDracul OMG I didn‚Äôt bring God into the conversation anymore than if I‚Äôd have asked about capitalization of any given name or surname. Just to give any example. I hardly think I‚Äôm important enough for you to save receipt, but if you think I am...go for it. Save anything you‚Äôd like.
1326197700631683072 2020-11-11 00:19:06 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @LuciDracul When did the capitalization (or lack of) Supreme Court become a discussion of Christianity?  Please go find a religious advisor to sort out your issues. Above my retirement pay grade.

1326161081551695872 2020-11-10 21:53:35 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @LuciDracul Just read your bio. Last part is correct. If you are a man, named Luci, you are confused and I‚Äôm not qualified to understand you. Best of luck.
1326159656666996736 2020-11-10 21:47:55 +0800 <Sunnydais538> From the article. This is the type of people biden appoints. Out for themselves. Surprise anyone? #AmericaDecides  https://t.co/eDCIRnPeO6
1326156696864088065 2020-11-10 21:36:09 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @LuciDracul You just answered you own question. That‚Äôs all I need to know.
1326148478960082944 2020-11-10 21:03:30 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @LuciDracul You sure don‚Äôt present yourself as happy.
1326135440114675712 2020-11-10 20:11:41 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @LuciDracul Knew it. I‚Äôm still smiling. Too bad you are too angry to be happy.
1326135151118737409 2020-11-10 20:10:33 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Let‚Äôs start listening to the thoughts of real people in tee shirts and yoga pants, not those in suits and dresses paid to trlll us what to think.

1326128604095410178 2020-11-10 19:44:32 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @joelpollak My uninformed opinion is, if/when Trump overtakes Buyden in votes, popular/electoral, there will be riots and looting. Just not ‚ÄòProud Boys and militias‚Äô.  Trump lawyers are allowed to contest, after all #StillWithHer is still ‚Äòa thing‚Äô. #LiberalsAreDesperate

1326125818607771649 2020-11-10 19:33:28 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @LuciDracul Great debate skill that resort to foul language. Ok. I‚Äôm an adult, not a ‚Äòdebater‚Äô, who is not arguing spelling/caps/grammar/punctuation/election fraud. Let teachers/lawyers/SCOTUS do that. BTW Rhetorical question...when and if you type/write God, is the word capitalized? #Smile
1325949728270528520 2020-11-10 07:53:44 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @LuciDracul Yup...you have great debate skills. Hard pass on this conversation. It‚Äôs simple. There‚Äôs plenty of proof if you look.
1325948375515213824 2020-11-10 07:48:22 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @Rockprincess818 Too little too late. Fox made their bed, now they can see numbers like CNN, MSNBS etc.
1325942704690302977 2020-11-10 07:25:50 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @LuciDracul Or were you talking about the non capitalized words. Petty corrections?
1325942335977484288 2020-11-10 07:24:22 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @LuciDracul But you alluded to the fact that the Trump supporter didn‚Äôt spell it correctly. Or did you misspell his misspelling? Just wondering.
1325941948612571138 2020-11-10 07:22:50 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @JesseBWatters Heard about 1 minute of Biden‚Äôs little unity speech today...then shut it off. He said the ‚Äòelection is over and it‚Äôs time to stop demonizing people‚Äô. Buyden called Trump, his supporters, his surrogates names like racist, Nazis, killers etc. &amp; NEVER called out rioters &amp; protesters
1325930986765430787 2020-11-10 06:39:16 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @LuciDracul How do you spell it?

1325436371486597120 2020-11-08 21:53:51 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Good thread. When Buyden said he didn‚Äôt need votes, he needed support and this  https://t.co/CRYxZuORaj it wasn‚Äôt a gaff. It was the truth and even #DementiaJoe knew it.

1325429948710989831 2020-11-08 21:28:19 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Reluctantly watching Fox and Friends and thank God for Huckabee telling the truth.
1325429309977276420 2020-11-08 21:25:47 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Took a break yesterday from tv &amp; Twitter. Turned on to watch Watters World to see president elect Buyden. Dems have managed to completely break all media &amp; our election process. At least I can complain and/or choose to ban media &amp; social media. What is any of it without Trump.
1325427300943409152 2020-11-08 21:17:48 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @theretrofem @drdavidsamadi @newsmax We haven‚Äôt been loyal to Fox from the beginning, but shortly after...they have abandon us. Good luck Fox with your new CNN style ratings.

I don‚Äôt mind hearing the opposite ideas, however all but Newsmax and OAN are one sided, totally ignoring opposing facts. Riots, looting &amp; #ElectionFraud etc. Dems have managed to completely kill our election process, media and America
1325065574578327554 2020-11-07 21:20:26 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @bfraser747 @StAnIsHr I had forgotten about the first one you listed. It also makes it clear why they never asked Buyden to promise to accept election results.
1325063603603562499 2020-11-07 21:12:36 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Why is there any question if Pelosi is the next speaker? Either a Republican is, hopefully, or another Dem. She promised 2018 would be her last reign &amp; then retire for someone new. Anyone else remember all the #DemLies &amp; promises after the 2018 election?  #ElectionResult2020

1324710649512026112 2020-11-06 21:50:05 +0800 <Sunnydais538> This was planned from the beginning.

1324345863343321088 2020-11-05 21:40:33 +0800 <Sunnydais538> I joined Twitter during the debates in 2016, mostly to hear thoughts on Donald J Trump. Now #Trump2020   If ‚ÄòOrangeman Bad‚Äô isn‚Äôt president, will it even be worth checking tweets anymore?   What will celebrities/sports stars do when no one watches their tweets/movies/games?

They both have much to lose if President Trump gets re-elected. I guess backstabbing the USA and covering his butt is more important than being thrown under the bus.

1319082480717205505 2020-10-22 09:05:45 +0800 <Sunnydais538> It‚Äôs the Biden plan. But...I thought Trump,was doing the worst job containing the virus. Hmmm...another Biden/Dem lie?

People need to know how corrupt Dem politicians have been for decades. If not, they will keep doing what they have gotten away with. Slapping hands doesn‚Äôt work. Shame does.

1317055895222833152 2020-10-16 18:52:49 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @SenSchumer I can imagine #CorruptJoeBiden being questioned like this. He‚Äôd be yelling, pointing, stomping &amp; challenging the moderator to a push-up challenge, or laying in the floor in a fetal position sucking his thumb &amp; crying, then he‚Äôd get up, sniff her hair for good measure. #Trump2020

1316758862238806021 2020-10-15 23:12:31 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Hypocrisy of Twitter that this can trend with absolution verification. What is going on. A made up story gets trending when #HunterBidenEmails story is quashed. Tell me the whole #HunterGate is true.
1316756197068996608 2020-10-15 23:01:56 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Twitter is full of it.  Photo in my timeline, no votes and when I click on it...votes. Not many,  it jack still suppresses it.  #TwitterCensorship  https://t.co/NWxdYwMtvO

1316727697658314752 2020-10-15 21:08:41 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Everyone needs to listen to the 6 part interview. Short and very informative. #BidenCrimeFamily #BidenTownHall @GStephanopoulos dare you to ask Biden about this.
1316726368500166656 2020-10-15 21:03:24 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @TrumpJew @TeamTrump Biden is the insult, but media hides most.

1316705901261328384 2020-10-15 19:42:04 +0800 <Sunnydais538> This little video proves Biden either lied about getting the prosecutor fired...or he did it. Either way Biden isn‚Äôt fit to be president. BTW this video of Biden‚Äôs braggadocio began his big downfall. #BidenCrimeFamily
1316704991818723330 2020-10-15 19:38:27 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @OccamsRazorCuts @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC and his viewers are brainwashed enough to believe and spread that.
1316704107248472064 2020-10-15 19:34:57 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @DrKarlynB Agreed. I just started rereading 1984 (been 50+ years). Just replace a few names...bingo. Orwell is a genius.  PS liberals...I know he died in 1950...hence...genius for predicting the 21st century.
1316703093925576705 2020-10-15 19:30:55 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @DrKarlynB My mind works well enough to have figured that out. After all, I‚Äôm not a liberal spell checker. I have fat fingers. Also autocorrect isn‚Äôt my friend sometimes. Used to it.
1316702490717454337 2020-10-15 19:28:31 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Can you believe the audacity of the @ACLU to actually a tweet this...and yesterday, of all days, for twitter/@jack to ALLOW it on Twitter? Come on man! #BidenCrimeFamily #HunterBidenEmails

1316525960091623426 2020-10-15 07:47:03 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @NonLiberalPAer I‚Äôm rereading ‚Äò1984‚Äô. Gonna be interesting got compare to today.  50+ years ago when I first read it, it seemed impossible.  By FaceBook and Twitter censoring the #HunterBidenEmails they are admitting it‚Äôs true.   Just a thought.   #WhereIsHunter #HunterLaptop #hunterGate
1316521253117853697 2020-10-15 07:28:21 +0800 <Sunnydais538> We are always supposed to believe and protect whistleblowers...right? Just because he isn‚Äôt ‚Äòanonymous or unnamed sources. Why does a Fox show the owner, his business and contact number. Not nice or legal.  #WhereIsHunter #BidenGate #Shameful

1316401846806876161 2020-10-14 23:33:52 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @TrumpJew Gonna be the most used, changed, added to meme in meme history. It‚Äôs so perfect for so many circumstances.

1316399598122995713 2020-10-14 23:24:56 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Is Whitehouse out of  money? No specialty printed charts? #ConfirmationHearing #ACB #ACBForSCOTUS

1316380702313795584 2020-10-14 22:09:51 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Sen Leahy, I went to pay property taxes yesterday in Blue Earth County Minnesota. The court house in Mankato is the early voting location. One...repeat one person voting...no line. I plan on in person voting for a Trump on Nov 3. #ACBHearings #ConfirmationHearing #Elections2020
1316377828674412545 2020-10-14 21:58:26 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Did Sen Leahy remember to put his pants on? #SupremeCourtConfirmation
1316371418263805952 2020-10-14 21:32:57 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Feinstein asks a question about Medicare being legal, then after ACB explains her not being able to answer hypothetical questions, Feinstein says ‚Äòcan‚Äôt imagine it being a question‚Äô.   Didn‚Äôt you write the question?  Didn‚Äôt you read the question?  #TermLimits
1316365252779560961 2020-10-14 21:08:27 +0800 <Sunnydais538> ACB is sitting, listening to Graham praise her, and has a look on her face no more revealing than when Dems chastised her continually yesterday. A true poker face. #ConfirmAmyConeyBarrett #ConfirmACB now

1316337528266526721 2020-10-14 19:18:17 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @kerpen @History6 Maybe they should ask all their Dem cronies that question...before they run for any position. Re: Bill Clinton, Gillum, Cunningham etc etc etc.
1316336569909948422 2020-10-14 19:14:29 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @kerpen @History6 Yup...Next debate Trump should just let Jobiden speak. The more he speaks, the more disconnected he gets.

1316132537794732038 2020-10-14 05:43:44 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Replies are true ACA stories.

1316128594108788736 2020-10-14 05:28:03 +0800 <Sunnydais538> I guess congress can‚Äôt work on two things at once. What were the votes they had to leave to do in other confirmations. #TheFive

1316116080256057345 2020-10-14 04:38:20 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Talk about carbon emission and a carbon footprint being worthwhile.
1316113633240375296 2020-10-14 04:28:37 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @TrumpJew Why is Jobiden worried about 19 years from now? We only have, what? about 10 years till global warming kills us all. Did he forget that?
1316100333056208901 2020-10-14 03:35:46 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @Erikjmora @realTuckFrumper Did you catch the Klobuchar comment on hoping she‚Äôd be in the seat ACB is on now?   Never gonna happen.
1316099892012556288 2020-10-14 03:34:00 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @HotMama83163983 @ChrisCoons Been a lot of mansplaining today by Dems.
1316067154417025027 2020-10-14 01:23:55 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Be sure to point out...no question was asked of ACB to answer. She didn‚Äôt ignore any question and paid attention to the whole boring speech.
1316060793893519366 2020-10-14 00:58:39 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @TrumpJew I know, right? I was running errands this morning and got home to him. Yuck.
1316018033203187712 2020-10-13 22:08:44 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Has Jobiden campaign called a lid for the week? Yesterday didn‚Äôt go very well.
1316017650766548996 2020-10-13 22:07:13 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @SomeBitchIKnow @keithasims I‚Äôm an employer also.   I am the owner of rental property.  I‚Äôm pretty sure I can‚Äôt discriminate against hiring or renting to anyone...even Trump supporters.   You are misinformed. Evil.

1315809654031691776 2020-10-13 08:20:42 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @G_lame3 It wasn‚Äôt on Fox. WE watched on OAN.

1315800581752205312 2020-10-13 07:44:39 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @lany891 It‚Äôs getting around. Quickly. His book is going to flop.
1315784867867774976 2020-10-13 06:42:13 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @lany891 I‚Äôm in no way in favor of Jobiden, Cuomo or Harris. I was just saying he won‚Äôt win NY pulling Cuomo in. I wasn‚Äôt specific I guess.
1315769926574108675 2020-10-13 05:42:50 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Did you see where Jobiden just gave up on NY? He is seriously considering Andrew Cuomo as his AG. #TheFive
1315768222533255168 2020-10-13 05:36:04 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @NHHome12 All libs think a positive Covid19 test is a death sentence. Why don‚Äôt they ever quote the survival rate or the number who have no symptoms at all. #CovidScamdemic
1315765359249625089 2020-10-13 05:24:42 +0800 <Sunnydais538> I believe it‚Äôs too late to save Fox News. They got rid of O‚ÄôReilly, Regan, contributors Malkin, diGenova, Toensing and other conservatives but continue to keep Juan, Brazile, Tarlov, Wallace, Harf and just keeping adding more extreme liberals.  #TheFive
1315763704416342020 2020-10-13 05:18:07 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @AMiddleClassGuy @TheJuanWilliams Well, Biden had a 6 car parade this weekend. So there, You know he‚Äôs winning.
1315762036031270913 2020-10-13 05:11:29 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @big_sponge I missed that. I didn‚Äôt want to be like a liberal, but I had ro today. I switched to OAN to watch the hearing so I didn‚Äôt have to listen to Wallace, then muted each Dem soapbox appearance. I also didn‚Äôt read the awful Twitter posts.#TheFive

1315711020636278784 2020-10-13 01:48:46 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @DavidLimbaugh @catturd2 I haven‚Äôt seen John Roberts since the week he blew up over Kayleigh telling him Trump has denounced white supremacy. Did he have a nervous breakdown? Extreme TDS? Will Wallace join him?
1315708797143392256 2020-10-13 01:39:56 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @ComfortablySmug I believe it‚Äôs too late to save Fox News.

1315691383324278784 2020-10-13 00:30:44 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @TrumpWarRoom But Biden remembers Mitts religion? Come on man.
1315664994927874056 2020-10-12 22:45:53 +0800 <Sunnydais538> People are arguing that not voting for Garland was a bad choice.  When the senate knows it hasn‚Äôt got the votes...why waste time and money. When a country votes, no one knows how many votes are for either candidate. A senate and national, vote are totally different.
1315642204673773568 2020-10-12 21:15:19 +0800 <Sunnydais538> People aren‚Äôt going to watch  #AmyComeyBarrett confirmation hearings, but will and then tweet crap all day. I‚Äôm not going to watch the tweets on here. All they are doing is lying about things that aren‚Äôt true. Bye. It‚Äôs all a waste of time.
1315641300285362176 2020-10-12 21:11:44 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Too bad. We will miss you. üëã
1315458394984198146 2020-10-12 09:04:56 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @TrumpJew After not being able to watch Donald Trump for 5 minutes, I laughed when he announced his candidacy. Then, I listened to his rallies and was proud to vote for him in 2016...and now again in 2020...in person.
1315455747782832131 2020-10-12 08:54:24 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @BoxdoHot Good luck. I ordered shoes from an online in...April of 2019. Still trying to get shoes/refund for the shoes that I never received. I get emails, just no results.
1315451676325801984 2020-10-12 08:38:14 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @JackPosobiec Pelosi will force her to anoint her.
1315448728044679168 2020-10-12 08:26:31 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @Breaking911 @axios Did Biden just give NY to Trump?
1315447850411724802 2020-10-12 08:23:02 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @W7VOA @Shem_Infinite @realDonaldTrump Wishing Trump well. Only one rally per day. He must not be 100% yet. Of course, he might have a couple White House/Oval Office events planned. üòâ
1315446889198870528 2020-10-12 08:19:12 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @dailycallout @TrumpJew Biden‚Äôs campaign is really good at keeping his appearances secret.
1315346588668174336 2020-10-12 01:40:39 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @DrKarlynB @JoeBiden Biden is calm, level headed and presidential in his dreams. He sleeps a lot in his basement.
1315309758224703489 2020-10-11 23:14:18 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @JonahDispatch @ThisWeekABC Wasn‚Äôt there a presidential debate in 1858 between Lincoln and Douglas? Seems I remember learning that in history class (back when history was taught in school). First televised debate was in 1960. You are not entitled to your own facts.
1315307018979364866 2020-10-11 23:03:25 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @SassCBrown @recon618 I commented on her yesterday . She called Blexit at the White House pandering. There was no hot sauces anywhere.  Move to OAN and Newsmax
1315306422259847176 2020-10-11 23:01:02 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @MariaBartiromo just defended Wallace on Fox with Donald Trump. Are they threatened with job losses for not defending his bad debate performance? It isn‚Äôt the over talking that is his problem...it‚Äôs his babying/protection/covering of Biden.
1315305501379440650 2020-10-11 22:57:23 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @Phreadys @fedagentmark We have Trump flags in out front yard, on our dock and at our shop. So far, no problems. We tried to get a large Trump sign and they are all gone. This is in Minnesota.

1315268132072755206 2020-10-11 20:28:53 +0800 <Sunnydais538> My uneducated/unscientific take on this Kate McKinnon/Colin Jost SNL skit...  One, they are seated NEXT to each other. Two, they are not wearing masks. Three, they are touching. Four, they are very triggered by #Trump2020LandslideVictory
1315259890676502528 2020-10-11 19:56:08 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @JoeBiden I know, right? That‚Äôs what I keep telling democrats on twitter, but they still hate Trump so much that want to waste their vote on you. Go figure.
1315066141547655169 2020-10-11 07:06:15 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Watch till the end. Just gets better and better.

1314996278053474309 2020-10-11 02:28:38 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @catturd2 So that he can make a point of taking it off and cough into his hand
1314995888545320960 2020-10-11 02:27:05 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @charliekirk11 Came inside to watch Trump with Blexit at the White House. TV was on Fox so watched it. Not 2 min. after, Arthel Neville made a point to say ‚ÄòTrump was pandering to blacks &amp; Latinos‚Äô. Done with her for good. Hot sauce, southern accents and bad black ent. at convention isn‚Äôt???

1314733077797703681 2020-10-10 09:02:46 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @PColaWhiteSands It said evaluation...not exam. As a patient for over 70 years, there is a difference.

1314728880557748229 2020-10-10 08:46:06 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Is Pelosi getting it set up to dump Biden if he gets elected? Never gonna happen tho. #TuckerCarlsonTonight

It‚Äôs odd that so few deaths reported from heart attacks, pneumonia, natural causes or heart failure...used to be catch all for any unexplained death...now it‚Äôs all Covid.

1314524162908655617 2020-10-09 19:12:37 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @TrumpJew Kamala Harris either lied, evaded or just made stuff up the entire debate. She did tho agree with Susan Page about Pence leading them into the next question with a good segue. That was the only truth out of her mouth. Not even her smile was real.
1314521410296066048 2020-10-09 19:01:41 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @RichardGrenell @History6 @realDonaldTrump Millions upon millions of people, around the world, have had and now have Covid19...were never hospitalized, never ever had a symptom...and have survived. Liberals are in an absolute panic over Biden‚Äôs condition and blaming Covid19. Biden is no leader.

1313017858750906368 2020-10-05 15:27:06 +0800 <Sunnydais538> VERY painful to watch. Was she trying to be Chris Wallace 2.0?

It‚Äôs a FACT...on record...that Joe got Hunter two waivers (age and drug use) to get a Navy commission. No boot camp etc. then he used again and was kicked out.
1311715198852567041 2020-10-02 01:10:48 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @johnrobertsFox please, what are the words you expect Trump to say.
1311712795407327235 2020-10-02 01:01:15 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Listening to Rush in my car on my way home. He suggested the Biden lids are to keep him away from the public, children and women. Sniffing, hair, necks etc. #Outnumbered

1304196494506037248 2020-09-11 07:14:09 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @redeyebrody @seanmdav Bret should have pushed him for answers especially on the teleprompter question. Said I‚Äôll take that as a yes.

1301840513566466048 2020-09-04 19:12:20 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @JordanKarem1 @catturd2 @POTUS Look at the good news:   Media hacks are so hard up for dirt on @POTUS they are rehashing stories from last year (France &amp; strokes)to deflect  from giving their blessing to Biden,riots, Pelosi etc.   The next four years may just go smoothly for Trump.

1301639814001889281 2020-09-04 05:54:49 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @JoMarksberry She‚Äôs also had Botox and possibly a face lift since the lockdown started. We aren‚Äôt stupid or blind.

1301630635539398661 2020-09-04 05:18:21 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @Jamaica658 And Kim Jong-un died 4 times in 2020...so far according to CNN anonymous sources.
1301628062359003139 2020-09-04 05:08:07 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @cherylkanere They just woke up after listening to the Biden speech today.
1301619664259297281 2020-09-04 04:34:45 +0800 <Sunnydais538> She finally discovered her ‚Äòwhite privilege‚Äô and is giving up on being ‚Äòblack‚Äô.
1301609892701241346 2020-09-04 03:55:55 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @TrumpWarRoom The truth will come out.  Little by little.  Media and Biden campaign pushbquestions for Biden to answer.  Shameful.
1301607845624983554 2020-09-04 03:47:47 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @DrKarlynB Listeners are falling asleep.,
1301606090237530112 2020-09-04 03:40:49 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @blondekott @PhilipWegmann I about fell asleep listening to Biden drone on. Never do when Trump talks.
1301604645698183171 2020-09-04 03:35:04 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Is Biden trying to hypnotize everyone into voting for him? Oh, maybe I‚Äôm saying good much now. Riiight!
1301604032360968192 2020-09-04 03:32:38 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @JoMarksberry Biden said he would listen to the scientists if elected. Fauci said not to shake hands...of he WOULD listen...not he DOES listen yet.
1301603295354650624 2020-09-04 03:29:42 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @almostjingo @Shem_Infinite @JoeBiden Trying to listen to Biden in Kenosha. Falling asleep...me and him. He can‚Äôt even breath in that mask. If he gets elected, no way could I listen to him or Harris daily. Oh, right...he‚Äôd only come out monthly.

1301543265112674304 2020-09-03 23:31:10 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @USSANews After the way fauci handled AIDS research...for the past 30+ years...why should anyone listen to him. He‚Äôs a hack.
1301480809384284166 2020-09-03 19:22:59 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @DC_Draino So Pelosi is saying the salon owner then went to her home, forced her to go to the salon, ripped her mask off and forced her to get her hair done? She‚Äôs been getting her hair and face done since last Feb. Come on man...
1301479761735278592 2020-09-03 19:18:50 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @DanScavino @History6 Has ANYONE heard a Republican in ANY office saying...instructing... supporters to go out and cause chaos in the streets, restaurants, gas stations or any public or private area? Didn‚Äôt think so. #EnoughIsEnough #Trump #DemsAreDestroyingAmerica
1301274484473761792 2020-09-03 05:43:08 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @lany891 Hiding this... The daughter of her friend is working at a local school. When introducing themselves, asked to say why they chose teaching. On guy said, I‚Äôm not kidding...‚Äùto teach kids to become democrat like me‚Äù. FireHim!

1301265846266888193 2020-09-03 05:08:48 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Here Juan...they didn‚Äôt wear masks at the protests. #TheFive

1301200117710675969 2020-09-03 00:47:37 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Lisa is chomping at the bit.  #outnumbered
1301196726393602049 2020-09-03 00:34:09 +0800 <Sunnydais538> We all KNEW Pelosi was going to the hairdresser and plastic surgeon during the lockdown. We aren‚Äôt stupid!  #outnumbered
1301194615257731077 2020-09-03 00:25:45 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Maybe now people will face charges in the riots. #Outnumbered
1301193619475492864 2020-09-03 00:21:48 +0800 <Sunnydais538> Those idiots waking around with floaties and party hats vote? #outnumbered
1301193179723694083 2020-09-03 00:20:03 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @Politcswatch @ecipmck Just kinda proves what Fox position is now.
1301192443531079683 2020-09-03 00:17:08 +0800 <Sunnydais538> @GEK1451 I think they are talking building owner (talked to Trump)  vs. business owner (not there). Or vice versa. Not sure tho.
1301191799604682752 2020-09-03 00:14:34 +0800 <Sunnydais538> I really find it hard to believe that Biden raised 324m in August or that the DNC had more viewers. Dems would watch Turnip convention just to mock his supporters. No one who isn‚Äôt Dem could stomach the Biden convention. #outnumbered
