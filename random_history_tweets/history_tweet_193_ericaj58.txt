1342912165422854144 2020-12-27 03:16:24 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump You’re saying mail in ballots are “corrupt”?   Your gullible supporters followed your poor advice abs DIDN’T mail in vote.   Dems DID.   They counted them LAST.   No “ballot dumps or fraud”   They JUST COUNTED all the VOTES.   So claiming you were “winning” at midnight” is A LIE.

You think investigations that produce FACTS that the 2016 election was interfered by Russia to help Trump win. 17 agencies confirm it.   But it’s fake news to you.   You say “don’t believe the media”.   Where do YOU get your news from then?
1342577283702263808 2020-12-26 05:05:42 +0800 <ericaj58> @ilookamazingman Because it’s true. Russia interfered in the election. Collusion was found but not enough to bring charges.  https://t.co/SuYgukH7bd

Besides that, he’s the most hated man in America. Why should she be? She SUPPORTS him.

1342535040320765952 2020-12-26 02:17:51 +0800 <ericaj58> @DeanBrowningPA @realDonaldTrump So glad you got that out of his tweet.   Not that he’s ignoring the 3000 that are dying EVERY DAY.   Not that he’s thrown a wrench into the relief bill for STARVING Americans.   Not that he’s GOLFING AGAIN.   Pretty sad when you think “owning the libs” is an accomplishment.
1342534286914641920 2020-12-26 02:14:51 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump May this be the only tweet from you until the 27th.   I know it’s wishful thinking abs highly unlikely it will happen but it would be what the American people deserve from you. SILENCE.
1342533870269259777 2020-12-26 02:13:12 +0800 <ericaj58> @BannedRama @itsJeffTiedrich The thing is though Trump calls himself a “Christian “ and spews religious crap. Biden is quiet about his Christianity. That’s the way it should be.

The difference is Biden is defending himself with the TRUTH.   Trump is incapable of telling the truth. In fact, HE said Biden was “taking away your guns”. Which was a LIE.

1340025014993580032 2020-12-19 04:03:54 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump It’s amazing that your supporters believe that the Russian investigation found NOTHING, after MANY investigations by SEVERAL agencies CONFIRMED they interfered in the 2016 election.   Making you the ILLEGITIMATE POTUS.   But they BELIEVE THIS election was rigged with NO PROOF.
1340024033333497856 2020-12-19 04:00:00 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump “The Russian investigation was a hoax”!  They found nothing! I’m totally exonerated!  “This is a RIGGED election “.  And yet, your supporters believe both of these statements.   “I love the poorly educated “.

Russian interference, Comey’s last minute reopening of the investigation of Hillary and Cambridge Analytica all got him the win. 77,000 votes in 3 states heavily targeted by Russia through social media gave him the electoral college votes he needed.

1337486940350730240 2020-12-12 03:58:30 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump Come and get him!
1337486209682042881 2020-12-12 03:55:36 +0800 <ericaj58> @DanCrenshawTX Applies to both sides.   What would be uncovered if Kentucky and South Carolina were contested and investigated?   Because surely to GOD if the Dems cheated they sure as HELL would have made SURE @senatemajldr and @LindseyGrahamSC didn’t win.   JFC. The stupidity is astounding.
1337485509073883137 2020-12-12 03:52:49 +0800 <ericaj58> @DanCrenshawTX Haha you speak of integrity?   Hypocrite much?   If you had a problem with it you should have addressed it MONTHS ago.   You KNEW how each state would count votes.   You KNEW but wanted to see who won.   Now that Biden has won by a LANDSLIDE y’all are screaming NO FAIR!
1337484927403663361 2020-12-12 03:50:30 +0800 <ericaj58> @DanCrenshawTX The will of EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE is being IGNORED.   How do you EXPECT them to behave?
1337484681466408961 2020-12-12 03:49:31 +0800 <ericaj58> @DanCrenshawTX And how would YOU be reacting if this was reversed?   What a bunch of hypocritical crybabies y’all are.
1337484448531533825 2020-12-12 03:48:36 +0800 <ericaj58> @DanCrenshawTX There is no CASE.   That is why there’s outrage.   But your take on this is predictable as you had NO PROBLEM sweeping the crimes @realDonaldTrump committed that lead to his impeachment under the carpet.   56 cases tossed out of court is PROOF there’s no “there there”.   Vile.
1337472435671638017 2020-12-12 03:00:52 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump The list of your CRIMES   Obstruction of justice  Abuse of power Russia interference in election  QPQ in Ukraine  Campaign finance violations  Tax evasion  Falsifying business documents  Sexual assault   And that’s not including your KIDS.   But the Biden admin is scandalous?

It’s kinda like when YOU replaced Obama you wanted credit for the strong economy and low unemployment and growing job numbers.  JFC you’re a crybaby.
1337466805225365505 2020-12-12 02:38:29 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump If they follow the constitution and show “great courage and wisdom” you will lose FOR the LAST TIME.   This is an ongoing “message” to the stacked court that you want them to overturn a FAIR ELECTION.   To dismiss the will of 81 MILLION AMERICANS.   Not HAPPENING.  Just GROW UP.
1337465663657365504 2020-12-12 02:33:57 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump What’s wrong with making the court EVEN NUMBERS in Republicans and Dems?   The American people need to know that cases will be FAIR. Not one sided!
1337465241303564288 2020-12-12 02:32:17 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump Then do your PHUCKING JOB and tackle the virus instead of whining about the FAIR ELECTION that YOU LOST.   YOU are KILLING AMERICANS.

Didn’t you and your lunatic supporters scream “MSM CANNOT CALL the ELECTION?”.   Millions of votes hadn’t been counted.   And it wasn’t at 97% either.   Another big fat Trump LIE.
1336778366846816256 2020-12-10 05:02:53 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump And where were the counting of the votes at? What percentage had been counted?

1335299122174152704 2020-12-06 03:04:54 +0800 <ericaj58> @KenBusz @Scaramucci Now THIS is cheating.   And they STILL couldn’t win.   Maybe, just maybe, it was because @realDonaldTrump was such a terrible candidate?   Otherwise, how did McConnell and Graham win? Don’t you think the Dems would have made SURE they didn’t win if they “cheated”?  https://t.co/5YpfBGD4Xh
1335298459855802370 2020-12-06 03:02:16 +0800 <ericaj58> @KenBusz @Scaramucci How did they cheat?   44 cases all tossed out of court for lack of evidence isn’t proof enough for you?   And I bet you STILL think Russian interference didn’t happen right?

1335297570269061121 2020-12-06 02:58:44 +0800 <ericaj58> @Acyn This is all they’ve got left. A “video” that could be ANYTHING and drunken “star witness” that even GIULIANI had to control.

The American people OVERWHELMINGLY voted for Biden as the next POTUS.   @realDonaldTrump is taking the money from the people he says he cares about. He KNOWS he lost.   How can 73 million people be so PHUCKING STUPID?

I too can write a book with 1000 pages describing all the cheating the REPUBLICANS have done.   Just because Trump didn’t win doesn’t to mean there’s been cheating. 44 cases have now been tossed out.   He’s a sore loser of the worst kind.   He LOST.

1335034426154086401 2020-12-05 09:33:05 +0800 <ericaj58> @itsJeffTiedrich But they don’t believe that Russia interfered in the election.   I was told here that “there’s no proof they interfered but plenty of proof this election was rigged “.   I’ve never seen so many dumb people in my life.

1335019392141205506 2020-12-05 08:33:21 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump BECAUSE BIDEN HAS WON THE ELECTION.   Didn’t you say it would tank if he won?   As usual, you’re trying to take credit for something you had NOTHING to do with.

Ghouliani and Team Trump have lost over FORTY CASES for lack of EVIDENCE.   How you can say “there’s no proof of Russia” but believe the LIES from Trump and his “lawyers” shows how BRAINWASHED you are.

That was his GOAL from the BEGINNING.   He KNEW they told the truth so he discredited them so you wouldn’t believe them. He admitted it to Leslie Stahl.   And you BOUGHT it.   Look who’s brainwashed now!

Y’all accuse @CNN of not being credible but you want us to believe @BreitbartNews or any of the other garbage you watch?   You attack CNN is because Trump TOLD you to.   He’s a pathological liar.

That’s the only reason he’s still whining about the election that he LOST by a LANDSLIDE.   So that idiots like you donate to his “pay off my debts” fund.   Such a bunch of losers y’all are.

You accuse, attack, belittle, and name call, when it’s YOU that’s committed the “indiscretion”!   You’re supporting and “working for” a man clearly suffering from cognitive issues, who lies pathologically. A man who almost destroyed the US.   GFY.

But HE TOLD YOU not to believe then because he KNEW it was true.   So like a good little sheep, you did as you were told.   So now you believe the REAL FAKE NEWS, like @OANN and @newsmax.

They “law team” for Trump is taking these bogus cases to court andTHEY are tossing them out.   That has NOTHING to do with Biden.   Start paying attention to FACTS instead of @OANN and @newsmax.
1333116429332148224 2020-11-30 02:31:39 +0800 <ericaj58> @JennaEllisEsq @conce1959 So because Trump lost it’s a “total disaster election”?

Biden would have SAVED THOUSANDS of LIVES by addressing the Virus back in DECEMBER 2019.   Biden has already accomplished more than Trump has. Wait until January!
1332374890372952064 2020-11-28 01:25:02 +0800 <ericaj58> @Carolynm80 @JoeBidenMask @search9286 @jimsciutto The cheating was done in 2016 when Trump was helped by Russia. ( FACT)   There has been ZERO proof of fraud in this election.   But as a typical Trumptard, I’m sure you call the Russia investigation a “hoax” but believe every word about this election being rigged.   Insanity.

Trump? @OANN ? @BreitbartNews ? @newsmax ?   There is NO POSSIBILITY of Trump staying in power.   The sooner y’all accept it, the sooner the US can start healing from 4 years of incompetence and lying.

1332180887211950082 2020-11-27 12:34:08 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump   In Trump world being asked to face the truth of his landslide loss by being asked a simple question is an opportunity to attack the reporter. He hasn’t shown respect to reporters since he stole the election in 2016. Why SHOULD they respect him? He’s a loser.

Does that make you feel better that OTHER COUNTRIES are suffering too?   Does that excuse your incompetence in your tiny little brain?   Of COURSE MSM is reporting this.   You’re just happy that people are suffering.

You don’t get it do you?

1326738504441720832 2020-11-12 12:08:03 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump Hilarious. @Jim_Jordan thinks that because Trump got 9 million more votes this time and STILL didn’t win there’s “something going on”?   It just means MILLIONS MORE VOTED THIS ELECTION. 6.6% more than in 2016.   Another example of Republicans thinking their voters are STUPID.

1326615897516118017 2020-11-12 04:00:51 +0800 <ericaj58> @seanhannity So we can fire @realDonaldTrump , @senatemajldr , @LindseyGrahamSC , @Jim_Jordan , and the rest of the lying POS Republicans then?   Awesome!

1326615259868585984 2020-11-12 03:58:19 +0800 <ericaj58> @seanhannity So one day of the year he shows he cares for veterans?   Or, a more likely scenario, it’s for the photo op.

If you’re going to start screaming “election fraud” when there’s no proof it’s you that’s delusional.   For all those times you called us triggered over the Russia investigation that PROVED they helped: back at you.

1324976859931504641 2020-11-07 15:27:54 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump @EveningEdit You told people not to vote by mail claiming it was “ripe with fraud “.   Republicans believed your lie.   Dems didn’t.   The last two days have been mail in votes. Which are predominantly Dem votes for Biden.   You asked for it.

1324886158564753408 2020-11-07 09:27:30 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump So you think your “legal proceedings” that have ZERO credibility will “miraculously “ give you the votes you need?   That may have worked when you were a failed businessman.   Not now.   You lost.   FAIR AND SQUARE.
1324885702845165568 2020-11-07 09:25:41 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump That’s the way it works.   They count DAY OF votes first.   Then they count early votes.   Then they count MAIL in VOTES. The kind of voting you TOLD REPUBLICANS NOT TO DO.   This isn’t rocket science. You shot upusekf in the foot.   Deal with it.  Like a man.

1324773935955628033 2020-11-07 02:01:34 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump You suppressed the mail in voting by saying it was “ripe with fraud”.

1324047632411488256 2020-11-05 01:55:29 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump YOU were the one that told people mail in voting was ripe with fraud. The Dems knew you were lying. Your idiot supporters believed you.   Now it’s backfired on you.   You have NOBODY to BLAME but YOURSELF.

1323752037532618752 2020-11-04 06:20:54 +0800 <ericaj58> @politvidchannel He thinks he weighs 238 pounds, is good looking , is the “favourite POTUS”, is truthful, well spoken, “a stable genius”, has created the best economy and jobs in US history, isn’t corrupt, and has raised the level of respect that the US has globally.   No Trump. Biden will win.
1323751119038816257 2020-11-04 06:17:15 +0800 <ericaj58> @trumpharmsusall They think they can act anyway they want because they’re “Christian “. It gives them a “pass” on vile behaviour.   So wrong.

As long as they “adore you”.   As long as they don’t question your lies.   As long as they believe you over the experts.   As long as they follow your lead.

As long as you continue to claim “I’m being audited “ and fight tooth and bail to keep them from being released people will think ( rightfully so) that you’re HIDING SOMETHING.

But it’s still not right that votes should not be counted as long as they’re mailed in time.   Trump thinks this is another example of “they’re out to get me”. I’m so sick of his constant whining. This could also help him. But he’s too stupid to see that.

1322323768878931969 2020-10-31 07:45:28 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump It should end when ALL VOTES ARE COUNTED.   INCLUDING the ones POST MARKED NOVEMBER 3rd.

Why would ANYONE give you another FOUR YEARS to continue your destruction?   You’re not only corrupt, but you’re also incompetent and incapable at EVERYTHING you do.   Except lie.
1321911959600558081 2020-10-30 04:29:05 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump You’re THE MOST CORRUPT POSPOTUS in HISTORY.   There’s NO EVIDENCE that Biden is corrupt. Just a conspiracy theory produced by @RudyGiuliani that has been debunked.   Kinda like “Obamagate”.   There no “there there”.

He inherited a strong economy that has tanked due to his incompetence and poor leadership. Jobs are down, market is down, unemployment is up.   Acknowledging the virus and acting to fight it was all he had to do.

1320809732555173888 2020-10-27 03:29:14 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump Is that all you’ve got?   You’ve KILLED 225,000 with your incompetence.   You got HELP from Russia to steal the election.   You’ve destroyed the respect of America globally.   You’re corrupt.   You’re a pathological liar.   Seems like Biden is the obvious choice  to me!

1320765998668996608 2020-10-27 00:35:27 +0800 <ericaj58> @ddale8 I can’t understand why @realDonaldTrump said her questions were “inappropriate “.   What he MEANT to say was “mean”.   And I was waiting for him to call her “nasty”.   What a cowardly bully.
1320765267312455684 2020-10-27 00:32:33 +0800 <ericaj58> @ddale8 He doesn’t think he lies either.
1320765172336611338 2020-10-27 00:32:10 +0800 <ericaj58> @Bitflight_ @realDonaldTrump Exactly! And it’s one sided. He doesn’t have to answer to his lies on SM. And he gets interviewed by bobble head @seanhannity where he can spew his lies with no questions asked. So frustrating.
1320762542495395846 2020-10-27 00:21:43 +0800 <ericaj58> White House: 'We're not going to get control of the pandemic'  https://t.co/nBkNNGlIXU via @msnbc @realDonaldTrump   So much for your claims that you’re doing a great job! You aren’t even TRYING!   #TrumpkillsAmericans   #TrumpIsAMassMurderer

He released it early with a “see how mean she was to me” attitude. Tonight’s release was awesome because it was FACT CHECKED. @realDonaldTrump was shown to be a liar AND a crybaby. He’s pathetic and disgusting.

Like the economy.   Jobs.   Unemployment.   But you DID kill 220,000 Americans with your incompetence.   “I take no responsibility “.

1319383031656771585 2020-10-23 05:00:02 +0800 <ericaj58> @FoxNews Now let’s talk about the Republicans ignoring the Mueller report.   And also let’s discuss the impeachment trial where they had ALREADY decided to acquit @realDonaldTrump before it was over.   So don’t tell us that you’re not good with a scandal not being treated seriously.

1319365117868322816 2020-10-23 03:48:51 +0800 <ericaj58> @oviosu @jaketapper He started rambling. She needed to keep him on topic. Have you watched his rallies? He’s incapable of sticking to one topic. She had a timeline that she wanted to stick to, and he kept on going off topic. She was just doing her job. And she was polite.
1319363718409408512 2020-10-23 03:43:17 +0800 <ericaj58> @EricRecla @JRehling @IngrahamAngle Because they’re attacking his son. What has that got to do with being POTUS?   I can just imagine if Biden attacked Trump about Jr, or barbidoll Ivanka, or Eric?   He’d lose it.
1319363197464244224 2020-10-23 03:41:13 +0800 <ericaj58> @IngrahamAngle What did she do? How did she treat him?   She was calm and asked questions that he SHOULD be able to answer.   The fact that he thought they were “tough” tells us all how unfit he is.   He’s been POTUS for 4 years.  Worst economy, jobs, unemployment ALL ON HIM.
1319355076289335296 2020-10-23 03:08:57 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump Shouldn’t you be focussed on prepping for the debate tonight so you don’t get crushed AGAIN by Biden?   You’re asking for another four years.   PROVE you DESERVE it with FACTS.   No more LIES.

1319352248900620291 2020-10-23 02:57:43 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump You answered ALL her questions with LIES.   She CALLED you in them.   That’s not “rude, biased, or hateful”.   It’s called GOOD REPORTING.   You’re so used to @seanhannity asking you lame questions and then sitting there like a bobble head and never challenging you on your LIES.
1319351623584337920 2020-10-23 02:55:14 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump You’ve released some of the video and NOWHERE do we see Stahl being “rude, biased, or hateful”.   If you HONESTLY thought you would get softball questions like @FoxNews asks you why did you even agree to the interview?   You should KNOW AMERICANS DESERVE THE TRUTH for ONCE!

1319331833880793088 2020-10-23 01:36:35 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump Watched some of this interview.   The first think out of your mouth was “be fair”.   Then you said something about Biden getting nicer questions.   She told you the questions would be tough.   THEY ShOULD BE.   You are asking for another FOUR YEARS.   Oh, and you lied.   A LOT.
1319316366537551872 2020-10-23 00:35:08 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump @nypost So NOW MSM is ok because you think they’re helping you?   JFC.   You’re insane.

1319080560715726849 2020-10-22 08:58:07 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews As soon as you answer questions about:   Your account in China.   Your taxes.   Who do you owe 400 million to.  When did you last test negative for Covid.   Did you actually HAVE Covid.   When did you FIRST test positive for Covid.   So careful what you wish for Donny.

And speaking of perverts, how many women have accused Trump of sexual assault?   24.   One of them was 13.   You can’t pick and chose what’s fact to match your narrative.
1319026085334405120 2020-10-22 05:21:39 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump @PressSec   There’s always a video.
1319025493169991681 2020-10-22 05:19:18 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump @60Minutes Like the “chart” she produced at your interview with Chris Wallace? Where he said the US had a high mortality rate and you got pissy and asked for “her” chart??  The one that conveniently left out all the countries DOING BETTER that the US?   @PressSec is a liar. Like you.

1319023688881037312 2020-10-22 05:12:08 +0800 <ericaj58> @EricTrump @kayleighmcenany I hope they sue every one of you once @realDonaldTrump loses the election.   Your dad has falsely accused them and MSM of lying, when it’s actually HIM and @FoxNews @OANN @BrietbartNews that spread lies and conspiracy theories.   Your day will come Eric.
1319023011173859328 2020-10-22 05:09:26 +0800 <ericaj58> @EricTrump @kayleighmcenany Another sycophant bashing MSM on @realDonaldTrump instructions?   But y’all are happy to retweet @BrietbartNews and @OANN ?   She’s just proving how low the Republican Party will go.   @CNN gave your dad THOUSANDS of free media coverage before 2016. He should be thanking them.
1319021484363313152 2020-10-22 05:03:22 +0800 <ericaj58> @JasonMillerinDC Another example of @realDonaldTrump setting the bar really really low.   PS. That’s not DANCING.

Equal number of Dems vs Republicans.   That’s how it SHOULD BE.   You Republicans wouldn’t know “fair” if it hit you in the face.

There’s far too many “fake news” stories going around started by a Trumper.   You all whine about MSM LYING but NOW you want an UNVERIFIED story to be spread because it helps Trump?   JFC.

MOST people know @realDonaldTrump is a pathological liar, is corrupt, and believe that he did try and bribe Ukraine.   But the corrupt Republicans gave him a pass.
1316839506683719681 2020-10-16 04:32:58 +0800 <ericaj58> @SteveScalise Perhaps if you Republicans would stop spreading lies and misinformation there would be be an issue.   @realDonaldTrump whines incessantly about “fake news”, but it’s ok if HE retweets it?   This “story” is full of lies, and will undoubtably end up being a total fabrication.

It was up to him to be a LEADER and do more than waste 7 weeks and slap a “travel restriction” on China AFTER the virus was in the country.

1316200678105071617 2020-10-14 10:14:30 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump Ya because America has been “winning” the last 4 years.   Why would they vote for you again? You’re a DISASTER!
1316200384835198976 2020-10-14 10:13:20 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump   You know “YMCA” is sung by a bunch of gay guys right?   Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but you being against gay rights and all.....
1316196835891965952 2020-10-14 09:59:14 +0800 <ericaj58> @figuring_it I’m fine. Thanks for asking.

1316126494272311296 2020-10-14 05:19:43 +0800 <ericaj58> @RepsForBiden Maybe he meant “noble prizes”.
1316126299870486529 2020-10-14 05:18:56 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump And here we are, with the Trump camp attacking Biden for saying he was running for senate ( taken out of context) and that he got confused which state he was in.   Trump FLAT OUT SAYS CRAZY SHIT and his supporters give him a pass.   JFC.
1316125335872708608 2020-10-14 05:15:07 +0800 <ericaj58> @politvidchannel No he can’t. Because he’s ALREADY been bought.
1316124749383127041 2020-10-14 05:12:47 +0800 <ericaj58> @RepsForBiden Because he sees the greater good.   @realDonaldTrump will lose this battle. More people trust Fauci than Trump.   He’s just shooting himself in the foot every time he attacks another one of his “enemies“.

1316054769652305921 2020-10-14 00:34:42 +0800 <ericaj58> You did NOT save ANY LIVES.   That 2 million was if NOTHING was done.   No masks.   No social distancing.   No hand washing.   No lockdowns.   And Fauci RECOMMENCED ALL of it once they realized the severity of the virus.   YOU KILLED AMERICANS with your incompetence.
1316054767387308032 2020-10-14 00:34:42 +0800 <ericaj58> The political futility of Trump's offensive against Anthony Fauci  https://t.co/BZBxUvCTNT via @msnbc @realDonaldTrump   How pathetic are you that you have to attack the ONLY SMART one in the room.

He’s killed 220,000 AMERICANS with his incompetence!   He pays virtually no tax!   He’s a pathological liar, the illegitimate POSPOTUS, and has committed a multitude of crimes.   He deserves ALL the hate.

I don’t defend a man who’s proven to be the worst, most corrupt, self enriching POTUS in history.   The POTUS that has killed 220,000 Americans with his incompetence.   You know he finds his supporters disgusting right?   That’s you!
1315792690752045056 2020-10-13 07:13:18 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump @KiKiDinero4 It’s quite likely you misunderstood what they’re saying.   You have a “comprehension” issue.   Care to provide the source for your claim?

You’re attacking Biden when it’s pretty clear what he was referring to.   Glad to see you have the same standard for Trump.   Oh wait....  https://t.co/OX7UPcD8ZQ
1315787921979437056 2020-10-13 06:54:21 +0800 <ericaj58> @Right_NotLeft @JoeBiden But @realDonaldTrump boasted because he PASSED A COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT TEST.   A test that they give for people who may have DEMENTIA.   And that he got EXTRA POINTS for remembering “person, woman, man, camera, TV”. ( not true)  But sure, go ahead and attack Biden.

1315777730202333184 2020-10-13 06:13:51 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump You HAVE done these things.   And far worse.   The ONLY reason you’re still squatting in the WH is because the Republicans are just as corrupt and greedy as you are.   If Obama had done a FRACTION of what you’ve done he would have been removed.

1315709403023118337 2020-10-13 01:42:21 +0800 <ericaj58> @JohnCornyn Really? So then why are you cramming through Barrett? If it’s all supposed to be “fair” you’d be ok to wait until AFTER the election. Right?   You can pick and chose when fairness is important.

1315706412639559680 2020-10-13 01:30:28 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump The US has gone to hell since you became the POSPOTUS.   Not long until you’re kicked to the curb.   There will be a huge world wide party.

1313253091471360000 2020-10-06 07:01:50 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump The only polls that have shown you winning ARE fake polls.   You’re not out of the woods yet. “IF” you have the virus I’m sure your docs have told you to REST.   But you NEVER do what the experts tell you.   The next week will be interesting. I bet you’ll be back at the hospital.

1313224829626015744 2020-10-06 05:09:32 +0800 <ericaj58> @PressSec Hey Kayleigh, didn’t you say that @realDonaldTrump “wouldn’t let a disease like Covid into the country”?   Not only did he do EXACTLY THAT, but 215,000 Americans are DEAD, and now YOU have it.   How pissed off are you at Trump right now?

1313197662456299520 2020-10-06 03:21:35 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump The media would not say you’re “rude” if you KEEP PEOPLE SAFE.   The media and MANY AMERICANS are FURIOUS with you.   I hope that tanks your presidency.   It would be totally deserved.
1313197327251722241 2020-10-06 03:20:15 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump It was SELFISH and you put OTHER PEOPLE AT RISK.   If it’s so important that you honour your idiot supporters, make a video for them.   You say you feel better? Did you know the virus can explode at days 5-9?   Gee I sure hope that doesn’t happen to you!

He made a remarkable recovery for a 74 year old morbidly obese man with underlying conditions. Less than a week and he’s feeling “great?   Give me a break. It’s another Trump lie.   Add it to the 20,000 he’s already told.

He’s minimizing the effects of the virus, telling people to “carry on”.   There’s NO WAY if he really had it he’d be healthy enough to go home AND be feeling so good.   It’s another LIE.
1313189894538186752 2020-10-06 02:50:43 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump How many more Americans will you kill with this “message”?   How many people will not wear a mask or social distance because you’ve “played it down”?   How many of your staff have YOU infected with your incompetence? How many will DIE?   How many votes will this cost you?

1311753650046291968 2020-10-02 03:43:36 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump You were a train wreck.   Worse than the debates against Hillary.   AND SHE WON THOSE so how you figure you “won” anything except the worst debate performance in history is asinine.   #TrumpDebateDisaster
1311753018354802688 2020-10-02 03:41:05 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump How so?   Did you provide facts?   Did you articulate your successes with evidence?   Did you show “presidential behaviour”?   Did you follow the debate rules?   Were you respectful of Biden?   Did you keep on topic?   Did you keep family issues out?   Were you truthful?   NO!

1311735874984402944 2020-10-02 02:32:58 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump Another baseless claim from the toddler in chief.   Can you provide a CREDIBLE poll that says you won?   Of course you can’t!
1311735425849937920 2020-10-02 02:31:11 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump You got slaughtered.   But let’s placate you and go along with your asinine comment.   Would it hurt to add extra measures to make it more fair? Seeing as that what you’ve whined about for the last 2 weeks?   There was no “cheating” from Biden.   But you were boorish.   Bigly.

And before you say “but he severed his relationship with him” I’ll respond that Byrd also severed ties with the KKK in the 1940’s. He has says he regrets his involvement.   Has Trump said that about Epstein?

Because he spoke TO AMERICANS?   Why did he win?

They hired him because he would work hard and not play golf.   Oh wait...  They hired him because he would bring back manufacturing.   Oh wait...  Not working out so well is it?

But the Repugnants don’t play by the rules. They have to cheat to win.   Just like when @realDonaldTrump was planted by Russia. They’re getting as much as they can done until he loses in November.

1308087866300399616 2020-09-22 00:57:05 +0800 <ericaj58> @PrezDennison @EricTrump But your dad @realDonaldTrump is RESPONSIBLE for the 200,000 deaths.   But sure, attack Biden for using “million instead of thousand” in his sentence.   You are so childish it’s unbelievable.
1308081726678278145 2020-09-22 00:32:41 +0800 <ericaj58> As US death toll tops 200,000, Trump moves the goalposts (again)  https://t.co/AQdnf9gscQ via @msnbc @realDonaldTrump   The 1st giveaway that you’re lying?   That they called you “sir”?   The 2nd one?   NOBODY calls you because the US has done a HORRENDOUS job with the virus.

The one “not playing with a full deck” is you for still supporting him, he’s killed 200,000 people with his incompetence.   But he loves the poorly educated!  PS: you know he finds y’all disgusting right?

The virus will spread, they aren’t wearing masks.   He’s attacking Biden for not doing rallies because he actually CARES about the American people.   OMFG.   Stop DEFENDING HIM!  Another poorly educated Trump supporter.

Trump tells Woodward he knew the virus was deadly and highly contagious.   Then he told people “it’s under control, it will go away”.   The first one on your list is a lie BTW. He only closed travel for Chinese Nationals. And thousands had already come in.

If he was at a party and he saw a “Trump supporter “ type person, he would avoid them.   He wants their support, but wouldn’t be caught DEAD with them otherwise.

KILLED 190,000 people with incompetence.   Crashed the economy.   Divided the country.   So much Nobel Peace Prize worthiness!
1303766040803831808 2020-09-10 02:43:41 +0800 <ericaj58> @therecount @kaitlancollins The president has never lied to the American people about Covid”.   “Just like a miracle it will go away”  “15 cases will go down to zero”  “We’ve got it under control “.   Insulting the intelligence of the American people...  @realDonaldTrump.

1302678601104420864 2020-09-07 02:42:35 +0800 <ericaj58> @is_dial @sandibachom @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump That’s not the point.   He’s TELLING his supporters to harass her.   She’s entitled to use her money how she sees fit. He’s pissed off because of the article in the magazine she owns.   His behaviour shows exactly why the article is TRUE.
1302675554492006400 2020-09-07 02:30:29 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump Speaking of conmen....
1302675217433546752 2020-09-07 02:29:09 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump This story about your vile name calling towards the military is gaining momentum. More people are corroborating it. And it’s fits your known behaviour. You call EVERYONE names.   So it’s totally believable.   You can scream “fake news” all you want.   The VOTERS know the TRUTH.
1302674620022009856 2020-09-07 02:26:46 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump Says the fool that’s lied 20,000 times since he stole the election.   Every time you open your mouth you spew “disinformation”.   The MSM tells the TRUTH,  by calling them “fake news” you convince your gullible supporters that they’re lying about you.   But they’re not are they?

Just because YOU don’t care about saving lives doesn’t mean everyone else doesn’t?   There are no words left to describe your hateful and cruel behaviour.   You were raised to be a psychopath.

He admitted he does that so nobody will believe the TRUTH about him.   Y’all are the ones being brainwashed.   It’s hilarious to watch.
1302658067352313857 2020-09-07 01:21:00 +0800 <ericaj58> Despite reality, Trump said he won the popular vote 'in a true sense'  https://t.co/473N09tOFA via @msnbc @realDonaldTrump   You just can’t let it go can you?   But, your supporters accuse Dems of “not accepting the election results”.   YOU LOST THE POPULAR VOTE.   DEAL WITH IT!

1301991167647600640 2020-09-05 05:10:58 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump You’re so predictable.   If they don’t show you favourably they’re “fake news”.  If you’re good you broadcast it all over twitter.   But you cherry pick which ones you “believe”.   It’s all so laughable because Rasmussen is of course right leaning and not credible.   Loser.

1301974291878039552 2020-09-05 04:03:55 +0800 <ericaj58> Report of Trump denigrating fallen soldiers sparks quick backlash  https://t.co/iySzjr3Nhi via @msnbc @realDonaldTrump   It’s a totally believable story.   AND it’s been corroborated by several reports.   And your administration attacked Pelosi because of a HAIR CUT?

Only to find out the story is TRUE but you’ve committed some other horrific transgressions so it’s forgotten!   You’re a PATHOLOGICAL LIAR.   #TrumpHatesOurMilitary

And his lack of compassion for vets killed at war.   This behaviour is common place for him.
1301951674714484736 2020-09-05 02:34:03 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump The “total fraud” is you.   This story has been corroborated by several sources.   Add to that your behaviour towards McCain, the Gold Star family, and your refusal to condemn Putin for the bounties on American soldiers.   Let’s face it. You don’t CARE about ANYONE but YOU.

Obama did not hold as much as Trump, and he didn’t do it in his OWN courses where he was MAKING money by charging the secret service to stay there.   And that money was IRAN’S money!!!  For the love of god do some RESEARCH!! You look like an idiot spewing BS!
1301940924595855362 2020-09-05 01:51:19 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump So if it’s just like the “fake dossier” that’s NOT FAKE does that mean that this article is NOT FAKE?   You’re such a cry baby.   And sadly your supporters believe your pathological lying.
1301939776983949312 2020-09-05 01:46:46 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump Who refuted it?   YOU don’t count.   And based on how you spoke about McCain, it’s TOTALLY BELIEVABLE.
1301939493054771202 2020-09-05 01:45:38 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump Yup. People are going BACK TO WORK.   No NEW jobs.   But as usual, you’re taking credit for something that you DID NOT DO.   #TrumpIsALoser

1301577591241887744 2020-09-04 01:47:34 +0800 <ericaj58> @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Trump has “always stood for law and order”?   But he commits crimes constantly?   He encores violence?   He calls WHITE SHOOTERS PATRIOTS?   He’s TELLING VOTERS to commit a crime by voting twice?   How do you sleep at night?   You’re no Christian. You’re the devil’s accomplice.

So yes, it’s his fault because he did nothing for 7 weeks, did a half assed ban on travel from China, didn’t take I seriously, didn’t tell people to listen to their governors, and said it “would go away”.   The US is a hot mess.
