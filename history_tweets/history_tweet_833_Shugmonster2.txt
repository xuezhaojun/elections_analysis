Answer - None - also Ed there is no tunnel from UK to Canada - Complete mongo!

1340988168217255937 2020-12-21 19:51:08 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @DavidLammy What‚Äôs the root cause? It isn‚Äôt the justice system as this is the end result - why not focus on the actual problem for example why are these ‚Äúchildren‚Äù committing the crime in the first place and why disproportionately high for BAME?

1336962886569259008 2020-12-10 17:16:06 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @DavidLammy I don‚Äôt need to imagine it - YOU mastermind especially after your performance in parliament this week - schooled again!
1336962140222197760 2020-12-10 17:13:08 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @BBCBreaking Yeah of course he is - does he pay tax in Ukraine and China?
1336962049117708290 2020-12-10 17:12:46 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @Iromg @SkyNews What credibility?
1336961232662900738 2020-12-10 17:09:32 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @LeeChatfield Good - can you imagine the outcry if someone was saying this to her - another six months of taking the knee
1336961041272631296 2020-12-10 17:08:46 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @GrayInGlasgow Westminster‚Äôs fault - change the record - Scotland is a disaster

1336944853838655488 2020-12-10 16:04:27 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @kelvmackenzie Agreed - massively overrating an organization that has zero journalistic integrity
1336944567761899520 2020-12-10 16:03:18 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @bbclaurak Bye is correct - goodbye!

1330480954553593856 2020-11-22 19:59:13 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @jessphillips Focus on the problems in your party which are numerous

1328963230128103425 2020-11-18 15:28:19 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @GiftCee @SkyNews @BBCNews Exactly - being exposed constantly to a left wing agenda is going to push people right and done far right although the media‚Äôs opinion of far right is basically anyone that doesn‚Äôt agree with their left wing propaganda

1328671058065502208 2020-11-17 20:07:20 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @SkyNews The media probably spouting left wing propaganda on a continual basis

1324019124520079361 2020-11-05 00:02:13 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @talkRADIO Agree - something very fishy going on - Biden just getting enough votes and 100% of increases since counting started again

1324008870637953024 2020-11-04 23:21:28 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @RealCandaceO Absolutely - this requires much greater scrutiny as does not seem plausible - full independent audit and criminal charges brought if voter fraud identified
1324007860297191424 2020-11-04 23:17:27 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @MattMackowiak 100% - no chance - complete fix and Pelosi called it early - sham election

1323963212040122368 2020-11-04 20:20:02 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @RachaelKingsle2 Agreed and seems very odd
1323962457140977665 2020-11-04 20:17:02 +0800 <Shugmonster2> Genuine question - why does mail in vote skew towards Democrats national when in many states proportions are fairly equal between both parties

1323960736067002368 2020-11-04 20:10:12 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @benshapiro Exactly - funnily enough media blowing this up
1323960586657538049 2020-11-04 20:09:36 +0800 <Shugmonster2> If I was scrutinizing US election would be checking what proportion of mail in votes were Biden/Trump when counted late  as CNN painting this as even areas with Republican majority will lose - very fishy!
1323959947739222016 2020-11-04 20:07:04 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @Lord_Sugar @piersmorgan No he isn‚Äôt - Morgan specifically said Trump said ‚Äúbleach‚Äù and he doesn‚Äôt and Morgan then changed to he said ‚Äúdisinfectant/bleach‚Äù - watch the full clip - it‚Äôs Morgan who lied as he did at Levenson and British troops when he lost his job

1319380517603758081 2020-10-23 04:50:02 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @NazShahBfd How about these children - asking for a friend  https://t.co/LLzZ7ueaGD

1319167290508775425 2020-10-22 14:42:45 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @SkyNews They should speak to their feckless parents then - more likely to be a feckless parent!

1318808079014760454 2020-10-21 14:55:22 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @TheaDickinson This is how out of touch Labour are when pretending to be ‚Äúfor the people‚Äù - wonder why they keep losing elections
1318807193584623616 2020-10-21 14:51:51 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @BBCPolitics Just remind me who are falling behind the most in education - that‚Äôs right - ‚Äúwhite‚Äù boys

1318800261117317122 2020-10-21 14:24:19 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @WhatSheSaidHere @RishiSunak The party of envy - well educated , intelligent and sensible - 3 elements that are missing from Dodd‚Äôs and the other idiots occupying the opposition front benches where Labour will continue to exist with attitudes which replicate yours
1318799673763790848 2020-10-21 14:21:58 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @RhonddaBryant Labour have done a good job of ruining Wales all by themseleves.

1318615665658466306 2020-10-21 02:10:48 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @jeremycorbyn Once again completely out of touch - what exactly has BLM done for black people - zero tangibly but what it has done is created more division

1314288879432863744 2020-10-09 03:37:41 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @samanthamarika1 Why does she need to resort to this if Biden has a commanding lead in the polls - just tells you these polls are absolute tosh as they were In 2016 and we will see the same result hopefully

1306192178440474624 2020-09-16 19:24:17 +0800 <Shugmonster2> Mystic meg prediction - leftards like Maguire claiming Rayner schools Boris in PMQs - she is terrible as we expected! Just a rant of envy

1305757703286009856 2020-09-15 14:37:50 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @mrdanwalker @pritipatel Stick to the football punditry as Priti has just schooled you despite your constant interruptions which seems to be a BBC interviewing technique - if someone gives a counter argument to leftard narrative interrupt
1305755223202422784 2020-09-15 14:27:59 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @seanhannity @Mikecryer3 Only 28% - hopefully this will increase as the BLM appeasement continues

1305753744995385344 2020-09-15 14:22:07 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @BrexitBrit Loved the ‚Äúhumpty dumpy‚Äù reference as Blackford does look like him (slightly fatter) and thought Gove was directly insulting him (which in fact he was) - also called Blackford out for lying about NHs and Water Companies on Scotland which are outside the scope of this bill

1300832994245128193 2020-09-02 00:28:48 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @PoliticsPollss Yes just like all the idiots protesting about extinction and BLM - they have a right to protest and are not far right just because they don‚Äôt agree with leftards
1300832373349720064 2020-09-02 00:26:20 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @PippaCrerar Another moronic tweet from an alleged ‚Äújournalist‚Äù

1300827437572464644 2020-09-02 00:06:43 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @SpeechUnion @magicdmw @RadoTylecote @epkaufm @jowilliams293 Because they are run by left wing activists

1300736152765370368 2020-09-01 18:03:59 +0800 <Shugmonster2> Trump hating on #JeremyVine he will win because opposition is terrible and majority don‚Äôt want liberal governments in power - law and order will win it for him as democrat states have let people run riot (literally)

1300705384026472448 2020-09-01 16:01:44 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @MahyarTousi Only likes 1 way shouting via megaphone rather than debate where her divisive ideology would be exposed
1300690726326599681 2020-09-01 15:03:29 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @SkyNews What a pointless poll - spend time on something of actual use - bit like corbyns political career - pointless
1300689929505320970 2020-09-01 15:00:19 +0800 <Shugmonster2> @DVATW Support for BLM has fizzled out - move on
