1344068050803453952 2020-12-30 07:49:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @PamelaCahill6 Good one 😂😂
1344067919349764096 2020-12-30 07:48:58 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DeeCarra I'm blocked too. Was she one of those attention seekers who posted videos of people in the city centre during the outdoor dining restrictions? Those types even blocked people for clicking like on others comments 😂
1344056089302724608 2020-12-30 07:01:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Cop4Carla 😂😂
1344046499051794432 2020-12-30 06:23:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @UsockRich That's so hard, hope things improve for you and your business ASAP. You've got a very positive attitude for someone affected so much. Wishing you the best.
1344043178899492864 2020-12-30 06:10:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Dublin45078537 Congratulations 😊 That will be so nice, something positive to look forward to.
1344042647569182726 2020-12-30 06:08:32 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @fredd111 That would be great, hopfully live music will resume. Missing gigs a lot.
1344042269540757504 2020-12-30 06:07:02 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @UsockRich I hope so, I need my job back. 10 months salary gone has had quite a big impact on life for my family and mental health. Debt mounting. I'll be much longer than a year out of work by the looks of what's ahead, possible the company might close.
1344036378590515200 2020-12-30 05:43:38 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @NikeEire @I_Will_Always_B I wish I was watching that again for the very first time 😊 I watched it twice. I need something this good again 😕
1344035689256656896 2020-12-30 05:40:53 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 That will be perfect, keep you busy. Good luck with it 😊
1344035460956434432 2020-12-30 05:39:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Haha sounds like the perfect year ahead 😂
1344035232408887297 2020-12-30 05:39:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @irish_racer That would come in handy for the lockdowns 😂 Hope you get it.
1344034796486451200 2020-12-30 05:37:21 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @BrianBo98399809 I've a trip booked mid-May. What will we do if they insist on vaccinations or paying for Covid tests? 4 of us would be expensive. Hope it does go ahead and for yourself too.
1344034324807626753 2020-12-30 05:35:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @UsockRich That's not a guarantee either though 🙂 Would like the opportunity to 'live' it and work rather than the current existence.
1344033206027358210 2020-12-30 05:31:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Has anyone got anything guaranteed to go ahead to look forward to in 2021? I need some hope that it will be a better year 😊
1344030119137046529 2020-12-30 05:18:45 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Nimmermaximum @ih8evrybdy We need more Niamhs 👍🙂 If more people could think critically and applied logic we would not be in this situation.
1344016232585027585 2020-12-30 04:23:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dixieburns8118 @Allycon3 Well rid both of you, he's nauseating.
1343995693237743617 2020-12-30 03:01:58 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 Have a good one 🥂
1343995220246081541 2020-12-30 03:00:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 Busiest day yet time for selfies 🙄
1343986435448315909 2020-12-30 02:25:10 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Brianne14437909 Coming months? Coming years more like this isn't going anywhere that soon 😳
1343986198042259457 2020-12-30 02:24:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JohnLac36728740 Hoping so John. Its going to take until August to cover vaccinating the vulnerable so I imagine 2021 will be quite similar to this year. It's sad to think 2 years of our lives are dictated by this but hopefully it's no longer.
1343978824434921476 2020-12-30 01:54:56 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @SaraHaboubi1 Good call, I started doing that months ago, not worth the headache!
1343978150930362368 2020-12-30 01:52:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @petertk992 Good question. Dragging the bejaysus out of it. They have said so many things which never transpired.
1343972155646742529 2020-12-30 01:28:26 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @HealthFreedomIE Why has she gone against the advice of the manufacturers that it is not advised in pregnancy? This is concerning as other pregnant women will follow suit and nobody knows the effects on the unborn child.
1343963861750321152 2020-12-30 00:55:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @case7877 Surely as we enter the second year of this more people will start to get angry and fight against it? Or is it a case of Stockholm Syndrome with them at this stage...
1343963272979095553 2020-12-30 00:53:08 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @EoinRMccarthy1 That's true. Trying my best, it would be easier to ignore if I could go to work.
1343962818287165442 2020-12-30 00:51:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Logicumdictatu1 It's looking that way... 😕
1343962699911331841 2020-12-30 00:50:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @SwichSaucisson Hopefully but we were told something along those lines before and we've essentially never came out of some form of lockdown. It's really hard to deal with now.
1343962079116615681 2020-12-30 00:48:23 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Rose35543028 @Ckpainters69 No hair will be done until March 😂 Best to just shave it off 🤣🤣😁
1343961832592175104 2020-12-30 00:47:25 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @case7877 It doesn't look like they are going to change the methods used any time soon. They would have to admit it wasn't exactly fit for purpose. Maybe when the vulnerable have the vaccine they might reassess how to handle it but I don't see any way out of this loop they have us in.
1343960937800355847 2020-12-30 00:43:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Rose35543028 @Ckpainters69 They initially said January 12th - as if 🤣🤣🤣🤣 This will go on months no doubt 😡
1343960463114174473 2020-12-30 00:41:58 +0800 <Sabdublindr> If this vaccine does not prevent a person from contracting Covid or transmitting to others are we not still essentially screwed? It potentially helps the body fight the infection but won't they still use lockdowns to prevent the spread? I hope it is the way out but can't see it.
1343958366989791233 2020-12-30 00:33:38 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 I thought the same 😡
1343690782306430976 2020-12-29 06:50:21 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @GeorgeyByron Will get a copy, thanks 😊
1343681920199241729 2020-12-29 06:15:08 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Sense finally. Long may it last.
1343668077947449344 2020-12-29 05:20:08 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @GeorgeyByron It's a whole new language to me. Need to brush up on those skills 😂
1343666564806156300 2020-12-29 05:14:07 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @PaddyCaseyMusic Very faded Ticketmaster print but my first gig of yours, Whelans 15th of October 1999. A whole €6.50 a ticket including booking fee!  https://t.co/BISAaUpe4b
1343659200061329409 2020-12-29 04:44:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @EdwinAmbrose11 That's true. Ozark starts out quite slow but the script is quite good.
1343656051707666434 2020-12-29 04:32:21 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @EdwinAmbrose11 @JohnKav1 Also found Ozark quite good, I hadn't seen it before this year.
1343655668797108226 2020-12-29 04:30:50 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @EdwinAmbrose11 I think its getting better? I'm a few episodes into Season 3.
1343654847422341126 2020-12-29 04:27:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JohnKav1 I did too, the theme tune to Succession is amazing too. Can't wait for the next season, the last episode was brilliant.
1343654505561415685 2020-12-29 04:26:12 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 Soundtrack is pretty great too ☺️
1343654331766202368 2020-12-29 04:25:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 Couple of episodes into season 3. That scene was good, typical mobile phones out filming the whole lot! I love his one liners. Paul Giamatti is also one of my favourite actors.
1343653186754764803 2020-12-29 04:20:58 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Anyone else watch Billions? I seriously need to brush up on stock broking for dummies but I want to be Axelrod 😊
1343637734984798208 2020-12-29 03:19:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Many a head split open sliding off those straight onto tarmac 😂
1343629565139296258 2020-12-29 02:47:06 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MarcasSuibhne We were lucky to have strong mothers. I work with people from disadvantaged areas now (when we aren't in lockdown) &amp; they are some of the best people &amp; have a great work ethic once given the chance. Opportunities are there for most who want to take them.
1343626237655322635 2020-12-29 02:33:53 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MarcasSuibhne True, I was too. Single parent family in the early 80s seemed hard at the time. But my mother returned to work when she could and I was lucky she encouraged me to work and go through the college system....Still trying to make a few quid though, but it could be worse 😊
1343615451167862787 2020-12-29 01:51:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 @Ckpainters69 Totally agree. I think they ate the head off me before even though I agree we should not be going through all of this. Feck that s*it! We get conspiracy theorist grief due to these types of accounts. Logic only please 💪 and a drink 😀😂
1343614789914918919 2020-12-29 01:48:23 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 This is why we get accused of being conspiracy theorists! Does more harm than good. If, by any chance it is true, the source should be given rather than hear say 😊
1343613375587233797 2020-12-29 01:42:46 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Don't be, you questioned it from the start as I did. Where are people getting this information from?
1343611796566003716 2020-12-29 01:36:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 This is a bit far fetched. The doctor would have to be sending 4666 people for testing in this case. Average family of 4 so 1166 full families. While there's many crazy things going on I think even contact tracing would question this.
1343573909204041728 2020-12-28 23:05:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Nimmermaximum If only more people could see this. I tell my children daily that none of this is normal and will have to pass. They are only 3 and 5 but I think it's important that they hear that it shouldn't be accepted as normal.
1343572643451166730 2020-12-28 23:00:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Mountai61137001 He should have been a solo artist and called himself The Mega Bollix. More fitting.
1343571807950004226 2020-12-28 22:57:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies I'm the same. My husband said 23,000 were tested in a single day here in the days before Christmas? Who are all these people getting tested?? So strange.
1343562712274636800 2020-12-28 22:21:27 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies Totally like that then swiftly shown the door. Now they would have a whole family sent for Covid tests if we said one of us had a sniffle. Money straight in the pocket for them.
1343558065845633024 2020-12-28 22:02:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies We would get the slow shake of the head and eyes rolled at us for anything viral.
1343533903483711490 2020-12-28 20:26:58 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir @Ckpainters69 There it is! 😊👍
1343533246315966465 2020-12-28 20:24:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 That is true, the HSE letter with the details on the fees for the doctors was published. They also got large bonuses for the flu vaccines. It's all crazy and worse still, it's us and our children who will have to pay for all this in future taxes.
1343321711807225856 2020-12-28 06:23:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @simodoho 😂😂 Jim 'what a-boot ya' McDonald 🤣🤣

1343312948593352706 2020-12-28 05:48:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AaronOBrien78 @Nimmermaximum It's a classic!
1343268285719191558 2020-12-28 02:51:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 The positive and negative controls? They would be ran to ensure the method is working correctly. Positive should read positive and negative come out negative. If they didn't they would know there is something wrong with the method.
1343211322268385281 2020-12-27 23:05:09 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MarcasSuibhne He will do a Lazarus by New Year's Day. We should take bets 😊

1342974253382172672 2020-12-27 07:23:07 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies Nope, and I was sent an email to say I've to re-schedule the date I changed the booking to in January. I think this will be my 5th time to change the date!! I can't cancel it, don't even know how far to forward it to so its not cancelled again?! It's a joke.
1342967874491731968 2020-12-27 06:57:47 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies Quite a good cast, I'm not mad on Sarah Jessica Parker but she's good in the role. It's a nice one at Christmas 🎄  https://t.co/7IM1Po0fpk
1342965918025068545 2020-12-27 06:50:00 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies I watched it twice, I also like The Family Stone as cheesy as it is 😂

1342958306638393344 2020-12-27 06:19:45 +0800 <Sabdublindr> 20kg x 2 that is. 25kg is the max weight to be lifted by one person so no reason for this orchestration.
1342957114709463041 2020-12-27 06:15:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 @Hilda15243808 @paulreiddublin @HSELive A forklift driver would never have to be directed in by someone like that when there's nothing else around. The boxes are 40kg. Could have been bright in by hand one by one or with a hand operated pallet truck, no need for a forklift. All for the cameras is right.
1342951678203621376 2020-12-27 05:53:25 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @suzy661 @Ryanair I know he's not widely liked but his airline has afforded many families European travel that they may never have had otherwise. This is low though, very manipulative 😞
1342950439730491393 2020-12-27 05:48:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Ethics seem to have gone out the window...

The scene in the tea rooms where they order the 'finest wine available to humanity' and the Camberwell Carrot spliff 😂😂 Oh and when he shouts 'scrubbers' out the car window, so simple but so brilliant. Classic 👌😊
1342927376716607490 2020-12-27 04:16:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Nimmermaximum Also Withnail and I. One of my favourite films ever, it's on tonight at 11.30pm. Don't think I'll be able to stay awake that long though.
1342926544893849602 2020-12-27 04:13:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Geniusguy10 Lovely, hope they are going down nicely, cheers!
1342925212396957696 2020-12-27 04:08:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Nimmermaximum Trading Places.
1342916210225270784 2020-12-27 03:32:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Escape to the country. St Stephens Day in Portumna, there's a storm brewing out there. Hope everyone has had a nice Christmas despite the circumstances 🥂  https://t.co/uUoausQXeH
1342570488346914819 2020-12-26 04:38:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Angemitch78 Fair play, enjoy. Happy Christmas 🎉🎄
1342563075740860418 2020-12-26 04:09:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 I have it taped, too much commotion to sit down and watch so I'm saving it!

1342519522264281090 2020-12-26 01:16:11 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 😂😂😂😂 Could have done without seeing that right after my dinner though 😂😂😂😂😂
1342519094759862275 2020-12-26 01:14:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo Happy Christmas Damien, I appreciate all of your posts especially your photographs which are nostalgic and a welcomed break from Covid conversation. Hopefully 2021 brings life and employment back to those places. Have a good one 🍻
1342480154539528192 2020-12-25 22:39:45 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies Happy Christmas, hope you're having a good one. Cheers 🥂

1342248376264482820 2020-12-25 07:18:45 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MarcasSuibhne Aww man 😔 My husband is a bus driver though, I can assure you they've likely seen worse. Many many stories like this and beyond 😳 Happy Christmas 🎄
1342246714032480257 2020-12-25 07:12:09 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @KeithMillsD7 The sales appear to have started in Dublin City Centre anyway. Happy Christmas and hope you get some bargains 😊

1341805914517614592 2020-12-24 02:00:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @Ckpainters69 It's all a tactic, right before lockdown announcements. People with no symptoms need to stop going for tests.
1341742668624310275 2020-12-23 21:49:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 Brilliant 😊🎁
1341734289935917060 2020-12-23 21:15:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @rtenews Will they be eating Christmas Dinner alone in their bedrooms then like the public have been told?! 😂
1341733745490014208 2020-12-23 21:13:47 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 @CcoHse Just when you think you've heard it all 😁

1341564788393054211 2020-12-23 10:02:25 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @paulreiddublin @HSELive Alright for you on your salary. What about those of us unemployed for 9 months and counting? Our outgoings are based on our salaries. Families are in huge debt as a result. The public don't need your scaremongering and patronising.
1341562098330071040 2020-12-23 09:51:43 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Zippy03786768 It's too much, if it wasn't for the media life would have just went on... A break is good call, its draining.
1341517221256966146 2020-12-23 06:53:24 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @RachelLavin How can you factor pregnant women and children in when the vaccine is not recommended for those groups?
1341513683306987520 2020-12-23 06:39:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ancailinban I don't do '-ism's' I just hate everyone equally 🤗
1341512721309847558 2020-12-23 06:35:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ancailinban This is seriously one of the most idiotic things I've ever seen, every single word of it.
1341500896472162304 2020-12-23 05:48:32 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dclarke1984 I totally agree. It's hard to belive the foolishness. That comment has actually upset me, basically accusing restaurant workers trying to earn a living of killing people. The damage being done to society is unbelievable.
1341498795561988101 2020-12-23 05:40:11 +0800 <Sabdublindr> A disgusting accusation towards restaurants with zero evidence or scientific back up. Government, NPHET and media successfully warping people with their scaremongering. Shameful.
1341498217591169024 2020-12-23 05:37:53 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ColmMKeogh @mistereatgalway @CMOIreland  https://t.co/oyKLlC4tUj

Can you provide evidence for this because the scientific data from the HSE shows the exact opposite. This is an awful accusation towards restaurants.
1341497573820002306 2020-12-23 05:35:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @mistereatgalway @CMOIreland So sorry JP, I work for a supplier to the hospitality sector so feel the same. Hoping that 2021 is better for our industry.
1341496937774723074 2020-12-23 05:32:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 Were you shopping? Good trip? I rescheduled to January from early December and yet again have to reschedule, for the FIFTH time 🙄
1341493964231290882 2020-12-23 05:20:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 People need to stop going along with it. That is insanity.
1341491261484765185 2020-12-23 05:10:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @SWso155 @erinstephanie84 Going to a few shops and for lunch has been like planning a day trip! Very off putting.
1341485107220262912 2020-12-23 04:45:47 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Shaggy51723126 You're not alone, believe in yourself despite the madness. Wishing you well, stay strong 💪
1341483493507928068 2020-12-23 04:39:23 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DublinMuppet @Independent_ie 😂😂😂😂
1341483378147811330 2020-12-23 04:38:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JiminROI Yes, sure weren't the majority of bank holidays in lockdown this year. The same lies ahead for 2021 I imagine. No fun to be had!
1341453389541109763 2020-12-23 02:39:45 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @colin_mac_hale I hadn't thought of that. Yes, you'll be right on that one.
1341448029799329792 2020-12-23 02:18:27 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Zero yesterday, 13 today. Perfect timing for us to accept our lockdown fate 🙄
1341443730562293761 2020-12-23 02:01:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @erinstephanie84 I think it depends where you're going and constantly changing. No point in me checking til near the time, I'll only put myself in bad form 😊
1341441921525436418 2020-12-23 01:54:11 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @erinstephanie84 Booked for May. Hoping so but don't want to have or pay for Covid tests for 4 of us either.
1341441694177353733 2020-12-23 01:53:17 +0800 <Sabdublindr> True.
1341440768767090691 2020-12-23 01:49:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @milly_bar No. I said the test is not sufficient. The lockdowns are disproportionate. This is certainly not normal is it? 😂
1341440377300148229 2020-12-23 01:48:03 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 The odd family holiday is nice too. Will we see that in 2021? I hope so. Overall just miss being able to do things randomly without planning ahead.
1341437407984533506 2020-12-23 01:36:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @nordyteacher @mariaj0718 @DaveyDonn Thanks for that, hopefully some sort of normality might resume thereafter.
1341433507269230594 2020-12-23 01:20:45 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Niallmo90037344 That there was too many people who refused the vaccine &amp; they can't let us risk it &amp; end up with 'long covid' or we might have underlying conditions that we aren't aware of and die anyway? I imagine they will come up with some excuse for sure, we can count on that.
1341432738239406089 2020-12-23 01:17:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @pdaly83 @DaveyDonn 😂😂 You're right. They will get their 2020 Covid themed Christmas decorations out every year and look back with fond memories. I can't wait to look back and for this just to be a distant faded memory.
1341430849938595844 2020-12-23 01:10:11 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DaveyDonn Hoping so Davey, really hope that's the case. We need to actually 'live' after a year of this.
1341428843312246786 2020-12-23 01:02:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Predictions?: Lockdown until February, open for a few weeks, back into lockdown for St Patricks day &amp; a repeat of 2020?  This is 2 important years of our lives &amp; livelihoods being robbed at this stage for 'cases' based on an unsuitable 45 cycle PCR method.
1341426896886706177 2020-12-23 00:54:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @luxury_driven @anthonyremedy @NoelAnderson_ After St Patricks day though, they aren't going to let that go ahead 😔
1341426351019048961 2020-12-23 00:52:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Patrick31178355 I don't either but it comes through on my news feed on here. Going to log off for a few days 😊
1341425284164317185 2020-12-23 00:48:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Patrick31178355 But funny how we tune in. Its like a car crash you just have to look 🤷‍♀️
1341424753135988739 2020-12-23 00:45:58 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Stevesearcher @kasiaforest @leannemac4 @ine16840704 @Angemitch78 @gerrywebster @IrishHughQ1 @CitizenIre @CatrionaColllns Lockdown into February at least. Reopen for a few weeks, back into lockdown for St Patricks day and then a repeat of 2020. Feels like we are reading from a script.
1341423268851494913 2020-12-23 00:40:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @PadraigPravda @rtenews Don't forget the long Coviders. A long term excuse for hypochondriacs, they must be delighted with themselves.
1341421945544425474 2020-12-23 00:34:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @allyd19781978 @M4ttmc87 I'm the same Alexandria, it's not worth wasting your energy and getting abused by them. They are a lost cause 😊
1341421080066572293 2020-12-23 00:31:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @PadraigPravda @rtenews Absolutely, who are going for these tests?? The same people running for tests are giving out about it. This is madness.
1341410650208280582 2020-12-22 23:49:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 @CMOIreland It's dreadful, sorry to hear that 😔
1341384995781423105 2020-12-22 22:07:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @rvjcallanan I agree. When will it end? There's no end in sight at all.
1341380302657228800 2020-12-22 21:49:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 @Aoifs123 And then for the May and June bank holidays. They will copy 2020.
1341379925543165956 2020-12-22 21:47:50 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @MichealLehane @rtenews Sadly yes. Plenty of 🐂💩 merchants out there buying it.
1341377457623097345 2020-12-22 21:38:02 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Absolutely agree with this.
1341377148699983874 2020-12-22 21:36:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Thousands of people out of work again Christmas eve and what's the bets they will have issues with their PUP payments being processed as the welfare offices will be closed quite a few days of the coming week. Happy Christmas eh?!
1341368804195053569 2020-12-22 21:03:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Toibin1 Thank you Peadar for speaking on the Niall Boylan show. You are one of so few that we the public have who are actually speaking sense. Wishing your family a Happy Christmas.
1341341850142208006 2020-12-22 19:16:32 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Elizabe69238589 @ih8evrybdy All of the above 😂👍
1341160929585717248 2020-12-22 07:17:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @devlingirl @Niall_Boylan They removed their business supports so they were forced to reopen. A restaurant owner in Cork posted that. It's all so unfair.
1341155332006031361 2020-12-22 06:55:23 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AudreyMulcahy Could end up being a long two years with the way they are dealing with this.
1341121566663434243 2020-12-22 04:41:12 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 @CMOIreland Hold out on buying the turkey until you know you're 'allowed' celebrate Christmas! 😁
1341120505705869318 2020-12-22 04:37:00 +0800 <Sabdublindr> This is so heartwarming of Gwen Layden. Many a weekend spent in the Georges Street Arcade buying CDs and records. The days when my main concern was saving up for albums and concert tickets. Now look at the stress we are under 😔
1341107191651168258 2020-12-22 03:44:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 @BarnabrowHouse I know, I hate them too but you did the right thing for your little one. Next Christmas you might look back and the masks will be a memory (I hope!). You all look great.
1341104299842134017 2020-12-22 03:32:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 @BarnabrowHouse Gorgeous 😍🎄🎅
1341097423612092422 2020-12-22 03:05:16 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AudreyMulcahy I would have said June. The figures in the summer were low. We could have eased out of lockdowns then. Very little of their roadmap actually went to plan, we were told we only needed to flatten the curve of death rate which then morphed into positives from an insufficient test.
1341095837263409152 2020-12-22 02:58:58 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dixieburns8118 @rtenews @CillianDeGascun I'll join you on that. Enough now.
1341093500910235649 2020-12-22 02:49:41 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @GrahamOhare 'My brain hurts a lot'...
1341093070998298624 2020-12-22 02:47:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> David Bowies 'Five Years' lyrics are so fitting for 2020. Brilliant song.
1341086332316246016 2020-12-22 02:21:12 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 Russell Brand?
1341077207574323200 2020-12-22 01:44:56 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AudreyMulcahy I was looking forward to the new year but the news the last few weeks has me feeling fearful of a repeat of 2020. In that case there is nothing to look forward to, another year of sitting at home &amp; walking around parks, hope I'm wrong.
1341053558167375872 2020-12-22 00:10:58 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MummySmiler Yes, my head hurts right now from it 😂 She's 5 and hasn't stopped talking since she learned how to 😊

1341044058161115137 2020-12-21 23:33:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 Aww no, hope it arrives! Could you print a picture of what it is and give it to the person? I know its not the same, I had to do it before so they know its on the way!
1340995681641779200 2020-12-21 20:20:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DaveyDonn It's very hard, I'm in an apartment too, tired of the same walls and missing travel. Fingers crossed 2021 is better.
1340990356909912066 2020-12-21 19:59:50 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Awful.
1340990224764121089 2020-12-21 19:59:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DaveyDonn That's great, hope you're not suffering with the lockdowns. It just feels very odd not working when I have always done. I didn't even get to take my full maternity leave 🤣
1340983359439298560 2020-12-21 19:32:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JohnDee63999880 You're on a roll with the blocks John!!

1340981998203092992 2020-12-21 19:26:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DaveyDonn Missing those days now, my qualifications are pretty much worthless until hospitality reopens. Hopefully 2021 will be a better year gut I'm sceptical 😊
1340978748758351872 2020-12-21 19:13:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DaveyDonn @MarcasSuibhne @labour The end of an era. I was 11 years in DIT in total, undergrad, postgrad then post doc. Great years looking back, so much hope compared to now🤷‍♀️

1340938439081013253 2020-12-21 16:33:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @CMOIreland overstepping the mark yet again. This man needs to go.
1340796545340493824 2020-12-21 07:09:41 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @BazPantz @CorkCoypu Garlic cheese chips straight from the tray 😁 Supermacs is Irish, they do a decent one, hopefully we're safe ☺️
1340789748055625730 2020-12-21 06:42:41 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @CorkCoypu Worried about your chipper chips? 😁
1340789341665308672 2020-12-21 06:41:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> 2020, the year I learned that 2 + 2 = whatever 'they' want it to be.  The year logic, statistics &amp; science could be manipulated &amp; misinterpreted to extremes but yet willingly accepted by the masses. The data does not back up the measures being enforced on us #disproportionate
1340785767086481408 2020-12-21 06:26:52 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @RobCross247 I can smell the turf just looking at this picture. Excellent work Rob.
1340781659944329216 2020-12-21 06:10:32 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 They stopped telling us when and the age of the people who have died months ago. Recoveries also not reported. 🐎💩
1340768780465688576 2020-12-21 05:19:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AudreyMulcahy It feels scripted at this stage. Back in lockdown in the days after Christmas.
1340766911991328773 2020-12-21 05:11:56 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ben_Scallan I know someone who worked with him. He has his bike in the back of his vehicle, parks up and cycles the final bit of his journey to make himself look like a 'green' cyclist. Hypocracy.

1340737283608162304 2020-12-21 03:14:12 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @GameOnClimate @dclarke1984 @mistereatgalway @MichealMartinTD @LeoVaradkar @1Hildegarde @EamonRyan @eamonocuiv @AnneRabbitte It's not 'faked'. They are misinterpreting it to fit their agenda. They have made statements which no evidence backs up such as that of the hospitality sector. The data says otherwise. The case number is however greatly overestimated due to running the PCR test at 45 cycles.
1340733326357901314 2020-12-21 02:58:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @BackKevs I want pals like that!! Enjoy 🍻🎄
1340708367166259202 2020-12-21 01:19:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 I pity anyone working short term in the UK who will essentially be trapped there. What is going on?? 😖
1340706825184927748 2020-12-21 01:13:10 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ni_ceitinn I hope they find a way to resume it. I buy from a few places that don't post to Ireland including the Craft Gin Club, it was one of the only good things this year 😣🤣🤣
1340692835163643905 2020-12-21 00:17:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 @LVADublinPubs @CMOIreland He's out of his depth. The only way thinks he can make it look like he's being pro-active is closing the hospitality sector repeatedly. I don't trust him at all.
1340679162638589953 2020-12-20 23:23:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Anyone who uses Parcel Motel for deliveries from the UK. They will no longer be accepting deliveries after December 28th so you can no longer use your virtual UK address. Such a shame, it was a great service. I hope they can resume at a future date. This year has been rubbish 😣
1340675691264806919 2020-12-20 23:09:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MickO_Keeffe @LeoVaradkar This year has just been a series of bullshits, one bullshit after another. Sorry for my language its just hideous at this stage and getting worse daily.
1340665650851815424 2020-12-20 22:29:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> If there are no outbreaks associated with restaurants/gastro pubs and zero deaths either how will avoiding them save lives?! Logic greatly missing.
1340665134822416384 2020-12-20 22:27:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @GameOnClimate @mistereatgalway @MichealMartinTD @LeoVaradkar @1Hildegarde @EamonRyan @eamonocuiv @AnneRabbitte No it won't as no outbreaks are associated with them. There have been zero deaths associated with the hospitality sector. You are way off there.

The hospitality sector are being disproportionately affected and very few, like yourself care about those people.

The data does tell us that. Closing hospitality will force people to have house parties where outbreaks ARE occurring as the data shows. Its counterproductive and disproportionate.
1340656444744589313 2020-12-20 21:52:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LVADublinPubs @CMOIreland Exactly. The data from the HSE clearly shows that the hospitality sector has not contributed to recent outbreaks and that private houses have led to the highest level of cases. Closing hospitality will only increase house parties so is counterproductive.  https://t.co/OqEmuH7F5n

1340041013419753479 2020-12-19 05:07:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @niall1405 No idea, but I think it's recent, the same Christmas tree was in the background behind each guest in the ad. Could be pre-recorded to keep the guests staggered through the day?
1340040484400599040 2020-12-19 05:05:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @shaythered07 I didn't see it, that's why I said that 'I know of'. I haven't been glued to RTE. I just heard he's doing his own appearance tonight.

1340019706837807110 2020-12-19 03:42:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AudreyMulcahy Exactly, whenever we used to look up to the Gravity Bar it was always full. The streets filled with tourists heading off with their bags of gift shop purchases. The same with Kilmainham Gaol the other side of us. Looking forward to seeing tourism resume, it is lonely really.
1340007348560162822 2020-12-19 02:53:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LazyGaga10 I've been living up the road from the Harbour Bar for 20 years and never once went in. Been in most other pubs in Dublin 8 so must go in soon tick it off the list 😊 Yes, some lovely locals, lots of great characters.
1339994157285339137 2020-12-19 02:01:17 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ClareKx2018 @rtenews You need a lesson in anger management and how to speak without abusive language. You're language is constantly disgusting. Vile.
1339993035946549249 2020-12-19 01:56:50 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Marydcs1Barry It's a side entrance but the Storehouse is also quite empty compared to normal.
1339991673326215174 2020-12-19 01:51:25 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AllPeopleAllNa1 Yes indeed. I worked for Diageo for a couple of years in the lab. The contracts are good but mostly short term so not a guaranteed job for life as they were. I still see the elderly use the health centre who would have had health care for life.

1339850119173320704 2020-12-18 16:28:56 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @maps_777 The younger generation are just completely oblivious to the fact that not all of society are on twitter etc. Even if you are it's easy to miss notifications. It probably works to their advantage to shut voices out.
1339832703106093057 2020-12-18 15:19:43 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @maps_777 I feel exactly the same, don't know what lies ahead. Hopefully the vaccine works for the vulnerable but I think masks will be with us for a long time. Wish it all never happened 🙁
1339687917946548224 2020-12-18 05:44:24 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @CharlesOReilly2 The HSE have tabulated this information.

1339679439295287297 2020-12-18 05:10:43 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @suzy661 @Ryanair That's so annoying. I had a booking for early December that they cancelled months beforehand and the refund was straight forward.  Sorry you are having such trouble.
1339675741496238081 2020-12-18 04:56:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @suzy661 @Ryanair Have you tried a payment dispute with the method you paid with? You can do it through the bank or PayPal to try claim the funds back.

1339618187411906560 2020-12-18 01:07:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy That is truly disgusting.
1339582570837680130 2020-12-17 22:45:47 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 She keeps campaigning for 5 year old children and up to be masked. How could a 5 year old spend 5 hours a day masked. So cruel, that's not someone who cares about others.
1339580195401920512 2020-12-17 22:36:21 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 She is the absolute worst Matt. Boarding on sociopath.

1339534010582790145 2020-12-17 19:32:50 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 Why they aren't being challenged more over this I do not know. So do you think they will try stop the travel being permitted from December 18th?!
1339532942536749056 2020-12-17 19:28:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 It's unbelievable. The money they are wasting testing people with zero systems could have been used to improve hospital capacity.

You download an app and buy what looks like scratch cards that you scratch off &amp; smell. You put your answer into the app &amp; if you don't get them right or even mix up smells you're told to book a Covid test! Madness.
1339315887044759554 2020-12-17 05:06:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy @CKee09120569 I can't wait til this is over and they realise how hysterical they were.
1339305191607300096 2020-12-17 04:23:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy Yes. I had a visit from our environmental health officer in work this week. She is petrified and following all of the guidelines and advice from our master Luke O Neill 😂 I couldn't believe what I was witnessing when she told me, she was always so logical.
1339304663464767490 2020-12-17 04:21:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LVADublinPubs Did you get any positive feedback for the hospitality sector in general? I hope 2021 is not a repeat of this year. I work for a supplier to the hospitality sector, hoping the best for everyone.
1339303476497698818 2020-12-17 04:16:46 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MiguelBain8 Exactly, without the ordeal of it. To book something and know it will happen. I just want the basics back.
1339303105570148352 2020-12-17 04:15:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AudreyMulcahy No I've not heard of Dr Madej. I'll look it up thanks. Can't believe what is happening.
1339296229180776452 2020-12-17 03:47:58 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Way831 It's all getting too much, nearly a year of this. I need a break!!
1339290285453533186 2020-12-17 03:24:21 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @PaddyOReilly4 @Ckpainters69 Yes, I need my job back and the normal things at home then I can worry about going away! 😊 Everything is just an ordeal right now.
1339284035202396161 2020-12-17 02:59:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Tomscollins They won't let us give up the social distancing because there won't be enough people getting it to know who is who! This time next year I imagine we will still have the masks and distancing in place. Its going nowhere, vaccine or no vaccine.
1339283545760681984 2020-12-17 02:57:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 I've a trip booked for May, postponed from May 2020. Don't even know if we'll make it, imagine a year on still not having any certainty 😔 I really need a break away though, I imagine you're the same working all year.
1339280306856144896 2020-12-17 02:44:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @RemyMartin_Q I hope so, I really do. I miss everything that we had, everything we do now is an ordeal.
1339279805217431553 2020-12-17 02:42:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Eisdus Definitely not, thank you. Just feeling very trapped and wanted to give my children more in life than this. There is so little I can do with them right now, I feel robbed of a year.
1339277221333241860 2020-12-17 02:32:26 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dclarke1984 @Coreygreene04 @rtenews @NormaFoleyTD1 This petition has been doing the rounds for weeks and it's not even at 200 signatures! It looks like the people pushing it need as much schooling as possible. Keep the schools open over Christmas 😂😂
1339275002965790723 2020-12-17 02:23:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JenDesNor How long will it take? We are looking at another year of no travel or having to pay for a Covid test, families just won't afford that on top of travel costs. I think they know people will be coaxed into compliance. People are going to go crazy a 2nd year of sitting at home.
1339272972008366080 2020-12-17 02:15:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Alanmc1885 @BusConnects Thanks, I hope so.
1339272516934787084 2020-12-17 02:13:45 +0800 <Sabdublindr> I am extremely sceptical of this new vaccine but I desperately don't want a life with no travel and endless restrictions. I still can't process that all of this is really happening 😔
1339270428989284360 2020-12-17 02:05:27 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Alanmc1885 @BusConnects Hopefully they address these issues and resolve it before making any changes. I think quite a few residents emailed with their concerns. I don't know why but this has me extremely stressed out!!
1339265070614908928 2020-12-17 01:44:09 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Alanmc1885 It seems to be the plan to deter people from entering the area but we have no option. If I didn't live on Bow Lane I would never enter it, there's certain times of day I just can't go out because of traffic backed up. There's often full on arguments on the lane between drivers!
1339259983796559875 2020-12-17 01:23:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Alanmc1885 @D8From @Pidge @BusConnects @DaithiDoolan Good question. This is really stressful as a resident what will lie ahead for us, traffic has got very bad in the past year as it is.
1339236798665461761 2020-12-16 23:51:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 Other articles say that's her grandson but even the daughter looks young, hard to tell with the mask!
1339236176180486145 2020-12-16 23:49:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @CreavenLynda That's meant to be her grandson but even the daughter looks very young.
1339142448820457473 2020-12-16 17:36:54 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Pidge @D8From @Maldesu @BusConnects I don't know how cars haven't hit one another. They have to crawl past within inches of each another. Although I have seen plenty of wing mirrors knocked off parked cars. Trucks also coming down a lot despite vehicle size restriction signs. Thanks for adding to your submission.
1339140749062004737 2020-12-16 17:30:09 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Pidge @D8From @Maldesu @BusConnects Thanks Michael. It takes around 2 mins normally to get through the lane. The max its taken me is 40 minutes!! Due to people not giving right of way and allowing you pass. Cars keep driving forward &amp; don't let you pass despite being a 2 way system. Awful for residents of the lane.
1339140284362452993 2020-12-16 17:28:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Pidge @D8From @Alanmc1885 @SInchicore @BusConnects Only the 'dirty' is in inverted commas Michael. As in people driving in our home areas, you have stretched what I said. Will Kilmainham lane now not be dirty? Diverting traffic here will be a nightmare, its too narrow.
1339122683250954241 2020-12-16 16:18:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Maldesu @Pidge Hopefully it is revised. There's a huge amount of apartments on these couple of lanes alone, traffic has got so much worse the past year, I dread to think how we would get to/from work with these new proposals @BusConnects
1339120325099999234 2020-12-16 16:08:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Maldesu @Pidge If Mount Brown is closed off to private cars we would have a lot of trouble accessing our homes because we couldn't get around that way, also there's no right turn in on Military Road. We already have a lot of access closed off, changes would make it even worse.
1339117626006638592 2020-12-16 15:58:16 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Maldesu @Pidge I live on this lane, traffic is a nightmare as is. I can't imagine how it could physically hold all the traffic they propose to divert through it.
1339002436585988098 2020-12-16 08:20:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @D8From @Alanmc1885 @Pidge @SInchicore @BusConnects 'Dirty' people accessing their homes? Seriously? We can't all live within cycle/walking distance of home. Plus drivers contribute more to the economy than any cyclist/pedestrian. Driving will never be removed from the suburbs. This is a joke.
1339000580614852610 2020-12-16 08:13:10 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Pidge @D8From @Alanmc1885 Supportive because you won't have to deal with it on a daily basis? The changes proposed for Kilmainham/Bow Lane will make life extremely difficult for residents on the lane. It's too narrow to fit the traffic planned. Drive down look at it #crazy @BusConnects @DaithiDoolan
1338999826231533569 2020-12-16 08:10:10 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Pidge @Alanmc1885 @D8From The true light of residents feeling wasn't presented accurately. Why would any resident want to cause gridlock? This is a residential suburb where people need to drive for work/access to homes. Many residents are stressed as a result of the proposed changes.
1338999092006031360 2020-12-16 08:07:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Pidge @Alanmc1885 @D8From I've been in touch with Daithi Doolan, the plaza strategy to close off the flow of traffic through Tyrconnell Road for the sake of a plaza to eat/drink on in Irish weather would just lead to traffic mayhem. Counterproductive.

1338602971718889472 2020-12-15 05:53:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DaveyDonn I'm from Dublin 8. I find those community and residents pages very biased. It's their way only, no interest in other opinions.

1338600010183749636 2020-12-15 05:41:27 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Sprinter0712 Same thing in Dublin 😕
1338598676365709314 2020-12-15 05:36:09 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dclarke1984 @LockdownNo It's moving on to the 'take the vaccine to protect others' stage. A lot of people won't or can't take it so what happens then? They will keep the restrictions in place. I see no end in sight, if anyone can see anything different happening please tell me because this is grim!

It was yourself that got all wound up, I personally couldn't care less what Dr Holohan has to say. Wouldn't trust anyone with his history of bad professional judgment.
1338590591672872961 2020-12-15 05:04:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LockdownNo I came to that conclusion months ago. This isn't going anywhere any time soon 😢

1338569937149890564 2020-12-15 03:41:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AudreyMulcahy Particularly when you take the odds into a count. The majority of people have a 99.9% survival rate.
1338569615950159875 2020-12-15 03:40:40 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @OldNormality When you think of it, it's absolutely mind blowing. Feels like we're in a bad film.
1338563355578134535 2020-12-15 03:15:47 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 I haven't watched the news in months, just get updates online. It's so much better for the mind. The constant bombardment isn't healthy.
1338562882397671424 2020-12-15 03:13:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @OldNormality And they think they are morally better citizens for doing so.

1338560684989296640 2020-12-15 03:05:11 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @OldNormality The word 'allowed' drives me mad. We aren't children!

1338130055898292229 2020-12-13 22:34:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 Hate when that happens. Hope it's eased your woes a little bit though, best to get back on it 😊
1338119859033550848 2020-12-13 21:53:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 This calls for a curer, if you can taste the curer it's not Covid but just keep testing yourself to be on the safe side 😊

I give it a week til his return though 😊

We have an agreement that he can start a few minutes late but that wouldn't be acceptable in schools.
1337416438999560192 2020-12-11 23:18:21 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @colinjfgray @Niall_Boylan Because its not possible to be in two different places at the same start/finish time!
1337409786015608832 2020-12-11 22:51:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @brianymoran @Niall_Boylan I totally agree with this. I don't know how parents could get two or more children to different schools when they have similar start times.
1337409524278456321 2020-12-11 22:50:53 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @colinjfgray @Niall_Boylan How would parents get two or more children to different schools though? They all have the same/similar start times. It wouldn't be possible.
1337399103874076679 2020-12-11 22:09:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @maps_777 @Laure81587886 @hazechu @dccscarea My children are missing the tree also, such a shame. Glad the tree went up in Kilmainham.

Happy to give views on your personal proposal &amp; hope everyone can respect that people in the community have different transport needs. I personally don't want to see services removed which will effect people negatively. Thanks
1337365897313476608 2020-12-11 19:57:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @FamilyJohanna @Ckpainters69 That sounds hideous. I get people want to go out but would you really be bothered at that rate? Strange times we are in.
1337360684422750208 2020-12-11 19:36:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @lauren_tuite @AllPeopleAllNa1 @Laure81587886 @OConnorOisin @D8Development Hi, I have sent you an email to your Gmail account if you get some time to have a look as you have not interacted with me besides saying I am unblocked. I am not anti-lockdown, I am anti- disproportionate lockdowns that will cause huge damage eg 900,000 on hospital waiting lists.
1337328760790585345 2020-12-11 17:29:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @lauren_tuite @AllPeopleAllNa1 @Laure81587886 @OConnorOisin @D8Development I was blocked Lauren. I have the screenshot. As do a few others.
1337328554619662336 2020-12-11 17:29:08 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @lauren_tuite @AllPeopleAllNa1 @Laure81587886 @OConnorOisin @D8Development My personal opinions should not affect my right to concerns about the area. I was called a rat runner &amp; a bitch/bastard &amp; you tried to make me feel bad for being a parent who drives to work which I have no option to. You've upset me a lot &amp; other parents in my position.
1337327534220976129 2020-12-11 17:25:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @lauren_tuite @AllPeopleAllNa1 @Laure81587886 @OConnorOisin @D8Development That would be me Lauren. I am anti 'disproportionate' lockdowns there is a difference (missed screenings, suicides etc) . I said nothing to warrant a block only voice concerns. You have been very unfair to myself and some others and I am a resident with rights to an opinion.

1335967954991800325 2020-12-07 23:22:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Trevor Deeleys face was on posters throughout Dublin City and suburbs the entire time I was a student. His family have never given up. I can't believe it has been 20 years without answers.

1335575082035539972 2020-12-06 21:21:27 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LockdownNo Aimee should be thankful she has a job. So many people have had their jobs stolen from them as a result of disproportionate lockdowns.
1335228011378057219 2020-12-05 22:22:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DaithiDoolan @maps_777 @SarahMSJH @D8From @JoanCollinsTD @dccscarea I emailed you also Daithi. I have 2 children to get to 2 different schools within minutes &amp; to work. I drive for a living so moving to cycling is not an option. I think residents need consideration. This area is a suburb &amp; buses &amp; driving are a fact of life &amp; can't be cut off.

At least we can tell our children we were at logical during all of this!
1334976598760697856 2020-12-05 05:43:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir @OldNormality @Charlie59845959 @NHSobserver @lisakeb007 I can understand that, it's not worth the hassle. It's not fair when it's not mandatory. Our school days are long over, terrible to be told what to do like that. This needs to end soon for everyones sake ☹️
1334975192372817921 2020-12-05 05:37:43 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir @OldNormality @Charlie59845959 @NHSobserver @lisakeb007 I never got this from the pre-school but the primary school sends us reminders to wear masks outdoors constantly. It's not mandatory so I don't. I see parents walk with their heads bent into their jackets if they forget a mask or use their hand, it's laughable at this stage.
1334973416621940738 2020-12-05 05:30:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir @OldNormality @Charlie59845959 @NHSobserver @lisakeb007 Do you drop off/collect them from outside? We don't go inside duty out kids and don't wear masks outdoors. They can't force parents to wear masks outdoors surely? 😕 My eldests school advised it but I don't wear them outdoors.

1334626610729914368 2020-12-04 06:32:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Life is so much more pleasant when you don't watch Prime Time or the Late Late Show. I feel free at last 🙂
1334625287657680900 2020-12-04 06:27:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Emjroche They must be desperate for panelists at this stage. They can ramp up the scaremongering all they like, I think there's a sufficient amount of data now for people to actually 'live along side the virus' without being petrified by these zero-covid lockdown activists.

1334561778303381509 2020-12-04 02:14:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @EmperorsNewMask If the deaths not actually from Covid were subtracted and a second trend line for total deaths added to the chart there would be little to no difference to any other year.

1334559081030443012 2020-12-04 02:04:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @rtenews They will find them to add on in a week or two and blame it on the pubs reopening.
1334551631145414663 2020-12-04 01:34:38 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Mountai61137001 Yeah that's the one I'm talking about. Never used and removed by the summer. What about the death toll they had predicted? They know it wasn't going to happen but expect us still to live in fear. Remember the months of helicopters over the area, what was that about? 🙄
1334537416028393473 2020-12-04 00:38:09 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @OldNormality I have a 32 year old neighbour that walks around alone in what looks like the same mask and blue plastic gloves since March. No underlying conditions just successfully brainwashed.
1334530690919124998 2020-12-04 00:11:25 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Mountai61137001 I'm in the middle of James's/Royal Hospital. Heard ambulances at the start but not now and the temporary mortuary they built in the Royal Hospital was never used and taken down by June despite us being warned of the 2nd,3rd, 4th, 5th....waves of doom??
1334519631151833088 2020-12-03 23:27:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AudreyMulcahy That, and the combination of guilt that the government and media have put on the public that if they spread it unknowingly they will be responsible for killing people.
1334505909356277768 2020-12-03 22:32:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ScaryTimes2 @indepdubnrth Exactly. What will the effects on children taking it now when they reach adulthood. Very worrying.
1333918753969549313 2020-12-02 07:39:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @CharlesOReilly2 I understand that but these are businesses who aren't closed yet and guaranteed business for the area they are in and time of year. It's beside the city centre. I know they must feel deflated as does my job in this sector but they need to band together and fight.
1333913692841398274 2020-12-02 07:19:41 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @RitaOverend Not all Dublin I'm sure. Speaking of my local area, those that I contacted in Dublin 8. Only speaking from my own experience.
1333913371570278401 2020-12-02 07:18:25 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @nightowl1610 You have it all sorted and you deserve it 😊 There has been no mention of price of the food only that it has to be 'substantial'. The time limit is no time limit if you are 2m from other people (as it always was but not mentioned) otherwise 105 mins if less than 2m.
1333911739788910593 2020-12-02 07:11:56 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @FamilyJohanna Don't blame them, sounds dire 😡
1333909648311799808 2020-12-02 07:03:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @nightowl1610 Hi pal, are your locals opening Friday? I can't get a straight answer or booking I'm frustrated 😞
1333909125978349576 2020-12-02 07:01:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir So sad. Above all, we are missing the community spirit from these businesses particularly this time of year. I would have loved to stay local. Hopefully they do get organised to open and stay open. What a year for the employees 😔
1333908231912124420 2020-12-02 06:57:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JoeBlog05115153 What are they getting though? I work in a supplier to this hospitality sector. We have been down to only 5% business. No payouts. What are we missing??
1333906646226137088 2020-12-02 06:51:41 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir I can understand them feeling beaten down but would love to see them fight forward.
1333906352293425153 2020-12-02 06:50:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir There was no enthusiasm at all from those we contacted. Not even an offer for a provisional booking. They have had a week's notice.
1333906107107078144 2020-12-02 06:49:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @suzy661 Sad. I can't wait to get out and see strangers enjoy themselves. In June it was great to see locals chatting away, people who may live alone have company. But of course that's what they don't want.
1333905191800872970 2020-12-02 06:45:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @adiemolloy And for myself 😔
1333905043016310786 2020-12-02 06:45:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @adiemolloy I totally get that and the cost of waste but they are really busy pubs even with the distancing requirements, they would sell the initial stock. Feel terrible for them.

1333849243426189318 2020-12-02 03:03:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AudreyMulcahy A friend who did her PhD with me is now leading a team in Texas A&amp;M University on this very subject. They are tracing Covid through the beef chain: live cows cow hides, the meat and employees. Will be interesting to see what they find.
1333744613568471041 2020-12-01 20:07:50 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Emjroche @TheNiceLandlord You're completely right John. Sam McConkey has been proven wrong with his predictions and his concepts are not realistic in daily life. We need to be practical not terrify and depress people.

1333532749441986568 2020-12-01 06:05:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @PatriciaGaffne5 @Ckpainters69 That will require 12 meals, can you handle that Colin?! 🤣
1333532389210017793 2020-12-01 06:04:32 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @philthrill69 What about those who have tested positive for it? Are they exempt? 🤔😏 They may in that case be forced to admit that the possibility of false positives is high throwing the actual case numbers into question.
1333504715288502272 2020-12-01 04:14:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DaithiDoolan @D8From The public will face challenges. We use this road to get children to school because we have time deadlines. I've 2 children to get to 2 schools within a 10 minute timeframe &amp; then to work myself as a scientist. Driving is part of my job too. Don't forget workers/parents please.
1333498987329040385 2020-12-01 03:51:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 When was there ever a time when offending someone was such an offense?! Nobody has ever ended up in hospital with a dose of being offended 😂
1333495101503524865 2020-12-01 03:36:21 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 Popular opinion seems to have gone so extreme, or it could be that they have the loudest &amp; most persistent voices. I'm uncomfortable with the time we are in, there's little compromise or respect for difference of opinion.
1333490695865298954 2020-12-01 03:18:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Couldn't agree more.

1333479630418948097 2020-12-01 02:34:53 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @D8From @dccscarea Closing a road to the public, removing bus access &amp; creating traffic chaos for commuters getting to work etc to make way for this across it? @DaithiDoolan The public aren't all aware &amp; there are more than the 8 people with unenthusiastic feedback. The Facebook page shows this.  https://t.co/ZQ0Y22BSq1
1333478771198980097 2020-12-01 02:31:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @D8From @dccscarea I use this pathway with my children &amp; my cousin with a newborn baby. How could the council justify closing a road to make way for street drinking like this on a road with 3 schools in walking distance.  https://t.co/mJd02M7AuY
1333476197918011393 2020-12-01 02:21:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @maps_777 @D8From Mayra, could you keep us updated if there is new information on this. We are from further down in D8, my family are just off Tyrconnell Rd &amp; surrounding areas &amp; none had heard of this so looks like we have to keep each other up to date please. Thanks for letting us know today.

1333155439731757057 2020-11-30 05:06:40 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo It is the cost of the waste that is the problem. Food that cant get sold and passes use by dates, bring left with half kegs etc. The loss to business outweighs the gain. Its awful.

1333136034469736459 2020-11-30 03:49:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo It was always great if you wanted a quiet one. The street could be jammed but the downstairs section was like a little quiet country pub in the middle of it!
1333131552239316995 2020-11-30 03:31:45 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo George's Street has many fantastic pubs the whole way up to Camden Street. I liked JJs that's gone now.
1333083031062650893 2020-11-30 00:18:56 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @skepticfella @rtenews Exactly, a number of sectors reopened at that time. Many variables to be considered but the pubs get the blame yet again despite the ones serving food having been open since June.
1333079163943706624 2020-11-30 00:03:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @rtenews Why are we only hearing this now nearly in December days before the pubs that serve food are due to re-open?

This isn't just a minor change &amp; many in the area haven't a clue about it so can't voice their objection which is unfair.

If they were I could see a reasoning but the infrastructure is good at this junction, no reason to block a road off @DaithiDoolan It's worrying when groups acting as community groups aren't interested in residents concerns.

All residents must be considered.  https://t.co/nf2nueKAn6

I haven't harassed anyone. This is an open discussion regarding concerns about closing a road we use. We have a right to voice our opinions even if it's different to yours, everyone has different needs based on where they work @DaithiDoolan
1333004753404571652 2020-11-29 19:07:53 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @kwilliams2000 @D8Development I don't know so I can't comment. I just think everyone in the community should be given respect.
1332990422042480640 2020-11-29 18:10:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @kwilliams2000 @D8Development There's a line &amp; this is crossing it. Community groups (use of D8 suggesting so) should support everyone not just those who suit. This is pitching people against one another. Not every parent is mobile either, some have disabilities &amp; can't do these things with their children.

1332979260945035271 2020-11-29 17:26:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 We would hope that they would 'keep track of the immunisation process'. That sounds like basic paperwork. They do that for the kids the little book til they are in school. The only thing is if they actually want to link it to your passport for travel, which probably will happen.

The footpaths are wide and there are adequate traffic lights there. We all know many people from the area and not one person can see any issue with it.
1332778849726308352 2020-11-29 04:10:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @RitaOverend They are dreadful looking. I don't know why anyone would want a reminder of this year every year they put their tree up. I hope next Christmas this is just a memory but somehow I think not.

This just moves the problem and leaves others to deal with it. Very unfair, all residents of the D8 and D12 area need consideration. This group have no interest in the concerns we have raised.

1332732308948967426 2020-11-29 01:05:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @D8Development That's wonderful &amp; parents can also bring their bikes with them to bring their children to cycle in landscapes further afield. An important education for children. People who use cars also participate in these activities. You seem very discriminatory towards drivers, it's unfair.
1332705804064088065 2020-11-28 23:19:58 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir @Allycon3 The children won't think anything of taking the vaccine. They are grooming the parents. Grooming us (or attempting to) to think it's normal for the child because they are aware it is coming. Its definitely disturbing.
1332704326389784577 2020-11-28 23:14:06 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @EmperorsNewMask Imagine the volume of plastic from the swabs, eppindorfs &amp; pipette tips from the PCR method alone. A serious amount of plastic gets disposed of with those methods.
1332700969835048963 2020-11-28 23:00:46 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @EmperorsNewMask It seems like all of Greta Thunburgs environmental work in 2019 has been undone and worsened by Governments worldwide in 2020 🙃

Children have no interest in pharmaceuticals or pushing anything related to health, of course the child was trained what to say!! These statements are obviously on repeat in the child's daily life.
1332687926585647105 2020-11-28 22:08:56 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @KyleOR1984 @IrishTimes It's ridiculous and boring. Feminism is counterproductive, if you want equality (which we already have anyway) then don't start bashing men, just get on with it!
1332685574034092035 2020-11-28 21:59:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @IrishTimes This article is horrible. Vilifying men for the sake of it, the women mentioned are in their late 20s and 30s!

You are only going to move the traffic problem to the people of the Drimnagh side which is unfair. You aren't thinking of other people at all.
1332662379692384256 2020-11-28 20:27:25 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @D8Development @jakey1234565555 @Barrywh27 @saferroadsnow1 @maps_777 @InchicoreEnviro @DublinInquirer And are you going to include the younger demographic? The people who use the road during the day, parents of the schools who want road access? People who have to to work? You seem very selective in your audience and you don't even ask those against the idea what our concerns are.

Please consider all residents of the area including the road users &amp; be clear to people that your plaza is in fact a closure of the actual road. I find this proposal selfish to be honest.

Would I petition to have the road closed off to drivers trying to get to work &amp; other needs? No. Roads are essential. These groups need to respect all residents including those who drive.

Nobody is harming the safety of children at this junction but it appears that anyone who uses the road are discriminated as 'rat runners'.

So yes, zero. What is the agenda? If only you would answer. And DCC footpaths are fine here.

The audience is very selective on Twitter. Every resident of the area needs to be taken into consideration when proposing changes. There is zero engagement from the groups with those in opposition, even if just to ask to the question why?

It can be assumed that it is people using it as a short cut 'rat runners' but locals are also trying to get to work/kids schools. We don't have a way around it when we have start times to meet.

1332283952674041858 2020-11-27 19:23:41 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JimIreland12 Opening all pubs would also allow for more of their beloved 'social distancing'. The lack of logic and fight is astounding. Feel very powerless as a result especially when people in support of them get blocked!
1332282669665832961 2020-11-27 19:18:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JimIreland12 Exactly. I could understand if all pubs were closed but there is a clear discrimination to those who cannot serve food without scientific data to actually back up the reasoning behind it. There is so much data available now to show there would be no significant difference here.
1332278702282072064 2020-11-27 19:02:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JimIreland12 This is disappointing Jim. We certainly aren't 'all in this together'. The lack of push from the VFI has been strange from the start.
1332240669197414401 2020-11-27 16:31:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AudreyMulcahy This happened so quickly. I know so many people who willingly embrace what they 'can' and 'can't' do, wondering if they are 'allowed' to meet a friend for a walk in the park etc. It is frightening how quickly people were conditioned to feel everyday activities are not acceptable.
1332223974567272448 2020-11-27 15:25:21 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Woolberto This is a whole new level of stupidity. 2020, the year evolution started moving backwards.

Great textbook theory for people who live, work &amp; kids schools in walking distance, not so practical for those of us without that option.

Traffic diversions also counterproductive environmentally.

1331713667222679556 2020-11-26 05:37:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @jakey1234565555 @maps_777 @InchicoreEnviro @D8Development @saferroadsnow1 @DublinInquirer I can't get my head around the idea of closing this junction off? No buses able to go through or emergency services. No way back out other than Davitt Road which is narrow and congested as is? Dreadful for residents.

Not an option to me, plus I drive for work. You aren't thinking of the logistics for parents in that position. What about emergency services?
1331703923384659968 2020-11-26 04:58:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @saferroadsnow1 @Barrywh27 @InchicoreEnviro @D8Development @DublinInquirer It is not a village. There are plenty of pedestrian lights. How will I get one of my children to the Oblates school &amp; the other to Kilmainham with a 10 minute time difference if you propose blocking both the road and the 13 bus route? You aren't considering those children.
1331703185564725255 2020-11-26 04:55:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Barrywh27 @saferroadsnow1 @InchicoreEnviro @D8Development @DublinInquirer I think that was directed at me as I questioned their issue. It was a genuine question which they won't answer as it doesn't suit their narrative.

1331702271332282368 2020-11-26 04:52:17 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 @aoifegracemoore I had it booked for next week, had to change the date for the 4th time with nothing being open.

1331695831204974593 2020-11-26 04:26:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AntiOnePercent @LastGael That's true. Don't know where we stand at all. Leaves a feeling of very little motivation or interest in what actually might open. The good has been taken from it.

I have been a resident 38 years &amp; never known it to be a problem. Busy at peak times but that can be said for any area in the vacinity of schools, hospital, industrial estate, businesses, church &amp; residences. Why remove our access &amp; buses?
1331656688072593412 2020-11-26 01:51:10 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @saferroadsnow1 @Barrywh27 @InchicoreEnviro @D8Development @DublinInquirer The other villages you've mentioned have multiple roads and bypasses to use as alternative options. This area has no other route than Davitt and Suir Roads. It is a logistical nightmare. Looks like you have done no research on this or the effects for residents who use the roads.
1331655886771777538 2020-11-26 01:47:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @shaunaq76561516 I agree. To think this started off with 2 weeks &amp; here we are 9 months on still in the same position, if not worse. We also have to face that we will be back in lockdown after this Christmas opening, they've as good as said it. When will it end? I don't have faith in the vaccine.
1331652727886245889 2020-11-26 01:35:25 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @shaunaq76561516 It's dreadful. They couldn't care less about anything but Covid.
1331637791919403013 2020-11-26 00:36:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Thomaskiely16 We need businesses to refuse to close this time, their employees and customers would have a chance to support them. Laid off employees have little they can do otherwise.
1331637170633912325 2020-11-26 00:33:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @rosborough_roma Yes, they are the people dragging this out.
1331633150246723584 2020-11-26 00:17:38 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @RitaOverend Other than protesting unless businesses remain open employees are left with no option. We need business owners to start saying no to closures, employees and customers can then support them?
1331629875036352512 2020-11-26 00:04:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir Signing on &amp; off that PUP payment is not always straight forward either. It often doesn't get processed on time so you are left with weeks unpaid &amp; they don't get back to people regarding backdated pay. People can't live like that. We need job security.
1331620300753137667 2020-11-25 23:26:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JohnLac36728740 Hospitality &amp; retail when open in Ireland showed no significant impact on viral spread. Those businesses had social distancing &amp; health &amp; safety policies as per HSA implemented which was was working well. I have not looked at USA data, each country has different guidelines.
1331619206220161027 2020-11-25 23:22:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @HarryMaybe1 @Allycon3 We need businesses to remain open so their staff can work, otherwise employees are forced to comply with that aspect of it.
1331617320956026887 2020-11-25 23:14:44 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JohnLac36728740 The US have not had the type of lockdowns and restrictions that we have had imposed, hospitality was not closed, its not comparable.
1331614889828372483 2020-11-25 23:05:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @BazPantz It's just being assumed that we will be into another lockdown. They haven't even given reopening a chance and we were told there wouldn't be a 3rd lockdown. They are also back to the 'two more weeks' lockdown line.
1331614315934339073 2020-11-25 23:02:47 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JohnLac36728740 John the alternative is to remain open obviously. There was never a need for a Level 5 lockdown.
1331613876979425281 2020-11-25 23:01:03 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @IrishTimes No permission required.
1331613489354469378 2020-11-25 22:59:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @OldNormality They are back to the lockdown 'just for two weeks' line!!! We all know that ends up being 'two more weeks' for months on end. This is never ending lunacy.
1331612518104625156 2020-11-25 22:55:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Ease restrictions for two weeks then what? Back to Level 5? Hundreds of thousands going back to work for two weeks only to be made unemployed again? They are completely messing us around, no respect for our lives and livelihoods.
1331612105674469389 2020-11-25 22:54:00 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @rtenews What then? Back to Level 5? Hundreds of thousands going back to work for two weeks only to be made unemployed again?
1331602849898303491 2020-11-25 22:17:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Shanesoup1 Like a predictable boring script at this stage.
1331601835522658308 2020-11-25 22:13:12 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Shanesoup1 I'm glad they can see we aren't all under the thumb. Time to start treating us like the adults that we are.
1331601046720929792 2020-11-25 22:10:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @adamabyss I second that. Sure as long as they bring their own cutlery and only one person handle the gravey boat they'll be grand 👍😊

1331579281856720901 2020-11-25 20:43:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ODonovanCon @InchicoreEnviro @D8Development @saferroadsnow1 @DublinInquirer It would create a nightmare to Inchicore &amp; Kilmainham to block off this road. There are no other through roads due to the canal &amp; all traffic/services would have to use Davitt Rd which is already congested. The loop back around Suir Rd is too far &amp; narrow, it's not feasible.
1331577736155029504 2020-11-25 20:37:26 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @timmyTheOurZ @ron_pool @IrishTimes It's like a script at this stage, very easy to predict their next move. Hope it's wrong through, desperately don't want another Level 5 lockdown, we need to be at Level 2 or below to actually be able to work &amp; live a bit.
1331567006085222400 2020-11-25 19:54:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @maps_777 @InchicoreEnviro @D8Development @saferroadsnow1 @DublinInquirer Exactly. Blocking an important road for the purpose of a plaza to drink coffees &amp; alcohol from the Black Lion pub in Irish weather is a waste. I have 2 children to get to different schools &amp; to work in the morning, no thought given to the difficulties it would bring to parents.
1331560309170069505 2020-11-25 19:28:11 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @maps_777 @InchicoreEnviro @D8Development @saferroadsnow1 @DublinInquirer The proposal will only lead to massive traffic congestion in the area as people who need to use a car and delivery trucks won't just stop. The pathways are not narrow here and plenty of pedestrian crossings. There is no issue here to block an entire road.
1331559851563081731 2020-11-25 19:26:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @maps_777 @InchicoreEnviro @D8Development @saferroadsnow1 @DublinInquirer I am a resident and this proposal will be a disadvantage for us. The road needs to be open to let the buses through, the bus also services St James Hospital. Getting off &amp; walking is not an option for everyone. Also emergency services will need to get through.
1331558735496552448 2020-11-25 19:21:56 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ron_pool @timmyTheOurZ @IrishTimes Ron, I am completely against lockdowns. I was being sarcastic as the current restrictions and exit from them are hideous.
1331552102204760065 2020-11-25 18:55:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @HealthFreedomIE In that case Grandad will have to eat with gloved hands beside an open back door according to Luke O'Neills contingency plan.

How would this affect services to St James Hospital &amp; the Ambulance Service on Davitt Road? Very counterproductive proposal.
1331548505639366656 2020-11-25 18:41:17 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Barrywh27 @InchicoreEnviro @D8Development @saferroadsnow1 @DublinInquirer @DCCTraffic @dublinbusnews @TFIupdates It also doesn't remove traffic from the area. Cars would still have to turn at the proposed roundabout &amp; traffic still moving each way at the Black Lion. All it will do is put unbelievable pressure on the Davitt Road which is already congested. No thought given to working people
1331547881619255297 2020-11-25 18:38:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @BazPantz I also need to get my valid 'excuse' together before I leave the house or I'll be fined €100.
1331546884876496897 2020-11-25 18:34:50 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @BazPantz I feel 12 again, must seek permission to see what I'm 'allowed' to do 😂😂😂
1331546626951942145 2020-11-25 18:33:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @saferroadsnow1 What is the problem here? Appears to be perfectly functional. Wide footpaths and pedestrian crossings available. The Fire Service, Ambulances, Garda and Delivery Drivers need to service this area, blocking roads will not help.
1331541949451546625 2020-11-25 18:15:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @timmyTheOurZ @IrishTimes Better lockdown for New Year's Eve, we may not even make it to January 😊
1331541567459512320 2020-11-25 18:13:43 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @InchicoreEnviro @D8Development @saferroadsnow1 @DublinInquirer There are plenty of traffic lights and the roads of this area need to be open to service St James Hospital.
1331541057654431745 2020-11-25 18:11:41 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @InchicoreEnviro @D8Development @saferroadsnow1 @DublinInquirer There has been no logistical thought put into this. Blocking that road to through traffic will prevent buses from using the road. The Davitt Road is also not sufficient to take the additional traffic &amp; diversions. As a resident of the area, the pathways are not narrow.
1331539399084007424 2020-11-25 18:05:06 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @timmyTheOurZ @IrishTimes In two more weeks....

You do realise that small and medium 'business heads' as you put it generated 63%, of the income taxes, USC etc that keep this country running. They are of huge importance to the economy,an economy that Tomas Ryan doesn't give a thought to hence his arrogance.

1331282394775744520 2020-11-25 01:03:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Don't forget our Master Luke O'Neill. Hes making so much money, no wonder why he can't wipe the cringy smile off his face as he speaks.
1331281395851915266 2020-11-25 00:59:53 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Kala_Management And the volume of costly waste we are left with as a result of immediate closures. If this is only going to be for a few weeks the loss could outweigh the gain for us. Thank you for your continued support.
1331278988497612800 2020-11-25 00:50:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Kala_Management True. As a manufacturer to the hospitality sector 2 - 3 weeks opening in December is useless to us. The 1st week of business being lost by 'phased re-opening' is another kick while we are down.
1331274183230238725 2020-11-25 00:31:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Clontarfman @MichealMartinTD Agreed.
1331273954267439106 2020-11-25 00:30:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Kala_Management So those going back to work from next week can sign back on when their workplaces are closed again in January! Will they even make it that far?!

1331266503279333378 2020-11-25 00:00:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @irishexaminer @MichealMartinTD @McConnellDaniel It was always a pick &amp; mix from any of the levels!
1331266242146160643 2020-11-24 23:59:40 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @irishexaminer @MichealMartinTD @McConnellDaniel Yeah it's not my thing either, strange atmosphere. Wonder what their plan will be to get restaurants &amp; pubs closed again by the 31st?!
1331265732680822787 2020-11-24 23:57:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MichealMartinTD 'Phase 3 will give PERMISSION for household visits'. Who would have ever thought those words would be real?! I hope 2021 will bring an end to this insanity.
1331264820189007873 2020-11-24 23:54:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @irishexaminer @MichealMartinTD @McConnellDaniel Oh grand, still have to Google what the levels entail as it all keeps changing. Two weeks of opening only before Christmas is crazy, a third week from December 1st would have helped. What's the bets they will be closed before New Year's Eve?!
1331263429613654016 2020-11-24 23:48:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MsMurray16 @Allycon3 Thanks. Angry but numb at this stage!!
1331263230099021826 2020-11-24 23:47:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @irishexaminer @MichealMartinTD @McConnellDaniel So is this only outdoor dining? What's the point in that in December?!
1331261788483186691 2020-11-24 23:41:58 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MsMurray16 @Allycon3 9 months! It's insane!! I would feel so robbed if I was a business owner, I do even as an employee. I'll be losing the best part of a year's work and that's only if they go to Level 2 by Spring which may not even happen.
1331260661624688641 2020-11-24 23:37:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MsMurray16 @Allycon3 ..... Lots of boxes to tick so ineligible for a lot of them. Most also for companies that employ under 10 staff. They were lucky to get that one grant.
1331260434591211520 2020-11-24 23:36:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MsMurray16 @Allycon3 If they are down I think 70% of business they also get the EWSS paid for the staff that are in employment. Apart from this company a manufacturer aren't getting anything else. The schemes for employers to get grants were really difficult to fullfill....
1331259567691403265 2020-11-24 23:33:09 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MsMurray16 @Allycon3 I was in my job yesterday and the owner is completely deflated. Feels powerless and finding it hard to keep motivated. His hands are tied as there's nobody to buy from him. Unless the sectors most affected band together there really is so little that can be done?
1331258893482270722 2020-11-24 23:30:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tubedbeam @BrennanBert @IrishTimes I was being sarcastic 👍
1331258499460947975 2020-11-24 23:28:54 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MsMurray16 @Allycon3 The company I work for are €400,000 at loss this year. They got a €7,000 grant for a machine that we can't use as our customers are closed so effectively nothing. I don't know about other businesses but I wish they would get angry &amp; fight to get their staff back to work.
1331243570225885184 2020-11-24 22:29:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @paulbyrne416 @LeoVaradkar No doubt about that.

1331242416762990597 2020-11-24 22:25:00 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 And if you want a hug it must be pre-organised by going outdoors and applying a mask first. Pyschopath.

1331241716381315073 2020-11-24 22:22:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @IrishTimes Organised hugs - must leave the building and apply a mask before engaging in the hug! 😂😂😂 @laoneill111 Do one you gobshite, anyone who abides by this is an even bigger gobshite. If you are that afraid stay home alone.
1331226189277655041 2020-11-24 21:20:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Never did obey and won't be now.
1331198742771458049 2020-11-24 19:31:27 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Paul Reid was on Ireland am this morning saying we have to 'behave' ourselves when we reopen. Its very patronising 😖

1331190482714681344 2020-11-24 18:58:38 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MikBurrows Oh yes we should be very worried, there's only a 99.9% survival rate after all!
1331186462163935232 2020-11-24 18:42:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 @RealCarlVernon Good to saw companies stand up against this 😊
1330999526413524995 2020-11-24 06:19:50 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AudreyMulcahy Every day is so mundane when there is no even simple plan to look forward to. Toasted sambo on a Saturday afternoon in a local watching the world go by, saying hello to the locals who live alone &amp; don't get to talk to many people during the week I miss very much.
1330998098542391300 2020-11-24 06:14:10 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 You're not wrong. Question is why didn't they open up more in the summer when cases were minimal and deaths zero? Feels like there's no way out of this any time soon if that's how they dealt with it then.
1330948850786459648 2020-11-24 02:58:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @donnchaoE @colinobr @SimonHarrisTD Good point!

1330897546768769026 2020-11-23 23:34:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Michael08483429 @DavQuinn The Covid figures are exaggerated because they include flu cases, false positives &amp; results of asymptotics which may be detecting past viral inactive cells. We are in the middle of an economic &amp; non-Covid health crisis from missed screenings &amp; cancelled appointments.
1330894012765581314 2020-11-23 23:20:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Gere79951979 They need to to get together and all open at the same time and customers should support them. It would be a start at least.
1330892219914530818 2020-11-23 23:13:26 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Michael08483429 @DavQuinn I didn't say Covid was less virulent. I said flu shows as a positive on a 45 cycle PCR test hence being clubbed into the Covid case numbers.
1330890874864214022 2020-11-23 23:08:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Michael08483429 @DavQuinn @Allycon3 Can't believe people are still rolling with this as a reason 🙈
1330890522899197960 2020-11-23 23:06:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Michael08483429 @DavQuinn No Michael, flu also appears as a positive on a 45 cycle PCR test. There are no further tests done to culture the sample &amp; distinguish between Covid &amp; flu. They are all being clubbed into the same category this year hence all being classed as Covid.
1330875638731988993 2020-11-23 22:07:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @eyesonwexford No thanks, I am more than established in my current role &amp; entitled to the job. Thanks for your obnoxious concern though, you'll get nowhere in life with a bad attitude like that but I suppose when you have nothing you have nothing to lose as you know 👍
1330873687659188225 2020-11-23 21:59:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @RMacker30 I can understand his position, it must be so frustrating. Very sad its come to this.
1330873503260749830 2020-11-23 21:59:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @shay_canning That's a joke while hundreds of thousands in hospitality have been emoyed since March. There's no hope with an attitude like that.
1330862886332362756 2020-11-23 21:16:52 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jimmy2s50013123 Shame the whole country isn't standing up with us.
1330862435541135362 2020-11-23 21:15:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @eyesonwexford Is that sarcasm? Losing a job is a massive inconvenience.
1330834070394245128 2020-11-23 19:22:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Mountai61137001 Tattoos on foreheads would be far more effective. Let's all get in line.
1330832164166971394 2020-11-23 19:14:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @mjack15 Yes, we will get the 'the vaccines are only up to 90% effective, we have to protect the vulnerable' line. We will be elderly ourselves before the restrictions are lifted at this rate!
1330804161672327169 2020-11-23 17:23:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @SimonHarrisTD Are we opening up next week? Can we have our jobs back? It's been 9 months now, that's the only thing that will bring good news because a lot of us have had everything taken from us.
1330786630580514816 2020-11-23 16:13:52 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @BazPantz Much like the company I work for if we don't get to Level 2 and below. I'd like my life and livelihood back now please 🤷‍♀️
1330784241924321281 2020-11-23 16:04:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @BazPantz Level 5 at St Patrick's Day and Easter. Repeat of 2020.
1330783379059511298 2020-11-23 16:00:56 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir Sounds about right.
1330778038880047105 2020-11-23 15:39:43 +0800 <Sabdublindr> So we're meant to be opening up next week, what sceremongering are we in for til then?! What won't they allow open? I fully expect it to be another farce but it doesn't make it any easier to digest.
1330604648512819200 2020-11-23 04:10:44 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 She probably doesn't even believe that to be true, they are on here to argue and attempt to belittle people to make themselves feel big. Must not have much going on in their lives.
1330602746517532681 2020-11-23 04:03:10 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 I had a similar experience in the summer. Good riddance!
1330602135474540546 2020-11-23 04:00:45 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 That Roisin one is an online bully, don't waste your time or energy. She then ropes her boyfriend in for backup bullying. Very sad.

1330551186018209794 2020-11-23 00:38:17 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Dublinheadshot Open up the fuck! The timeframe for lockdown brainwashing is over. The young want their lives back, they are willing to take the 99.9% survival odds and why shouldn't they. Protect the vulnerable and stop the disproportionate lockdowns.
1330446032623243270 2020-11-22 17:40:27 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @irishexaminer The young should never have been expected to be locked in. This is the problem, there's only so long they can be expected to put their lives on hold for a virus they have a 99.9% survival rate from. People aren't afraid anymore and want to live their lives not merely exist.
1330445050661179393 2020-11-22 17:36:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @GovtdontlieNOT @Niall_Boylan @laoneill111 True, I was trying to be nice today 🤗😊

1330272836452306954 2020-11-22 06:12:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leannemac4 We aren't getting out of restrictions in January or February either, this is a year and more. We are going to do another Groundhog repeat of 2020 come next March.
1329914844808695813 2020-11-21 06:29:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo @PhotosOfDublin Definitely. I keep thinking of the people who's only decent social interaction was maybe in their local on a weekend afternoon. I always liked taking the time to hear their stories, it was more than just a pint &amp; toastie.
1329910372363595781 2020-11-21 06:11:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo @PhotosOfDublin I'm in Dublin 8 so very close to the city centre but the real Dublin is (temporarily) lost. Hope we get it back soon. I miss the community spirit of faces you know and of strangers.
1329907653712207874 2020-11-21 06:01:07 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo @PhotosOfDublin Beautiful pictures you have been posting, makes me miss 'Dublin' even though I have been here all year ❤️
1329850394277765120 2020-11-21 02:13:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @sineadirish_ Beautiful! Hope you have a great night, happy birthday 🎉🎉

1329750430218379264 2020-11-20 19:36:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MikBurrows I noticed this change, it's an improvement but it's feeling more hideous with each day that we are still in lockdown. I can't get my head around it and dread hearing what they aren't going to allow reopen in December.
1329525291312701442 2020-11-20 04:41:45 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies I agree. I normally don't do the conspiracy theories but there's something very odd going on here. Feels unreal.
1329521915401269249 2020-11-20 04:28:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies This is going to go on and on. When will we ever get back to work and living life? I've lost a year's work as a result of all this, it's just too hard to believe what's going on its unimaginable 🙃
1329520462594977795 2020-11-20 04:22:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies This is crazy so up to mid December no shopping or hospitality? I have a feeling they are going to do similar in the south. This is an absolute joke! Going to have to reschedule a trip to Belfast for the 4th time now!
1329457448512610306 2020-11-20 00:12:10 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 I don't know how much longer we can go on like this. Missing the Christmas season for hospitality suppliers leaves us out of work until at least March. A year's work has been taken from myself &amp; my co-workers. How much longer can this go on? It's unimaginable its gone this far.
1329449908483616770 2020-11-19 23:42:12 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @limerick_lad @LeoVaradkar It'll be 2022 and we will still be hearing '2 more weeks' at this rate 😡
1329342472904970242 2020-11-19 16:35:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Emjroche This is disgraceful but the reality is that the outrageous lockdowns he and Tomas Ryan hope for actually end up happening.

1329148425808588801 2020-11-19 03:44:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Scientifically this doesn't take into account all of the variables. It takes up to 14 days to display symptoms, children aren't proven to be carriers, the parent/childminder might still be working &amp; carry the virus, they may go to a shop etc &amp; come in contact with the virus.

1329145281670213637 2020-11-19 03:31:44 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Rheum2improve Hoping they 'can see' their grandparents? Who's actually stopping you?
1329133102363516930 2020-11-19 02:43:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies Exactly. Laughable the control they actually think they have over people. I hope it's ignored.
1329128177189449736 2020-11-19 02:23:46 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @Ckpainters69 My pint preference would actually be Strongbow but it's hard to get. Anything along those lines would do at this stage or a gin or vodka or white wine 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
1329120641447063553 2020-11-19 01:53:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Consonant please Carol.  7 letters.   B. U. L. M. E. R. S.

1329114558263422976 2020-11-19 01:29:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Sabrina96966140 @Niall_Boylan I'm sure there are some teachers that would see it that way but far too many would just rather play victim for their own personal gain.
1329114077919064064 2020-11-19 01:27:44 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Niall_Boylan Will we close the hospitals, fire service, GPs, Buses, Trains, dentists, Supermarkets too? Those workers have been going throughout the 'crisis'. Dock the whole lot, park them up til January if that's the case. Is there anyone thinking logically these days?
1329090844775772163 2020-11-18 23:55:25 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @False_Pos1t1ve Good news has become extinct in 2020.
1329079449657110532 2020-11-18 23:10:08 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DublinMuppet @IrishTimes Oh thanks for the heads up, I must get a few bottles in the morning. To think I worked there for 18 months and never drank it on the job, that was before kids though 🥴😇

1328829262783188994 2020-11-18 06:35:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @karlwizowski You're being very polite Karl. I'd go as far as to say he's a sadistic evil prick 🤗 Don't let his negatively get to you. His days have to be numbered at this stage, all things must pass.
1328825359844990986 2020-11-18 06:20:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 My 3 year old could make the same prediction.
1328819007726772225 2020-11-18 05:55:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Sunlioness1 The government give in to NPHET constantly. Even if they delay it, they still end up going with their 'recommendations'. They are failing to realise a whole myriad of issues exist outside Covid, all of which are compromised by lockdowns. Complete atrocity.
1328814648649510922 2020-11-18 05:37:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> The comments on this post show no confidence in this man. We are being geared up for not reopening in December or at least very limited &amp; for what? A virus with a 99.9% survival rate for most of us &amp; a failed health system. Sorry for the doom &amp; gloom but 2021 will be the same.
1328813333215113216 2020-11-18 05:32:41 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @CMOIreland Judging by the comments and my own personal opinion we are becoming less concerned with each passing day about what you are concerned about. You are destroying more lives than you are 'saving' but you seem to have a history of that.
1328808933612544000 2020-11-18 05:15:12 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @ronan_glynn How many times have we heard this? They can go and shite!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1328798290180272131 2020-11-18 04:32:54 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Chef1Wayner Hi Wayne, from Dublin. You aren't alone ❤️
1328783380155133952 2020-11-18 03:33:40 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JohnLac36728740 I know, it's everything that's affected, even walking down the street without someone jumping out of your way as if you have the plague. We are just existing now and it's not changing any time soon. Just have to do as best we can this Christmas.
1328779493331361793 2020-11-18 03:18:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo Exactly, total backtrack on the drive to reduce waste. Huge amount of individually wrapped foods in plastic now too where multiples would have been taken by customers in a paper bag. Greta Thunburg must be raging.
1328778206669893632 2020-11-18 03:13:06 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JohnLac36728740 We have young kids so trying not to let it be different. We wouldn't have been on nights out much anyway &amp; our family are also in Dublin so it's easier for us than others. I hope you can have some semblance of a normal Christmas too John. Try not let them take it away from us 💪
1328773476572917762 2020-11-18 02:54:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MickO_Keeffe @Niall_Boylan Fair play you your mother speaking out. She really shouldn't have been put in that position. Unacceptable for screenings to be ignored, I hope she gets her scan rescheduled soon it's wrong on every level.
1328771554663165957 2020-11-18 02:46:40 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @crbarnes001 Just seems like they are wording it more clearly though. Maybe not 🤔
1328766416296751111 2020-11-18 02:26:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Brianne14437909 They must have known this for some time though and were happily going along with it. Is there a change coming? I desperately hope so.
1328765789604880386 2020-11-18 02:23:46 +0800 <Sabdublindr> RTE are being very careful with their wording now in the announcement of deaths.... eleven more people 'who were DIAGNOSED WITH'. Why the change?
1328760215253233665 2020-11-18 02:01:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Is there any end in sight with this insanity?
1328754047738896386 2020-11-18 01:37:06 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MikBurrows Mystic Mike. You're not wrong though.
1328753733698809866 2020-11-18 01:35:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Niall_Boylan Moronic. Simple as that.
1328671396642349056 2020-11-17 20:08:41 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @HealthFreedomIE That's insanity. Literally people with athletes health being force vaccinated.
1328617556148678656 2020-11-17 16:34:44 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Shanesoup1 My two won't be getting it either.

1328465932193308672 2020-11-17 06:32:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @HealthFreedomIE @IrishInquiry And today, further confirmation.  https://t.co/d181u7L6te
1328465479468519425 2020-11-17 06:30:26 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @HealthFreedomIE @IrishInquiry Just one example as to why it is disproportionate that so many parents have lost their jobs and are struggling to provide for their families. Our children deserve better than this, things are only going to get worse if they continue with lockdowns.  https://t.co/jXy0vmHnYR
1328461820420644866 2020-11-17 06:15:54 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @HealthFreedomIE And not hundreds 'and' thousands that get sprinkled on packet trifles at Christmas!! Starting to feel like I'm reading the National Enquirer with recent news stories, clutching at straws.
1328456562231414788 2020-11-17 05:55:00 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies Or the ones with the faces with masks on and toilet roll on them. I get new Christmas decorations every year for memories from places we've travelled to etc but those Covid ones are disgraceful. No thanks.
1328401852283711491 2020-11-17 02:17:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @BazPantz Yes, Covid leads to short term memory loss causing woman to forget contraceptive pill and result in pregnancy. Long Covid thereafter, 18 years at least.
1328333607799320579 2020-11-16 21:46:26 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @adamabyss @Independent_ie I would be mortified to put my face to a scaremongering story like this. Loss of taste from respiratory illness, tonsillitis etc even for several months is very common. If anything he's lucky to have survived this deadly virus, give us a positive story instead.
1328332178049167360 2020-11-16 21:40:45 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @NigelGallagher9 @Independent_ie Literally!! 😁😁 No disrespect to those who have taste affected but people have lost 8 months of their livelihoods for this and we never get any positive recovery stories.
1328331232397103104 2020-11-16 21:36:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @smackovsky Would they not get extra payments for the emergency meetings and all of that? Sure what does it matter when we are already billions in debt! We need something to break soon or NPHET will have us in lockdowns through 2021.
1328330359222784002 2020-11-16 21:33:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Independent_ie There are people committing suicide, missing cancer screenings, unable to pay their mortgages etc due to extended Covid lockdowns and you are worried that you lost partially lost your sense of taste. These scaremongering attempts are pathetic.
1328326702322372611 2020-11-16 21:18:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @smackovsky Hopefully!! I still can't believe there's 40 of them in NPHET. What a shocking waste of money.
1328324975451906055 2020-11-16 21:12:07 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Rene_Sonce We would like to think that but he's probably referring to those having the drinks on the street at the weekend or something along those lines. Always blame the public!
1328321173315346434 2020-11-16 20:57:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Let's get a move on with getting people back to work then Leo.

1328123856452804609 2020-11-16 07:52:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @NigelGallagher9 @MikBurrows Cancel it completely. Who knows what diseases could be spread each Christmas day, too high a risk.
1328123487442046976 2020-11-16 07:51:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @NigelGallagher9 @MikBurrows The dialogue is changing, it's slow but it is good to see the other side coming through at last.

1328046866009829377 2020-11-16 02:47:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leannemac4 Did anyone truly believe they were going to?!
1328029569262219266 2020-11-16 01:38:17 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DublinMuppet @Independent_ie The dog will get accused of being a Covid super spreader. If nobody films us we can just film ourselves and upload it pretending to be a curtain twitching bedwetter, plenty of them around.

1327767232907186178 2020-11-15 08:15:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Gere79951979 Exactly. The whole supply chain is affected by this disproportionate lockdown. Let's not forget each other, the only 'we're in it together' are the sectors that have had long term unemployment.
1327762702081675267 2020-11-15 07:57:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Gere79951979 The whole supply chain is affected 😔

All I want to do is work. #Fiannafail #finegael #NPHET are ruining all Publicans/suppliers lives/mental health with the disrespect they have shown us &amp; our trade.  They have divide us from the rest of society.
1327738845325111297 2020-11-15 06:23:03 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @higginsdavidw Outdoor hospitality in Ireland in December? Get a grip will you!!

1327532776405471234 2020-11-14 16:44:12 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies Yep, it was at the start when they first introduced mask wearing on the buses but still! Imagine it would be warm and moist from a total stranger 🙊
1327532059531866113 2020-11-14 16:41:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies My husband's a bus driver and has seen people getting off the bus giving the face mask off their face to a stranger getting on who has forgotten one! 😳🤢
1327308040152997889 2020-11-14 01:51:11 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 🤣🤣🤣 He never dyed his hair again after that 😄
1327306960958607361 2020-11-14 01:46:54 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Safety first! 💪 I put a womens brown dye in my husbands hair once, thought it would be grand. It turned out a red shade, he was like Dickie Rock. Next time I made sure I got Just for Men, realised half way through it was a beard dye so I only had enough to cover half his head 😁
1327305085534285825 2020-11-14 01:39:27 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 That's a fresh dye in his hair, I hope it was a box of Just for Men applied at home alone and he's not breaching the restrictions.
1327303078459166722 2020-11-14 01:31:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 Happy job anniversary 🍾 Hope you're having a glass at home tonight? 🥂

No energy left trying to make enough to pay overheads and also been rightly put in their box by government. Their confidence has been badly knocked.
1327044897224994817 2020-11-13 08:25:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @Allycon3 Hearing of some people saying they aren't going to travel to family this Christmas but thats about it. Just going to be the same as normal for us, it's generally just a lockdown day anyway sitting at home eating, drinking &amp; opening presents which will have to be ordered online 😳
1327044027288522752 2020-11-13 08:22:06 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @NigelGallagher9 @Ckpainters69 5 of them!! Two was enough for me, you must have lots of energy and patience!!

1327043118630395911 2020-11-13 08:18:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 @M4ttmc87 Suppliers to the hospitality sector aren't getting anything anyway. Any grants available had so many criteria to meet that even a small simple business were ineligible after one or two check points on the list 🤷‍♀️
1327042210584518663 2020-11-13 08:14:52 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @Allycon3 Vintners association said they have sought legal advice a number of times and been told they have no case. The word 'crisis' seems to get them out of everything.
1327041452921204736 2020-11-13 08:11:52 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 @M4ttmc87 Boring now. The more cancelling Christmas news the better, its getting them all riled up 😁
1327040797968097287 2020-11-13 08:09:16 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Indeed and thank you, but the lockdown mindset will leave no future for the young people so I hope that Ryan and co are ignored if they have outrageous theories they wish to put in practise.
1327039917441081345 2020-11-13 08:05:46 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @Allycon3 Ah, the good ol days when no pints was our main issue. Now look at the state of the country after 8 months of this rubbish, everyone should be angry now.
1327037670430830594 2020-11-13 07:56:50 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 I think his current zero covid concepts are dangerous to society. I've nothing against his education or current role. It just wasn't the career I wanted to pursue but I can see what he is trying to gain from it and its not saving lives, he's interested in his career.
1327036814952198145 2020-11-13 07:53:26 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @daramccarthytg He's behaving like a hormonal teenager having a tantrum🤷‍♀️
1327035853412167686 2020-11-13 07:49:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 He's only vested in his own interests. He ought to realise that research is mainly funded through tax payers money generated from the very sectors he wants to remain closed long term.
1327034203423338499 2020-11-13 07:43:03 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 😂 After PhD if you continue in research you're rarely guaranteed long term work these days. You have to play the game/keep up with what's novel to get funding. If you want to go for professorship which he would you need a team of students working for you hence the push on this.
1327032547054850050 2020-11-13 07:36:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 He has a PhD in a Science unrelated to virology/immunology. Works in research in Trinity, probably does some lecturing. He would still need to secure funding for his employment so Covid is perfect for raising his profile/securing funding.
1327030699644346368 2020-11-13 07:29:08 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @OliverWest123 @piersmorgan You're well able to type on your electronic device for someone so early into life threatening disease.
1327029304685899776 2020-11-13 07:23:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Important point to mention is he is a PhD not a medic so not really in a position to dictate, &amp; that is coming from someone with the same qualification. He's far removed from society &amp; his own career agenda in mind. I don't know how he ever got air time, they must be desperate.
1327025837653315588 2020-11-13 07:09:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 He's a clone, grown in a lab to be wheeled out for propaganda purposes 😂
1327022377893584897 2020-11-13 06:56:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @wakeywakies @Nimmermaximum Is that a Cis man these days? Genuine question.
1327017853602713603 2020-11-13 06:38:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Nimmermaximum @wakeywakies Don't they do it with a surgical scissors? I had no epidural, felt and heard it clip. Heals like a motherfucker....🤢
1327016601762361345 2020-11-13 06:33:07 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo Exactly. Right back to square one! Hopefully it doesn't come to that extreme.
1327014064195776514 2020-11-13 06:23:02 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo Trip to Edinburgh or Liverpool would even do me 😍
1327013814659899396 2020-11-13 06:22:02 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo Feel like I'm back where I began in the 80s where these things weren't accessible to most people. What we've worked towards has been taken away. Hope there's a light soon 🙂
1327012725407571976 2020-11-13 06:17:43 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 Best not get your roots done Matt just in case you had an asymptotic dose you don't know of!
1327012101194440704 2020-11-13 06:15:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo Even my 3 &amp; 5 year olds keep asking about going somewhere. We don't mention it to them because we have had so much cancelled yet they haven't forgotten. Just wanted to give them more in life than 5km!
1327009871846400001 2020-11-13 06:06:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo We went to Cascais while there and yes found that in the central area. Some of those selling were well dressed wearing suits! Missing travel big time, it's the hardest part of all this for me.
1327007612186091522 2020-11-13 05:57:24 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tricolorbood Ah don't leave us!!
1327006932725587970 2020-11-13 05:54:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @rvjcallanan 😂😂 I have actually heard of that headline!!
1327006243987337216 2020-11-13 05:51:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @sbannable Better avoid their blue rince so!
1327005990869405697 2020-11-13 05:50:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo The last time I went was 2014, found it incredibly run down at that time, quite a bit of drug pushing &amp; unhygienic. I know that's the case in many cities &amp; I've travelled quite a bit, just didn't find it 'heartwarming', can't find the right word...maybe went to the wrong places?
1327003858799915023 2020-11-13 05:42:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo Not Lisbon though please.
1327002694112989195 2020-11-13 05:37:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> It gets better every day 👏👏👏👏👏😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1327000665433010179 2020-11-13 05:29:47 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @bazyjonesy Hazel Chu is as narrow minded as they come. If your colour preference for a jumper is black she will call you racist. She needs to learn how to hum another tune, this is beyond boring now. And before I'm called racist, I'm all about the equality, I hate everyone equally!
1326998329448931328 2020-11-13 05:20:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MikBurrows But were the 'Covid related' deaths actually Covid related? We have been told they are not, so the percentage of true Covid deaths will be lower again.
1326953384323190784 2020-11-13 02:21:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @nightowl1610 @rtenews Are you going to order your pints in triplicate when the pubs reopen? 🍺🍺🍺
1326933991992201217 2020-11-13 01:04:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Emjroche They both appear very removed from reality. Science is incredibly important for learning about/controlling this virus but they are using it in extreme textbook terms. Mathematical models often don't translate to natural life which has many variables which is clear in this case.
1326931016523591681 2020-11-13 00:53:02 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Load0fboll0x @HealthFreedomIE This is very true!
1326928936656375820 2020-11-13 00:44:46 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @WaldronDara @AndyMcCourt32 I imagine he's trying to raise his profile to secure several years of funding with the aim of a professorship? He has to know at this stage that his views are not respected by the majority of people?
1326927548274630657 2020-11-13 00:39:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ronanOreilly38 I really hope so. I don't do the conspiracy theories and am holding out hope that something has got to give here and end this fiasco.
1326926561816219649 2020-11-13 00:35:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ronanOreilly38 Not in the slightest, but a future with no travel is a huge concern.
1326925586632232972 2020-11-13 00:31:27 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @HealthFreedomIE His use of words like 'forced' is concerning. Who exactly does he think he is? Highly unprofessional.
1326923281220427779 2020-11-13 00:22:17 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JoeRyanWx @Emjroche I think you're alright Joe, Tomas was cloned in a lab and grown for propaganda purposes 😊
1326919489297010689 2020-11-13 00:07:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @WaldronDara @AndyMcCourt32 It's crazy, my own PhD is in microbiology and I would never make claims to any form of expertise like he does and its a subject closer to it than his. He needs to be put back in his box 😂
1326917576014909440 2020-11-12 23:59:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @WaldronDara @AndyMcCourt32 Tomas Ryan needs to be eradicated like the virus itself.
1326914681420845065 2020-11-12 23:48:07 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 He looks like I could splatter him with a fly swat. I would take pleasure in it actually, I'm a zero fan of zero covid Ryan.
1326914029135269889 2020-11-12 23:45:32 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AndyMcCourt32 It will be very interesting to see how this one plays out. The reports stating people may only have antibodies that last 2 - 6 months are perfectly timed with the vaccine promise. Scare people into thinking they need it for long term protection. The manipulation is in overdrive.
1326909983179616256 2020-11-12 23:29:27 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JohnDee63999880 @paulreiddublin @HSELive I imagine that list is becoming quite long. The facts are readily available, this is not the pandemic it was predicted to be. PCR test is not fit for purpose &amp; the illness has a 99.9% survival rate for those under 65 with no underlying conditions but Paul keeps pushing fear 👍
1326908214353473536 2020-11-12 23:22:25 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo I love the old pubs that were also a haberdashery. John's Pub on Thomas Street has made a good effort recreating one, they haven't had a chance to open properly with the restrictions but it's lovely.
1326906719449051136 2020-11-12 23:16:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo Must have passed that hundreds of times but never noticed the details 😍
1326905933549752324 2020-11-12 23:13:21 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ShadowW44363695 Would love to put him on a boat alone and sail him off. See if he comes back post Covid crisis with scurvy.
1326903038758543367 2020-11-12 23:01:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @wakeywakies Utterly undesirable with a lingering irritation that at the time feels like it will never go away.
1326886083326582791 2020-11-12 21:54:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @wakeywakies 😈
1326878709517783041 2020-11-12 21:25:11 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LockdownNo I'm with you 👍
1326874901844815874 2020-11-12 21:10:03 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @adamabyss The push is on to try prevent people booking flights or visits to family over Christmas.
1326864099846860801 2020-11-12 20:27:08 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @RichieHayes2 Their pro-lockdown view &amp; affiliation with the pharmaceutical industry fits the narrative. Its viewed as the safer side to promote I guess? He hasn't received much media attention of late so probably used this bombshell to get his name back out! Any publicity is good publicity 🤔
1326861158335307777 2020-11-12 20:15:26 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @RichieHayes2 Tomas Ryans suggestion to postpone Christmas until the end of January &amp; remain in lockdown until then has been good for anti-lockdown. He's angered people &amp; shown how hideous his concept is. Its worked against him in fairness, thanks Tomas 👍🎅🎄
1326847040807186437 2020-11-12 19:19:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Emjroche We have been told all year that outdoor activities are safer hence outdoor dining etc. Now these outdoor traders are not permitted to operate while the shops they would work outside are allowed open for indoor sales. 2020, the year of contradiction.
1326844651815514112 2020-11-12 19:09:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leannemac4 If this were true &amp; a level of permenant lockdown was required the ones dying from coronavirus are the lucky ones to get an exit route. Karen's need to learn that risk is involved in every aspect of life &amp; death is guaranteed for us all. Get over it!!!!
1326629366529454082 2020-11-12 04:54:23 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @HealthFreedomIE Was it even a genuine account? For someone claiming to be a medic of some form who also works in a university she had an awful lot of time to attack people on twitter. Never used any technical language or state facts and was quite abusive at times.
1326578495443628032 2020-11-12 01:32:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JaydonHeireann He's like a fly you'd just love to splat
1326575909537714177 2020-11-12 01:21:58 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @KarlRic55402196 @rtenews Greedy?! Many of them have not opened their doors since March! Ignorant comment.
1326574105739587585 2020-11-12 01:14:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Rocketpants_ @Niall_Boylan @SamuelMcConkey1 Clones 😊
1326571962047602696 2020-11-12 01:06:16 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MikBurrows I don't work. Because of poxy lockdowns.
1326550018258472962 2020-11-11 23:39:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leannemac4 Playing the system. Some of us have had no choice, laid off most of the year. It's insane to think how long we haven't been allowed work.
1326548787595075586 2020-11-11 23:34:11 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leannemac4 What is the point of this? The isolation payment is only €350. Are they in jobs that pay sick leave and want time off on full wages?
1326537228701462528 2020-11-11 22:48:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @FatEmperor Can we put Tomas Ryan in a straight jacket and muzzle please and have him taken away?
1326502484010000384 2020-11-11 20:30:12 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tonyholohans @NigelGallagher9 @AllyouneedisC @PatKennyNT This definitely isn't the last lockdown. He's going to keep on going like a control freak.
1326494672961855488 2020-11-11 19:59:09 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Rene_Sonce I heard it discussed on Irish radio yesterday. Hopefully it's just an assumption thats wrong. Travel is so important I can't imagine going without it. Also wouldn't afford Covid tests for a family of 4 if they charge for them, the whole thing is like a bad dream.
1326487062497931265 2020-11-11 19:28:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @devlingirl @Niall_Boylan @piersmorgan He's getting worse every day, his posts are disgraceful!
1326484428529545216 2020-11-11 19:18:27 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MikBurrows When before were we ever conditioned to be responsible for the health of strangers? We are brought up not to harm others but ultimately to look after ourselves and our families.
1326475972695248896 2020-11-11 18:44:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @CheltenhamJoe They were never going to open earlier. They just said it to soften the blow of 6 weeks, not that it did.
1326475348675092480 2020-11-11 18:42:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @BrixtonDragon I hope it is just that.
1326470706004103169 2020-11-11 18:23:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Weren't they meant to be reviewing the restrictions this week with a view to getting people back to work earlier than December? What happened that?! Glad I've learned not to believe a word they say.
1326464108108132352 2020-11-11 17:57:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 No, it's a lovely outfit! I'm putting my kids Christmas jumpers on them from Sunday, mid-November. Putting up the tree then next weekend, a week earlier than usual for the year that's it in, cheer us up 😊
1326300545355821058 2020-11-11 07:07:46 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @petertk992 Hopefully. As much as I don't want rushed vaccines, I also don't want a life with zero travel. Very important for mental health, learning etc. Our kids constantly asking about it because we always had them out &amp; about. Sad really 🙁
1326299105262514182 2020-11-11 07:02:02 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Pintofstout1 It was always going to be the next step. We were and are being conditioned for it. Madness.
1326298298681073664 2020-11-11 06:58:50 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Pardon my French but what utter bo***x being spouted on the Tonight Show. Here we go.... You get the vaccine for me, and I'll get the vaccine for you 🤯
1326295806652116992 2020-11-11 06:48:56 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ShadowW44363695 Back to the 70s/80s when yearly family travel was for the elite? Sad times, I rate travel highly in life and wanted to give my children more in life than I had.
1326291563534835715 2020-11-11 06:32:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MikBurrows The potential benefits for people to stop wetting the bed.
1326290758501011459 2020-11-11 06:28:52 +0800 <Sabdublindr> So, I don't want a rushed vaccination for my family but I also don't want to resign us to a future without travel. What happens? No jab no flight? €400 each way for a family of 4 to be tested?
1326269113103167489 2020-11-11 05:02:52 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tricolorbood That's probably the plan alright, blame it on Covid rather than government incompetence &amp; lockdown decisions.
1326268779811237889 2020-11-11 05:01:32 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Sabrina96966140 @Nimmermaximum I've reported and blocked also. That shits not on. Just reflects badly on themselves, nobody else.
1326213852753702916 2020-11-11 01:23:17 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Nimmermaximum This Covid shit show is really showing people's true colours. Pity they have to hide behind fake accounts while being nasty. Don't let it bother you 💕
1326204490039631874 2020-11-11 00:46:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LouiseMMallo8 You're not alone, I've a 3 and 5 year old and I've had people jump out of their way as if they have rabies. I generally just laugh but it can be insulting. It's their issue not ours 😊
1326203465555730433 2020-11-11 00:42:00 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @bongoboyo I actually have a friend in Texas A&amp;M University researching that very subject. SARS-coV-2 transmission in the beef chain amongst both staff &amp; livestock. No end in sight any time soon.
1326173911227244544 2020-11-10 22:44:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MikBurrows I would say they developed it 9 days into this in March. Many haven't recovered as of yet.
1326173162820804614 2020-11-10 22:41:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @RedladNew 4 out of 5 already have by now, especially the lockdown fanatics.
1326171990303051782 2020-11-10 22:36:56 +0800 <Sabdublindr> This is not an illusion, this is a real news headline 🙈😂😂
1326105342296666112 2020-11-10 18:12:06 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @sisi4_sisi Yes, sadly people do believe it. They would take a dose every week if they were told to. The media and government have done a great job conditioning the minds of people who at one time, I would have thought were quite rational.
1326097814951223296 2020-11-10 17:42:11 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MikBurrows @PatKennyNT Ugh! My stomach is sick seeing that many McConkeys spinning around. Thanks Michael!

1326092948761698304 2020-11-10 17:22:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @RitaOverend Yes and paid to keep the agenda going. Crazy times.

1325408640451358720 2020-11-08 20:03:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @PaddyOReilly4 @Ckpainters69 I thought it was Dry January? 😊
1325358187520909314 2020-11-08 16:43:10 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leannemac4 No it's a different picture, took it Friday. Hubby has woken up with the chicken pox/shingles! Our 3 year old had it now he's fallen victim I've to listen to him now 😂😂😂😂
1325230346527526916 2020-11-08 08:15:10 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @NigelGallagher9 @leannemac4 Horse them in!
1325230009737469960 2020-11-08 08:13:50 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leannemac4 Thought I'd add myself in colour in an attempt to brighten things up. Seems like we're in a winter of discontent as George Harrison said of the Let it Be album, now I know how he felt 🤣
1325227411554914305 2020-11-08 08:03:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leannemac4 Streets where I live this evening packed with large groups drinking pints on the street. People aren't afraid anymore and why should they be with 99.9% survival rate for their age. Socialising is so important, our lives have been on hold long enough.
1325225102804480001 2020-11-08 07:54:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @diy_masks @IrishTimes @MichealMartinTD I'm sure 🤣🤣
1325213142440321025 2020-11-08 07:06:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tricolorbood Meant just share pictures/updates on here  but yes, keep a bottle too 😂😂
1325208575648657415 2020-11-08 06:48:40 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @CatrionaColllns @supervalu Good jaysus is all I can say...... 😳
1325207585864081411 2020-11-08 06:44:44 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tricolorbood Sounds great. Its a real craft and science. I studied food science for years, always had an interest in fermentation. Good luck with it, share you work when you get up &amp; running!
1325206644603547655 2020-11-08 06:40:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @KernaghanRod Up and down like most people but trying to be positive. Hope you are OK too? Thanks
1325206396669988864 2020-11-08 06:40:00 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 I hope so, I've been laid off for 7 months of the year on &amp; off 😂 Had been working since I was 15. Didn't even get full interupted maternity leave on 2 kids, had to work even 2 weeks after one of them &amp; now this I'm lost for words! 🤷‍♀️🤣 Something has to give.
1325204959621607424 2020-11-08 06:34:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @KernaghanRod Hoping not so then there's more for me 😁🤗😂
1325204629898973185 2020-11-08 06:32:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tricolorbood Oh brilliant. I brewed beer a few years ago but I didn't invest in the carbonation side of it so it was hard to drink. I would love to distill spirits, costly to invest in &amp; I've no space. I used to work in Baileys.
1325203212958371841 2020-11-08 06:27:21 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Exactly &amp; probably going to catch colds &amp; flus which will just add to the problem. They shouldn't have to put their lives on hold for what is essentially a failure to control spread in care homes. That needs to be addressed so we can actually 'live' along side it.
1325201275441483778 2020-11-08 06:19:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tricolorbood I did actually, couldn't find one big enough in the shops 🤔😁
1325201008780333056 2020-11-08 06:18:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Went to collect from Parcel Motel in Kilmainham tonight, streets packed with people in large groups drinking takeaway pints. Fair play to them but also shows its pointless closing pubs, people still need to socialise. I was collecting my Graft Gin Club so on it now at home 😂🍸🍹
1325199763759796224 2020-11-08 06:13:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tricolorbood 🤗🤗💦
1325199486977761285 2020-11-08 06:12:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tricolorbood Epic Peter. Chilled to perfection without the watery mess 👌😌
1325198170234740737 2020-11-08 06:07:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Easily pleased but delighted with my new giant ice cube tray, perfect for spirits or a Baileys so it doesn't melt too fast &amp; dilute the drink ❄️😁😂  https://t.co/puYe9HIzXC

1325066300293570561 2020-11-07 21:23:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @diy_masks @IrishTimes @MichealMartinTD 'leakage'?! Is that the scientific term?!
1325040113538232320 2020-11-07 19:39:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Honestjane69 Yep. Just realised today though I didn't hear the words 'socially distanced' used for a few days. Nice break!!
1325037414671376384 2020-11-07 19:28:32 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Honestjane69 Nothing. Same ol' BS since March.
1324992102758043648 2020-11-07 16:28:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ElaineTrea Yes my husband noticed the same this week in the city centre going to work, using the no unnecessary journey line. Gave him grief even though he was in Dublin Bus uniform going to work. I'm always just ready to say I'm going shopping for food if they ask, sick of this BS.
1324781544653889543 2020-11-07 02:31:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Bring back pub pints!!!!!!!! 😩🍻
1324745572625092608 2020-11-07 00:08:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @jonathanramplin @seekthetruth27 Haven't heard that word in use in years.
1324745219972235266 2020-11-07 00:07:27 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @seekthetruth27 If this virus is so deadly how were they fit enough to get out of bed, travel and queue for a lengthy time to be tested?

1324714000689618945 2020-11-06 22:03:24 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @wakeywakies I don't see it as racist, I just thought it was funny and fools come in every colour.
1324616959779098625 2020-11-06 15:37:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 @DonnellyStephen This is bulls**t of epic proportion.
1324611517829074944 2020-11-06 15:16:10 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 @DonnellyStephen Are you serious about Dublin? Have they said that? This is pathetic 😡
1324481921666158593 2020-11-06 06:41:12 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @XbossTony Those were the days! Planes, Trains and Automobiles is on the list to watch in November. Trading Places too, surprised they haven't tried to ban that one, very un-PC.
1324470371941232645 2020-11-06 05:55:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Nimmermaximum ..... For my life to be over.... I definitely don't want to wait anymore, its been on holding enough this year 😕
1324467948271116288 2020-11-06 05:45:40 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 Awww travelling, remember that?!
1324465642083409922 2020-11-06 05:36:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tricolorbood 39 in a couple of months 😬
1324465486864797702 2020-11-06 05:35:54 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AntiOnePercent I totally agree, sooner the better there's nothing normal about this.
1324461966199541761 2020-11-06 05:21:54 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir I don't wanna wait for my life to be over..... Kind of reminiscent of now actually 😳
1324454731432054786 2020-11-06 04:53:09 +0800 <Sabdublindr> You know things are bad when at 38 you re-watch Dawsons Creek to try feel nostalgia about good ol' days before all of this 😂😂
1324453617705775104 2020-11-06 04:48:44 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo Yes definitely, I was going to say that. If we get some confirmation on reopening it might feel more positive.
1324452881186099200 2020-11-06 04:45:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo I'm a bit emotional looking at that. Bittersweet 😔🎄
1324447863301165058 2020-11-06 04:25:52 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LouiseMMallo8 The comments on this news post really cheered me up 😊
1324375487171436546 2020-11-05 23:38:16 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MikBurrows They could look at correlations among care home recipients of flu vaccinations and effect on mortality thereafter, but they won't 🤷🏻‍♀️
1324374362431119360 2020-11-05 23:33:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AlanMcM23669693 @Niall_Boylan It's trendy to be outraged about things that deserve no outrage.
1324373576456249346 2020-11-05 23:30:40 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @s_i_taylor @Independent_ie They were never going to let us out of it mid-November were they? 🤷🏻‍♀️ Hope I'm wrong.
1324361214982500353 2020-11-05 22:41:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AlanMcM23669693 @Niall_Boylan I think people are just angry about anything and everything these days!
1324360828443918337 2020-11-05 22:40:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DerekCarey11 @Niall_Boylan Good for him. Its not the students fault they aren't permitted to work so they deserve the payment. They need something to live on like everyone else.
1324354176965627905 2020-11-05 22:13:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LouiseMMallo8 Patronising comes to mind....
1324353355314024450 2020-11-05 22:10:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @EwanMacKenna The volume of disapproving comments is excellent 😊 Gives me hope that people aren't thinking this is acceptable. We were well able to live our lives without coaching up to this point.
1324352649152573441 2020-11-05 22:07:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @nmaher36 @EwanMacKenna 🤣🤣 I've been a vegetarian for decades and I don't even cut chicken like that. Soap and water afterwards and you're grand!!
1324349485510729731 2020-11-05 21:54:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @TyroneGoldberg3 Hahahaha there are sados who will buy this 😂😂
1324309942011047937 2020-11-05 19:17:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @primalpeter1960 And the response below to Peadars comment is one of many examples showing the fuelling of fear is working! 🤦🏼‍♀️  https://t.co/8Op65WD3XI
1324305536259629056 2020-11-05 19:00:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 Most of the deaths aren't happening in hospital settings. They are from homes and care homes, people naturally at the end of their lives hence why we aren't being told the ages or any details anymore. How are people still buying this bull?
1324124502922547201 2020-11-05 07:00:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 @tuffy_sir Thanks Colin. I grew up with basically feck all so I didn't want to end up with no job &amp; being able to give them little in life. The only hope is so end these lockdowns so our businesses aren't all forced to close. I've a handy number &amp; I want it back 😊😊
1324122802799214594 2020-11-05 06:54:11 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 @tuffy_sir I've been wondering why I even bothered spending so long in college, my qualifications are worthless now literally. I drop my kids to school and drive home to nothing &amp; to a home I'll now never afford to own. I'm really angry &amp; want more for my kids.
1324121870950715393 2020-11-05 06:50:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Shanesoup1 @Ckpainters69 I respect your opinion. I hope it doesn't become reality though I want my life back before I'm fully insane ☺️
1324120062723301380 2020-11-05 06:43:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 @Shanesoup1 Some drug trials done on children in the past did cause them to be sterile in life, not purposely done, it was an unknown &amp; horrific side effect. I'm with you though Colin I think this is more bad decision making rather than a strategic plan. I don't think they're that smart.
1324119001912483846 2020-11-05 06:39:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir @Ckpainters69 There will always be suffering &amp; deaths. Its part of life &amp; part of why we are brought up to work hard to better ourselves so we don't have to suffer as much only to have our right to work taken from us. If there is a Great Reset I hope I'm dead before we get there ☺️
1324118130684252161 2020-11-05 06:35:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir @Ckpainters69 Each country/people in general have always looked after themselves first (I'm not justifying that) which is one of the reasons why I don't understand this whole push on wearing masks for other people &amp; protecting every stranger we would never have even looked at before.
1324117026772787204 2020-11-05 06:31:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Shanesoup1 @Ckpainters69 Then why not let the virus run through the population?
1324116436621664261 2020-11-05 06:28:54 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Shanesoup1 @Ckpainters69 So groups putting forward business models, it's all very text book. How do they achieve this in reality?
1324114276777340929 2020-11-05 06:20:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Shanesoup1 @Ckpainters69 All where? Where is the evidence apart from theories? Genuine question.
1324113903731777538 2020-11-05 06:18:50 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 The WHO dealt with it bad to begin with. Governments won't backtrack &amp; don't want to take the risk of not going lockdown route. I like to think we will get some form of normal back. If we are pawns for a great reset why send us all into poverty so we can't make the rich richer?
1324112256125292545 2020-11-05 06:12:17 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 As much as I never would have imagined so much could be taken from us through this 'pandemic' I don't think there has been a structured plan globally for this 'great reset'. It's more like panic &amp; bad decision making now leading to governments covering themselves....
1324110982738825216 2020-11-05 06:07:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir @Ckpainters69 I love how this article is written by Fight Clubs Tyler Durden. Is the first rule that we can't talk about it? ☺️
1323991753515556866 2020-11-04 22:13:27 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 There has to be some conclusion??
1323990847193550853 2020-11-04 22:09:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 What happens with all this now that all of the parties have asked their questions?
1323936863296520192 2020-11-04 18:35:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies Yeah it can be changed, this is my 3rd time changing it. At least your leaders seem to want to live with it so that is some hope. I'll change it to then &amp; hopefully we can go. We were actually meant to be on our rescheduled trip to Spain also cancelled! What a year 😒 Thank you.
1323933754050682882 2020-11-04 18:22:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies Hi Jenni, I have a stay in Belfast booked this month, going to have to change the dates. Realistically do you think the shops &amp; restaurants will be open there the first week of December? We need a bit of Christmas cheer 😊🎄🤶
1323673214988464134 2020-11-04 01:07:41 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LouiseMMallo8 My family GP needn't ring me to get my two flu vaccinated 🤬
1323652643827470338 2020-11-03 23:45:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @hazechu @the__dullahan Very professional language there from the Lord Mayor of Dublin.
1323634525612756993 2020-11-03 22:33:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> 😂😂 What hope have we got with this? 🤦🏼‍♀️
1323564148618416128 2020-11-03 17:54:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @TyroneGoldberg3 This is hideous, a woman in childbirth doesn't give a damn about rules, just rip them off stop complying!!
1323540971771076610 2020-11-03 16:22:12 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Tony98765678910 @karlwizowski @johnaita00 Weddings etc rescheduled to 2021 also, it's going to be a mess if they continue with these lockdowns but people will probably happily go along with it for another year. The mask wearing definitely part of the problem.
1323393723577884678 2020-11-03 06:37:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @karlwizowski @johnaita00 Something has to break. This isn't a life at all, I can't understand how so many are happily going along with it. 2021 is definitely already a write off but I want to be optimistic that something is going to change this for the better, maybe I'm stupid to hold out hope 🤦🏼‍♀️
1323391642896863236 2020-11-03 06:28:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @karlwizowski @johnaita00 He saw him on two different days with the sellotape so not a once off either! Yes, this is definitely getting more bizarre. Government trying to get Garda power to keep restrictions in place in pubs/restaurants til next June. We just aren't getting our lives back any time soon.
1323391039059697666 2020-11-03 06:26:25 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @suzy661 @Ckpainters69 Just a means to have power to keep them closed because they are SOOOOOOOO dangerous ☠️ 🤬

1323381158315515904 2020-11-03 05:47:10 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @trisham265 @gerrywebster Same in mine, I'm actually glad to be laid off again so I don't have to listen to them every day. It's crazy how brainwashed and obsessed some people are with it.
1323035973022814210 2020-11-02 06:55:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Mountai61137001 They've been robbed.
1323024060670947328 2020-11-02 06:08:11 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tazgallin He must have more blocks than anyone in the history of twitter.
1322995252073029638 2020-11-02 04:13:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Mountai61137001 There is nothing normal about this. As someone who went to college for years I don't think I would have done well with online learning. The students will miss out on so much.

1322955025036005378 2020-11-02 01:33:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @TheDisquieted My friends daughter was still believing in first year of school, about to turn 14. I thought it was cruel in case she said something &amp; got laughed at in school so I suggested to at least ask her daughter not to talk about Santa to other kids to try avoid that happening.
1322953927713837056 2020-11-02 01:29:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Mountai61137001 I was in shock. When I asked if she was serious she replied 'oh yes I certainly am' with a bossy attitude. I laughed and walked off, think I might have told her to F-off. I know they are told to do it, but it was her attitude that was the problem. I was already outside the shop.
1322952373623554048 2020-11-02 01:23:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Mountai61137001 They must. I got roared at another time getting a click &amp; collect order. I was literally roared at saying I could collect but 'NO FOOD' purchases afterwards. I didn't go back for about 2 months after that. I have found their door staff the worst of any shop.
1322950595817414659 2020-11-02 01:16:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Mountai61137001 Yeah I know it. There was no signs in the one I was in, just one cone, she expected me to re-enter the shop, go around it &amp; back out leaving me literally one foot from where I was! No other customers around either. It was hideous, no way was I going to do it. She was disgusted 😊
1322949325987741697 2020-11-02 01:11:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Mountai61137001 This happened me in M&amp;S Liffey Valley. There was no signs &amp; I was outside the shop when she shouted at me, she actually demanded I go back in &amp; walk out correctly 😂 I said are you actually serious &amp; she said yes! Treating me like I was a child I was disgusted, just walked off.
1322904171893395461 2020-11-01 22:11:47 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @RozanneStevens I've lived in Dublin 8 for over 20 years. I've noticed he has made a number of unfair comments in recent months regarding the people from the area. He blocked me last night simply for clicking like on someone else's comment saying don't tar us all with the same stick 😊
1322888942954438656 2020-11-01 21:11:16 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @OBalbriggan Not all of it.
1322885658264915970 2020-11-01 20:58:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @CheltenhamJoe I won't, thanks. Just find it over the top to go into the likes and block those people! He's always putting the people of Dublin 8 down. There are some poorer areas but the private rental market is huge here, I saw one standard house that was €2600 a month to rent!
1322850808984121346 2020-11-01 18:39:44 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MarcasSuibhne This is nothing new for this area. My husband is a bus driver on this route and drivers are constantly attacked with bricks and buses pulled out of the area. He even had a group of teenagers stop the bus and throw a dead seagull onto the bus, seriously what's wrong with them??
1322630446451249160 2020-11-01 04:04:06 +0800 <Sabdublindr> This is the Halloween costume of the year for me 👏👏😊🎃🦇  https://t.co/zIlXdfY5Fh

1322489241184669696 2020-10-31 18:43:00 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @mjack15 @SimonHarrisTD Plan is to keep us in lockdown as long as possible because there is no plan on actually living with it.
1322482211317293056 2020-10-31 18:15:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DaveyDonn Oh I wish I was going away! Enjoy every minute 😊
1322190954229620737 2020-10-30 22:57:43 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @johnaita00 @rtenews As his family also confirmed. They asked for him not to be used as a covid statistic yet RTE can't help themselves running it as a scaremongering story.
1322181588843724805 2020-10-30 22:20:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Criticalclive @Niall_Boylan I'd do the same Clive if I could!! Fair play enjoy those pints!! 🍻🍻🍻🍻

1321883701005996033 2020-10-30 02:36:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 Hideous. They stopped reporting recoveries months ago. An illness so deadly you get told you are positive and let go on your merry way. Some pandemic!

1321863865798397952 2020-10-30 01:17:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Nimmermaximum @NewstalkFM @PatKennyNT Sounds like a Waterford Whispers article 😳

1321846887431966720 2020-10-30 00:10:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies That is very unfair. Fair play to the family speaking out at such a hard time for them.
1321843375549665286 2020-10-29 23:56:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DublinMuppet @Independent_ie I like to do my pub-lic worship in pubs. Open them too 🍻
1321779218724933634 2020-10-29 19:41:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @CelticDromore Do you always use Today FM as your sources of information? Very credible and shocking as you say. Seems you have a lot to learn yourself ignorant little man.

1321738052105097216 2020-10-29 16:58:02 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 The footballer results are interesting especially if they continue to test positive after months. How will they explain that one?! 🤔😁
1321615254544154625 2020-10-29 08:50:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> For those shouting for lockdown...

1321506393594146819 2020-10-29 01:37:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @GulagProfessor @ColmanOfGuaire Sure it wouldn't be 2020 if we weren't accused of being a 'phobe' of something. Bring back the good ol days where we could hate everything equally and nobody gave a damn 🤣
1321499968079843337 2020-10-29 01:11:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @eatyourgardn @LeoVaradkar Oh sorry! It was my name first in the reply so thought it was to me. So used to being attacked on here 🙂 Finding Leo's posts very contradictory of late.
1321492438322655232 2020-10-29 00:42:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LeoVaradkar 'Stay in your room'?! What are we all teenagers? This is getting patronising.

(Spelling it out is tiring).

How do you know I haven't read them? Your agenda from the start with me has been to play a game of tit for tat asking ridiculous questions but I haven't played along with your childish game.
1321370893159964673 2020-10-28 16:39:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @byrne_david @PeterFaberSP @LeoVaradkar No it's not. I'm speaking of your actual articles David. If you have such an issue with twitter why do you invest so much of your time on it? Could you not be doing some research to write some balanced work? You certainly seem pro-lockdown with these posts.
1321369187038756866 2020-10-28 16:32:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @byrne_david @PeterFaberSP @LeoVaradkar I suggest you read scientific journals for peer reviewed papers not the options of a biased panel NPHET. You've just highlighted your own problem here, you're one sided, zero balance and zero quality research time invested to educate yourself.
1321368465991675904 2020-10-28 16:29:26 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @byrne_david @PeterFaberSP @LeoVaradkar I never said the virus doesn't transmit during summer months but it does peak later in the year. I have not personally attacked you, I just find you weak as a journalist. You've ignored much of the scientific responses people personally gave you. There's no balance in your work.
1321366333544669184 2020-10-28 16:20:58 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @byrne_david @PeterFaberSP @LeoVaradkar @PeterFaberSP has already given a good explanation for that. Do you not read what people are replying to you? Perhaps if you did you would have a greater understanding of the science, I thought at the very least that would be expected of a 'journalist'.

1321110253778382848 2020-10-27 23:23:24 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LouiseMMallo8 True. Businesses need to make more of a stand together. I had to go to work today to do a small bit of work, we only have 10% sales but one of the women is so pro-lockdown I couldn't wait to leave. Such a horrible attitude to have, it could cost us our jobs fully if it continues.

1320758708633325572 2020-10-27 00:06:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MikBurrows Good point. I watched a documentary on this a few years ago. There was links to Trinity College as far as I remember. I just think the families deserve the truth. It was wrong to even delay it this far, it should have been investigated urgently when Catherine Corley reported it.
1320747688611164168 2020-10-26 23:22:41 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Niall_Boylan @TescoIrl And rightly so 😂👏

1320722357686882310 2020-10-26 21:42:02 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Niall_Boylan I think it would be €5000 the doctor would have made today if the €150 bonus for every 10 children was included? The tweet the GP posted made it appear like a joyous occasion actively promoting her agenda. Your point was very valid.
1320718461216108544 2020-10-26 21:26:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @GlenDaly85 @DonnellyStephen An insult to Brian Belo to compare them to be honest, Brian's a top bloke 😊👍

Had Vicky Phelan not exposed him it would not have come to public knowledge &amp; more would have died. He tried to pay her off. Shameful.

Karma has a way of catching up on these people.

1320407628690882569 2020-10-26 00:51:25 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 He's being giving such mixed signals lately. One day he's set on lockdown the next it seems he's exposing some of the disproportion??
1320401501228064768 2020-10-26 00:27:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Dermopj @LeoVaradkar Coffin fits too. Weren't there meant to be dead bodies all around us by now.

1320400671976378368 2020-10-26 00:23:46 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Can we have our jobs back then???? Why have we been restricted for 7 months if this is the case? Again, back to the lockdown being completely disproportionate.

I hope the wake up is soon, we can't have another year of our lives ruined for a virus that has a 99.8% survival rate for those under 65 with no underlying conditions. These are bizarre disproportionate restrictions!

1320292530051743744 2020-10-25 17:14:03 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Wesht_Lad @HSELive @Education_Ire My 5 year old has her hands sanitized at the class room door even though there's a sink inside. It's definitely for the quick route. 3 year old also has his sanitized in pre-school while walking passed the bathroom. Makes no sense, even for cost purposes 🤷‍♀️
1320288332891422722 2020-10-25 16:57:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Wesht_Lad @HSELive @Education_Ire I worked in a microbiology lab for ten years, working directly with many different pathogens and soap and water was the hand hygiene procedure. Sanitizers were only used for cleaning the benches and work areas not on hands.

They are now living on a moral highground convinced lockdowns work &amp; embracing more of it. I know how you feel, I've a 5 &amp; 3 yr old, feel like actual living life is being robbed from us.
1320004452456300552 2020-10-24 22:09:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Honestjane69 Maybe he wants to make you think you're being watched and if you are bold he'll have you banned off twitter! 😂

1320002586884345858 2020-10-24 22:01:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Many SMEs have been treated as if they are 'non-essential' since March &amp; treated appalling overall to be honest. The reality is the exact opposite as shown in the data below.
1320001006164271104 2020-10-24 21:55:38 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Honestjane69 What does it mean put on notice? Think I saw someone else saying this Sean Toibin is hounding them.

The HSA have provided very detailed documents on what is required of all businesses and the majority of those who were lucky enough to reopen did an excellent job implementing those guidelines.

The idea of stealing Christmas from people will really anger them. They aren't doing themselves any favours now to keep people on board. Hopefully it will break soon 😊

1319921717322698752 2020-10-24 16:40:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @cricketwyvern Can we not buy a card to post to someone?! Surely now that is more important than ever? This is just cruel. What next? Banning Christmas cards?

1319634418642882571 2020-10-23 21:38:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> We are supposed to take this 'pandemic' seriously while they can't even keep track &amp; trace in line &amp; now a testing centre is closed for the Bank Holiday weekend!!! Even Holohan said he's not too concerned about the tracing issue. What pandemic??!!!!
1319582340881022977 2020-10-23 18:12:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MaryKenny4 What is there to celebrate if we don't have our lives, jobs, can't go anywhere, can't visit family, can't go to a restaurant, hotel, see a film or a band? Everything has been taken from us apart from the basics of food and a walk in your area.
1319579455640248322 2020-10-23 18:00:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 They will have everything destroyed. I hope the children aren't getting the impression this is normal.

It came through straight away surprisingly because I was waiting weeks in March &amp; never backdated. Did she apply online? It seems to be the only way that works, hope she gets sorted.
1319321281678970883 2020-10-23 00:54:40 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @El_Brendano @LeoVaradkar Sorry to hear this Brendan, I know how it feels. If you have an online store please let us know, many people want to buy from small Irish businesses this Christmas.
1319310544139145219 2020-10-23 00:11:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @boldteddy @rtenews @MichealMartinTD Buses were told only to allow 17 passengers so the bus stops were jammed with students &amp; essential workers left behind. Parents who can't go to work are mixing with families as they drop off their kids to school &amp; bored people killing time grocery shopping. It's contradictory.
1319297979501760513 2020-10-22 23:22:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Shelly201285 That's so sad, to think if she's 104 the kids she's asking to see are probably 70s/80s themselves. It's robbing them of their final years together.
1319296856430682113 2020-10-22 23:17:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @rtenews @MichealMartinTD Lots of congregation in school yards, building sites &amp; bus stops today. That's what we can see, there's plenty of factories operating with 100s of staff on site. We have to live with the virus not close businesses which cause no spread. This lockdown is a waste of time &amp; money.
1319294603703537664 2020-10-22 23:08:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @1rorycowan @adamabyss *saying this as I'm from Kilmainham D8. Having 2 children in different schools and needing food shopping has had me in and out all day, no choice in the matter! 😊

People are weary now and angry that they are threatening Christmas, I think that will work against them, hopefully things start to backfire 😊
1319293648207552512 2020-10-22 23:04:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @UnaSmyth3 @Mountai61137001 I don't think it can stay as bad but I think 2021 will be a write off. Micheal Martin has already said 2021 will be a series of lockdowns. They are going to drag it on as long as possible, hopefully people stop complying. The fear in the public seems to be less now than March.
1319292191408357376 2020-10-22 22:59:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @1rorycowan @adamabyss There are quite a few schools &amp; essential shops in Dublin 8. Parents are out dropping off/collecting children &amp; Thursday is a popular day for families shopping &amp; paying bills. I don't think people are going to hide away this time, we have to get out for mental healths sake too.
1319289243751993344 2020-10-22 22:47:21 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 Punishment for working for an 'essential' sector.
1319288701713743874 2020-10-22 22:45:12 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @IrexitFreedom And the transfer list for when families become overcrowded needing a 3 bed never moves.

1319286245361479680 2020-10-22 22:35:26 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Mountai61137001 I feel quite robbed at this stage, not just of my livelihood now but taking all form of joy away. Can't travel, no meals/drinks out, no family visits, no cinema/events etc &amp; now we can't even go Christmas shopping. They won't open fully in December &amp; if they do it will be manic.
1319283651721396224 2020-10-22 22:25:08 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Mountai61137001 There was about 50 queueing outside Aldi in Dublin 10 this morning before 9am but I think that was because of the toys going on sale. I don't get a bad atmosphere, I get a fed up angry atmosphere. People having had enough now. Roads as busy as ever despite Level 5 starting.
1319279569954729991 2020-10-22 22:08:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 What a life they are imposing on us 😳

I can't imagine there being as much compliance with this lockdown as there was in March/April. They have lost a lot of trust.
1319004099480879110 2020-10-22 03:54:17 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @McEnteeCraig @Mary_Morris1 @LeoVaradkar But that would be sections of their own shops not the non-essential retailers stock? They will still be closed? But hopefully the supermarkets do keep the clothing sections open for those who need it.
1319002147124633605 2020-10-22 03:46:32 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @johnnconnelly @Mary_Morris1 @LeoVaradkar It makes no sense at all. People are growing really weary now with this dialogue and treating us as if we're children. Lock us up at home now for 6 weeks like we're grounded and if we're good boys and girls they will let Santie come at Christmas 🤗
1318998462885658624 2020-10-22 03:31:54 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LeoVaradkar So that's the new line 'reduce the second wave to a ripple'?! The second wave is going to be the tsunami of non-covid deaths due to misses screenings, delayed treatments and suicides. Disproportionate lockdowns need to stop. You have lost the trust of the people.
1318990265605083142 2020-10-22 02:59:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Mary_Morris1 @LeoVaradkar Exactly, non-essential retailers will be locked up closed again, empty buildings. I don't understand this comment at all?

1318981020780253184 2020-10-22 02:22:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @cmaemcclean @Philip_Ryan It's stating the obvious.
1318948493294247938 2020-10-22 00:13:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @TPinemarten @Ckpainters69 I would have kicked a few donuts in myself🦵🍩🍩🍩🍩🤗
1318944510290874369 2020-10-21 23:57:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ni_ceitinn @Ckpainters69 Yes! I'm intrigued! Poor staff that had to clean that mess up, not their fault.
1318941068767932418 2020-10-21 23:43:50 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Rock_IRELAND 'Bits of virus....bits of virus'. Is that the correct nomenclature? Highly scientific!
1318940032988839942 2020-10-21 23:39:43 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Awful isn't it. Anyone know what happened before they started recording? Waste of good drink 😒
1318925472311480321 2020-10-21 22:41:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MarmaladeMax This is wrong. Whatever people think of Dr Ciara Kelly, and I don't agree with everything she says myself, she is still entitled to her opinion and to speak out.

1318635242752802825 2020-10-21 03:28:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ronanOreilly38 @DaveBM2020 @gavreilly @sean_osull00 @VirginMediaNews Didn't they tell us we have to live with it, named their plan 'Living with Covid', it was all about flattening the death curve, not over running the hospitals. There was more in hospital in 2018 with flu than at any point this year. Its baffling 🤷‍♀️
1318634500692365312 2020-10-21 03:25:38 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @wakeywakies @CNN 😂😂😂😂👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

1318633664746524672 2020-10-21 03:22:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ronanOreilly38 @DaveBM2020 @gavreilly @sean_osull00 @VirginMediaNews It makes it very hard to digest the numbers we're being given each day! Especially when we've lost so much all year. They are already admitting we will be in and out of lockdowns through 2021.
1318632041886437382 2020-10-21 03:15:52 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @TomVanBrabant1 @Niall_Boylan Not enough to cover the hole they have dug for SMEs. For some perspective, the business I work for have lost €200,000+ at this stage. We got one grant of €6000 to buy a machine &amp; now we've no customers to use it to make any revenue from.
1318629967010402304 2020-10-21 03:07:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ronanOreilly38 @DaveBM2020 @gavreilly @sean_osull00 @VirginMediaNews It makes sense when 80% of those tested have no symptoms at all so could be flu or other viruses exposed to in the weeks/months before testing.
1318629424800124928 2020-10-21 03:05:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ronanOreilly38 @DaveBM2020 @gavreilly @sean_osull00 @VirginMediaNews The deaths were meant to be reviewed but who knows when? PCR can't differentiate between covid-19, coronavirus strains &amp; influenza so a positive could be for any of those virus. Quite maddening when you consider mass job losses likely based on flu cases in the total numbers?!
1318625760307863558 2020-10-21 02:50:54 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leeser4 @Michael_O_Regan Hahahaha that's brilliant, is it your own work?! 😊
1318625344417615882 2020-10-21 02:49:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ronanOreilly38 @DaveBM2020 @gavreilly @sean_osull00 @VirginMediaNews I completely agree with you Ronan. Adding deaths to the total which were never actually confirmed positive for covid still have not been removed from the figures. They should be categorised correctly especially when the country is being locked down based on this.
1318619403550863362 2020-10-21 02:25:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Druidwol Hopefully this second lockdown will wake people up.

Can't wait for this to be over, it has to end at some stage no matter how long they drag it on.
1318614530155577344 2020-10-21 02:06:17 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @UnaSmyth3 @dolorescahill5 @ThomasJ62938021 Yeah I get that and don't listen to her show personally but if only just to get more medical doctors on board who are against Lockdowns.
1318608553909813248 2020-10-21 01:42:32 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dolorescahill5 @ThomasJ62938021 Dr Ciara Kelly today claimed she &amp; a number of doctors she knows are against Lockdown. Why doesn't she get them to put a campaign together? I think doctors are frightened after seeing what happened Dr Feeley &amp; De Brune. Dsgraceful how anti lockdown professionals are treated.
1318602846389100544 2020-10-21 01:19:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dolorescahill5 @ThomasJ62938021 An anonymous account calling someone using their name out as an anonymous account?! 🤔
1318594011955855361 2020-10-21 00:44:45 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ronanOreilly38 @DaveBM2020 @gavreilly @sean_osull00 @VirginMediaNews You're right Ronan but the majority of the deaths in the past few months are not happening in hospital settings but care homes as in March/April. The HSE report it daily, there were 2 deaths in hospital this week but most are occurring in  care/nursing homes sadly.
1318590802487091202 2020-10-21 00:32:00 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MarmaladeMax @Clodagh63742267 @M4ttmc87 Exactly and if school and university teaching goes online the staff numbers could be cut. Repeated lockdowns will just play into this.

1318580462126833665 2020-10-20 23:50:54 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Clodagh63742267 @M4ttmc87 @MarmaladeMax No I'm well aware of all of this. I agree, anyone who speaks out gets called a conspiracy theorist but it looks like their theories are actually coming into reality. 99.9% survival rate for those under 65 with no immunity issues is what everyone needs to cop on to.

1318576767595139079 2020-10-20 23:36:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 Only until they introduce Level 6 then it'll be increased to 4 🤗

I still can't believe this is happening again, not that we ever got out of it fully but level 5 is crazy. Hospitality &amp; my own job as a supplier is now over until at least Easter as a result of missing the Christmas season. A year out of work.
1318563351920844804 2020-10-20 22:42:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @MarmaladeMax @Clodagh63742267 Ah yeah the word 'crisis' gets them out of everything.

The months October - December are most important to tide wages of this sector over until March/Easter time. The year is now finished for us after only getting back to 30% for 3 months since February.
1318559661923205125 2020-10-20 22:28:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @MarmaladeMax @Clodagh63742267 🤣🤣🤣 I just need reassurance that there will be an inquiry into these drastic decisions they have been making on our heads. They will use the unforeseen circumstances, pandemic emergency excuse and just trot on with a pay rise.
1318558965484212228 2020-10-20 22:25:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @vlsoliveira2 @rtenews Anyone in Ireland can get a test referral booked within minutes of ringing their GP. And a subsequent false positive as you said. This is a major contribution to the problem.
1318557897043988481 2020-10-20 22:21:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MarmaladeMax @Clodagh63742267 It's shocking. How long would it take normally for a formal inquiry into something like the care home scandal? I spent so many years studying science that politics is not my forte! Trying to catch up now 🤔

1318551893304541186 2020-10-20 21:57:23 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @PeasantRevoltin @HealthFreedomIE I think a lot of people are willingly wearing masks and going for tests. People I know who I would have previously thought as perfectly rational have ran offering themselves up for tests after waking with a sore throat after a drinking session. It's crazy.
1318550863691042816 2020-10-20 21:53:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @CGreachain4 Do you regret coming back?
1318550188567465984 2020-10-20 21:50:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AndyMcCourt32 @annmcnam I totally agree with you both but as an employee unless our employers open up we are pretty much left with no option. We also can't support other businesses unless they open. We're snookered.

I think it's wrong that government can pick &amp; choose what they want if they expect us to believe this the deadly virus that they're making it out to be. The covid obsessed still don't accept the 99.9% survival rate.
1318523336629116929 2020-10-20 20:03:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Is the tide turning?
1318522916011708416 2020-10-20 20:02:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @mjack15 There's no evidence that lockdown is necessary. Everything should open how we were in the summer including wet pubs. Enough damage. My life now exists of bringing the kids to school, they have more of a life than I do because apparently everyone in my job would die if we opened!
1318517968037400577 2020-10-20 19:42:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @mjack15 If they claim that it is unsafe for people to go to work then children and school staff should be treated the same. All or nothing, they are picking and chosing what suits them and they have done since March.
1318462573382074370 2020-10-20 16:02:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @fionamflanagan1 You were right all along. What will happen next? Lockdown til spring?

Sorry to hear that happened. Is it hard to get hold of a manager? I'm really so disappointed with this service.
1318315999083581441 2020-10-20 06:20:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @alexandryan @ParcelMotel Did they refund the price of the order? They told me if it doesn't show up I'd get a refund. They sent me someone else's item and I was honest enough to return it knowing full well I probably wouldn't get mine back.
1318314575733919746 2020-10-20 06:14:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @alexandryan @ParcelMotel Did you ever get it? This is toys for my son, had to get off ebay and won't be able to find another seller with them, they are discontinued. I'm so upset over it, just being ignored.
1318314096119451652 2020-10-20 06:12:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Your service is good but once your staff make an error it's a disaster to try rectify. The below is ongoing 8 days. I would appreciate your help for delivery. No doubt the other person hasn't received their items either.  https://t.co/j5r9CNoVjz
1318313384098648067 2020-10-20 06:09:38 +0800 <Sabdublindr> You sent me another person's package, I returned it &amp; have not received mine since. The customer service has been terrible &amp; I keep being told different things each time I call. I really need my items, there has been no update in my account on it for 5 days.
1318312723109859328 2020-10-20 06:07:00 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ParcelMotel I've been calling about a parcel of mine that you have had for over a week now. Your staff continually tell me they will call me back with an update yet NEVER do. Really disappointed with the service &amp; need the item delivered. Looks like its lost at this stage?

Considering he lives on a small street in Stoneybatter his neighbours will know exactly who he's speaking about if they see this. The same neighbours he was praising in the summer for their community spirit.

1317402569879203840 2020-10-17 17:50:23 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 I should have been in Belfast this weekend, postponed til November 21st, will probably have to change that date again.
1317402168224350210 2020-10-17 17:48:47 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @Allycon3 Are the cabinet meeting today to discuss this level 5? Read that somewhere yesterday but may not be true. I don't know if I want to be put out of my misery or have a couple of days first 😔
1317401643466526722 2020-10-17 17:46:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @EmperorsNewMask I have a screening in a Colposcopy clinic in January. I well and truely expect that to be delayed but hoping not. Going into another lockdown will be devistating to important services, there's no way they can catch up with the backlog in a safe timing to health at this stage.
1317397052633108480 2020-10-17 17:28:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @Allycon3 Yes, absolutely I point out all the facts but these people are also the type who think they should 'bring in the army' to enforce young people to wear masks when they gather outdoors. It's hard to get reality through to that type of mindset, a losing battle.
1317396459717787650 2020-10-17 17:26:06 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @EmperorsNewMask This will impact more people than covid.

1317395066223267841 2020-10-17 17:20:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 I don't doubt it. I work with people who are pro mask wearing everywhere outside your front door. They think it is the answer to everything.

1317392968945369090 2020-10-17 17:12:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @EwanMacKenna @LeoVaradkar Drink blended soup, eat chunky soup 😊
1317388293646987264 2020-10-17 16:53:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @elainegood19 @DaveyDonn @KenHarp35576228 So by your logic teachers &amp; school children's families becoming sick is 'worth it'? But parents going to work to pay mortgages to prevent their children becoming homeless is not 'worth it'? I care about children's overall wellbeing, education &amp; having a home, its not one sided.
1317383039442444288 2020-10-17 16:32:47 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @CreavenLynda @Ckpainters69 There has been a few recent deaths from the care homes that had outbreaks, it could be from that. Its awful, they should give more details to the public as they had been.
1317379400590086146 2020-10-17 16:18:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @elainegood19 @DaveyDonn @KenHarp35576228 But they can congregate in schools? Ok. Not all jobs are office based and not all roles are in close proximity to one another. My own company people have always been distanced from one another and there is PPE that we are told is effective for situations where necessary.
1317377660461395968 2020-10-17 16:11:24 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @elainegood19 @DaveyDonn @KenHarp35576228 I have not said education is not priority. You've been very rude &amp; I never said you can't highlight something because you don't have a PhD. You're good at misinterpreting words. Of course I want children in school but I also think people should be allowed to go to work. Simple.
1317374090357997568 2020-10-17 15:57:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @elainegood19 @DaveyDonn @KenHarp35576228 Elaine, considering I went to PhD level myself I am not someone who does not support education!! My point is regarding a virus we are told is so deadly we cannot work but kids can go to school. Again, stop twisting my words you're way off the mark here.
1317240400931921922 2020-10-17 07:05:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @elainegood19 @DaveyDonn @KenHarp35576228 You're twisting my words Elaine. Very strange but go ahead if that makes you feel better about yourself.

1317197883414896642 2020-10-17 04:17:02 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @pollymac65 @the__dullahan I would imagine the only patients he has are in his head! I had to block sooner, he was giving me the creeps 😂 Not worth your time.
1317194354830811139 2020-10-17 04:03:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JohnKav1 I find it so hard seeing the empty tables out on the street desperately trying to make a living. Nobody should ever be put in this position, it's heartbreaking. I hope they all get through this.
1317190966663667713 2020-10-17 03:49:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @HelenaOTooleFM My stomach is sick and I'm already out of work at level 3 so no change work wise but the thoughts of it 😔
1317190597615243266 2020-10-17 03:48:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @the__dullahan @Rob1Obrien I doubt his credibility as a doctor. Probably a fake account.
1317190075348811777 2020-10-17 03:46:00 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @the__dullahan @pollymac65 Obnoxious. Does he not realise there is a block button for tweets he does not want to read or just scroll on by?! 😂
1317189536083050497 2020-10-17 03:43:52 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Rob1Obrien @the__dullahan No she should not remove it. Her comment is very accurate and I remember those days well myself. Things have completely changed, though I imagine that applies worldwide also. Attempting to censor peoples opinions is obnoxious.
1317187719034998787 2020-10-17 03:36:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @pollymac65 Bullying is rife on twitter. There's very little respect for a difference of opinion. I think if someone states their profession as a doctor online then they should be professional about these types of matters and not just overwrite it with their personal opinion.
1317172083516985344 2020-10-17 02:34:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leannemac4 @planetjedward Are they like those castrato singers who never reach puberty? 😊
1317171258795171840 2020-10-17 02:31:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dubkop72 Haha no 😊
1317170208608522242 2020-10-17 02:27:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ClaireyyM I don't see the point at all if it's not near a boarder other than to frighten people and get us ready for more restrictions. We are allowed travel within our county so why even bother asking.
1317167731318423557 2020-10-17 02:17:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 Just deleted the post in case people start but it's on Johns page you can click and see it fully. Sad PC times, it's gone too far if you can't voice an opinion without people trying to have you sacked.

1317162127073906695 2020-10-17 01:54:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @briancarrickna1 Says a very ignorant Brian O Rielly.
1317151951948308480 2020-10-17 01:14:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo I agree Damian, it didn't feel right at all. I would understand more if it was near a boarder to another county or main road out of Dublin but it was a housing estate.
1317141770904489984 2020-10-17 00:34:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @sullivan_ir Sad troll.

1317126025365565442 2020-10-16 23:31:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Wubaluba12 Hahahaha Dublin 12 the area - Drimnagh!!!!!! It was the morning.
1317096340640366593 2020-10-16 21:33:32 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @RomanShortall Galtymore Road Roman, a housing estate area not even a main road leading out of Dublin.
1317090829610160128 2020-10-16 21:11:38 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 I'm fed up with the idiots. Their compliance is dragging it out for the rest of us. And I thought NPHET were told not to leak stories to the media, they've done it again with this Level 5 for 6 weeks crap, people are sick with worry over it.
1317088672236396544 2020-10-16 21:03:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 She thinks it makes total sense to lockdown the country based on its either covid OR the flu (highly specific method)! Excellent rationale for those losing jobs and not affording their mortgages.
1317087660884844548 2020-10-16 20:59:03 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @marianrockmusic @bennydunne69 @thejournal_ie Experts from the WHO are stating not to lockdown. What do you say to those experts Marian or do you just pick and choose whatever suits you?

1317084964312186880 2020-10-16 20:48:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Questions should be asked now, not after it happens again.
1317057023192797184 2020-10-16 18:57:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DaveyDonn @KenHarp35576228 My children can go to school but my sector is not permitted to work to provide for them as their parent. It makes no sense.
1317051393405050880 2020-10-16 18:34:56 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leannemac4 No, I wanted to ask but my husband didn't want me to make a big deal of it. I probably would have said something I would regret, they could see how disgusted I was though. I will know next time to politely ask what the point of it is &amp; remind them I can go anywhere in my county.
1317043809008652290 2020-10-16 18:04:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Toibin1 Peadar, I was stopped this morning by 2 Garda in Dublin 12 asking where I was going and my address. This is nowhere near a boardering county, why are Garda resources being wasted like this? We have a right to go out (dropping children to school). It's demoralising to citizens.
1317035969829363712 2020-10-16 17:33:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @redlad27 @CMOIreland This has to end at some stage and we can look back and laugh at their complete stupidity. Until then we are a bit stuck until more people start to cop on.
1317034866387636224 2020-10-16 17:29:16 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @redlad27 @CMOIreland There's too many covid addicts who are welcoming this with open arms.
1317034296788570114 2020-10-16 17:27:00 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dclarke1984 Didn't give the exact address, just said home then was asked where's that and said the road name rather than full address. They could tell we were in shock at how ridiculous it was.
1317026588408631296 2020-10-16 16:56:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies It took a lot of willpower to keep quiet. I'm actually upset more than angry now to be living like this.
1317025046439788544 2020-10-16 16:50:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Stopped by two Garda in Dublin 12 this morning bringing my child to school. I'm nowhere near a boardering county, asked my address and where I was going. What a waste of money and resources.

The method is not specific enough as you've just said. These results are being used to close down livelihoods based on it may be covid or may just be flu!

1316821044766810112 2020-10-16 03:19:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @IrishTimes It doesn't belittle anything, it simply presents the facts. Nothing in the ad was inaccurate.
1316818767452798981 2020-10-16 03:10:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> The truth is starting to emerge. If only the covid addicts would open their eyes and see the truth.
1316814707785859072 2020-10-16 02:54:26 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Independent_ie There's that word again, 'ALLOWED'. We do not need your permission to see our family any day of the year, let alone Christmas.

1316807506098876417 2020-10-16 02:25:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DaveyDonn @erinstephanie84 😊 I want to thank John F Moore who placed the ad! Can't find his contact details at all.
1316805967191986195 2020-10-16 02:19:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 I'm feeling the same. The ad in the Irish Times today cheered me up a bit though. Really missing normal life.

1316795559060164609 2020-10-16 01:38:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tricolorbood True. Just depressing myself reading about it.
1316791390211375108 2020-10-16 01:21:46 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @CatrionaColllns The amount of people completely obsessed with Covid is worrying. It's like a drug to them can't get enough.

1316687410328199168 2020-10-15 18:28:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tierneydyl300 It's been like that quite a while unfortunately. It's a cesspit.

1316397492968271874 2020-10-14 23:16:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> *'services' not treatment but same difference
1316396996580827136 2020-10-14 23:14:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> They blame the public they have forced out of work to hide their incompetence &amp; at the same time give themselves a pay rise. We aren't 'all in it together', we never were!
1316396142230462465 2020-10-14 23:11:12 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Seeing 'Re-start cancer treatment' in writing makes it harder to believe they actually stopped cancer treatments. This government do not care about people, they care about covering their own backsides.
1316394733669879809 2020-10-14 23:05:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @PaddyODonoghue1 @DonnellyStephen @sgaelemc My thoughts exactly. Seeing that statement in writing actually makes it harder to believe that they actually stopped cancer treatment. Unforgivable.
1316394399111229440 2020-10-14 23:04:16 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DonnellyStephen 'Re-start of cancer services'. What a dangerous statement, these services should never have stopped.
1316393870524121089 2020-10-14 23:02:10 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Thorgwen Let them offer themselves up to the vaccine trials that many have been put on immediate hold due to serious side effects.
1316392860468629506 2020-10-14 22:58:09 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Honestjane69 Saw this earlier, crazy 😳
1316390778747449346 2020-10-14 22:49:53 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Honestjane69 @rte It just baffles me how they are getting 90,000+ people to show up for tests a week.
1316386796150968320 2020-10-14 22:34:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Honestjane69 @rte They may as well light it in flames. The effect would be the same. Nothing is gained from testing asymptomatic people.
1316385015132020737 2020-10-14 22:26:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Honestjane69 @rte Yeah they are continually tested just so they can play. Did you see Irelands team one player tested positive then negative on repeated sample. What a disgusting waste of money that could be spent on more important matters.
1316352972113301504 2020-10-14 20:19:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 Self diagnosis eh?! Her symptoms are reminiscent of a night on the batter 🤷Sorry if a few outliers do get a bad dose but millions of people shouldn't have their lives taken from them, it's disproportionate.
1316352345505173504 2020-10-14 20:17:10 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 @irishexaminer Sounds like a hangover 🤷
1316347229456740354 2020-10-14 19:56:50 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies We've done the same, we still visit family and we travelled to family outside the county, its just a guideline. The show must go on as they say! I'm sorry to hear you've to go through this, hope it isn't extended beyond that.
1316346651422928897 2020-10-14 19:54:32 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MikBurrows @Niall_Boylan Joe 'Wash Your Hands' Duffy.
1316345766261252097 2020-10-14 19:51:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies They told us level 3 in Dublin (not full lockdown but no hospitality, sport etc), only let us get to week 2 &amp; added another 3 on. That brings us to Halloween week so no doubt they'll add more on then so people can't go out for Halloween. Its getting predictable at this stage.
1316315828124626945 2020-10-14 17:52:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @EamonRyan If only you let us back to work then so we can start saving for a decade to buy our electric cars 🙄 Pushing this while hundreds of thousands aren't permitted to work is a bit much to stomach to be honest.
1316105518805590016 2020-10-14 03:56:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies @WHO Exactly the same here in the south. Level 3 may as well be Level 5 for the sector I work in. Pretty much out of work since March. They ignored increasing hospital capacity &amp; now we all have to suffer. I had a trip to Belfast booked for next month 🤦‍♀️ Its all gone too far now 😔
1316103922445058051 2020-10-14 03:50:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jennijeremies @WHO It's dreadful 😡 How long are that proposing this lasts in NI?
1316093059722088450 2020-10-14 03:06:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Deiscirt @LeoVaradkar Definitely not now with this new 'crisis'.
1316074557208432643 2020-10-14 01:53:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @nauns @LeoVaradkar Even if we could take on work with another employer part time we would not be entitled to redundancy from our current employers if those businesses don't reopen. It's a no win situation unless guaranteed that your job is safe to return to 😔
1316070712650719240 2020-10-14 01:38:03 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Even RTE hasn't much interest in Covid-19 today 😃
1316066704263442437 2020-10-14 01:22:08 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 I know you didn't mean it that way. Just agreeing that they are screwing the whole lot of us over in one way or another.
1316064963832811522 2020-10-14 01:15:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 If they stopped testing healthy people with zero symptoms it could pretty much go away for good.
1316033024853712899 2020-10-13 23:08:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 A lot of us on PUP would love to be going to work to earn more than €300 a week. Looking back, I earned more monthly when I was a student and now I've two children 😳 This farce is costing us all a fortune.

1315964998427054080 2020-10-13 18:37:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @mrsclaff @thejournal_ie Antibody testing is not specific to covid-19. The antibodies can be present from a viral infection from other coronavirus or flu strains so this test method is not a confirmation in its own right, particularly if he tested negative on PCR analysis three times.
1315964252474273792 2020-10-13 18:35:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @thejournal_ie Can someone please explain how it can be assumed he had covid19 and now 'long covid' when he tested negative for the virus THREE TIMES? There is no logic here, this is a blatent disregard for science and the public.

Everything you need to know is in that, they are meant to have a Representative available to staff to discuss these issues with. If you can maintain 2 metre distance you shouldn't have to wear it the entire day.

1315586257972604930 2020-10-12 17:33:00 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 The media/government came out with the line wear masks to protect others. I know surgeons wear them to protect the patient but the idea of the public parading around in a cloth mask is NOT for others it's for them. We simply never cared about strangers that much before.
1315583545532977152 2020-10-12 17:22:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @amin1977 @FatEmperor Same here in Ireland. Bars in Dublin still closed since March unless they can provide a meal over €9 outdoors in October!!

1315363445269725187 2020-10-12 02:47:38 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @HealthFreedomIE This can't be real, can it?! 😳
1315304949408989186 2020-10-11 22:55:11 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @4fucksake4 @Niall_Boylan I think people would still like the option to work even if it is to earn €130 extra a week, that's €520 a month more. Having no option is hard. Also the amount of tax that will also have to be replayed will hinder those on PUP for a long time if/when they get back to work.
1315302944410042372 2020-10-11 22:47:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @4fucksake4 @Niall_Boylan They are still earning their full wages while those who aren't permitted to work are reduced (now to €203 to €300) for the past SEVEN MONTHS and counting.

Do yourself a favour and educate yourself and stop wasting my time with out of date googls searches. You've made everything you said completely redundant with that 🤦‍♀️😂

1315239881770065922 2020-10-11 18:36:38 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 And short sharp lockdown. Didn't they say that at the start for 3 weeks which has practically turned into 7 months for a lot of sectors.
1315238754194317312 2020-10-11 18:32:09 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @markapmcnulty @leeser4 @natsocall @paulreiddublin @HSELive Pubs full? No pub has been allowed to operate at full capacity with social distancing and tables removed, complete lies stating they are full.
1315212138521276416 2020-10-11 16:46:23 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @RyleDave @Caolanmcaree George's Street, Dublin. Crazy times 😳
1315211771473465344 2020-10-11 16:44:56 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @SaraHaboubi1 Anyone any idea how they are getting 20,000 people a day to test? Surely contact tracing doesn't account for that many. Who is being tested? I still don't know a single person who tested positive &amp; only know of one who called for a test becsuse he had a sore throat.
1315199313048473600 2020-10-11 15:55:26 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AshbourneAnnie This comment worked out very well for you Annie, can't see anyone in agreement with you. Sad times when people resort to curtain twitching. Better luck next time.

1315030514764517376 2020-10-11 04:44:41 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AoifePBoylan @EDBLSS @CMOIreland @hpscireland Asymptomatic people do not spread the virus. Confirmed by WHO this week, several scientific papers published on the subject now.
1315023677994475525 2020-10-11 04:17:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Honestjane69 Disgusting.
1315017198629466112 2020-10-11 03:51:46 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy Yes, they appear to be. WHO discussed the fact that asymptomatics do not spread the virus, there are several papers published now yet the government is still insisting people with no symptoms spread it.
1315003523441057797 2020-10-11 02:57:26 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @case7877 Something has to break eventually. I stress the 'eventually', I think we've a lot more of this to endure first!
1315002870555725825 2020-10-11 02:54:50 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @Allycon3 @ni_ceitinn @rtenews It's hard to know what to believe but at least there seems to be more honesty regarding testing in the UK. We would never be notified of mistakes.
1315002318929174536 2020-10-11 02:52:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DamianGalvin1 @teragramFLIP @EDBLSS @CMOIreland @hpscireland No loss 🤷
1315002043287904257 2020-10-11 02:51:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Saturday night &amp; we're being told to have discussions about masks &amp; hand washing!! If we aren't depressed enough 😂😂 I long for the day we can look back and laugh at this because right now it's unbearable.
1314999854058401801 2020-10-11 02:42:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 @ni_ceitinn @rtenews I would love to know the answer to this.

1314995995399290880 2020-10-11 02:27:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @PalaceX2cb @GrahamOhare @rtenews The €300 must cover it for you, for a lot of us it does not.

1314993419723444232 2020-10-11 02:17:17 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @rhodriphillips6 @EDBLSS @CMOIreland @hpscireland Contradictory there Ms and PhD. Its clearly Dr.

1314991265436622849 2020-10-11 02:08:43 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @Allycon3 Because we live in a country of Brian Belos who buy every word they are told, no question.
1314990362532827136 2020-10-11 02:05:08 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @EDBLSS @CMOIreland @hpscireland The vast majority of people who do get the virus are grand, not so much as a symptom even!
1314989062537842690 2020-10-11 01:59:58 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 Do you think they will put restrictions on off licence sales? It would probably do my neighbour good, it's up to 18 cans a day 😊
1314988036527185921 2020-10-11 01:55:53 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 It's like a predictable script. Total manipulation. What a time to be alive!!!
1314902478807330817 2020-10-10 20:15:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MickChristophe2 @IrishTimes He was probably on carers allowance too!
1314899985008406529 2020-10-10 20:06:00 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MickChristophe2 @IrishTimes 🎶 Nice work if you can get it..... and you can get it if you try 🎶 😊😊 Its definitely wrong but it says a lot about a flawed system that they didn't discover it until into the 4th decade.
1314895372091887617 2020-10-10 19:47:40 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MickChristophe2 @IrishTimes Definitely the money but he must have been minted, he didn't even need it. He was just on so much of a roll he just kept on going 😂
1314885224942178305 2020-10-10 19:07:21 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 @spring70092278 @Merch74687349 @paulreiddublin @HSELive You may as well. I don't know what day it is anymore, let alone the season. Hopefully Christmas will bring some happiness and spirit.

1314883342920278020 2020-10-10 18:59:52 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JaydonHeireann Seriously Saoirse, I couldn't get over how abusive she was. She would have done the same to an elderly man. Completely disrespectful.

1314879989591027713 2020-10-10 18:46:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @smackovsky Indeed.

1314876525343379461 2020-10-10 18:32:47 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MickChristophe2 @IrishTimes That was some scam he had going from 1987!! To think he could have kept going only for trying to claim the bonus 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1314875435751223300 2020-10-10 18:28:27 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @paulreiddublin @HSELive Another 'two weeks'?! Groundhog day! If you want people to continue to buy this rubbish maybe try change the dialogue, there are some idiots but thankfully we all aren't that stupid.
1314870756283756545 2020-10-10 18:09:52 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 @suzy661 You're very polite. I'd disown him 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1314869639395106816 2020-10-10 18:05:25 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir I was walking down the road I've lived on for 20 years yesterday. Fresh beautiful day, meters away from anyone, yet a woman shuffled past as if I had lepracy. Complete and utter madness. If people are this frightened they should just stay home, Tesco delivers food!
1314866526588108802 2020-10-10 17:53:03 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @suzy661 Is that the young lad with 'long covid'? He came across like a disrespectful entitled prick. People can attack me how they like but it's the truth. You wouldn't have got away with his attitude when I was that age.
1314864568825524230 2020-10-10 17:45:16 +0800 <Sabdublindr> The government &amp; media have more than succeeded at turning the public against one another. Respect and consideration is a thing of the past.

People need to get off their moral highground and stop butting into other peoples lives.
1314860497221677057 2020-10-10 17:29:06 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 @DOC_TUDublin @Barrywh27 @alanjlawlor @paulreiddublin @HSELive Bedwetters of the world unite. Would you ever cop on. I was in my neighbours house last night &amp; we invited another neighbour in. 3 households breaking the 'guidelines' &amp; why? Because we need to look after each other &amp; our mental health! Did we get a virus from doing so? NO!!!!
1314859222673260544 2020-10-10 17:24:02 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Niall_Boylan Hideous on every level. I'd rather be dead than exist like this. Wake up eejit nation.
1314693634306998272 2020-10-10 06:26:02 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dublin_damo Yes friend, I'm way down 😔
1314653277888425984 2020-10-10 03:45:41 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 Thanks, 6 year wedding anniversary. There's no such thing as customer service anymore. Fun is extinct 🤣🤣
1314647632065765377 2020-10-10 03:23:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 Supported local business around then corner for them with €105 worth of custom. Polite and friendly staff.
1314646972884611072 2020-10-10 03:20:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 I simply asked for availability for a table as there was only 30% occupancy and was spoken to as if I was dirt. Squinty skanger eyes head shaking side to side at me with a disgusting patronising voice rather than say no thanks we don't have any availablity. No sympathy for them.
1314643672202465288 2020-10-10 03:07:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> The customers outside also agreed that they had been verbally abused by the same girl. Absolutely disgusting treatment. I wouldn't speak to a junkie on the street how this person spoke me, still in shock.
1314642890098970625 2020-10-10 03:04:24 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @thepatriotsinn I have never been treated worse than I have by your staff member this evening. I was completely polite to the young female employee &amp; she spoke to me like I was a piece of dirt. I have been a local 20+ yrs &amp; sickened at her attitude. Please retrain your staff.
1314600409261056005 2020-10-10 00:15:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @seansnooze Finally some good news!
1314581180654723075 2020-10-09 22:59:11 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @KeithMillsD7 Wow Keith, looks like the government and media have done a good job turning the public against each other going by the replies on your post. You don't deserve to be spoken to like that.
1314580375583313922 2020-10-09 22:55:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MillieByrne12 Common sense seems to be thrown in that fire  by people now. I'm done 🤬
1314571046520000512 2020-10-09 22:18:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @CiaranMeagher3 @AndyMcCourt32 Anything above Level 2 is effectively closure for this sector and its suppliers. The whole supply chain is affected by this lunacy.
1314570811358023687 2020-10-09 22:17:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AndyMcCourt32 We never really came out of lockdown since March. Anything that prevents us doing so much is a lockdown. When are people going to wake up to this rubbish and demand their lives and livelihoods back?
1314569540081192960 2020-10-09 22:12:56 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Realworldbusine @spiraalarm @fionaegan10 @adriancummins Exactly, selfish. Absolute height of selfishness and ignorance from this woman.
1314569316793286657 2020-10-09 22:12:03 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @fionaegan10 @adriancummins 'Shut this country down'. Who are you to say that?! You're the height of ignorance and selfishness Fiona. Wake up and educate yourself.
1314567652866695170 2020-10-09 22:05:26 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LouiseMMallo8 No positivity allowed in a 'pandemic'!!!!!! Its as if they are afraid to laugh or joke.

1314522218186051584 2020-10-09 19:04:54 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @annabotting @JuliaHB1 You don't appear to have empathy yourself for those whose lives are ruined from losing their livelihoods.
1314516260223414274 2020-10-09 18:41:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MillieByrne12 In other words, you are not a gullible fool as they appear to be! I honestly would have given people more credit for intelligence level but we seem to be surrounded by people unable to think for themselves.
1314515619010752512 2020-10-09 18:38:40 +0800 <Sabdublindr> This is completely wrong.
1314514441636118529 2020-10-09 18:34:00 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @TPinemarten @ih8evrybdy I think that expression sums it up pretty well! Everyone bending over just as they are told.
1314513720664567808 2020-10-09 18:31:08 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy You would think the public would be in uproar to get their livelihoods back by now, 7 months in but the majority are happily adhering and welcoming restrictions with open arms. Very very strange.
1314508616645386241 2020-10-09 18:10:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy That's why they changed the way the payment was given but reducing it to €300 is bad. It should still be €350 to those of us who earned over that. I've lost thousands already this year, it's not a lot but the €50 did make a difference. Or they could open up &amp; let us work!!
1314506997165961217 2020-10-09 18:04:25 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy Working full time on minimum wage would earn anyone over €350 a week.
1314505767643492353 2020-10-09 17:59:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Niall_Boylan Tomas Ryan should not be given air time.

1314468966081925124 2020-10-09 15:33:17 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 I'm the same, always have to have a couple on the go! The official Yankee shops have Holiday Hearth, hoping Homestore &amp; More get them in soon.
1314467428211085312 2020-10-09 15:27:11 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Independent_ie The same headline being used repeatedly, give it a rest!
1314467197943767041 2020-10-09 15:26:16 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 There's a new scent this year Holiday Hearth, it's lovely can't wait to get some.

1314316262885990401 2020-10-09 05:26:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @TallJosephine Don't let anyone mock you. I had a premature baby and was so grateful to the ladies (or men) who spent their time and money knitting hats and clothes to help save our babies. It's a talent that not many of us have so good for you 👍
1314315210958794753 2020-10-09 05:22:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @NoNewGreatReset @IrishTimes My thoughts exactly.
1314314889700278272 2020-10-09 05:21:03 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Independent_ie I wouldn't believe a word from any orafice of this man.
1314313281549602820 2020-10-09 05:14:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 Psychology is coming into play. There's only so long you can cage an animal before it begins to fight and become territorial. We can see it already, tide is turning but just very very slowly.
1314312733848932357 2020-10-09 05:12:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @TPinemarten @Allycon3 Doubling down on the restrictions so they can say they did the right thing, they did it for us. Truth is the death rate is down with or without their outdated measures. Meanwhile, the rest of us suffer.
1314311927988989954 2020-10-09 05:09:17 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 They'll drag it into 2022 if they can. There's going to be mass chaos if this keeps up, at least I hope so. ENOUGH.
1314311365826314240 2020-10-09 05:07:02 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @suzfitz49 @Niall_Boylan Did it ever affect your job prospects? Hope it didn't, no reason it should. Most of the staff my job employ are from Tallaght and they are great people and very dedicated!
1314310297809756169 2020-10-09 05:02:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 11 months?? Is this foreseeing how much longer (and then some) we are going to have to deal with this shite? 🤦‍♀️
1314306464152985609 2020-10-09 04:47:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Noreen1672020 @FatEmperor He's trying to raise his own profile to secure funding for his research team. When he can't support a response the look of rage is apparent on his face!

There is a change of dialogue &amp; we are starting to hear the other side, it's slow, way too slow, but something is going to give &amp; we will get out of this. Don't let it drag you down! 💪

1314265279170576384 2020-10-09 02:03:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 I know the type. Probably the same gloves from March.

Just lobbed us in with the rest of the country for a blanket 3 weeks additional restrictions... Which we know will be extended.

We can't even have a few drinks with our neighbour because he ends up going through about 18, yes 18! of his slab cans then is too hungover to go out the next day so sends us to the off licence 🤣🤣 Solo drinking is better for his health 😊

It looks like they are possibly not submitting recovered case data because those 'cases' were never actually sick to begin with (asymptomatic/false positives)?! Very hard to trust the information we're given. Also no information regarding the people who died now.

The recoveries should be moving very much in line with the total cases as we've had so few deaths. Even if there were outliers with prolonged effects they would still have recovered from the active virus stage.

If we are told to isolate for 14 days they presume you are recovered then. A few spend longer in hospital but can we presume the active cases are the totals from the past 2 to 3 weeks plus those in hospital?

1313524474361380867 2020-10-07 01:00:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @milly_bar @kenny_Irl @jpal2001Paul @LeoVaradkar It's not libellous and it is evidence that he concealed this information ie covered it up.

1313521370672828416 2020-10-07 00:47:53 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @milly_bar @jpal2001Paul @LeoVaradkar It is true. So sue me and the thousands of others who are saying it online 👍 Good luck.
1313521139273080838 2020-10-07 00:46:58 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @RedladNew @IrishTimes It is true, many employees are not permitted to work in their current roles now due to restrictions nor are they entitled to redundancy payments during the restricted periods. This is against normal employee contract rights, I wasn't speaking about retirement age and pensions.
1313518603887611904 2020-10-07 00:36:53 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @jpal2001Paul @LeoVaradkar Dr Tony Holohan doesn't deserve an apology off anyone after he purposely covered up the Cervical Check scandle that has affected hundreds of women &amp; their families.
1313517329150599168 2020-10-07 00:31:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @RedladNew @IrishTimes Workers don't seem to have any rights anymore no matter the contract, its desperate.
1313515733561769984 2020-10-07 00:25:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @IrishTimes Hardly a pay 'hike' is it, 80 cent a day!

1313473270751125516 2020-10-06 21:36:45 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @SaraHaboubi1 Thank you, I'll watch it this afternoon.
1313472585854787584 2020-10-06 21:34:02 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @OxfordDiplomat This statement is outrageous. There is nobody around him. Surely you have heard that cameras have zoom lenses?! You're being hysterical.
1313469645370863618 2020-10-06 21:22:21 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leannemac4 @M4ttmc87 I would go further as to say they never applied critical thinking to anything before. We are just seeing it highlighted now.
1313441786455617537 2020-10-06 19:31:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 Going by case numbers alone is dangerous. If this virus is so deadly why are people who test positive just told their result &amp; let go on their merry way? The volume of testing is giving us hundreds of false positives/wk as confirmed by HSE &amp; is causing our lives to be ruined.
1313427224465469450 2020-10-06 18:33:47 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 Because the 50 cent is really going to make a difference 🤦‍♀️
1313426326632779780 2020-10-06 18:30:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dclarke1984 @adriancummins @RAI_ie That doesn't include the suppliers to the hospitality industry. Many have not got back to work since March. We hope to get our existing jobs back, many of the roles are specialised to the industry which we hope doesn't completely collapse. Worrying times for all those affected.
1313423157349486592 2020-10-06 18:17:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @friel_aine @PTHosford At least they will get a decent present seeing as we'll be picking it out for them 😂 Still sad though, the atmosphere won't be the same.
1313419920806469632 2020-10-06 18:04:45 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @PTHosford It is sad for the kids and families. I'm ordering a Santa suit and have recruited a family friend to do Santa for the kids 😂 They are 3 and 5 so we can't not do something for them at that age.
1313419204587122688 2020-10-06 18:01:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @IrishTimes We were told 3 weeks before and it turned into 3 months. 7 months and counting some sectors have been closed for. Going to level 5 wouldn't make a difference as they would never let us back to Levels 1 or 2.
1313400760797990912 2020-10-06 16:48:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Niall_Boylan Anything above Level 2 for the hospitality sector is effectively closure. There's still 180,000 jobs gone due to introduction of Level 3. A lot of these employees had no job since March.
1313396133612466177 2020-10-06 16:30:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @pania_12 Hypochondriacs.
1313374057975484418 2020-10-06 15:02:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 When will that be? 7 months already and no wake up for a lot of them. Hospitality relies on Christmas months to tide them over til March/April so effectively for us, that's a whole years salary gone because we'll be affected until then at the earliest.
1313370690343636992 2020-10-06 14:49:08 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 I just fear how long we will be left in Level 3. Can't see us getting to 2 any time soon. Anything above Level 2 may as well be level 5 to a lot of our jobs. 180,000 more unemploymed today I heard.
1313370076414963712 2020-10-06 14:46:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @FreeneyLisa @Independent_ie Surely you meant 'lives'?! But either way, pushing people into unemployment and delaying hospital waiting lists further will inevitably cost more lives than covid will.
1313369577074630656 2020-10-06 14:44:43 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 Fool threatening us with adding on stricter levels 6 to 10. Who exactly does he think he is. Tomas Ryan gone very quiet?
1313367835469590528 2020-10-06 14:37:47 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Kerrie0 @DonnellyStephen He never said he had no faith in them, in fact he said the opposite. He said there's needed to be balance. Hearing what you want to hear.

1313365324599787520 2020-10-06 14:27:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @sand169 @MichealMartinTD NPHET don't care about anyones jobs. They would ensure that travel and the entire hospitality sector are shut down for years if they could.
1313362354256699392 2020-10-06 14:16:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DaveyDonn I feel the same but the amount of people disappointed we didn't get level 5 is frightening. I can't see us getting out of this in 3 weeks either, Dublin started off at 3 weeks &amp; already its extended to nearly 6. Very worrying for the sectors that have been hit for 7 months now.
1313195719591956485 2020-10-06 03:13:52 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Artugal3 @rtenews Nothing stopping you staying at home if you're so concerned.
1313182074208219136 2020-10-06 02:19:38 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @adamabyss They are still keeping the additional restriction for Dublin not allowing wet pubs to open. It's so unfair.
1313181707680575489 2020-10-06 02:18:11 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @darrylbeth @thejournal_ie Only the Garda can enforce mask wearing. There will always be outliers, but for the most part people are complying, particularly on public transport. My husband is a bus driver, rarely has a passager not wearing one.
1313178819428323328 2020-10-06 02:06:42 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @adamabyss I try to be positive but can you even see them opening this year? Very long time for people to have their businesses closed and so many people out of work.
1313178099551531012 2020-10-06 02:03:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @darrylbeth @thejournal_ie We've been 'doing what we're told' for 7 months now. Time to live with it not doing more damage by  locking down.

1313170807976267777 2020-10-06 01:34:52 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @SinglyNone @kencurtin We are far from that point now.
1313170593445969922 2020-10-06 01:34:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Independent_ie From a business point of view they may as well be closed with the outdoor dining and only 15 customers being permitted. It's October! You are destroying businesses who have not significantly caused outbreaks while those who have remain untouched.
1313169173560860672 2020-10-06 01:28:23 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @GrahamOhare @KatieCrowe67 @LouisWu1992 @rtenews And try doing that for 7 months and counting. This isn't losing a few days pay and we may never get the jobs back.
1313168328714784773 2020-10-06 01:25:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @brianphelan16 @rtenews It's not fine for the people losing their jobs as a result.

It was meant to help those businesses through the winter months.
1313165826934165505 2020-10-06 01:15:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @GrahamOhare @ClareKx2018 @rtenews Job? That's doubtful.
1313164820066246657 2020-10-06 01:11:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy @theminersbar @rtenews @RTENewsPaulC So many questions they have no answers for while employees of our sector have suffered for 7 months. Thanks though, I better get used to it, doubt we will get below level 3 any time soon with the way they are dealing with things.
1313164184927055872 2020-10-06 01:08:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dclarke1984 Don't worry, I'm not. I've just told myself that I doubt Dublin will be anything less than Level 3 into next year. Also means no job for me while we're in it. Fed up is an understatement.
1313163481173159939 2020-10-06 01:05:45 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @kerriganmickey @theminersbar @MichealMartinTD I thought I was bad, got to 2 weeks on my normal wage since March and back unemployed again due to Level 3. Desperate.
1313162785442983942 2020-10-06 01:03:00 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @theminersbar @rtenews @RTENewsPaulC This is true, the whole supply chain is affected. I work for a manufacturer to the hospitality industry. I've had 2 weeks on my normal wage since March 13th &amp; unemployed again due to Level 3.
1313162223800463362 2020-10-06 01:00:46 +0800 <Sabdublindr> This is completely true, anything above Level 2 is putting hundreds of thousands out of work. The whole supply chain to these businesses is affected.

1313156062653054977 2020-10-06 00:36:17 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @jenasjenas1 @aoifegracemoore Until @CMOIreland returned yesterday, his idea to go to level 5 so the government agreed to level 3 countrywide instead. Lots more people out of work again now.
1313154126130356224 2020-10-06 00:28:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @case7877 @TrishMcHugh1 @kencurtin Mass loss of livelihoods is not the answer. The data on hospital admissions &amp; cases in ICU do not justify a level 5 lockdown. Millions losing their jobs so schools can remain open is not an argument for level 5 either, incomes are just as important to our children as education.
1313153038576746496 2020-10-06 00:24:16 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @SinglyNone @kencurtin So millions of adults lose their jobs in the process. That makes no sense. We all have to live along side the virus, mass loss of livelihoods is not the answer.
1313150600637538307 2020-10-06 00:14:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @SinglyNone @kencurtin Schools are still open in Level 5 so no difference between 3 and 5.
1313150325847724035 2020-10-06 00:13:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @TrishMcHugh1 What vested interests?
1313150040987316224 2020-10-06 00:12:21 +0800 <Sabdublindr> This mindset is dangerous. There is no scientific evidence that we need to go to level 5 but yet lockdown fanatics like this are crying out for it. So selfish to the millions who are suffering.
1313149456552951808 2020-10-06 00:10:02 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @kencurtin By vested interests did you mean people who don't want to lose their jobs/have their businesses closed down? You are obviously not affected financially by lockdowns that you can be so selfish. There is immense loss to millions in Ireland &amp; people like you who couldn't care less.  https://t.co/23e9GHUUyD

The hospital capacity should have been increased though, now all of us, especially those of us in the private sector are going to suffer immensely.

Either you're in a job that isn't affected or you just didn't work to begin with! Don't speak for all of us, so many people are desperately suffering.

People have contacted their bank or PayPal who they paid with and you refunds quicker, they have a dispute process you can lodge. Hope you get your money soon.

1312445120730468355 2020-10-04 01:31:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MarmaladeMax We'd have less than 1000 tests a week! 😊 Sadly, it's us tax payers that will have to pay all of these costs back.

1312335867281768454 2020-10-03 18:17:07 +0800 <Sabdublindr> If they are testing 90,000 a week and we've just under 5 million in the country surely they will run out of hypochondriacs to test at some stage or are people repeatedly going?!

1312158765190316032 2020-10-03 06:33:23 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 Easy for him to say. He's off the head.

Only covid matters and it's very worrying, there is going to be a massive rise in non-covid deaths from here on in. I hope you get the appointment you need, I had an ordeal getting an antibiotic recently!

1312095714688761856 2020-10-03 02:22:50 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Maureen_O_ @thejournal_ie Then you stop visiting people. Keep out of everyone else's lives. There is no legislation to stop people meeting in their own private homes. Why go look for rules when there is none?!
1312094693149220864 2020-10-03 02:18:47 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @wakeywakies I thought it was a ghost..... ectoplasm....
1312081177554096130 2020-10-03 01:25:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 My husband is convinced he had it after we got back from Edinburgh in February, he had every symptom they list. I think I read antibody testing is best done within 3 months of infection?
1312080458222628865 2020-10-03 01:22:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 There's a few Irish companies doing it, they are around €80 a test. You'll see the places pop up if you just Google 'antibody test Ireland'. The problem is the reliability and also there's different types of immunity like T cells which it wouldn't screen for. Interesting to try.

1312058913735561217 2020-10-02 23:56:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Agenda212020 @wakeywakies She did that before, it was with people with no family in their final weeks of life to have a friend/company as they died naturally. She never even stayed long enough for that moment which I think is bad leaving those people.
1312053295293304832 2020-10-02 23:34:17 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @rtenews Waste of police time 🤣🤣
1312043235347501059 2020-10-02 22:54:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @wakeywakies Level 5 sorry, she mentioned it on her last Late Late Show appearance and on here.  https://t.co/xwPqa0N1J5
1312041842679123968 2020-10-02 22:48:46 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @wakeywakies And she was saying she is going to do a FETAC Level 6 course to become a carer 🤦‍♀️
1312036195942248448 2020-10-02 22:26:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JiminROI Thank you, it is not too serious, she is being monitored for a slight twist in her bone that is straightening itself naturally now. We are lucky because if she had needed operations I doubt she would have got them in time. As you said, not too much faith in our system.
1312031670699163649 2020-10-02 22:08:21 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JiminROI My daughter attends the Children's hospital. Over the past year, she's received 3 letters but all received in duplicate in separate envelopes. Strange. If it happens again I must actually contact them to let them know.
1312030088372916226 2020-10-02 22:02:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Wjrgo @mybollix @higginsdavidw And how many from that age category were even admitted to ICU? It makes no sense to interpret data that way and present it to the public as facts. If the probability was that high the schools would most certainly not be open.
1312020019157651457 2020-10-02 21:22:03 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @mybollix @higginsdavidw Yeah seriously David where are you getting these figures?! 1 in 1000?! Back to maths class with you 🤣🤣🤣🤣

1311915573908058113 2020-10-02 14:27:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> No deaths in hospital settings again.
1311915197951606787 2020-10-02 14:25:32 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @PaulaRudd9 I would love to know. I think they aren't affected financially at all or are benefiting from it, maybe working from home, gullible, selfish.... Its a bit sadistic really they seem to quite like what's going on. With people like this will we ever get the lives we had back?
1311758811024236544 2020-10-02 04:04:06 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Sure we'll probably see a lot more crazy sights to come, people are at breaking point!

That could then be linked to ICU admission &amp; deaths giving the full scope which the above cannot as nobody was that sick. Or would that just highlight what you're trying to ignore.

1311410749160460291 2020-10-01 05:01:02 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @higginsdavidw Quite hard to afford when your own business isn't open. Saving businesses means opening every sector, especially those who aren't the blame for significant rise in cases.
1311408790932160513 2020-10-01 04:53:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @BennyBfrmdbronx @DonnellyStephen They were only asked a question like this in the past week and said they couldn't predict exact details, now this magically appears.
1311408223598018561 2020-10-01 04:50:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> This is scripted manipulation to scare people. Very convenient that it involves pubs, restaurants, house parties, hotel stays &amp; transport!
1311404717260574728 2020-10-01 04:37:03 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @CJ08608341 @DaveyDonn @CllrKRedmond I totally agree James. It's proven that these lockdowns do more damage than good. I'm just afraid with all these academics and NPHET pushing it as the only solution that were going to be in this cycle for a long time. Its mind boggling to do that when the true risk is quite low.
1311399227881390088 2020-10-01 04:15:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DaveyDonn @CllrKRedmond And then as before it will rise to level 2 and beyond once we interact again. Are these people crazy?! Lockdowns are no longer the solution.
1311394610409869313 2020-10-01 03:56:54 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy I would understand that more if they knew that they actually can develop a vaccine but there's the possibility that they won't. They are leaving those who are desperate for it in false hope. Living with it and gaining natural immunity is more realistic.

I have definitely said no to certain ingredients being used in our products at times after viewing the specs 😊 Now if only I could get back to work 😂😂 The hospitality sector being closed is destroying us.
1311389821852700672 2020-10-01 03:37:52 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Thorgwen @pryanv @KerrygoldIRL @NestleUKI No probs, another change I've noticed is some of our customers have a list of ingredients that are permitted by law that they do not want their product to contain like sulphites, colours, trans fats etc... There is a slow move. Dunnes Simply Better range would be an example.
1311386343218577413 2020-10-01 03:24:03 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Thorgwen @pryanv @KerrygoldIRL @NestleUKI I always add it to the label if below that as its an allergen and I think it should be declared even if negliable levels.

It's all part of the traceability &amp; that's a requirement by law. Sulphites only need to be added to the label if over 50 ppm but
1311385235456745474 2020-10-01 03:19:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Thorgwen @ozzyheather I know, some of it is really shocking when you look into it. The drive for supermarkets to keep food cheap wins unfortunately but I do see some improvement since they introduced QUID. Where they now have to declare the %. That stopped a lot of adulteration in the food industry.
1311384514892124161 2020-10-01 03:16:47 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Thorgwen @pryanv @KerrygoldIRL @NestleUKI I've worked with products containing sulphites, it's common in processed apple. The food industry go by the EU levels permitted PPM values. Once they are deemed safe by EU law they will he used as there is so much pressure to keep costs down with longer shelf lifes.
1311383034994855947 2020-10-01 03:10:54 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Thorgwen @ozzyheather I've been vegetarian 28 years so have a real interest in ingredient management &amp; hygiene overall in the food industry. I think most companies do overall adhere to the legislation as we have HSE visits routinely &amp; the amount of paperwork is immense now compared to 20 years ago.
1311382237217202176 2020-10-01 03:07:44 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Thorgwen @ozzyheather I've not worked in a food company which has used lye myself. The food labelling requirements have gone so strict though in recent years &amp; rightly so, allergen management takes up most of my work now as even restaurants now need to control allergens &amp; ingredients very tightly.

I do understand that some food processes aren't pleasant but what you said about ingredients under 2% not requiring labelling isnt correct. People with allergies would die as a result of nuts etc not labelled in that case.

1311351154983473152 2020-10-01 01:04:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Niall_Boylan I doubt you would find a single person in the country surprised by this!

1311343314042576897 2020-10-01 00:33:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ozzyheather @Thorgwen Environmental Health routinely take samples for testing. The FSAI are a good source of information &amp; any company I have worked for adhere to the food laws completely. I have never heard of this about ingredients below 2%, that could kill someone if it were nuts, sesame etc.

For gluten it has to be below 20 parts per million so certainly there would be no way 2% of cereal containing gluten could be left off the label.

The ingredients legislation has become increasingly strict in the last ten years. Apart from processing aids, everything must be listed.

I won't be consenting to these vaccines but I'm also afraid that the schools will say they aren't permitted to attend if the haven't had it? You don't know how far they will go to force it on people. The GP bonus scheme shows they are pushing it hard.

1310617057571098631 2020-09-29 00:27:11 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LouiseMMallo8 They are profiting highly from this and the few doctors who have spoken out have been slated. Lots of bonuses await them now for the flu vaccines.
1310596125196460035 2020-09-28 23:04:00 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jacklllllllllll @Niall_Boylan They seem dead set about these county restrictions. I hope you're right.
1310595424445755393 2020-09-28 23:01:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Jacklllllllllll @Niall_Boylan Absolutely, it's a joke at this stage 7 months on.

1310582673052774400 2020-09-28 22:10:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Mountai61137001 Sadly more people don't do that. A lot of people seem to be blanketly believing everything they are told these days.

Simply surprised at his rapid recovery and I asked a genuine question if it was confirmed by medical professionals. Perhaps read a little more clearly before jumping to conclusions.
1310573632729632768 2020-09-28 21:34:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Mountai61137001 I completely agree and all retweeted to his own political page of course.
1310572778534457344 2020-09-28 21:31:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Embee_effect @benquigley00 Because he was still tweeting other people after those tweets were posted and retweeting his messages on his own political page. It can be seen on the timeline. Is this really a question?! Come on 😂😂😂
1310568066993061888 2020-09-28 21:12:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @brigadoon69 @benquigley00 Says the person who's being verbally abusive to me on Twitter. How ironic.

1310508206054084608 2020-09-28 17:14:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LouiseMMallo8 Exactly, I certainly wouldn't expect the world to shut down and childrens future destroyed for my 80 year old ass!
1310505552569659392 2020-09-28 17:04:06 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LouiseMMallo8 Ah but now you'll get the 'are you saying their lives do not matter' tweets. This 7 month farce is destroying the lives of everyone.

He has radio interview offers so I would hope a doctors confirmation is requested for the sake of accurate reporting. Glad to see that quite a few people are questioning this. We are well within our rights to do so.

I'm well aware of technology but I seriously doubt this lad used voice activated dictation to tweet. You're clutching at straws there, try harder 🙄
1310499783048605696 2020-09-28 16:41:10 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @TyroneGoldberg3 Not that I think they should ever wear masks. This is getting crazier by the day.
1310499552814923779 2020-09-28 16:40:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @TyroneGoldberg3 Plenty of space there. Why the masks?

Just a random tweet off someone with a political agenda on twitter. He's even retweeting to his own political page but yes, let's just believe every single word shall we 👍

1310347833195798530 2020-09-28 06:37:23 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @kirs2016 @benquigley00 Not quite buying this until confirmed. He was on twitter abusing people within hours.
1310340131665174529 2020-09-28 06:06:46 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MillieByrne12 Plus there's his political blog that he's currently retweeting himself on. Why do people buy this stuff without question?
1310335045979209735 2020-09-28 05:46:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @wakeywakies Jaysus her eyes are half masked up, is that what's new in the new normal?
1310332252317011968 2020-09-28 05:35:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @FatEmperor Seeing the frustration increasing in people's comments. Hard to believe how the data is being presented/misinterpreted in Ireland. If this went forward for a masters/PhD thesis it would be thrown out before they even got to the viva stage. Nothing can be defended scientifically.
1310330578739376129 2020-09-28 05:28:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir Anyone can get themselves into hospital these days if covid has been confirmed. They believe anything the patient says.
1310330127755157505 2020-09-28 05:27:01 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @RedRascal_ @benquigley00 Yes, he possibly is.
1310328383180505088 2020-09-28 05:20:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir Hoping to make a few quid, get a few paid radio interviews out of it. He's tweeting abusively to people right now. If I thought I was dying I wouldn't be tweeting away within hours. Could a medical professional also confirm covid caused his episode before everyone believes this.
1310326944928591873 2020-09-28 05:14:23 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir I didn't even know about that side of it, seems completely staged. He's going 90 on twitter, mocking people and all. If you're in hospital hours after paralysis thats the last thing on your mind. But yet - majority of people eating it all right up 😕
1310325930418675714 2020-09-28 05:10:21 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @VLicked @andrewlufclad Exactly, look at his activity he's mocking people and everything. I've been in a hospital bed sick, you don't think of your phone let alone go 90 on twitter.
1310323999801516037 2020-09-28 05:02:40 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Quite a few of this type of comment since the €20k was suggested for people to influence young people on covid safety. Very quick turn around to go from deaths door to being extremely active on twitter. Maybe I'm wrong but this is very strange. Get well soon either way.
1310322012628320256 2020-09-28 04:54:47 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @benquigley00 You came around quite quickly if you're able to go on twitter and type this message just hours later. Quick turn around from deaths door to perfectly functional. Has it been confirmed that covid is the cause of this illness?
1310321515058130945 2020-09-28 04:52:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @cassia_tweets @benquigley00 Exactly! Deaths door to perfectly functional.
1310307586344976384 2020-09-28 03:57:27 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @PCiekawa @B1KER42 @gerry_truthvet @Niall_Boylan @MaryLouMcDonald Yes of course I'm aware of that. But this is in relation to repaying tax at a later date in addition to the usual tax rate. Our tax credits are significantly reduced so we will be down on salary for a number of years. Your comment is not in relation to the same subject.
1310298016268550150 2020-09-28 03:19:25 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Lady_FMP @case7877 @rtenews Seriously, you're clutching at straws there with that response 😂 The total as it stands is incorrect and is to be reviewed as they stated. This is complete time wasting, the conversation was had months ago.
1310295551347433473 2020-09-28 03:09:38 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Lady_FMP @case7877 @rtenews Theres your source.  https://t.co/4mwndLbABe
1310295040334454785 2020-09-28 03:07:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Lady_FMP @case7877 @rtenews Leo Varadkar stated it months ago. It's a well known fact &amp; people have been debating it for months. You clearly aren't following the news. Why don't you spend your time educating yourself on the matter then trying to pick arguments on twitter.
1310294621952659458 2020-09-28 03:05:56 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @B1KER42 @gerry_truthvet @Niall_Boylan @MaryLouMcDonald Thanks, I feel terrible for all of the people in this position. Its really taking its toll now. Never would have imagined 7 months of it.
1310291403075878920 2020-09-28 02:53:09 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @B1KER42 @gerry_truthvet @Niall_Boylan @MaryLouMcDonald Exactly, I never wanted to be on it, I want to be working. I got back to work for a few months but the Dublin restrictions on the hospitality sector means I've had to reapply for PUP.
1310291032274276353 2020-09-28 02:51:40 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @B1KER42 @gerry_truthvet @Niall_Boylan @MaryLouMcDonald Can't see many having a lump sum after half the year being down on income! What a mess.
1310288152511250433 2020-09-28 02:40:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Lady_FMP @case7877 @rtenews No I'm not. There were several hundred of them wrongly classed as covid as Leo Varadkar himself pointed out. Those numbers were not removed from the total deaths so its false.
1310286400793739264 2020-09-28 02:33:16 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @B1KER42 @gerry_truthvet @Niall_Boylan @MaryLouMcDonald So someone working part time on lower pay won't have to pay it back even though they benefited most from the PUP? Those with higher incomes lost wages &amp; next year lose more wages to repay it? Sounds Irish alright! 😔
1310280907576741889 2020-09-28 02:11:26 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @gerry_truthvet @Niall_Boylan @MaryLouMcDonald Those in receipt of PUP will be taxed on it next year so that is a percentage of it repayed. So much money could be saved and taxes generated if they just let each sector open up like other countries.
1310269283239374855 2020-09-28 01:25:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DublinMuppet @Independent_ie 🤣👏
1310268686264078347 2020-09-28 01:22:53 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @GOLD_EN_ARMS That is awful. Falsely categorising deaths as covid takes from the statistics and research of the actual cause of death. Sorry to hear that happened to your neighbour, they are right to fight it.
1310252060936372225 2020-09-28 00:16:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> This is shocking. The recent deaths aren't happening in hospital settings and we are being zero details despite our livelihoods being taken from us for 7 months.

1310219449702678530 2020-09-27 22:07:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @fionamflanagan1 How come we could maul every product in Dunnes, Also, Tesco etc but we can barely touch other items? I had to buy a hob in Powercity, the whole shop closed off, can't look at anything unless you specifically ask &amp; are escorted to it followed by swiftly escorting you out.

I had experiences with several staff actually shouting at me when I wasn't breaking any guidelines. I was collecting a package &amp; told I wasn't permitted to buy food afterwards in a tone as if I was a bold child so I stopped going.

1310138893061304322 2020-09-27 16:47:07 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LovinDublin 'Mixed' reaction is a complete overstatement. Pretty much all but a couple of comments thought it was a ridiculous post and disagreed with @StefPreissner
1310135639619272704 2020-09-27 16:34:12 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @case7877 @rtenews We're losing our livelihoods &amp; getting into massive debt that will take years to repay &amp; for what? There is no justification for how extreme the restrictions are especially based on data below. Almost 7 months, when are we going to collectively say NO? We can't keep doing this.  https://t.co/d96TXBB0pi

1309976586767212547 2020-09-27 06:02:11 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @YeyesShamrock It makes a point to those enforcing the restrictions, who do apparently care about the 'pandemic' as they're paid to do so.
1309973240094371841 2020-09-27 05:48:53 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @YeyesShamrock It's recorded to highlight what is going on. Are we all meant to pretend its not happening? Out of sight out of mind?

I think more people are starting to change their opinions though and wanting to get back to life without restrictions. Hold on in there &amp; look after yourself Ben. You aren't alone in feeling this way.
1309958251325329409 2020-09-27 04:49:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 I know it just eats up your energy at this point. Not sure if it's just me but I'm starting to see things turn a little bit now? More people seeing through this &amp; wanting restrictions lifted? Hopefully we're finally getting somewhere.
1309956110158307331 2020-09-27 04:40:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 Not really, it was a small enough TV series set in Dublin. It was on Netflix, quite lighthearted, unlike herself by the looks of it. Covid has everyone gone demented.
1309955058075869184 2020-09-27 04:36:38 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 Have you seen Can't Cope, Won't Cope? She wrote the script, it's actually quite good I hate to admit after seeing her attitude against the public today.
1309954574531407873 2020-09-27 04:34:43 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Niall_Boylan @StefPreissner She's an author and wrote the script for Can't Cope, Won't Cope tv series. Not sure she falls into the 'influencer' category but she seems to be well known by some.

That is so wrong! Glad to see that the majority of comments were in disagreement with her. Sad.

1309947542851981315 2020-09-27 04:06:46 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @frauke_baecker @DavQuinn That's a ridiculous statement. Nobody has said anything of the sort, you're hearing what you want to hear. Good luck.
1309947228757336067 2020-09-27 04:05:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leeser4 @Niall_Boylan Same with myself, the company can't take the constant loss of sales as a result of restrictions. Every time Dublin is put under restrictions I'll be laid off again. It also takes time after restrictions are lifted for sales to pick up. No business can sustain this.
1309945580886646784 2020-09-27 03:58:58 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @frauke_baecker @DavQuinn This has been widely debated for months. Taking into account the total deaths per year, 2020 is not significantly different to any other year. The elderly/vulnerable need to be protected but those who work shouldn't have their livelihoods taken from them, it will do more damage.
1309942710963441665 2020-09-27 03:47:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @DavQuinn The new abnormal 😔
1309942379819008002 2020-09-27 03:46:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @frauke_baecker @DavQuinn My comment was in relation to those at the end of their lives with underlying conditions which is why I mentioned age along with it (Median age 84) . Unlikely they would live another 20rs if that age &amp; with underlying conditions. Most of the deaths in Ireland were in this group.
1309940613924769793 2020-09-27 03:39:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @CovidSenseBloke Didn't we try something along those lines and it didn't work?! 😂 When are people going to understand that lockdowns do more damage then good, they will never eradicate the virus.
1309939657778528258 2020-09-27 03:35:26 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @frauke_baecker @DavQuinn They aren't reporting it that way though. I know someone who was in their final weeks of cancer, had recovered from covid and died from the cancer complications yet covid on the death cert. This has been done in many cases and Varadkar himself acknowledged that.
1309939057028411392 2020-09-27 03:33:03 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leeser4 @Niall_Boylan Thats dreadful David sorry to hear that. I've always thought it a horrible position to be in to be interviewing again for your own job, I've been in that position myself. I hope your job is safe as it can be, I don't think many have job security these days sadly.
1309936868620894215 2020-09-27 03:24:21 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @frauke_baecker @DavQuinn Surely if you have been following the news you would be aware of this. Several hundred overestimated deaths which were not directly due to Covid, so yes that does matter when healthy people have their livelihoods taken from them, the economy decimated &amp; endless restrictions.
1309936389904105472 2020-09-27 03:22:27 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @frauke_baecker @DavQuinn Many of the deaths were of elderly people who died with Covid not FROM it as they had other conditions which caused the death. Also some recovered from the virus then died later of other causes and we're still noted as covid. Leo Varadkar admitted the overestimation.

1309926864010575872 2020-09-27 02:44:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DavQuinn Any more details on the deaths, are they happening in care homes mostly because they are not being reported from hospitals? Also the ages and underlying conditions?

1309907463022534659 2020-09-27 01:27:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @pollymac65 @Niall_Boylan The public sector aren't uniting with us though that is the problem. Many are even happy with this as they can work from home. I do understand what you mean about the divide though and these local lockdowns have counties pited against each other, it's really sad.
1309900831962075136 2020-09-27 01:01:09 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @StefPreissner @elehutch Ring the Garda then Stefanie and let them deal with the numbers, it's not your job. From the comments on this post most are disagreeing with you, what a ridiculous post! I can't believe attitudes like this, really pathetic.

1309827194760368129 2020-09-26 20:08:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AngelOnTheEdge1 Common sense is rare now &amp; let's be honest, when did anyone ever really care that much about complete strangers? Most people aren't heartless but we've been raised to care for ourselves &amp; those close to us primarily &amp; expect strangers to be doing the same not worrying about you.

Even zero isn't achievable any time soon especially with a method that produces false positives as confirmed by HSE.
1309441568139509761 2020-09-25 18:36:12 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @dclarke1984 @rtenews Because they are wasting the money testing healthy people with no symptoms instead. Pointless waste of money when they could invest it into something which would last long term.

1309378755564113921 2020-09-25 14:26:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @PaulL_London Lockdowns do not work. We can't function in a lockdown world &amp; once we starting living again cases rise as they are now. There is a 99.83% survival rate so no justification. Sweden are out the other side now with total deaths not higher than any other year. Lockdowns don't work.
1309377080539389952 2020-09-25 14:19:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @PaulL_London I see you are in the UK, are we even talking about the same thing. I'm speaking of the Irish government and the restrictions here are the harshest in the world for some areas. It is destroying us. The scientific data does not justify the decisions. Have a good day.
1309376457156767746 2020-09-25 14:17:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @PaulL_London It's not good for me. I've lost a job it took me years doing a PhD to get. Lockdowns don't work, I'm a scientist, you don't know what I 'claim', I look at the data accurately &amp; Ireland is managing this to harshly &amp; a huge amount of people are &amp; will suffer.
1309374121688674304 2020-09-25 14:08:12 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @PaulL_London Great Paul, I'll just tell my bank that when I can't pay my bills &amp; all will be good 👍 At the end of the day we can control the destruction of the economy so more lives aren't ruined but the Irish government currently do not care about that and our children are going to suffer.
1309227625240563731 2020-09-25 04:26:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @IrishTimes Never knew we had so many hypochondriacs. 98% of tests being done are negative and of the 2% remaining that includes false positives.

Many businesses like cafes would have been closed by the time the announcement was made so zero notice. Unacceptable considering they likely got deliveries of fresh food today for the weekend. I feel for everyone being treated this way, it is wrong.

1309096762519564288 2020-09-24 19:46:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @BarbaraMcMahon8 @IrishTimes Same with myself. They clearly couldn't care less about this massive sector.

1309059533587779587 2020-09-24 17:18:08 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @kendratheaker @Ryanair That's desperate, so frustrating. I've two bookings with them at the moment, I'm sorry I bothered booking, it's more hassle than its worth. Hope you get it sorted.

Front line workers they have called themselves. Self entitlement to the extreme! I didn't know that about the mortgages, says a lot about their job security!
1308890521738326016 2020-09-24 06:06:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ijXjf8OGHkooKbF @Reelmammy Agreed. It also must be amazing for them to be in a job that no matter what happens they still are guaranteed their full wage while the rest of us are cut to PUP €300 at the drop of a hat &amp; potentially losing our jobs completely.
1308889330929332226 2020-09-24 06:01:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @thejournal_ie Why because they had 15 customers outdoors and one staff member which made 16?   Bars and restaurants desperately trying to make a living in Dublin this week and Garda on their back on the basis of unclear and unnecessary restrictions.

1308873881617395712 2020-09-24 05:00:25 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MarmaladeMax @FatEmperor This would be my guess - covering themselves by being overcautious to deflect from their bad decision making regarding nursing homes in March.
1308867806910394369 2020-09-24 04:36:17 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @agentofhonesty @DavQuinn Spot on. They have been covering themselves since the nursing home disasterous decision making.

1308856260440268800 2020-09-24 03:50:24 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DavQuinn It appears that they couldn't care less about the loss of livelihoods of private sector workers &amp; the effect on our lives, mental health &amp; non-covid illness. What happened to 'living along side the virus' ? We certainly aren't 'in this together' anymore. This has gone too far.
1308853418644123653 2020-09-24 03:39:06 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Nimmermaximum @thejournal_ie It's what they have been trying to condition us towards since March. Insanity. They missed out on the opportunity of gradual herd immunity throughout the spring &amp; summer and now we have to deal with the consequences of their bad management of this.
1308852501710598150 2020-09-24 03:35:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AndyMcCourt32 @Niall_Boylan If this continues into 2021 everyone in the country will be affected. The governments endless loans will also dry up eventually. I hope you are right &amp; that the change comes soon but to date, people are bowing down to every pointless restriction.

These Dublin restrictions have landed me out of work again, but realistically what can we do? If businesses just close as employees we are powerless. I wish everyone would just stand against this together.

All of the closed sectors need to get together &amp; fight but there are too many fanatics pro-restrictions/lockdowns that we're in the minority. We need more people to wake up.
1308768682995331075 2020-09-23 22:02:24 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @OldNormality @MillieByrne12 @fionamflanagan1 Well their funding to support the industry is grossly exaggerated. We were down €160,000 before the latest restrictions &amp; we've received a €6000 grant to purchase a machine. It doesn't even begin to fill the hole they've dug. Business owners need to stand up to this together.
1308766631888392195 2020-09-23 21:54:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @OldNormality @MillieByrne12 @fionamflanagan1 It's just taking too long to hit home. Many in the private sector are at rock bottom already without these further lockdowns. Time is running out for many businesses.

In that time the average private sector businesses will be fully decimated. Its senseless.

I've noticed more media reports which appear to show people starting to wake up, but when will there be enough of a turn to get us out of this??  The lockdowns of entire business sectors needs to stop.

1308731330843365376 2020-09-23 19:33:58 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir And how long do we give it until they try put masks outdoors upon us? Mid-October?
1308731047090290690 2020-09-23 19:32:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir If it meant the hospitality sector could open until a certain time I'd actually go with the curfew rather than blanket closures. I actually thought these measures were resigned to the history books, I still can't get my head to accept the fact that this is actually happening
1308729455955898368 2020-09-23 19:26:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir They seem to be loving every minute of their control.

1308499114804613125 2020-09-23 04:11:14 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @paulreiddublin @HSELive This proves nothing. 98% of tests are negative &amp; hundreds per week are false positives.

1308434596837679106 2020-09-22 23:54:52 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @case7877 The unemployed benefit, now €300, doesn't even cover the outgoings of those of us who were working. It's not feasible, the economy is going to collapse &amp; we will be unemployed long term. Covid isn't going anywhere soon either. All that we worked for gone 🤷
1308410880896442369 2020-09-22 22:20:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @case7877 It's devistating. The company I work for was closed for 17 weeks, we finally got back about 40% of the business but we supply the hospitality industry so yet again we're gone again. We can't just keep doing cycles of lockdown like this, it's destroying us.
1308407771247894530 2020-09-22 22:08:16 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @case7877 Absolutely. It's amazing how many people appear to be completely clueless to that fact these days. They aren't thinking rationally at all, but maybe they never could.

She comes on here just to wind people up to try make herself look big, it's pretty pathetic and not worth anyones time!

1308349478089494529 2020-09-22 18:16:38 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @fionamflanagan1 I'm back unemployed again, 20 weeks so far this year. I've had 2 weeks on my normal wage since March. I would do anything to work, their €300 payment means nothing to me, I'm still down money &amp; I'd rather work for it. Depressed at home.
1308342690224971777 2020-09-22 17:49:39 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Scorpian661 @fionamflanagan1 I'm the same, woke this morning thinking it can't possibly be true but unfortunately it is. Its like a nightmare. I work for a supplier to the hospitality industry, job gone yet again! 20+ weeks unemployed this year so far...
1308306009518157826 2020-09-22 15:23:54 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 @thejournal_ie Sounds like they are saying you can return to work part time and not lose the full payment, probably get 1/5th payment for the unworked days like the casual worker payment. The whole thing is a mess, just let businesses open we just want to work as normal.
1308305360588017669 2020-09-22 15:21:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 @rtenews They can shove it.

I have two young children, but we don't matter. This has to be dealt with realistically, they are destroying our futures not saving lives.
1308118173984731136 2020-09-22 02:57:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @GrahamOhare Thanks Graham, I hope it passes soon I'm more than fed up at this stage.

1308098820132212736 2020-09-22 01:40:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy @DavQuinn It's awful but we just want to be allowed open and work. I can bring my children to school in the morning but I can't go to work to earn a living to pay our bills? It makes zero sense.
1308094379022856194 2020-09-22 01:22:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy @DavQuinn The 'support packages' don't even begin to fill the hole they dug for companies. The business I work for lost €160K so far &amp; got a €6K grant for a machine. The covid payment still leaves our staff in massive debt each month, we are unemployed again due to the new restrictions.

1308036014582177792 2020-09-21 21:31:02 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 Thank you. I'm livid but I'm not surprised. My language has been shocking today, I never realised what a foul mouth I can have 😂😂😂
1308024655622688785 2020-09-21 20:45:54 +0800 <Sabdublindr> So thanks to the government I've been made unemployed yet again. I have had 2 weeks on my normal wage since March. The measures they are taking are not saving people, they are destroying our lives, livelihoods &amp; future of our children, ultimately to cover their own ars*s.

1307761114034384902 2020-09-21 03:18:41 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 I was scrubbing like a mad thing yesterday! Got so much done that I had feck all to do today but drink gin!! 🤣
1307760706071285768 2020-09-21 03:17:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Allycon3 Much more then that if you take into account their suppliers; the food manufacturers, producers, delivery drivers etc. There is a knock on effect to the whole supply chain.

1307717753357373443 2020-09-21 00:26:23 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @fionamflanagan1 So petrified of getting it depite there being a 99.83% survival rate (with grossly overestimated mortality numbers) that they are forgetting to live. Sad times, government and media have won with so many people but I hope they are starting to wake up.
1307717082545610755 2020-09-21 00:23:43 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @CatrionaColllns I was there today, thought it was heartbreaking seeing restaurants forced to fit as many tables as they could out on the pathways in this dreary weather. People desperately trying to earn a living. There is no need for it, it feels like a bad dream.
1307715838955466752 2020-09-21 00:18:46 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @GuyNAustin @FatEmperor He has been drafted by the government to brainwash the nation.
1307715293616246788 2020-09-21 00:16:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DonnellyStephen @President_MU If you want to save lives stop taking our livelihoods away from us. You're alright sitting on your fat wage and pension but you're leaving millions of people in massive debt.

You were right to highlight this and inform your solicitor. Don't let it get you down, that's what the mindset of these people want and you're better then that.

1307615148727775233 2020-09-20 17:38:40 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DavQuinn @SunTimesIreland I'm not overly religious myself, but taking the Church away from people yet again is just out and out cruelty.
1307614688788860928 2020-09-20 17:36:50 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leeser4 @ItaOKelly Absolutely. There will be significantly more non-covid deaths as a result of these measures, ultimately they aren't saving lives they are just covering their ar**s.
1307610611472314374 2020-09-20 17:20:38 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leeser4 @ItaOKelly I think this will be like earlier in the year, they will stretch the Dublin lockdown til after the Bank Holiday and then conveniently include Halloween to try keep us in. I wake in the morning thinking it can't be true what's going on, it's just bizarre to live this.
1307609960596090882 2020-09-20 17:18:03 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leeser4 @ItaOKelly My mother in law is making her own decisions. She wears the mask, follows distancing etc but she's not following the cocooning advice. She needs to get out if only to collect her pension/do the lotto. Its so sad to see people that age depressed.
1307603931560923137 2020-09-20 16:54:06 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leeser4 @ItaOKelly My mother in law is feeling the same David, its very sad. All of this is taking very valuable time away for us but its especially hard for those who don't have many years left and have no option only to waste it sitting at home.

1307395228589006849 2020-09-20 03:04:47 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy I'll probably get them in earlier than usual. Might even get some delivered. Definitely takes the excitement away.

1307274440045146115 2020-09-19 19:04:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> Mood for today. Feeling further from normal than I did in March. This government Living with Covid plan is going to render us into &amp; endless loop of lockdowns, it's written vaguely specifically to do so. NPHET are creating a bigger disaster than covid itself.  https://t.co/menBjSvxXC
1307271544004136962 2020-09-19 18:53:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JOBIEofficial @MichealMartinTD @LeoVaradkar @LVADublinPubs @TheAngryBarten3 @dougleddin @rtenews @TheEchoOnline @Kala_Management @CrossyTweets This is desperate but we also need to ask the government to be realistic in their decision making. They are at fault here too, they can't just blame the public. Closing restaurants &amp; pubs which were not the source of spread is just going to drive people to meet in their homes.
1307263274879197184 2020-09-19 18:20:27 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DavQuinn Anyone any idea what numbers will allow us back to level 2? We have to face that there will be a number of cases for the foreseeable future.
1307262613781389312 2020-09-19 18:17:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DaveyDonn Even more nonsense is being forced to dine outdoors in weather like this. People are going to end up with more colds!
1307246039242616833 2020-09-19 17:11:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @BrendanWilde2 I wouldn't either, I hope you enjoy every minute Brendan.

1307243069876600833 2020-09-19 17:00:09 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Nimmermaximum @fcraul2 @IrishTimes They will all be clubbed into the covid category, there seems to be no accountability to establish the actual cause of death. As a scientist I cannot get my head around the inaccuracy of it all and more so, how they are getting away with it?
1307234780157747200 2020-09-19 16:27:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy These people are headcases just on here to vent their lunacy. I ignore anyone like this now, they aren't worth your time or energy of being frustrated on!

Nobody would think big company jobs would be affected but they are, it all trickles back to source or in this case it will be an avalanche if it keeps going as it is 😔
1307077155801751553 2020-09-19 06:00:52 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 It's OK to complain, you've a young baby and only back from maternity. We are allowed feel normal emotions too, it's hard on everyone so vent all you like 🙂 I've always hated seeing anyone losing their job, these new restrictions are a step too far.
1307074895533273088 2020-09-19 05:51:54 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @erinstephanie84 One of so many. This is devistating, nobody should lose their livelihood like this 😔
1307069407873708032 2020-09-19 05:30:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Honestjane69 My post even says I was bringing the kids on Sunday not tonight. And the HISTORY museum doesn't hold art 🤣🤣🤣
1307068745190432771 2020-09-19 05:27:27 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Honestjane69 ?????? I am talking about closures in Dublin and how illogical it is. My job is also at stake! I've had two proper weeks wages since March and now face more unemployment. My point is they are preventing us doing anything.
1307068031479283718 2020-09-19 05:24:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @mickdela @LVADublinPubs @VFIpubs The whole supply chain to the hospitality industry is destroyed. I work for a manufacturer who supply to this industry and we are in the same boat. Devistating news to all those affected, very disappointed with the government's decisions.
1307065486480375809 2020-09-19 05:14:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DaveyDonn Ah, a fellow D8-er! I hope you're going somewhere nice if you're leaving us. I would say I'm not jealous, but I am 😊
1307064581815250944 2020-09-19 05:10:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy You definitely will get to dine out again. This shit storm is clinging on but it won't hold forever. Happy birthday to the hubby &amp; don't forget to enjoy all the little things with him &amp; your child. I'm reminding myself of the same, I need to stop wishing time away &amp; try live 🎂💝

1307062073986351106 2020-09-19 05:00:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> I had the National History Museum booked to bring my children on Sunday. Got an email this evening to state its cancelled as they have been forced to close. Where is the logic in closing museums? And how ironic this happens on 'Culture Night' when it's being taken away from us!!  https://t.co/YYdwir85iG

A percentage of the billions spent on testing people with no symptoms could have been put to use increasing hospital capacity which would also have been a long term investment but no.
1307056809623027714 2020-09-19 04:40:02 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @pania_12 @DonnellyStephen Yes, that is very very clear! They have not lost a cent, while the majority of workers made unemployed by this are drowning.
1307056083618402306 2020-09-19 04:37:08 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DonnellyStephen How are we meant to pay our bills indefinitely on €300 a week? People are tens of thousands in debt already. We can't go on like this, this government are making terrible decisions and destroying lives. Mass loss of livelihoods is the distaster, not the virus.
1307055565856739331 2020-09-19 04:35:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DonnellyStephen You are destroying the country not saving lives. Those of us losing our jobs are in shock again right now, it's not the time for another of your heartless posts.

None of that goes to us employees who are down €1000s every month. And the company I work for got €6000 grant when they are down €160,000! Didn't even begin to fill the hole they dug us.

1307048076184616960 2020-09-19 04:05:19 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Honestjane69 I'm so stunned by this today I haven't even opened the bottle yet! Its soul destroying.
1307047219137314821 2020-09-19 04:01:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leeser4 @Niall_Boylan Easier for them to blame the people than accept responsibility for poor and lazy decision making. Cowards.
1307046713530765313 2020-09-19 03:59:54 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @fuming_larry I'm sorry Larry I feel your pain &amp; frustration. I was off since March, managed to get back to work with only the last 2 weeks being back to my normal wage now this. There's too many people so petrified of dying that they are forgetting to live. Hope things improve for you.

1307033797322510338 2020-09-19 03:08:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leannemac4 @Honestjane69 @JohnLalor18 @gavreilly @VirginMediaNews My job will be completely gone if they keep this up. They keep saying they have funding to pump into companies but we have lost €160,000 so far and been given €6,000 in grant form for a new machine. It doesn't begin to fill the hole they've dug for us.

Its too much effort to go outside the county for a few hours. Looks like I'll be in the kitchen after all, but I WILL be having the drinks 😂😂
1307032175607525379 2020-09-19 03:02:08 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Honestjane69 @leannemac4 @JohnLalor18 @gavreilly @VirginMediaNews I'll be doing what I want in Dublin too but sadly what I really wanted was to go for a planned dinner and few drinks on Sunday 😡 Don't know if I'll end up out of work again too from next week as we supply the hospitality sector.

1306993305947975681 2020-09-19 00:27:41 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy @HealthFreedomIE And realistically how many pubs and restaurants have outdoor dining? Or at least enough seating capacity to make it worth opening and paying staff to work. This is hideous.
1306992155475480577 2020-09-19 00:23:07 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DaveyDonn I wish I had the option to leave myself. You're right to do so if you can. It's all very disheartening.

This won't be 3 weeks either, it'll linger on like March and we'll be in and out of it well into next year. I managed to get two weeks wages back to my normal level since March and I could be out of work again from next week thanks to their ridiculous decisions.
1306985499060506629 2020-09-18 23:56:40 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AndyMcCourt32 @christinafinn8 Its extremely frustrating. Their first time to implement their own plan and they've already broken it.
1306982941155889152 2020-09-18 23:46:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @christinafinn8 That's not level 3 then, it's level 4 to 5.

1306951813271298048 2020-09-18 21:42:48 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MickO_Keeffe She looks like an avid cyclist alright.

It looks indoors, would it not make sense to have it outside so those who wear &amp; forgot their mask can buy one before going in? Second thoughts, mask wears would never forget their masks 🤦

1306898245902315522 2020-09-18 18:09:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @citizensinfo Except 30% of the Irish population are about to be told we are a mix of Level 3/4/5. Shove your restrictions at this stage, forcing so many of us back into unemployment. It's gone beyond a joke.
1306897128472621056 2020-09-18 18:05:31 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @PaulODonoghue4 @rtenews Logic doesn't seem to come into it at all.

No doubt he is successful but he's using that success in the wrong context &amp; for his own interests not the publics &amp; certainly not the economy.

1306866515774451714 2020-09-18 16:03:52 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @tuffy_sir @M4ttmc87 @LVADublinPubs Exactly, my PhD is more in line with this than his (microbiology with some epidemiology) but I still wouldn't even attempt to get a platform like he is doing if I still worked in academia. Hes only out for his vested interests &amp; I imagine trying to go for full professorship.
1306864107916865536 2020-09-18 15:54:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @LVADublinPubs That Mirror headline is misleading and wrong. Thats the reason Gillian McKeith was told to drop the Doctor because she has a PhD in nutrition or something like that but the public were taking her advice as if she were a medical doctor. Ryan is all ego!
1306863507074437120 2020-09-18 15:51:55 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @LVADublinPubs The way they are using the title is wrong. Those with PhDs can use Dr before their name on paper but the full name is used 'Dr Tomas Ryan'. 'Dr Ryan' suggests a medical doctor which is misleading. Thats how my PhD supervisor explained it to me, its the context its used in.
1306860947076718592 2020-09-18 15:41:44 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @LVADublinPubs He knows that agenda will keep this going indefinitely. He will have a rake load of PhD students frantically publishing papers on it so he can apply for a Professorship. Meanwhile, the rest of us struggle to make our normal weeks wage.
1306859965076910080 2020-09-18 15:37:50 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @fionamflanagan1 This is true, reduced occupancy with these distancing measures, masks and forced closures are here indefinitely. We will never get out of Level 1 as its specifically designed to keep us failing, endless lockdown loop ahead. They have destroyed the hospitality industry.
1306859240884244480 2020-09-18 15:34:57 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @LVADublinPubs Tomas Ryan is only interested in raising his own profile to obtain funding to keep his research team going. They don't factor the economy, tax payers money just gets pumped into their sector. Mentality like his is why I left academics &amp; moved to the private sector. Insane times.
1306857122244820995 2020-09-18 15:26:32 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @M4ttmc87 @LVADublinPubs I know Matt its ridiculous. Currently sitting in work wondering if I'll be back unemployed again by the end of the day. House parties are the source we're told but lets close the pubs and restaurants which are a more controlled environment forcing people to meet at home again!
1306842080698945539 2020-09-18 14:26:46 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @jimmymunro80 @rtenews Ah sure why not, go for a mix of level 3 and level 5. Its only peoples livelihoods they are playing around with!!
1306713884460449793 2020-09-18 05:57:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy Because that would be common sense and no sense exists anymore. We now live off 'what ifs' and mathematical modelling projections when mathematical modelling doesn't actually work well for biological systems especially as human behaviour has too many variables.
1306708957172555776 2020-09-18 05:37:47 +0800 <Sabdublindr> 😂😂 I actually needed this laugh!  https://t.co/2THItdD2CN

1306705622914736130 2020-09-18 05:24:32 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy Yes, that must have been it! Its actually the very reason I moved from academics to the private sector. Game playing isn't my thing and these 'academics' in the media are only trying to raise their profile to get endless funding to secure their work indefinitely.
1306705014598127619 2020-09-18 05:22:07 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ClaireyyM @rtenews Everything they have said is contradictory. I've lost all faith in their decision making, really disappointed with how things are going.
1306704729712590848 2020-09-18 05:20:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @NewstalkFM Building natural immunity is the only way out of this disaster. The virus isn't going anywhere and a rushed vaccine, if it ever is developed, is a risk to anyone who takes it. We need to get on with living.
1306703039500353538 2020-09-18 05:14:16 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy By the way I signed up for that when I was out of work for 17 weeks cos I've a PhD in science and thought I could even do basic lab work and I wasn't qualified according to the HSE on Call for Ireland team!!
1306702596258832385 2020-09-18 05:12:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy 'put'? As if they are pawns on a chess board? How nice of her!!!
1306701332892585985 2020-09-18 05:07:29 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LVADublinPubs 'Living with Covid Plan': make it and break it in the very same week!!  Totally unacceptable.
1306700833040588800 2020-09-18 05:05:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MichaelsCoDub This affects the entire supply chain to restaurants. I work for a manufacturer who supply pubs &amp; restaurants and this will be a shocking blow our company can't take if it comes into affect tomorrow. It just forces people into meeting at home which we are told is the source??!
1306699459766738951 2020-09-18 05:00:03 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DaveyDonn True. I work for a manufacturer that supplies pubs/restaurants so may well be looking at 3 weeks unemployed again (hoping not). It's not just those working directly in those businesses affected, its the whole supply chain it destroys.
1306698888225660931 2020-09-18 04:57:46 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ClaireyyM @rtenews I was clinging for things to do with my kids, simple things like I had the History Museum booked for a visit, can't do that now. Was meeting one family member for a meal out &amp; that may not happen. What's the point anymore? Those things would do no harm.
1306698265451261954 2020-09-18 04:55:18 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy Ahhahahahahaha!!! Are they going to pay our mortgages/rents and bills indefinitely? Because until they do they can piss off out of what happens in my home and I'll also be inviting whoever I want in, none of this no visitor level 4 and 5 bull.
1306697713929662470 2020-09-18 04:53:06 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @DaveyDonn I hope it's the straw that breaks the camels back for them but they just seem to get away with all their ludicrous 'advice'? I really fear that government will agree to this and break their own 'Living with Covid' plan on the very week they published it. I hope I'm wrong.
1306697068862410753 2020-09-18 04:50:33 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ClaireyyM @rtenews I was saying we are just existing bed to work and repeat but now this will mean so many can't even go to work. It's not just those working directly in the pubs and restaurants, it's their suppliers and manufacturers who will also be hit.
1306696435342114819 2020-09-18 04:48:02 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @jimmymunro80 @rtenews A nice ol pick n mix from any of the columns. Playing around with our lives and livelihoods.
1306695505943113728 2020-09-18 04:44:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Niall_Boylan So they can just pick and choose what they want from any of the 5 levels of the 'Living with Covid' plan, a mix and match! They make and break their very own plan in the same week. I hope they don't agree to this NPHET nonsense.
1306689279301689349 2020-09-18 04:19:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LVADublinPubs It's unacceptable to make this 'plan' and then break it in the very same week.
1306688768771055616 2020-09-18 04:17:34 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @CathalKavanagh @liobrien @ClareKx2018 @rtenews Absolutely.

1306685623047258112 2020-09-18 04:05:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @rtenews Won't that lead to people meeting each other in their homes which they have stated is the cause of the problem? This is getting more idiotic by the day.
1306685310210904064 2020-09-18 04:03:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ClareKx2018 @rtenews What are you 5? Terribly childish attitude.
1306684806374346758 2020-09-18 04:01:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @wakeywakies So that they can then be classed as 'wet pubs' which aren't permitted to open in Dublin yet so bingo - all pubs closed! And what does that lead to? People meeting in their homes which they state is the problem. They are getting more stupid by the day.
1306683634565480451 2020-09-18 03:57:10 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @GrahamOhare @thejournal_ie I saw quite a few of these racing through Ballyfermot in rush hour traffic this evening even on the wrong side of the road. Hope the child will be OK, that's awful.

Sad to think it's now rare for presenters not to talk about covid continually. I must look up up Neil, I've never heard his show.
1306663333869826049 2020-09-18 02:36:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @KevinOliver19 @NeilRedFM @Niall_Boylan Also fair play to Classic Hits PJ and Jim for rarely mentioning the dreaded Covid. It's nice to be able switch on the radio without it being the first thing you hear in the morning.
1306662489690693633 2020-09-18 02:33:08 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Honestjane69 @DonnellyStephen And how many false positives?
1306659814039269377 2020-09-18 02:22:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Honestjane69 It's ironic though, out of all those diseases I'd actually chose covid over any of them 🤣
1306659155453841408 2020-09-18 02:19:53 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Honestjane69 Oh 'Disease', quite vague! So the 4 on his list could have any disease .... Herpes, Syphilis, HIV, HPV.... 🤣🤣🤣
1306658259751837698 2020-09-18 02:16:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @AndyMcCourt32 That's the overstatement of the year 🤣🤣 Hilarious that people believe this.

1306646905141760003 2020-09-18 01:31:13 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @IrisOConnor @ExIrishFarRight @rtenews You're twisting things now Iris. Only the Garda have the place to tell people to wear a mask, not you, not me, not anyone but the Garda, that is my point, nothing else.
1306645679440265216 2020-09-18 01:26:20 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LUFC_WorldWide @IrisOConnor @ExIrishFarRight @rtenews No it's not sustainable. Even stopping sports spectators, closing libraries, museums &amp; basically anything social is going to affect mental health so much. We're just existing at the moment, bed to work &amp; repeat (for those who are lucky enough to have their workplace functioning).
1306644685067354114 2020-09-18 01:22:23 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @IrisOConnor @ExIrishFarRight @rtenews No I'm saying it's not your place to enforce it! Are you a member of the Garda?

1306643726543003649 2020-09-18 01:18:35 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LUFC_WorldWide @IrisOConnor @ExIrishFarRight @rtenews I totally agree, the living with covid plan is just going to be an endless loop of restrictions. We are not going to get out of level 1 even. There is no way people are going to comply to the no visitors to their homes in levels 4 and 5. Not 6 months in.
1306641937995370498 2020-09-18 01:11:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ExIrishFarRight @rtenews Agreed. It's specifically designed for us to fail and be kept in this restriction loop for years.

1306154386188632066 2020-09-16 16:54:07 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 We found out through other people, Niall Boylan often said when the deaths were from but like they aren't letting out any info on that now.
1306114909399388167 2020-09-16 14:17:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Ckpainters69 Are the deaths announced the past week from months ago again? We don't hear when they are from anymore.
1306114657824976897 2020-09-16 14:16:15 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy I just want to get out of Ireland for a few days! Feels like all we do is bed to work and repeat. Though, I can't complain about work because I was going insane when my job was closed!
1306110019759468544 2020-09-16 13:57:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy I agree, I can't see us getting back to what we had not even in 2021. Travel abroad is going to be a nightmare for years if not for good like the way 9/11 changed air travel. I'm hoping the fact they're going with the EU travel list that they may have more sense to be fair.
1305980706674401282 2020-09-16 05:23:59 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy Worse in what sense? How much more can they restrict, this is crazy. If they never get their beloved vaccine what life are we in for indefinitely? They should have went with slow herd immunity from the summer months.
1305978540236693510 2020-09-16 05:15:22 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy We can't, they've commited complete control of our lives until next May at least (which will be dragged on). I hope next year isn't a complete write off too like this has been.
1305972506625552384 2020-09-16 04:51:24 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Rock_IRELAND @mybollix @IrishTimes Hard to believe so many without symptoms are volunteering themselves for testing. Are they petrified, hypochondriacs, looking for time off work?!
1305957834111283200 2020-09-16 03:53:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @mybollix @IrishTimes Who are these huge numbers of people with no symptoms who've been getting tested over the past few weeks? I don't understand where the cases are coming from. The only thing that's changed is schools opening so it's it large numbers of families being tested?
1305893055174713350 2020-09-15 23:35:41 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy No Christmas shows or pantos for the kids. Never thought I'd want to go to one, but sad for the kids it made their Christmas last year going to the Cheerios panto.

I just drop my child &amp; go as soon as she's with the teacher as I've another child to get to pre-school. I know they are covering themselves but it seems so bizarre that we are told to mask outdoors. Never would have imagined this!
1304519348623675397 2020-09-12 04:37:04 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @LabhrainS For the parents dropping the kids to school. The yard is huge no need for it especially when it's not manditory outdoors.

I still think this is not acceptable as outdoor mask wearing is not manditory &amp; the yard is large allowing for distancing.

1303381740002709504 2020-09-09 01:16:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @kieran90 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews Nothing happened when the pubs serving food reopened months ago in June.
1303381486712885251 2020-09-09 01:15:36 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Empress22221 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews People are dying? One person, probably from months ago and with underlying conditions. Hundreds of deaths are to be denotified. How many dying from suicide, cancer and other illness as a result of delayed treatment? Lockdown fanatics are selfish.
1303380606236139520 2020-09-09 01:12:06 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @MaviolaH @Corcaigh35 @thejournal_ie 'Possibly' as you said, that's not solid enough evidence to destroy the economy of the country &amp; everyone's futures for. We have to live with it. The current trends are good, young people are either not sick/mild symptoms &amp; the tests are detecting old virus not current illness.
1303379838707871744 2020-09-09 01:09:03 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @Corcaigh35 @thejournal_ie There's 3 people in ICU at the moment. This is going to be with us for years, we have to live with it. Most people are asymptomatic, the tests are detecting old virus not current illness. We can't destroy livelihoods &amp; children's futures. Lockdowns don't work indefinitely.

1303375718097793024 2020-09-09 00:52:41 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @GrahamOhare @rtenews And lockdowns don't work indefinitely as current 'cases' shows. We can't stay locked up forever and destroy our livelihoods, time to live with it.

1303373903679676418 2020-09-09 00:45:28 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ReillyEmlyn @thejournal_ie Pretty much nobody dying from this now (most deaths reported are from months ago). Stop being so selfish.

The words 'parental consent' have not been used in relation to this children's flu vaccination at all, I'm disgusted they think they can make the decision on our behalf.

1303044568624005120 2020-09-08 02:56:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @IrishTimes No.
1303038595394043904 2020-09-08 02:33:05 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @leeser4 @ih8evrybdy Yes the person I know went for 3 tests because the covid isolation payment was more than he earned. He told us yesterday the HSE contacted him again for another test.

1303034009568636929 2020-09-08 02:14:51 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JohnLalor18 Shame on me for not being racist and expressing my opinion? I have worked with many foreign people over the years and they are not as stupid as you are making them out to be. Nobody deserves abuse like that for going to work, you're pure ignorant.
1303032994068860931 2020-09-08 02:10:49 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @SpartanQueen11 @ih8evrybdy I'm not going for one anyway, I wonder can the workplace as for results before allowing you back to work if you are told to be tested. I think results are being given verbally anyway.
1303032585577271296 2020-09-08 02:09:12 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JohnLalor18 Citizens advice website states the isolation payment is still available for those being tested. Foreign people are often the most aware of any entitlements they can get.
1303028412970348544 2020-09-08 01:52:37 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @SpartanQueen11 @ih8evrybdy I would hate to have to stay home while waiting on the results of a test. I dread anyone in my job getting it if they forced us to get tested!
1303027878813106182 2020-09-08 01:50:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @JohnLalor18 @ih8evrybdy @SIPTU Do they not get the €350/week isolation payment from the Welfare still? I knew someone in April who faked symptoms to get two weeks off on that payment and they got it.
1303022604245184514 2020-09-08 01:29:32 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy Who are willingly putting themselves forward for these tests? Are there that many hypochondriacs in the country or are people looking for time off work?

1302516006020145152 2020-09-06 15:56:30 +0800 <Sabdublindr> @ih8evrybdy This whole thing has really brought to light how selfish many teachers are. Their attitude is very disappointing and their responses often very childish if you say something they don't agree with.
