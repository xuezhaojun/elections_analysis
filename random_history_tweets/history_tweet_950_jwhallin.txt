Most of them have already jumped the line to get vaccinated ahead of our front line workers &amp; first responders. BTW, we all know you voted against the relief package to assuage the demands of the fascist RNC mega donors. Bad!

He has no interest in anything else, except becoming a tinpot dictator. Your allegiance to him is a betrayal of our country &amp; Constitution. You’re going to prison, Traitor.
1339197634804809729 2020-12-16 21:16:11 +0800 <jwhallin> @SDBurgher Another grotesque waste of taxpayer $ by a GOP nitwit. Bad!
1339194594722869248 2020-12-16 21:04:07 +0800 <jwhallin> @axios Very.Bad.Idea. A Republican in charge of Commerce is like putting Spanky in charge of our Treasury. Joe is about to have the unhappy awakening  that the GOP has ZERO interest in the working with him, or any other Democrat.

The GOP WILL be gunning for control of both the Senate &amp; House. They’ll pull every dirty trick to win at any cost. Just ask #MoscowMitch.

The question is: Will the Biden admin have Harris function actively as the presiding officer of the Senate?

It is important people understand “how we got here”, and why it is so important we end this wretched betrayal before we all end up as indentured serfs to the power elite.
1338477338569281544 2020-12-14 21:33:59 +0800 <jwhallin> This is an extremely important “read” on the social &amp; economic re-engineering of America  promulgated by the wealthy scions of Vulture Capitalism &amp; related alt-right/fascist institutions. Be prepared to be completely outraged!

1338469031775367169 2020-12-14 21:00:59 +0800 <jwhallin> In short, the GOP is the home office of White Supremacy &amp; Fascism in Amerika. They are hell bent on replacing our Republic with a fascist theocracy. They will destroy the Constitution so they can establish perpetual one-party RULE.

As a Veteran dedicated to the preservation of our Republic, I cannot believe we have so many so ready to destroy everything for an insane wannabe tinpot dictator. We must reset &amp; we do that by bringing these traitors to Justice!
1338134827619373060 2020-12-13 22:52:58 +0800 <jwhallin> There can be no “let bygones be bygones”. Justice must prevail, and for that to happen, the entire RNC/GOP/Russian Mob Fascist Cabal &amp; Crime Syndicate must be completely dismantled, and fully prosecuted for their crimes.

1337760718150541313 2020-12-12 22:06:24 +0800 <jwhallin> @RepJimBaird Your shameless &amp; seditionist act supporting the TX lawsuit is beyond contempt. We will not have a fascist dictatorship in America. Resign immediately. You are unfit to serve in the House!
1337759976186544130 2020-12-12 22:03:27 +0800 <jwhallin> @RepJimBanks You clearly have no understanding of how our Constitution works. The shameful act of supporting this seditionist act is beyond contempt. Resign immediately. You are unfit to sit in the House.
1337759483842289665 2020-12-12 22:01:29 +0800 <jwhallin> The shameful &amp; seditionist act of supporting the TX lawsuit to overturn our election will never be forgotten. Those who did so must resign immediately.
1337758527226429444 2020-12-12 21:57:41 +0800 <jwhallin> I second this motion. It is important the esteemed SOTH send a clear &amp; unequivocal message to those in the GOP who have broken faith with We, The People. They are unfit to be seated in the House.
1337756744584290304 2020-12-12 21:50:36 +0800 <jwhallin> Indeed, they did! Watch as the rabid circus monkey goes into total meltdown.
1337751716553375744 2020-12-12 21:30:38 +0800 <jwhallin> Absolutely! Traitors, all!
1337579211263934464 2020-12-12 10:05:09 +0800 <jwhallin> @maggieNYT Awww! Is Spanky having a pout? How sad...😎  https://t.co/GQPGoD95ea
1337571053749428224 2020-12-12 09:32:44 +0800 <jwhallin> @Becca2885 @tribelaw A waste of time. But, duly noted.
1337570763222601728 2020-12-12 09:31:35 +0800 <jwhallin> @RodneyCaston @CarrieSweet2017 Dude! We’ve had enough nightmares the past 4 years!! 😉
1337570012739989505 2020-12-12 09:28:36 +0800 <jwhallin> Yes!
1337567086764150785 2020-12-12 09:16:58 +0800 <jwhallin> So.True.
1337566850213761024 2020-12-12 09:16:02 +0800 <jwhallin> @abbydphillip Seriously! A complete &amp; total let-down! 😎
1337566645951197185 2020-12-12 09:15:13 +0800 <jwhallin> Throw.Them.Out.
1337565443192627200 2020-12-12 09:10:27 +0800 <jwhallin> @jimsciutto @Carlitav25 Quite a moment in American history? It’s one of its most shameful, and it’s utterly despicable! 126 fascist goons sitting in our House of Representatives is completely unacceptable. I exhort the SOTH to refuse to seat them!
1337564729733070848 2020-12-12 09:07:36 +0800 <jwhallin> I agree 100%! Madam Speaker is well within her rights to refuse to seat these idiots. They are TRAITORS!
1337564364547604480 2020-12-12 09:06:09 +0800 <jwhallin> @tribelaw Damn sad we have 2 fascists on SCOTUS who were willing to let this travesty be heard in their court. Absolutely despicable! But, we’ll take the victory, nonetheless.
1337563813659303936 2020-12-12 09:03:58 +0800 <jwhallin> @OlgaNYC1211 @HouseGOP Speaker Pelosi is well advised to refuse to seat them. They are traitors. They have violated their Oath of Office (those who were re-elected), and they have completely &amp; irrevocably broken faith with We, The People.
1337560346240843778 2020-12-12 08:50:11 +0800 <jwhallin> @thatmarknewman @mmpadellan Seriously! 🤣🤣🤣

1337550844036751360 2020-12-12 08:12:26 +0800 <jwhallin> @GeorgeTakei Don’t faint, George! The best is yet to come... next up is Spanky declaring he has signed a pact with Putin whereby Russia has annexed the U.S., renamed it West Kremlinstan, and made Spanky the Grand Poo-bah of said autocracy. 😎
1337549555944996864 2020-12-12 08:07:19 +0800 <jwhallin> Yaaasss!
1337549325409288192 2020-12-12 08:06:24 +0800 <jwhallin> @KLoeffler @realDonaldTrump We need to vote out all GOP traitors who commit crimes (like insider trading), but insist they are above the law. Get ready for your appointment with the new DOJ AG. You won’t escape Justice in the end.
1337547910485950465 2020-12-12 08:00:46 +0800 <jwhallin> Fire that traitor!
1337547288923664388 2020-12-12 07:58:18 +0800 <jwhallin> @FordJohnathan5 @SpeakerPelosi I second this motion. And, it’s now 126 traitors who have broken faith with the American people by embracing an attempted fascist coup.
1337546849729712128 2020-12-12 07:56:34 +0800 <jwhallin> @DrGJackBrown I support Rep. Pascrell (NJ) in his call for the SOTH to refuse to seat the 126 GOP Reps who have broken faith with the American people &amp; violated their oath of office by joining the fascist movement to overturn the ‘20 election! This is the act of Traitors!
1337545870858805248 2020-12-12 07:52:40 +0800 <jwhallin> Lock.Them.Up
1337545329718091776 2020-12-12 07:50:31 +0800 <jwhallin> @johnpavlovitz @OdoyleCharlotte @marcorubio Very rough. No worries, Marco...Walmart &amp; Target are always hiring. It’s about time you did some good, honest work for once in your miserable life. We all know you’re completely useless in Congress.
1337544743325069312 2020-12-12 07:48:11 +0800 <jwhallin> @JoeBarri @knute_scion Nothing like the foul, polluted stench of a fascist dictatorship to get the blood boiling. What the Hell is the matter with these people? We have 18 GOP AGs &amp; 126 GOP Reps actively breaking faith with America &amp; their oath of office. Fire them all!
1337541978913792000 2020-12-12 07:37:12 +0800 <jwhallin> @MBradyNash @realDonaldTrump Uh, Yeah, it is. You just can’t handle it. Cry more.
1337493871861776385 2020-12-12 04:26:03 +0800 <jwhallin> How fitting...😎
1337491301470650368 2020-12-12 04:15:50 +0800 <jwhallin> So...both GA GOP Senators are now on record as saying the good people of GA don’t have the right to vote unless they vote Republican. Otherwise, it’s fraudulent. That is essentially how this boils down...🤨
1337489759514443776 2020-12-12 04:09:42 +0800 <jwhallin> @MobBossTrump @ashlie_weeks Yep, me too!
1337489204763246593 2020-12-12 04:07:30 +0800 <jwhallin> Thank you, Elie! This whole “case” is baseless &amp; as you point out, it’s way too late challenge. It’s a nothing burger.
1337487193233756160 2020-12-12 03:59:30 +0800 <jwhallin> @JRehling @realDonaldTrump And, here are memes to go with it!  https://t.co/lwZCmvb7WB
1337486272126840832 2020-12-12 03:55:51 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump So...Spanky gets out his Magic MAGA Crystal Ball &amp; after consulting the demons from the fiery pit, predicts the Biden Admin will be “scandal plagued”. Its almost like he just CONCEDED &amp; is blaming others for that which he is guilty!  https://t.co/2qjwc95tbp
1337483733490753537 2020-12-12 03:45:45 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump Yo, Spanky! Spoiler Alert, Baby...you’ve killed over 270K Americans. The H1N1 epidemic took 12K lives. So, at this juncture, setting aside the FAKE NEWS that you’ve done something “great, you’re on course to be single largest killer since WWII. Now, GTFOH!
1337481582295228417 2020-12-12 03:37:13 +0800 <jwhallin> So...what is the legal standing for the “attorney” filing for permission to submit an amicus brief for the non-existent States of “New Nevada” &amp; “New California”? I’m sure the fukwits in the GOP can conjure up some Fake shit...🤨

1337431057818243072 2020-12-12 00:16:27 +0800 <jwhallin> These traitors will join the ranks of the other quislings in the GOP, including the “Traitor 8” who met with Kremlin officials on the 4th of July, 2018. Their names will be “Mud”, their reputations completely destroyed!
1337403401668341760 2020-12-11 22:26:33 +0800 <jwhallin> @SecPompeo Odd. You don’t seem to have any issue with the wretched traitors in the GOP impeding &amp; rigging elections here at home. Your rank hypocrisy is on full display. You may show yourself out now, and prepare for your pending meetings with the new DOJ AG &amp; the #TrumpCrimesCommission
1337397543873855490 2020-12-11 22:03:16 +0800 <jwhallin> @marcorubio Take a seat, Baby. When we want your RWNJ opinion, we’ll give it to you!

1337149458174201856 2020-12-11 05:37:28 +0800 <jwhallin> @AGCurtisHill You &amp; your “colleagues” are attempting to overturn a free &amp; fair election decided by We, The People.

1337142899285262338 2020-12-11 05:11:24 +0800 <jwhallin> The GOP has been  morphing into the Fascist Party of America for years. It accelerated with the advent of the Tea Party, aka the Freedom Caucus. They no longer subscribe to the tenets of a democratic Republic because they can’t win free &amp; fair elections.
1337141010447491072 2020-12-11 05:03:54 +0800 <jwhallin> @gumboqueen3030 @JoeBiden Hell No to Birx!

1337135314830180352 2020-12-11 04:41:16 +0800 <jwhallin> I’m wholly confident @AOC will be POTUS one day! She goes to work every single day on behalf of the 99% with grit &amp; determination. That’s my kinda politician!
1337134729556938755 2020-12-11 04:38:56 +0800 <jwhallin> Truth!
1337132564885061632 2020-12-11 04:30:20 +0800 <jwhallin> He absolutely “gets it”, and like the rest of the corrupt morons in the GOP, he’s giving it his erstwhile support, hoping it will fly. Never believe a Republican.

1337130887947808769 2020-12-11 04:23:41 +0800 <jwhallin> @acnewsitics It’s outright Fascism at this point. There is no value in trying to put lipstick on this pig.
1337130494803075072 2020-12-11 04:22:07 +0800 <jwhallin> @SheriAWilkinson I must vote for Dr. Fauci. And, I wholly reject Spanky bring on this list. How the Hell is he qualified to be given any award other than a long sentence in prison?!
1337129999317405698 2020-12-11 04:20:09 +0800 <jwhallin> Guaranteed! You’re next in the Justice barrel, Baby. We’ll dig out every bit of corruption &amp; crime you’re associated with. And, we will not rest until that task is complete!
1337027960142843911 2020-12-10 21:34:41 +0800 <jwhallin> @joncoopertweets @cwebbonline How, exactly, do spineless weenies “Man Up”?
1337026095653167104 2020-12-10 21:27:16 +0800 <jwhallin> I second this motion!
1337022326496325633 2020-12-10 21:12:17 +0800 <jwhallin> They have NO idea. None. They simply react to any new lie spewed by Spanky &amp; his Gang of Russian mob criminals &amp; traitors.
1337020801216737280 2020-12-10 21:06:14 +0800 <jwhallin> Huzzah!

1337019025381945355 2020-12-10 20:59:10 +0800 <jwhallin> You gotta love Chris Cuomo. He so bravely puts aside his naturally shy demeanor 😉 to rake Lindsey’s sorry Traitor ass over the coals!

1337017852159639558 2020-12-10 20:54:31 +0800 <jwhallin> All good MAGAs should boycott the GA election as a show of Solidarity with DJT &amp; to prove, once &amp; for all, they DO Own the Libs!
1337016984412725252 2020-12-10 20:51:04 +0800 <jwhallin> @kimguilfoyle Oh, Look! It’s Fredo’s soon to be former squeeze giving Joe some shit. Maybe she can offer some real solutions to the #TrumpVirus pandemic instead of lying &amp; promoting Trump Fascist State propaganda? Better yet, she STFU!
1337015617199562753 2020-12-10 20:45:38 +0800 <jwhallin> Ditto!
1337015278824124417 2020-12-10 20:44:17 +0800 <jwhallin> @kylegriffin1 Republicans have no interest in something as silly as the “Will of The People”. The only people who matter are the Fascist RNC mega donors; the 1% &amp; their bosses in the Kremlin. Money before People; Grift instead of Public Service.

1336752110134693888 2020-12-10 03:18:33 +0800 <jwhallin> We must initiate a thorough investigation of this corruption. #MoscowMitch &amp; the GOP cheated to win!

He was never close to winning...Never!  - Popular Vote - Joe wins by 7+M  - EC - Joe wins 306-232 A blowout! Total domination of #ChickenTrump!  https://t.co/VJKSWz5oYO
1336748260459827200 2020-12-10 03:03:15 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump Not gonna happen, #BunkerBoi! Your days as #IMPOTUS3 &amp; #PutinsPuppet are nearly over. Then, the LAW comes for YOU!

1336707136168972291 2020-12-10 00:19:50 +0800 <jwhallin> I’m shocked, I tell you! Shocked! 🤨
1336706500585132033 2020-12-10 00:17:19 +0800 <jwhallin> @tbkrazy2016 @RepKatiePorter The problem is the GOP Senators went along with #MoscowMitch seizing total, absolute  power to obstruct as he pleases. And, he has an iron grip on the RNC election campaign funds, so you do as Mitch tells you, or you get no money!
1336705473244884993 2020-12-10 00:13:14 +0800 <jwhallin> Thank you, Katie! We are well aware of why #MoscowMitch is jamming a COVID relief bill. But, amplifying it is necessary so ALL Americans can understand WHO bears responsibility for this vile obstruction. Put the blame where it belongs...on #MoscowMitch!  https://t.co/7E2aEAb1AV
1336703656834392067 2020-12-10 00:06:01 +0800 <jwhallin> @danielsgoldman So...where’s are the fines &amp; censure for this outrageous abuse of our justice system? If Dems we’re doing this, the GOP would be howling for disbarment, prison sentences &amp; “Heads On Pikes”! Guaranteed!

1336418567118438400 2020-12-09 05:13:10 +0800 <jwhallin> Quite Right!

1336415174643748864 2020-12-09 04:59:41 +0800 <jwhallin> @NotHoodlum Just to clarify...Spanky is responsible for making sure we’re the last to get the vaccine, and that as many people as possible died from the virus because he just doesn’t give a shit.

1335229621583765507 2020-12-05 22:28:43 +0800 <jwhallin> As always, everything put out by the corrupt traitors supporting #IMPOTUS3 is 100% Fake News!

1335224006413176832 2020-12-05 22:06:25 +0800 <jwhallin> And, that is exactly the type of change that needs to happen during the Biden admin. All of these meetings must be made public. No exceptions. The GOP always demands secrecy to avoid accountability. Basta Ya!
1335223328391368704 2020-12-05 22:03:43 +0800 <jwhallin> Bad!

We’ll be seeing both of you soon @ the #TrumpCrimesCommission hearings in Q1. All grifters, Russian owned mob criminals &amp; corrupt traitors shall be brought to Justice. That means YOU!  https://t.co/ZDavmzhreR
1333757473199587336 2020-12-01 20:58:56 +0800 <jwhallin> Happy Birthday, Beautiful! 🌈💐🌼🌹🌸
1333753587994791936 2020-12-01 20:43:29 +0800 <jwhallin> @Road_trippn A little flatulence before dessert is Spanky’s idea of proper decorum...
1333568122842869761 2020-12-01 08:26:31 +0800 <jwhallin> Thank you for the mention, Ladyred! 🇺🇸🗽🌈🌸💐🌼🌺  https://t.co/KCO3sf1diP

1333528903185432577 2020-12-01 05:50:40 +0800 <jwhallin> Dogs can smell evil in any form...including a deranged lump o’ shit masquerading as a human being. Thank for attending my TED talk.
1333526466743521280 2020-12-01 05:41:00 +0800 <jwhallin> Because the entitled, wealthy elite have the money &amp; influence to rig the Justice system. Just ask Billy Boi over at the DOJ. He has ordered “no action” against Loeffler, Perdue, Imhofe &amp; others. But, he is prosecuting Burr on orders from Hair Furor.
1333480349272141827 2020-12-01 02:37:44 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump Yo, Spanky! There’s a new reality TV show launching in Q1 ‘21. It’s the #TrumpCrimesCommission with you as the star defendant. Talk about “Law&amp; Order”...This will be epic! The best part will be you trying to stay out of prison while Barf is in one!  https://t.co/y2Zotqr9Di
1333477081599025154 2020-12-01 02:24:45 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump Yo, Spanky! You left out the part where almost 81M voted for Joe Biden... in an election heavily gerrymandered &amp; rigged by YOU &amp; the GOP! And, Joe BEAT you in the EC, 306-232. Cry more...then, pack your shit &amp; leave!  https://t.co/VR3p93jEuh

1333402423226896384 2020-11-30 21:28:05 +0800 <jwhallin> A smart, kick-ass woman heading OMB...wonder what could go wrong for Spanky &amp; Munchkin after she starts digging in? 😳
1333122285486493697 2020-11-30 02:54:55 +0800 <jwhallin> So much winning...or, is it whining?
1333122023749414912 2020-11-30 02:53:53 +0800 <jwhallin> @Strandjunker Because the kick-backs from Defense Contractors to the GOP are so rich.
1333121157051006976 2020-11-30 02:50:26 +0800 <jwhallin> @FrankFigliuzzi1 @MariaBartiromo So...Bilge Barf &amp; Election Rigger Kemp are now RINOs &amp; Losers?
1333118660555149312 2020-11-30 02:40:31 +0800 <jwhallin> @ReportsDaNews @AimingHigher11 The New Feudalism has been cemented into our economy &amp; our social order. Voting for Republicans is how this happened. Don’t be screaming about “socialism” when you vote to support the wealthy elite turning you into an impoverished serf to the Fascist State.
1333117692140654592 2020-11-30 02:36:40 +0800 <jwhallin> Hair Furor never pays his bills or his debts. But, when Uncle Vova’s debt collectors show up the afternoon of 20 January, the loans are due in full, and they WILL be paid...one way or another! 😳
1333116734157377536 2020-11-30 02:32:52 +0800 <jwhallin> @CBSNews @AimingHigher11 Trump supporters should absolutely boycott the GA Senate election. Best way possible to “Own the Libs”!
1333081036092129280 2020-11-30 00:11:01 +0800 <jwhallin> @PattyLehner New Band...The Chick Magnets!
1333080279037083651 2020-11-30 00:08:00 +0800 <jwhallin> Bingo! More of that good ol’ pro-life stuff from the Fascist Party of Amerika (aka the GOP)!
1333079124261314562 2020-11-30 00:03:25 +0800 <jwhallin> Talk about Suckers &amp; Losers...🤨
1333078672471773184 2020-11-30 00:01:37 +0800 <jwhallin> So...Joe wins PA 4 times now? Or, is it 5? I’ve totally lost count!
1333078346188537857 2020-11-30 00:00:19 +0800 <jwhallin> But, does he understand “denial” is not a river in Egypt? 😎
1333078161194553344 2020-11-29 23:59:35 +0800 <jwhallin> Excellent recommendation!
1333078086472982530 2020-11-29 23:59:17 +0800 <jwhallin> @JoyceWhiteVance Word is the #TrumpCrimesCommission will be impaneled shortly after the new DOJ AG is sworn in. I’m guessing the hearings will be scintillating, shocking &amp; will blow out the ratings!
1333077093794545664 2020-11-29 23:55:21 +0800 <jwhallin> Precisely!
1333076963687239683 2020-11-29 23:54:50 +0800 <jwhallin> Lock him up! Lock him up!
1333076173866168321 2020-11-29 23:51:41 +0800 <jwhallin> Well, Looter Kelly’s primary point of contention is “free &amp; fair” elections are, by definition, corrupt because Republicans cannot win “free &amp; fair” elections.
1333075471236415490 2020-11-29 23:48:54 +0800 <jwhallin> Lock her up! Lock her up!
1333073849382969344 2020-11-29 23:42:27 +0800 <jwhallin> Looter Kelly doesn’t understand the good people of GA now have more confidence in the integrity of their elections because Kemp &amp; his cronies were largely prevented from corruptly throwing the election to Spanky.
1333072957946560512 2020-11-29 23:38:55 +0800 <jwhallin> @carol_33410 @firefly909 And, Mitch, Lindsey, Cornyn, Johnson, Cruz &amp; Rubio (and, other GOP traitors) are going to prison, so there will ample open seats in the Senate &amp; House next year!
1333072447420076032 2020-11-29 23:36:53 +0800 <jwhallin> Excellent!
1333068711004049409 2020-11-29 23:22:02 +0800 <jwhallin> @MattForDelegate Absolutely! Real change cannot be achieved leaving the GOP in charge of so many State legislatures. The same applies to local elections.
1333067238501347328 2020-11-29 23:16:11 +0800 <jwhallin> @Winzol And, the other 29.8% are stupid!
1333066938839285761 2020-11-29 23:15:00 +0800 <jwhallin> @atrupar She’ll be raging about her election loss because too many Democrats voted!

1333050837011099651 2020-11-29 22:11:01 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump So...Spanky is preparing another bogus &amp; corrupt challenge to election results. It’ll get kicked to the curb like all his other bogus claims because there is NO evidence of fraud. Cry more &amp; die mad.  https://t.co/toehDY2tbM
1333049863278268416 2020-11-29 22:07:08 +0800 <jwhallin> @mburns2009 But, the GOP will insist we keep the #TaxScam intact, so they can rob the 99% some more. These idiots are not competent, nor trustworthy, to be making ANY policy decisions for our country. 🔥FIRE🔥 them ALL!

1332749649296326656 2020-11-29 02:14:12 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump Yo, Spanky! That $3M you spent in WI in an effort to disenfranchise African-American voters was a complete bust! Joe ended up getting 132 additional votes &amp; you LOST again! As always, you lost money for no return. You’re 🔥FIRED🔥!
1332748593288015872 2020-11-29 02:10:00 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump You forgot to thank the 80M American Patriots that voted you OUT! You’re going to prison, Traitor!

1332705427264516099 2020-11-28 23:18:28 +0800 <jwhallin> It was effective...just not effective enough. That explains Spanky’s discombobulation about the final results...he was SO certain the big fix was in! Little did he know the GOP put the fix in themselves, but left him holding the bag.

Joe enters the WH after he is inaugurated &amp; after the joint is fumigated. He’s the man who soundly whipped a cryin’ punk in the ‘20 election. You LOST!

1332413930199678976 2020-11-28 04:00:10 +0800 <jwhallin> Damn fine work by ACLU of Montana!
1332413072976216065 2020-11-28 03:56:46 +0800 <jwhallin> Lucky for us Jenna &amp; Rudy, The Stoopid Twins, are profoundly incompetent, like the monkey that hired them.
1332412185780264960 2020-11-28 03:53:14 +0800 <jwhallin> Good analysis, Paul. Thank you!
1332409871942123520 2020-11-28 03:44:03 +0800 <jwhallin> Lock him up!
1332409729067335680 2020-11-28 03:43:29 +0800 <jwhallin> They were too busy rigging the vote for themselves. They had no time to help poor Spanky. In short, they did to him what he’d do to them on a heartbeat.
1332409099590324226 2020-11-28 03:40:58 +0800 <jwhallin> @fenrir_71 🤚🏼Joe should cancel the security clearances of everyone in the WH &amp; the Cabinet.
1332408519732039681 2020-11-28 03:38:40 +0800 <jwhallin> There is NO doubt! Single Moms are tough ladies!
1332407165307428865 2020-11-28 03:33:17 +0800 <jwhallin> @JennaEllisEsq @RudyGiuliani SCOTUS won’t hear the case, Puddin’. Or, if they do, you’ll be humiliated once again. BTW, the 3 “activist” judges in the 3rd District...2 were appointed by W &amp; one by Spanky, but do go on making yourself a fool!
1332402892687360003 2020-11-28 03:16:19 +0800 <jwhallin> @kaj_amm @Makeitstop99 Meanwhile, rather than “do the right thing”, #MoscowMitch &amp; the corrupt GOP run around telling their constituents all their problems are because of deep state plots by Soros, Obama &amp; Hillary. Bad!
1332400343175446528 2020-11-28 03:06:11 +0800 <jwhallin> @waltshaub Very scary! Too horrible to contemplate! Think of the masses of libs they’d OWN by doing this?

You LOST again, LOSER!  - Joe BEAT you by 6M+  - Joe BEAT you in the EC 306-232 - Joe is President elect - Spanky is #1AndDone &amp; on his way to prison!  #DiaperDon

1332046248908505090 2020-11-27 03:39:08 +0800 <jwhallin> @JennaEllisEsq Thank you for outing Spanky &amp; the corrupt traitors in the GOP...the only ones who do election rigging because they can’t win a free &amp; fair election. You may show yourself out now.

1332022245854613504 2020-11-27 02:03:45 +0800 <jwhallin> @RBReich @415holgate It fits with the RNC/GOP Fascist Agenda...”winning at any cost, using any method, fair or foul.”

1332018348016627713 2020-11-27 01:48:16 +0800 <jwhallin> Bingo!
1332003405531791360 2020-11-27 00:48:53 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump Try to enjoy your last Thanksgiving. Where you’re going, it’s boiled rice &amp; beans &amp; maybe a thin sliver of spam for your holiday meals. You’ve earned expulsion from the WH, and now you face your reckoning with Justice for your crimes.
1332001516748566528 2020-11-27 00:41:23 +0800 <jwhallin> Ditto!

How’s that for some MAGA?! Pack your bag for prison, Baby...it’s your destiny...unless Uncle Vova’s debt collectors get to you first!  https://t.co/clbMPv2N7l
1331999206425260033 2020-11-27 00:32:12 +0800 <jwhallin> Outrageous!
1331998805630148610 2020-11-27 00:30:37 +0800 <jwhallin> We must expand SCOTUS &amp; reestablish the separation of Church &amp; State! If we don’t, we’ll soon find ourselves living in a Christo-Fascist Hell that will inflict immeasurable harm on our country!
1331997991801012226 2020-11-27 00:27:23 +0800 <jwhallin> @kylegriffin1 Actually, our elections are always rigged...by the GOP. Gerrymandering; voter suppression; voting fraud, etc. Yet, We, The People, managed to prevail by voting in numbers too real to steal. It’s something to be thankful for this Thanksgiving Day!

We should include a rigorous standardized exam that tests knowledge &amp; understanding of Civics, Economics, Basic Math skills, Reading Comprehension, Critical Thinking.
1331924292045402114 2020-11-26 19:34:31 +0800 <jwhallin> Beaten like a drum, many times, by Joe Biden. Humiliated on the national stage; a global pariah &amp; laughingstock. A Russian owned mob criminal &amp; traitor on his way to prison, forever.
1331922449932292098 2020-11-26 19:27:12 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump We know you did say it, Spanky, and more than once. Now that you’re #1AndDone, in addition to being #IMPOTUS3 &amp; #FakeNewsFarce, you may resign immediately. Pack your shit. Get Out!  https://t.co/OcDqn1NvHl
1331919672401248261 2020-11-26 19:16:10 +0800 <jwhallin> It’s what they do. And, it’s what they intend to continue doing. A vote for a Republican is a vote against your own personal welfare. The 99% are useful only so far as they serve Corporate Fascist State.
1331917963222388737 2020-11-26 19:09:22 +0800 <jwhallin> Outstanding! The MAGAts will google this up.

1331916363321884673 2020-11-26 19:03:01 +0800 <jwhallin> Your last sentence is the essential fact. The GOP has demonstrated they don’t give a damn about anyone but themselves.

1331727889910300673 2020-11-26 06:34:05 +0800 <jwhallin> Spanky has never been wise. He’s a 2 dimensional loser. He has no idea how this can &amp; will boomerang on him. We’ll all be having the last laugh as Flynn ultimately has to put a shiv in Spanky to save his own worthless ass.

1331590712433885184 2020-11-25 21:29:00 +0800 <jwhallin> It is vital we not let this slide. Lindsey broke the law. Lindsey MUST be prosecuted.

Melania has at least 2 side squeezes &amp; will drop divorce papers on Spanky as soon as Joe is sworn in; Spanky has robbed every Charity he’s ever been associated with; his “church” is the P.T.

1331345099494547456 2020-11-25 05:13:01 +0800 <jwhallin> @funder @ParuchGretchen If we WIN both seats in GA, #MoscowMitch is defeated, too! Let’s get it done, Georgia!!
1331344821642924032 2020-11-25 05:11:55 +0800 <jwhallin> My 401K is Loving this! After the beating we took in Q1, it is good to see some confidence coming back into the markets. However! We’re now looking at some extremely overbought indicators, so hang on for a bit of a pullback.

1331325026965000192 2020-11-25 03:53:15 +0800 <jwhallin> @grimm_resist Same. Getting rid of Spanky is but one victory in our war against Fascism in America. We must aggressively prosecute those who enabled the Trump Fascist State &amp; Russian sponsored crime syndicate!
1331320727501467653 2020-11-25 03:36:10 +0800 <jwhallin> Seriously! And, no bank robber from Wall Street to secretly loot the Treasury! What’s this World coming to?!

Next day, he’ll be served with subpoenas &amp; felony indictments from the NYS AG; the Manhattan DA. The new DOJ AG may need a few weeks to exhume all the dirt Bilge Barf trued to bury, so patience is recommended. The Hague is on deck...

1331263079842136066 2020-11-24 23:47:06 +0800 <jwhallin> @marcorubio The Great American Decline has been the handiwork of the RNC/GOP/Russian Mob Fascist Cabal. Fostered by traitors like you.

1331012603083067392 2020-11-24 07:11:48 +0800 <jwhallin> I’ll find more comfort &amp; joy when Spanky is behind bars...

1330996680280293376 2020-11-24 06:08:31 +0800 <jwhallin> Yeah, Ted, but it just never seems to get done, does it? One has to wonder why? You guys lost 10 seats to the GOP, and it’s all @AOC’s fault. It’s not @AOC’s fault. It’s a failure of vision, strategy &amp; leadership. No charge for the wedgie, pal.
1330993676407902208 2020-11-24 05:56:35 +0800 <jwhallin> You left out that puttin’ Spanky in prison thingy...!

1330849120454549507 2020-11-23 20:22:10 +0800 <jwhallin> We’ll need a lot more Democrats to achieve that result. Maybe a couple of guys from Georgia? ✊🏻🇺🇸🗽

1330589461432786944 2020-11-23 03:10:23 +0800 <jwhallin> It’s really that serious &amp; dramatic. We simply cannot have another term of #MoscowMitch holding the entire nation hostage to serve the fascist agenda of the RNC mega donors &amp; Vladimir Putin.

We, The People, will demand full exposure of what happened to Jeffrey Epstein. The FULL Mueller Report WILL be given to Congress. Need I go on?
1330586839476961282 2020-11-23 02:59:58 +0800 <jwhallin> @AmicaAli I’d build a bigly bonfire on the WH front lawn &amp; torch it on the spot!

1330585760525815808 2020-11-23 02:55:41 +0800 <jwhallin> We can be sure the GOP will be back with a vengeance at the mid-terms in ‘22...unless we do the right thing &amp; aggressively prosecute ALL who have enabled the Trump Fascist State. There can be no “looking the other way” for the subversion of democracy!

1330581150541041665 2020-11-23 02:37:21 +0800 <jwhallin> In 60 days, Spanky transitions from #IMPOTUS3 to felony indicted mofo. Justice finally catches up with Putin’s formerly “useful idiot”. Watch as he goes down in an Armageddon of prosecutions that wipe him out financially, and ends with him in prison.
1330543642453233665 2020-11-23 00:08:19 +0800 <jwhallin> Ron is correct. I have no doubt the new AG will “do the right thing” to address the egregious crimes committed by the Trump Fascist State &amp; it’s enablers. The DOJ must remain free &amp; independent of influence from the Executive Office, the Cabinet &amp; Congress!

1330519430053367811 2020-11-22 22:32:06 +0800 <jwhallin> It’s past time for the good people of MI (and, other States!) to dump the GOP in their State legislature. Things cannot get better when you’re held hostage by an organized crime syndicate, intent on reducing the populace to abject poverty.  https://t.co/Ol3aBOcFQm
1330517782849523719 2020-11-22 22:25:33 +0800 <jwhallin> @smc429 With extreme prejudice!
1330511054686732289 2020-11-22 21:58:49 +0800 <jwhallin> ✊🏻🇺🇸🗽
1330510520214982656 2020-11-22 21:56:42 +0800 <jwhallin> Unfortunately, about 73M voted for this loser. We have a serious problem in this country when that many people think he’s the dude who should be in charge.
1330509645346004992 2020-11-22 21:53:13 +0800 <jwhallin> Perhaps more Judges should do the same. Spanky &amp; his Gang keep wasting the courts time &amp; resources bringing these nothing burger “legal” challenges. When is that “Trump Crimes Commission” thingy gonna crank up?
1330507037306810369 2020-11-22 21:42:51 +0800 <jwhallin> @JumptyTrumpty Seems so! Suddenly, paper product supplies are running low. Seeing stores reimposing buy limits again.
1330506005113757697 2020-11-22 21:38:45 +0800 <jwhallin> Too often, when money talks, truth &amp; reality walk...
1330505289833930752 2020-11-22 21:35:55 +0800 <jwhallin> Another nothing burger. That’s exactly what Spanky is...a nothing burger. Time to put this traitor in prison.
1330245983784013825 2020-11-22 04:25:31 +0800 <jwhallin> Never! Thank you, Bernie for always being a champion of Democracy!

1330243351061401600 2020-11-22 04:15:04 +0800 <jwhallin> Oh, yes! And, they will be!
1330243223156117507 2020-11-22 04:14:33 +0800 <jwhallin> @GrondaMorin @thomaskaine5 @stevenmnuchin1 @JoeBiden It’s in the hands of Congress. Interesting that Munchkin announced this the day after #MoscowMitch adjourned the Senate for the Holiday. One might conclude it’s intent is to destroy the economy &amp; cripple the incoming Biden admin...🤨
1330239557107900418 2020-11-22 03:59:59 +0800 <jwhallin> Oh, how awful! 😎
1330239405760667649 2020-11-22 03:59:23 +0800 <jwhallin> @TrinityResists @blueeyeddoll51 I don’t know about anyone else, but I’ve had quite enough of this MAGA BS. It has been a complete &amp; utter failure. Possibly the worst failure in American history.
1330238433000828928 2020-11-22 03:55:31 +0800 <jwhallin> @thomaskaine5 They’ve already killed the economy. Like they always do. Now, it gets worse as Munchkin shut off emergency funding for the Fed. What is it people don’t understand about the GOP being completely incapable of running our government? They go there to loot it!
1330237510627319808 2020-11-22 03:51:51 +0800 <jwhallin> @anyonewantchips @lindaha96123336 Yes, but the MI AG has advised audits come AFTER State certification. So, Spanky loses once again!
1330237174692900869 2020-11-22 03:50:31 +0800 <jwhallin> The only meetings Spanky will soon be attending are the Friday night circle jerks up in Cell Block A ...
1330235363575685122 2020-11-22 03:43:19 +0800 <jwhallin> @YvetteJacqR @LidstonePeter Absolutely! The GOP has been systematically looting America since the Reagan era. Every time these losers control the federal government we go into massive debt from tax breaks for the rich; forever wars; destroying the environment for profit. Bad!

1330202104212951042 2020-11-22 01:31:10 +0800 <jwhallin> This is beyond outrageous!
1330201374978699266 2020-11-22 01:28:16 +0800 <jwhallin> Absolutely!
1330201156887449602 2020-11-22 01:27:24 +0800 <jwhallin> This is the handiwork of the GOP. Big tax breaks for the wealthy &amp; food lines &amp; evictions for the 99%. This is exactly what I refer to when I speak of the “New Feudalism” in America. It’s here. Now.
1330199240803540994 2020-11-22 01:19:47 +0800 <jwhallin> @MysterySolvent Hmmm....I’d have to say “Lookin’ for a new big money squeeze” brown...

1330196910498582531 2020-11-22 01:10:31 +0800 <jwhallin> Seriously! I mean, who in their right mind would take a “Trump vaccine”?!
1330196239703543813 2020-11-22 01:07:52 +0800 <jwhallin> Bad!

1330174630129246215 2020-11-21 23:41:59 +0800 <jwhallin> @glennkirschner2 @BrendaBalazs Better idea...make Glenn DOJ AG! I called Joe this morning to promote you for the big job @ DOJ, Glenn. You’re gold, Baby! Expect a call from Joe any minute...😎

This is how the Republicans use &amp; abuse your public trust. Guzzling $125 bottles of Champagne &amp; letting Spanky shake them down for $5K per night @ the Trump Bedbug Palace (bedbugs were gratis!). Vote them OUT!
1330169187898109957 2020-11-21 23:20:22 +0800 <jwhallin> I talked to Joe this morning &amp; gave him my personal recommendation that Glenn Kirshner is the absolute best qualified candidate for DOJ AG. Glenn...expect a call from Joe, soon! 😎

1330164437936955394 2020-11-21 23:01:29 +0800 <jwhallin> @BMeiselas Yep! 3rd time? Now, Kemp wants another recount to make the 12K+ for Biden go away...🤨
1330163628817997833 2020-11-21 22:58:17 +0800 <jwhallin> @mhdksafa Truly, it takes so little to cast a healing light into the lives of others, and demonstrate our humanity. I salute you, Mohammad. You are a good man!
1330162240734044166 2020-11-21 22:52:46 +0800 <jwhallin> @AudreyStJames1 Yes! But, most of the GOP “won” re-election which makes NO sense!

1330139377427689473 2020-11-21 21:21:55 +0800 <jwhallin> Agree! We need a true firebrand heading the DOJ. Let’s talk about Glenn Kirshner or Sally Yates or Adam Schiff...
1330138608293064707 2020-11-21 21:18:51 +0800 <jwhallin> @KLoeffler @Perduesenate Sorry, No! We’re done with the Fascist Party of Amerika trying to illegally disenfranchise voters &amp; stealing elections they couldn’t win fairly.

1330137516226310145 2020-11-21 21:14:31 +0800 <jwhallin> The Trump Crime Family is going to PRISON!
1330137281789882370 2020-11-21 21:13:35 +0800 <jwhallin> Oooohhh! 🤣🤣🤣
1330137215935057921 2020-11-21 21:13:19 +0800 <jwhallin> Apparently, at least one more time. Kemp wants another count so he can make 12K+ votes for Biden magically disappear! You know...the same way he won his election as Governor.
1330136695203835908 2020-11-21 21:11:15 +0800 <jwhallin> Unfortunately, the media is addicted to click bait. There is no other objective in their world. They won’t stop until we reestablish the Fairness Doctrine &amp; reel in the unchecked dissemination of propaganda.
1330135904648884232 2020-11-21 21:08:07 +0800 <jwhallin> @LeeChatfield So...it’s an “honor” to collaborate with a wannabe fascist dictator who is responsible for selling our country out to hostile foreign powers &amp; is responsible for the deaths of 250K people? What is wrong with you?
1330135025489235974 2020-11-21 21:04:37 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Yo, Spanky! You’ve been spewing this lie for 4 years. It’s still a lie. BTW, have you found a venue to flee to yet? JUSTICE is coming for Spanky, and he better get out of Dodge before his passport is revoked &amp; his assets seized! Nancy sends “tots &amp; pears”!😎

1330126233443688449 2020-11-21 20:29:41 +0800 <jwhallin> Thank you, Bill, for taking direct action to challenge the vile acts of the “3 Strikes &amp; We’re Out Farce”. These “lawyers” are nothing but a Fascist Cabal attempting to destroy the democratic process. They should all be disbarred!

Nothing energizes ones spirit quite like reading through piles of specious claims &amp; idiotic, fact-less conclusions. It seems we’re still at that place where “Ya can’t fix stupid” still applies...
1329926767222538247 2020-11-21 07:17:04 +0800 <jwhallin> Better idea...impeach Beer Boi Brett &amp; put Mr. Garland on SCOTUS. Then, put Glenn Kirshner in charge of the DOJ &amp; let’s rock the corrupt traitors in the GOP who sold out America!

1329776425079959553 2020-11-20 21:19:40 +0800 <jwhallin> @maiamimi @Montejp231 Glenn Kirshner has recommended an Independent Counsel be appointed to manage the “Trump Crimes Commission”, thus relieving the  DOJ of much of the investigative &amp; prosecutorial burden. Joe &amp; Kamala can then focus on other critical issues on their agenda.
1329774967131500544 2020-11-20 21:13:52 +0800 <jwhallin> Absolutely! Spanky &amp; his 3 elder progeny will now pay the price for their crimes. Next Up: the corrupt traitors in the RNC/GOP/Russian Mob Fascist Cabal! Justice is Coming!
1329774361067233280 2020-11-20 21:11:28 +0800 <jwhallin> Yep! Cheatin’ Spanky has been repudiated &amp; is now scheduled for expulsion on 20 January ‘21. Expect the first of MANY felony indictments to drop after Joe us sworn in. It’s cryin’ time for Spanky &amp; his Gang!  https://t.co/NVdFoJps8C

1329557647062827008 2020-11-20 06:50:19 +0800 <jwhallin> @JimDabakis @doc_next So...MI Legislators are supposed to break the law; be indicted, prosecuted &amp; imprisoned to keep Spanky in the WH? Maybe it’s just me, but I’m not seeing any upside for the MI legislators...🤔
1329556769169756166 2020-11-20 06:46:50 +0800 <jwhallin> @SpringMorning74 @Jay_USMC2 Spanky figures the 200 unqualified RWNJ judges Mitch pushed through will eventually come to his rescue, break the law &amp; go to jail to save Hair Furor. You don’t win many football games with “Hail Mary’s”.

1329477499332349954 2020-11-20 01:31:50 +0800 <jwhallin> The GOP is now the Fascist Party of Amerika...an organized crime syndicate dedicated to destroying democracy &amp; reducing the 99% to abject poverty &amp; serfdom. They are a collective of self-serving felons &amp; traitors.

1329089384470044672 2020-11-18 23:49:37 +0800 <jwhallin> Joe will appoint a DOJ AG who serves the interests of American Justice. To that end, Spanky &amp; his Gang of corrupt traitors will he charged &amp; prosecuted for their crimes. Also, pardons where you are a co-conspirator in the crimes committed are null &amp; void.

1328869562859675648 2020-11-18 09:16:07 +0800 <jwhallin> Of that, there is NO doubt!
1328868358561796096 2020-11-18 09:11:20 +0800 <jwhallin> Spanky must be removed from office NOW!
1328867721895763973 2020-11-18 09:08:48 +0800 <jwhallin> @tedcruz Oh, it’s Mr. Punk, the slavering sycophant &amp; professional lickspittle trying to shush someone! Hilarious. When you have no backbone; no moral compass; not a single redeeming human attribute, you remain silent &amp; listen to your betters, fool. Now, GTFOH!
1328865733648936960 2020-11-18 09:00:54 +0800 <jwhallin> @TimeToSayGood15 @NextResort @LindseyGrahamSC If a Democrat did what Lindsey did, the GOP would have lynched him already! Now is the time to remove Graham from office!
1328865013524697089 2020-11-18 08:58:02 +0800 <jwhallin> @MiaFarrow @NextResort @LindseyGrahamSC Sorry, Mia...legislators (House &amp; Senate) cannot be Impeached. They are elected representatives. They can be recalled or voted out. Or, they can be indicted, prosecuted, convicted &amp; incarcerated. Lets go with that!
1328863103627366401 2020-11-18 08:50:27 +0800 <jwhallin> Excellent question. There must be consequences for these fraudulent lawsuits.
1328862414876467200 2020-11-18 08:47:43 +0800 <jwhallin> @ericgarland @craigwk8 I second this motion.
1328861082694295552 2020-11-18 08:42:25 +0800 <jwhallin> Precisely!
1328858328340959232 2020-11-18 08:31:29 +0800 <jwhallin> @LindseyGrahamSC Your feeble attempt to distract is so obvious it’s painful to watch. Let’s talk about you shaking down the GA Sec. of State to toss out ballots. Let’s talk about what you did to cheat your way to re-election. Let’s talk about why should resign NOW!
1328856950050750464 2020-11-18 08:26:00 +0800 <jwhallin> So...now we have a perjury charge to add to the indictment for election tampering? Lindsey must be extremely desperate to risk felony criminal prosecution...what, exactly, has Lady G so terrified?
1328856275984125952 2020-11-18 08:23:19 +0800 <jwhallin> @mmpadellan Goddamn Right it is! A total disgrace!

1328852151091691520 2020-11-18 08:06:56 +0800 <jwhallin> @nancykaffer So... the Chair is saying they don’t count African-American votes in Detroit? Do I have that right?
1328850732070572032 2020-11-18 08:01:18 +0800 <jwhallin> Absolutely!

1328841090271641600 2020-11-18 07:22:59 +0800 <jwhallin> It’s Spanky getting some debt relief by delivering what Putin needs to kneecap the U.S.

1328835748443799553 2020-11-18 07:01:45 +0800 <jwhallin> @apzanolli @EmmaKinery @yashar Yes, but to ensure actual receipt of funds, require a cashiers check or direct wire transfer, and NO service until the funds are posted as received by the WI Secretary of State’s office.

1328834821418717185 2020-11-18 06:58:04 +0800 <jwhallin> @EmmaKinery There won’t be a recount because Spanky can’t or won’t pay the fee, upfront.
1328832936460750848 2020-11-18 06:50:35 +0800 <jwhallin> Quick Question: what happened to the 300K ballots in S.FL? Counted? Not counted?   2nd Quick Question: why hasn’t  Louis DeJoy been indicted for tampering with the USPS service &amp; ordering the destruction of tens of millions of $ of mail sorting equipment?
1328830039094292480 2020-11-18 06:39:04 +0800 <jwhallin> @landroval87 @BillKristol @GOP Unfortunate, but true!
1328811915770884098 2020-11-18 05:27:03 +0800 <jwhallin> Say “Bye” to #Impotus3 ...the ONLY person ever to stain the honor of OUR White House to actually do hard time in prison. Justice is coming Spanky, and it’s coming for YOU!  https://t.co/EOkwfNAm4N
1328809589165281280 2020-11-18 05:17:48 +0800 <jwhallin> @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Spanky can go lay the wreaths himself.
1328809148864053248 2020-11-18 05:16:03 +0800 <jwhallin> @funder How about the part where #LeningradLindsey insisted the GA Secretary of State “find ballots to throw out”? Seems like a felony to me...🤔
1328808611313643520 2020-11-18 05:13:55 +0800 <jwhallin> Republicans are worried about being exposed for taking illegal campaign contributions; actively supporting voting fraud &amp; voter suppression; selling our country out to hostile foreign powers. They should be worried because Justice is coming for them!  https://t.co/BAPrCKAtPP
1328807757089173504 2020-11-18 05:10:32 +0800 <jwhallin> @HKrassenstein The judge should slap him with a heavy fine for promoting this nonsense &amp; wasting taxpayer $. Hit him up for $250K &amp; he’ll stop...because Spanky ain’t pickin’ up the tab. 😎

1328688823371403264 2020-11-17 21:17:55 +0800 <jwhallin> Bad!
1328688669788573697 2020-11-17 21:17:19 +0800 <jwhallin> Well, the GOP mantra has always been “if we can’t win fair, we cheat, threaten &amp; obstruct”. This is not how a democracy operates. Its how a fascist state works...

1328681973582163969 2020-11-17 20:50:42 +0800 <jwhallin> @lunaticopresid1 @sharonschauffle Spanky will have Munchkin pilfer the funds from the Treasury. They’ve been looting the U.S. for the last 4 years...why stop now?
1328681487575597058 2020-11-17 20:48:47 +0800 <jwhallin> Yes!
1328540040268398594 2020-11-17 11:26:43 +0800 <jwhallin> If a Democratic Senator did this, he’d be hanging from a street lamp right now. We need some actual Justice here. Congress...if you’re listening?!

1328538839418167296 2020-11-17 11:21:57 +0800 <jwhallin> @ericswalwell @deb_grojean Are we going to let this slide, or will someone in Congress take action to investigate this skulduggery?
1328536744312983552 2020-11-17 11:13:37 +0800 <jwhallin> @waltshaub @sar_oso Seems the GOP’s “plans” always involve felony criminal activity and/or getting innocent people killed by neglect, stupidity or disinformation. Why is this “party” allowed to continue operating? They are an organized crime syndicate.

1328391126294753280 2020-11-17 01:34:59 +0800 <jwhallin> @xwiseguyx @Thom_Hartmann And, if Spanky got 10M more votes, so did a lot of GOP Congress people up for re-election this cycle.
1328388046341894144 2020-11-17 01:22:45 +0800 <jwhallin> Seriously!

1328386777212624897 2020-11-17 01:17:42 +0800 <jwhallin> Just sayin’...
1328386499084046342 2020-11-17 01:16:36 +0800 <jwhallin> @OurProgressive PSA: Spanky is shaking down his base to amass a fortune that will go into his personal accounts. Not a dime will be used to “pay campaign debts” nor “legal fees”. He’s going to stiff everyone, like he always does. Be smart. Don’t send him money!  https://t.co/qjNKvmtRfp

1328383472289792000 2020-11-17 01:04:34 +0800 <jwhallin> No one can! But, it’s likely a combo of gerrymandering, voter suppression &amp; voting fraud. We must make it a priority to investigate once the Biden admin is sworn in.

1328141242140540930 2020-11-16 09:02:02 +0800 <jwhallin> I agree. He’ll run away to FL as soon as the States confirm the EC votes.
1328138397806804992 2020-11-16 08:50:44 +0800 <jwhallin> The added bonus here is Kamala gets to tell #MoscowMitch “shut up &amp; sit down”.  That just gave me rush!

1328137066966728705 2020-11-16 08:45:27 +0800 <jwhallin> @RojoRurba002 @STabbytosavit How’s that gonna work when Spanky is on a chain gang? Askin’ for a friend...
1328135187012612096 2020-11-16 08:37:58 +0800 <jwhallin> @StiesBeforeGuys @joelockhart Yes, it’s probably fake.
1328132433170972674 2020-11-16 08:27:02 +0800 <jwhallin> @StiesBeforeGuys @joelockhart She would if she could get away with it. She would gladly herald a world where all anti-fascist dissent is smothered &amp; those opposed to the Trump Fascist State are in concentration camps.
1328130866518708224 2020-11-16 08:20:48 +0800 <jwhallin> @JaneTea4 Actually, he can. SDNY is Federal. What he can’t pardon are cases in local &amp; State courts.
1328130224358232064 2020-11-16 08:18:15 +0800 <jwhallin> Bad!
1328130141403316225 2020-11-16 08:17:55 +0800 <jwhallin> ...don’t forget he’s also the only one installed (by Russia), not elected. He’s also the Enemy of the People.
1328129663172964352 2020-11-16 08:16:01 +0800 <jwhallin> There is no reason for the media to cover Spanky. He’s 2 week old leftovers, growing mold in the back of the fridge. Time to dump that shit &amp; start covering the real news...the incoming Biden admin.
1328127027111608320 2020-11-16 08:05:33 +0800 <jwhallin> @Flag19591 @nudog71 Seriously! 🤣🤣🤣
1328126009598648322 2020-11-16 08:01:30 +0800 <jwhallin> He’s pocketing ALL donations. He’ll not hesitate to rip-off the RNC. At this late day in his tenure, they’re just another mark.

1328123270084792320 2020-11-16 07:50:37 +0800 <jwhallin> @nudog71 He’d be burnt Spam croquettes w/ MAGAt sauce...
1328122915984850945 2020-11-16 07:49:13 +0800 <jwhallin> @jacksinboston Of course!
1328122569027842048 2020-11-16 07:47:50 +0800 <jwhallin> They abandoned “democratic process” long ago. Now, it’s “winning at any cost, by any means”. The Trump Fascist State is defeated, but the GOP remains fully committed to one party rule via a fascist theocracy. They’ll be back &amp; we’d better be ready!
1328120629489405952 2020-11-16 07:40:08 +0800 <jwhallin> @BeckyBunzy @CindisPLace Because THEY are f*ckin’ morons!

1328108317244223489 2020-11-16 06:51:12 +0800 <jwhallin> @mtgreenee You need help. A psychiatric intervention is necessary. Anyone in such a deluded state is dangerous to themselves &amp; others. Please check in at the nearest hospital with a psychiatric care unit!
1328055507563671554 2020-11-16 03:21:21 +0800 <jwhallin> Sad.
1328055043069644800 2020-11-16 03:19:30 +0800 <jwhallin> @ResisterForever Hillary would certainly cause many heads to explode, but I’m there for it! 😎

1328027114805764096 2020-11-16 01:28:32 +0800 <jwhallin> @ValiVailVali @EricBoehlert Ironically, most Trump voters don’t read much of anything. If it’s not on Fox Fake News or some alt-right Conspiracy site, they tune out immediately. Life outside the MAGAt echo chamber is too scary...
1328025028974104577 2020-11-16 01:20:15 +0800 <jwhallin> Lock him up!
1328024708256653313 2020-11-16 01:18:58 +0800 <jwhallin> Can we get him to take #MoscowMitch &amp; #LeningradLindsey with him, Bernie? Askin’ for a friend...
1328024322049417218 2020-11-16 01:17:26 +0800 <jwhallin> @carolinebrehman 1/3 of these idiots will be C-19 positive within 2-3 weeks. Then, they’ll spread the infection to others. But, “muh rights” are more important than being a responsible citizen. I’m sick of these turds!
1328023458073042945 2020-11-16 01:14:00 +0800 <jwhallin> @atrupar Dan Patrick is a RWNJ &amp; fascist fanatic. He’s also an idiot.

1328022243356549122 2020-11-16 01:09:10 +0800 <jwhallin> I’d call that a solid win! Rudy leading Spanky’s legal team can have only one outcome...they’ll all go to prison.
1328021842225889280 2020-11-16 01:07:35 +0800 <jwhallin> In Spanky’s addled mind, he’s good with the entire world perishing as long as he’s left with all the money. Sad. Bad. Crazy.
1328018904203988992 2020-11-16 00:55:54 +0800 <jwhallin> Bad!
1328012406476263424 2020-11-16 00:30:05 +0800 <jwhallin> ...and, the GOP doesn’t give a shit. Far more important to “humor” the Lame Duck ignoramus than concern themselves with the welfare of the people.

1327995925331988480 2020-11-15 23:24:36 +0800 <jwhallin> @TheRickWilson So sad! He needs the distraction. Contemplating the eternal agony that is his only future, is beyond terrifying.

1327975832124411904 2020-11-15 22:04:45 +0800 <jwhallin> @herlihy_f No Republican can ever be trusted again. They have disgraced themselves &amp; the party, forever. If there is to be a new Conservative voice in America, the GOP must be burned to the ground, and a new organization will need to created, from scratch.
1327973347989229569 2020-11-15 21:54:53 +0800 <jwhallin> @ReverendWarnock @dani_duggan ...and both facing hard time in prison. The days of rank political corruption &amp; fronting fascism in America are at an end. Many in the GOP will be summoned to account...some to the #TrumpCrimesCommission commencing Q1 ‘21.  Justice is coming!
1327972078813757440 2020-11-15 21:49:50 +0800 <jwhallin> @willapercy A very good analysis. With the read!
1327968824948260864 2020-11-15 21:36:54 +0800 <jwhallin> @Amy_Siskind @dani_duggan And, investigate Munchkin’s activities in funneling money from the PPP to his cronies, RNC Donors, GOP Congress people, Spanky!

1327959947879976961 2020-11-15 21:01:38 +0800 <jwhallin> Nothing sez “Liberty &amp; Justice for the Entitled” quite like a GOP Senator openly advocating suppressing the votes of PoC &amp; Democrats. This is the GOP...the Fascist Party of Amerika. Vote them OUT!
1327695809387786240 2020-11-15 03:32:03 +0800 <jwhallin> Spanky’s next gig is teaming up w/ Paula White as Televangelists for the Fiery Pit Power Hour! Anybody who can sell his stupid BS to 70+M is gonna make big bank on these fools! He’ll put Joel Osteen &amp; Franklin Graham out of business in a week!

1327681855844352001 2020-11-15 02:36:36 +0800 <jwhallin> @acnewsitics He gave them permission to HATE out loud. And, he’s convinced many he actually cares about their welfare. He doesn’t, not even a little bit. He serves ONLY himself.  https://t.co/pkisozQODR

1327664102429233153 2020-11-15 01:26:03 +0800 <jwhallin> At least as far back as Newt Gingrich becoming SOTH. That’s when he &amp; #MoscowMitch hatched the “winning at any cost” mantra that devolved into a fanatical drive to establish a fascist theocracy in America. Bad!
1327662926887489538 2020-11-15 01:21:23 +0800 <jwhallin> @rpdandy Spanky is a punk &amp; a coward. He’s never been in this for any ideological, moral or political ideal. He’s in it to loot the U.S.Treasury to retire his debts &amp; keep the skim going hot &amp; strong as Dictator. He doesn’t give a shit about any of these RWNJs.
1327659657221992448 2020-11-15 01:08:23 +0800 <jwhallin> Sad. Bad. Delusional.

1327598851671216128 2020-11-14 21:06:46 +0800 <jwhallin> @LawrenceHorn3rd @senatemajldr True. The GOP robbed the SS fund to pay for 2 wars on a credit card during W’s terms in office. #MoscowMitch decided it was a good idea to rob every retiree in America of their SS &amp; Medicare to repay that debt. We, The People, say “Hell No”!
1327597804294873090 2020-11-14 21:02:36 +0800 <jwhallin> A reckoning is coming, #MoscowMitch! May you live 200 years so you can spend the remainder of them in prison, Traitor!

1327595688608219136 2020-11-14 20:54:12 +0800 <jwhallin> Absolutely! Yo, #MoscowMitch! You see this, Baby? You are the most despised person in America.

1327579703511805953 2020-11-14 19:50:41 +0800 <jwhallin> @BookwormAudrey @tburages Perhaps not “treason” by its Constitutional definition, but certainly sedition.

1327567891961581568 2020-11-14 19:03:45 +0800 <jwhallin> Perhaps it’s time to address this outrageous abuse of our legal &amp; judicial system? Can we start with putting away our weenie hats &amp; move forward with disbarring Barr?

1327392527863795714 2020-11-14 07:26:55 +0800 <jwhallin> @Bckrda Perhaps. We can be sure it’s being watched very closely.
1327389850572447745 2020-11-14 07:16:16 +0800 <jwhallin> @Bckrda We must remain vigilant. The EC is now a matter of record. Trying to subvert it is fraught with real legal jeopardy. As for an an actual “military coup”, they’re too dumb &amp; clumsy to pull it off &amp; the military would never support it.
1327351614529695745 2020-11-14 04:44:20 +0800 <jwhallin> Astounding! Maybe Geraldo can put Spanky up in Al Capone’s vault...permanently!

1327330034596544512 2020-11-14 03:18:35 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump No, this election was rigged by you, the RNC/GOP/Russian Mob Fascist Cabal, and other traitors like #MoscowMitch. But, it wasn’t enough. Now, you face the Justice you so richly deserve! It’s prison time for Spanky!
1327328905833766912 2020-11-14 03:14:06 +0800 <jwhallin> It’s almost like all the candidates for election were on separate ballots...but, they weren’t!

1327327272924188672 2020-11-14 03:07:37 +0800 <jwhallin> @B52Malmet @dunecat1 One would think “submitting untrustworthy evidence” would be possible grounds for disbarment. It’s par for the course for the cheaters &amp; traitors in the GOP, but attorneys need to ask themselves if being disbarred is a price their willing to pay for Spanky?
1327326203871588353 2020-11-14 03:03:22 +0800 <jwhallin> @B52Malmet @dunecat1 Oh, Dear! How Awful! 😎
1327325769622720512 2020-11-14 03:01:38 +0800 <jwhallin> Regrettably, nothing will happen until the Biden admin is in place. However, it is very important we investigate REPUBLICAN voter fraud, across the board, with emphasis in TX, FL, SC &amp; KY.  https://t.co/TJtyoAZNlG

1327301694879797254 2020-11-14 01:25:58 +0800 <jwhallin> @Dragonfly_Drama Indeed! The prison menu is rather sparse, consisting largely of processed carbohydrates &amp; canned veggies &amp; fruits. Nothing like a bowl of week-old boiled rice &amp; Lima beans.
1327300904811331585 2020-11-14 01:22:50 +0800 <jwhallin> @SteveSchmidtSES It’s time to bring these wretched seditionists to Justice.

1327297926872252422 2020-11-14 01:11:00 +0800 <jwhallin> @Dragonfly_Drama It’s time for Spanky to go to MAG-A-Fungo while we prepare his felony indictments. He best get in all the golf he can before he’s incarcerated.
1327296450775064576 2020-11-14 01:05:08 +0800 <jwhallin> Winning in GA kneecaps #MoscowMitch while we prepare his reckoning with Justice @ the #TrumpCrimesCommission !   Let’s get it done!  https://t.co/bsfI6MmHYo

We know you &amp; the GOP rigged the elections in KY, SC, TX &amp; FL, at minimum. It will be exposed after Joe is sworn in as POTUS. Oh, and Hillary will be the new DOJ AG.

1327260600867594240 2020-11-13 22:42:41 +0800 <jwhallin> Without hesitation, and the GOP would endorse it immediately.

1326966012751691776 2020-11-13 03:12:05 +0800 <jwhallin> @ShawnInArizona @BoundarySeeker @MSNBC @CNN It is! But, MSM, true to form, is again chasing the next distraction Spanky throws at them. It’s almost like these people have a incurable learning disability...
1326959984341524480 2020-11-13 02:48:08 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews The simple truth is America is tired of being lied to &amp; gaslit by Russian owned mob criminals &amp; RW nut job media outlets. The really bad news for you is the legal Hell you’ll be facing come January. Fox Fake News won’t dare any better.

The legal Armageddon coming his way will consume all his remaining wealth. Then there’s the little problem of Russian debt collectors who don’t take prisoners...😳

1326871249826447360 2020-11-12 20:55:32 +0800 <jwhallin> Not for one second, yet the GOP remains silent. Who is the real “Enemy of The People”?!

1326864332496384006 2020-11-12 20:28:03 +0800 <jwhallin> @funder @boandsunny A GOP Senator promising to do the right thing is definitely a surprise. How long before #MoscowMitch slaps him back into line, and he does nothing?
1326863907210756096 2020-11-12 20:26:22 +0800 <jwhallin> @donwinslow That assumes there was something to “pull out”...Stormy did indicate her 90 second soirée with liddle’ Spanky was a “short” affair in more ways than one...  https://t.co/yWJWzq27g4
1326862375232827392 2020-11-12 20:20:16 +0800 <jwhallin> @JeromeNparadise I did that with my son for several years ( age 2-5). We made it story time &amp; he always fell asleep half way through. There was no downside to being a Dad to a little boy who didn’t see his father all day.

1326859768988758016 2020-11-12 20:09:55 +0800 <jwhallin> @CCLcaribecrew Like a small, spoiled child having a tantrum. And, this useless turd sits in OUR WH, wreaking havoc while the GOP cheers him on. Need we ask who the “Enemy of the People” really is?
1326654121999360000 2020-11-12 06:32:45 +0800 <jwhallin> Exactly.
1326653856034381824 2020-11-12 06:31:41 +0800 <jwhallin> @coalsmom @atrupar True, but they don’t care! Winning at any cost is the name of their game.
1326653620239036418 2020-11-12 06:30:45 +0800 <jwhallin> So... to those in the gallery who think a fascist coup isn’t in process, take a look around...all the pieces are being put in place as we argue on Twitter.
1326652860491132928 2020-11-12 06:27:44 +0800 <jwhallin> Uh...on the topic of election fraud, it seems quite necessary to investigate #MoscowMitch.
1326652536338616320 2020-11-12 06:26:27 +0800 <jwhallin> @TravisAllen02 Buncha snowflakes!

1326650166145810433 2020-11-12 06:17:02 +0800 <jwhallin> The Republican Party? More like the Fascist Party of Amerika. Bad!!
1326624536788230146 2020-11-12 04:35:11 +0800 <jwhallin> This could not be more relevant or true. Shame on those who support the Trump Fascist State.

Oh, wait...we already 🔥FIRED🔥him! Say “Bye” Spanky! Send us pics from the prison laundry room when ya get a chance! 😎
1326622234203484160 2020-11-12 04:26:02 +0800 <jwhallin> Perhaps the GOP can ‘splain this to us...preferably in terms that won’t instantly trigger a gag reflex.

1326569799963471872 2020-11-12 00:57:41 +0800 <jwhallin> @dukewindsor388 @AimeeDearmon I second this motion. Let’s do all possible to win both Senate seats in GA! Vote, volunteer, contribute to OSSOFF &amp; WARNOCK!

1326556302194044929 2020-11-12 00:04:03 +0800 <jwhallin> Sad, but undeniably true.
1326552361704153090 2020-11-11 23:48:23 +0800 <jwhallin> @RickChapterTwo Maybe someone should inform Lindsey he &amp; Mitch are the  targets of the next election fraud investigation?
1326549313078534144 2020-11-11 23:36:16 +0800 <jwhallin> @Mocraig13 Exactly. If you’re a Republican, you can just ignore losing your election. 🤨
1326548129634639872 2020-11-11 23:31:34 +0800 <jwhallin> OMG! Too hilarious! 🤣🤣🤣
1326524133560102914 2020-11-11 21:56:13 +0800 <jwhallin> Well, at least it’s “on brand”. If you can’t win fairly, cheat, bribe &amp; steal your way to victory.
1326523603555250178 2020-11-11 21:54:07 +0800 <jwhallin> @TheyWereStolen No! And, we won’t until an effective vaccine is available.
1326523119859691520 2020-11-11 21:52:12 +0800 <jwhallin> Yo, Spanky! You see this, Baby? Obama never had to give a concession speech. You won’t either, but it won’t matter. You’re still #1AndDone &amp; #IMPOTUS3 forever! Prepare yourself for prison!
1326522394576478208 2020-11-11 21:49:19 +0800 <jwhallin> @jadedcreative @spokanetom It is, but nobody bothered to inform Justin Amash...
1326521825317195777 2020-11-11 21:47:03 +0800 <jwhallin> It’s almost like none of these candidates are on the SAME F*CKING BALLOT!

1326515456853766145 2020-11-11 21:21:45 +0800 <jwhallin> @chargrille @JIlgner The GOP is more than ready to cook up some more Fake News about Dem election fraud. Maybe we should be investigating GOP election fraud? Funny how Mitch &amp; Lindsey coasted to an instant, easy victory while being two of most reviled people in the Senate...🤨
1326514271094595584 2020-11-11 21:17:02 +0800 <jwhallin> If I’ve ever seen anything begging for an audit, this is it!
1326510985163599872 2020-11-11 21:03:58 +0800 <jwhallin> @Patta47cake @MattMurph24 Because Spanky ordered Barf to take down Burr, and take a pass on indicting Loeffler &amp; Perdue (and others!). That’s how “justice” works in the Trump Fascist State...persecute all the dictators enemies.
1326510249499529218 2020-11-11 21:01:03 +0800 <jwhallin> @FrakerMonica @donwinslow Getting rid of Republicans at the local &amp; State levels is how we turn this around. That, and getting a solid Voters Rights Act passed in Congress. Let’s start by helping GA elect Ossoff &amp; Warnock!
1326504874205347841 2020-11-11 20:39:41 +0800 <jwhallin> That IS the real story.

1326322989948825602 2020-11-11 08:36:57 +0800 <jwhallin> We know what to do!

1326318224275767297 2020-11-11 08:18:01 +0800 <jwhallin> @Lee_in_Iowa Now, who paid him?
1326317621550096384 2020-11-11 08:15:37 +0800 <jwhallin> @MalcolmNance @HoltonSharp The Trump Fascist State coup is in process.
1326317310093635584 2020-11-11 08:14:23 +0800 <jwhallin> Absolutely! It’s negligent &amp; stupid. Past is prologue. Spanky will do anything to stay in power. Anything.
1326316602342584321 2020-11-11 08:11:34 +0800 <jwhallin> @AdamParkhomenko @AtreiyaN7 Explanation: replacing Pentagon professionals with Trump lackeys that will obey Trump’s orders to unleash the U.S.Military on the populace during a fascist coup. The U.S. Military will not comply.
1326313705521389573 2020-11-11 08:00:03 +0800 <jwhallin> The GOP goes ever lower, day by bloody day.

1326305215994241024 2020-11-11 07:26:19 +0800 <jwhallin> Yes! Now!
1326305028915691520 2020-11-11 07:25:35 +0800 <jwhallin> I’m not gonna hold my breath.
1326304644126027776 2020-11-11 07:24:03 +0800 <jwhallin> To order the U.S.Military to support a fascist coup in America. Next question...
1326304321596616705 2020-11-11 07:22:46 +0800 <jwhallin> @SunflowerSoul71 By definition it’s not “treason”, but it is most certainly sedition.
1326303042740785153 2020-11-11 07:17:41 +0800 <jwhallin> @honeyNOTvinegar @TomJChicago That is exactly what they are up to.
1326300389017153540 2020-11-11 07:07:08 +0800 <jwhallin> Indeed! Something no Republican has ever done.

1326299304617680897 2020-11-11 07:02:50 +0800 <jwhallin> Really good!
1326297971445489664 2020-11-11 06:57:32 +0800 <jwhallin> Now, Don! The Dems are at cocktails &amp; canapés this hour. They don’t wish to be further upset today....🤨
1326296792128909312 2020-11-11 06:52:51 +0800 <jwhallin> @richones1 I’m stayin’ out of this one! 😉
1326283398621532161 2020-11-11 05:59:38 +0800 <jwhallin> Exactly! That is THE game plan!
1326281783512461313 2020-11-11 05:53:12 +0800 <jwhallin> The MAGAts don’t give a damn!
1326281580013252609 2020-11-11 05:52:24 +0800 <jwhallin> Guaranteed! That is the end game for Spanky &amp; the GOP. The Dem leadership damn well better wake up!
1326281316774539267 2020-11-11 05:51:21 +0800 <jwhallin> @atrupar That is exactly the game plan, and it’s working (so far). Delegitimize the election results so that the House GOP can throw the election to Trump. We are once again at that place where too many are saying “it can’t happen here”. It damn well can!
1326279132934668288 2020-11-11 05:42:41 +0800 <jwhallin> Anyone believing this is just “noise in the channel” is badly mistaken. It seems the current strategy is to completely delegitimize the election results &amp; then send the “case” to the House electors, where the GOP can throw the election to Trump.
1326262185161498624 2020-11-11 04:35:20 +0800 <jwhallin> And, he’ll continue doing so until he’s stopped...
1326261585808035841 2020-11-11 04:32:57 +0800 <jwhallin> @senatemajldr The Trump Misadministration had NOTHING to do with this vaccine. As always, here is Russian owned mob criminal &amp; arch traitor #MoscowMitch spewing nonsense &amp; Fake News. He’s a disgrace. He belongs in prison!
1326260652134952960 2020-11-11 04:29:14 +0800 <jwhallin> It’s exactly that!

1326254896023154688 2020-11-11 04:06:22 +0800 <jwhallin> They don’t want you saying the quiet part out loud, Bill.  They’ll take a coup if they can get away with it. What’s been going on the past week are “trial balloons”...testing the relative level of resistance to overturning a “free &amp; fair” election.

1325890123351822336 2020-11-10 03:56:53 +0800 <jwhallin> Lindsey is the poster cabana boy for everything that is so horribly wrong with the GOP. No ethics. No morals. No integrity. No compassion. No intelligence. No redeeming human attributes, whatsoever.
1325889436064739328 2020-11-10 03:54:10 +0800 <jwhallin> That’s exactly what it’s been since Obama’s first term. Try to keep up, George!😉

1325833303304200192 2020-11-10 00:11:06 +0800 <jwhallin> Guaranteed the GOP rigged this election! They can’t win “free &amp; fair” elections.
1325818147031539713 2020-11-09 23:10:53 +0800 <jwhallin> Yes!
1325816989785317376 2020-11-09 23:06:17 +0800 <jwhallin> A thorough investigation is absolutely in order. These numbers make NO sense. #MoscowMitch cheated his way to re-election, and I suspect this is the case in other States. Once the Biden admin. is in office, we need to get the FACTS!
1325807898396565504 2020-11-09 22:30:09 +0800 <jwhallin> Yep! It’s a fact!

1325803729325469706 2020-11-09 22:13:35 +0800 <jwhallin> True, but it’s been apparent for at least the past 12 years. The GOP isn’t interested in “governing”... they want to RULE America by way of a fascist theocracy.
1325803033775599618 2020-11-09 22:10:50 +0800 <jwhallin> @essenviews How, you ask? C.H.E.A.T.I.N.G.
1325802582921498625 2020-11-09 22:09:02 +0800 <jwhallin> They most certainly do not make sense. Mitch cheated his way to re-election, as he has always done. It’s time for a very deep dive into this skulduggery!
1325801414585507842 2020-11-09 22:04:24 +0800 <jwhallin> @iamLucretiaMott We will never forget!
1325801134418661376 2020-11-09 22:03:17 +0800 <jwhallin> So much for “unity”. This is the part where the gloves come off! We are not going to allow the GOP to subvert this election!
1325800442714939394 2020-11-09 22:00:32 +0800 <jwhallin> What is this world coming to?! A politician serving the people?
1325799999083433984 2020-11-09 21:58:46 +0800 <jwhallin> @DavidCornDC @VP He’s only doing it because Joe Biden is putting his own task force together. It’s a sham by a soulless con man, completely devoid of any redeeming human attributes. We are not fooled.
1325797210894729221 2020-11-09 21:47:41 +0800 <jwhallin> Indeed! Let’s do it!
1325797028568293376 2020-11-09 21:46:58 +0800 <jwhallin> We didn’t need any further proof Spanky is a rank cheat &amp; liar...

1325530186838761472 2020-11-09 04:06:38 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump No one heard you bellyaching when the’16 election was called by MSM way before this one was called! You’re DONE! Pack your shit &amp; Get Out!
1325527999718907904 2020-11-09 03:57:56 +0800 <jwhallin> @ifshesaidso @Mabelais63 We learn best from our harshest lessons because we’re human. The same stubbornness that gets in the way of “easy learning” also hardens us for the worst events. As we evolve, hopefully we’ll get smarter &amp; a bit more flexible.
1325513177497395200 2020-11-09 02:59:03 +0800 <jwhallin> That’s all Spanky knows how to do...rip people off!
1325511103955173381 2020-11-09 02:50:48 +0800 <jwhallin> Yeah, but...they’re good with ACA, it’s Obamacare they reallly hate! 🙄 Freaking Losers!

1325503065433149440 2020-11-09 02:18:52 +0800 <jwhallin> I must agree!
1325500216275918848 2020-11-09 02:07:32 +0800 <jwhallin> @MontyBoa99 It’s also saying the GOP is resisting the peaceful transfer of power. Are they going to go “full Traitor”? Do these punks think they’re going to thwart the Will of the People?

1325482734936977409 2020-11-09 00:58:04 +0800 <jwhallin> @BioTurboNick @DBossIsBack2 Let us understand that “paying off campaign debt” is a euphemism for “going straight into Spanky’s personal off-shore accounts”. Does anybody really believe this fukwad is going to repay any debts? Please!  https://t.co/uarZRFxHLY
1325481293547597824 2020-11-09 00:52:21 +0800 <jwhallin> Now!
1325477397597024256 2020-11-09 00:36:52 +0800 <jwhallin> @HKrassenstein Uh, no! Spanky is going to be working for We, The People, on a chain gang. He’s got a bigly debt to society to repay. He’ll be good on that debt by about 2449 CE.
1325476571092713473 2020-11-09 00:33:35 +0800 <jwhallin> It’s not about “revenge”, it’s about “consequences”. Accountability, by definition, ends with consequences.
1325471847551434757 2020-11-09 00:14:49 +0800 <jwhallin> @tedlieu @Jerri47 So, Ted...what’s up with Spanky firing 3 agency heads in charge of our nuclear programs? This seems very, very dangerous!
1325471330066550785 2020-11-09 00:12:45 +0800 <jwhallin> The same applies to every member of the GOP still trying to sell the Fake News of a stolen election. They are traitors, pain &amp; simple!

1325465891782320129 2020-11-08 23:51:09 +0800 <jwhallin> Hoorah!
1325465664019034112 2020-11-08 23:50:14 +0800 <jwhallin> I know this will go “against the grain” for Joe Biden, but the most efficient way to neutralize #MoscowMitch is to designate every cabinet member as “acting” to end run his guaranteed obstruction.

1325450643109146624 2020-11-08 22:50:33 +0800 <jwhallin> Correct! The GOP hates Democracy &amp; they hate America.

1325132780217331716 2020-11-08 01:47:29 +0800 <jwhallin> @MollyJongFast @Skepmi The Trump kids can move straight to Rikers!
1325130803114700802 2020-11-08 01:39:37 +0800 <jwhallin> @kyledcheney ...don’t forget to mention the Russian debt collectors coming for full settlement. Appendages are accepted in lieu of non-payment...😳
1325130313362595842 2020-11-08 01:37:41 +0800 <jwhallin> @JeffPottering @michellemalkin It’s OVER. All butt-hurt Fascist snowflakes may now show themselves out. You won’t be missed.

1325118428508647428 2020-11-08 00:50:27 +0800 <jwhallin> I could not agree with you more! The two Georgia Senate seats are absolutely vital to protecting our democratic Republic! Vote Ossoff &amp; Warnock!
1325115627128774657 2020-11-08 00:39:19 +0800 <jwhallin> Yaaasss! ✊🏻🇺🇸🗽
1325113767835754496 2020-11-08 00:31:56 +0800 <jwhallin> @rpdandy Good! It’ll be sweet pleasure watching him dragged out &amp; kicked to the curb!
1325111628128419841 2020-11-08 00:23:26 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump No. You LOST the election by a lot. There, I fixed it for ya, once again. Now, GTFOH!
1325111243196133381 2020-11-08 00:21:54 +0800 <jwhallin> The Republicans are also dedicated to poisoning democracy. They can’t win “free &amp; fair” elections, so don’t hold your breath waiting for that which will never happen.

1325110429668966401 2020-11-08 00:18:40 +0800 <jwhallin> @rpdandy Never believe a damn thing said by #MoscowMitch. This turd has been lying, non-stop, for over 35 years. He’s not going to change.
1325109924435689472 2020-11-08 00:16:39 +0800 <jwhallin> Fumigation, followed by a deep spiritual cleansing ritual!
1325109316819415041 2020-11-08 00:14:15 +0800 <jwhallin> Give it a few hours. They’re so addicted to his nonsense, they’ll be back in short order. The media cannot live in a sane world led by a POTUS who embodies Decency, Respect &amp; Integrity.
1325108329509629952 2020-11-08 00:10:19 +0800 <jwhallin> @realTuckFrumper Yeah, tell Maria we’re not going to miss her Fascist ass!
1325108096331513858 2020-11-08 00:09:24 +0800 <jwhallin> @Pot_Pizza_Pinot Agree!
1325107485892440064 2020-11-08 00:06:58 +0800 <jwhallin> I second this motion! “Weenie Time” for the corporate media cabal has expired!
1325106918151475201 2020-11-08 00:04:43 +0800 <jwhallin> @JoyceWhiteVance Why has Alito gone rogue? This isn’t the act of someone who is on SCOTUS to defend &amp; uphold the Constitution of the U.S.  Why hasn’t CJ Roberts reigned him in?
1325106324577771520 2020-11-08 00:02:21 +0800 <jwhallin> Barf is incognito somewhere in Malta, hoping no one remembers all his criminals acts to enable the Trump Fascist State. He’s going to be sorely disappointed.
1325105865838403584 2020-11-08 00:00:32 +0800 <jwhallin> Likely, something more nefarious, Glenn. It fits with his actions the past 4 years, and it never ends well for our country!

1325095351334830087 2020-11-07 23:18:45 +0800 <jwhallin> Absolutely!
1325094068355960840 2020-11-07 23:13:39 +0800 <jwhallin> @LeonaLioness6 Can Twitter just cut to the chase &amp; permanently suspend Spanky’s account?!
1325093363859640321 2020-11-07 23:10:51 +0800 <jwhallin> Roger that!
1325092616933838849 2020-11-07 23:07:53 +0800 <jwhallin> Of course! Isn’t it obvious? He’s been a deep state ringer for years &amp; paid by George Soros &amp; Obama to subvert the Radical Right’s agenda to rig the elections so Hillary can keep her child porn operation in NYC funded. Do try to keep up, willya?! 🙄
1325091446219702278 2020-11-07 23:03:14 +0800 <jwhallin> Fuck ‘em!
1325090195956408321 2020-11-07 22:58:16 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump Fairy Tales can come true, but they ain’t happening for YOU! The frauds in this election are: - YOU!  - Louis DeJoy - the Radical Right Nut Job propaganda machine - Putin - The corrupt traitors in the GOP You’re DONE, Baby! Pack Up. Get Out!
1325080640350375936 2020-11-07 22:20:18 +0800 <jwhallin> @joncoopertweets Let’s get real. Spanky will never concede, and we don’t give a damn. He’ll be dragged out if necessary. End.Of.Story.
1325079843571081221 2020-11-07 22:17:08 +0800 <jwhallin> But, of course! All of this “protesting” is being carefully orchestrated by the fascists seeking to retain &amp; expand their RULE over America. We, The People, have said “Hell No”!
1325079219366293505 2020-11-07 22:14:39 +0800 <jwhallin> We must change that stupid shit, and we shall!  Together!
1325078429172068352 2020-11-07 22:11:30 +0800 <jwhallin> @deanofdublin @thinkkimthink Spanky is wholly incapable of acting with “grace”. And, “preserving his legacy” is the most insane suggestion made in modern time. Why would anyone want to “preserve the legacy” of a Russian owned mob criminal &amp; traitor?
1325076849253212162 2020-11-07 22:05:14 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump You’re going to prison, Baby! Say “Bye”!
1325072518835679233 2020-11-07 21:48:01 +0800 <jwhallin> @tedlieu @CNN @MSNBC The corporate media fascists are giving Spanky as much opportunity to blow up the ‘20 election as possible. It’s “good business” for them. And, they fear the repeal of the #TaxScam. We need to break up these media conglomerates!
1325071408339144704 2020-11-07 21:43:37 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump You’ve lost, Baby. It’s the END of Spanky. The Trump Fascist State has been repudiated. Get ready to spend the rest of your life in prison. It’s your only destiny!
1325070597005606917 2020-11-07 21:40:23 +0800 <jwhallin> @JoeBiden @EagleGuardian2 The RNC/GOP Fascist Cabal disagrees, Joe. That’s why they have to go!  https://t.co/vjusPUfacZ
1325068451665174528 2020-11-07 21:31:52 +0800 <jwhallin> Exactly! There can be no more illusion about this...Spanky’s clear intention is, and always has been, to be Dictator. And, the GOP happily agrees. Bad!
1325066781971554309 2020-11-07 21:25:14 +0800 <jwhallin> Roger that!
1325064685993947136 2020-11-07 21:16:54 +0800 <jwhallin> We are all aware of this! Dems will surge these run-offs with cash &amp; support. If the best we can do right now is split the Senate 50-50, we MUST get it done!

1324898469446782976 2020-11-07 10:16:25 +0800 <jwhallin> But, apparently, that’s exactly where we’re at...the corporate media fascists are giving Spanky all the time he needs to create more chaos &amp; disorder.

1324889041960013824 2020-11-07 09:38:57 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump Ask Louis DeJoy...the punk you hired to rig the election...
1324888722744045569 2020-11-07 09:37:41 +0800 <jwhallin> @lawrencehurley So...Spanky is pissed  off because his lawyers can’t sell Fake News to the judiciary?
1324887992264138752 2020-11-07 09:34:47 +0800 <jwhallin> @BlueVotr Nicole Wallace
1324886134720114688 2020-11-07 09:27:24 +0800 <jwhallin> @JJohnsonLaw True. But, the Republicans have been successfully subverting the legal system for so long, they no longer believe they can be stopped. It’s time to deliver their wake-up call!
1324885597190672384 2020-11-07 09:25:16 +0800 <jwhallin> ...and, his is one no dog would ever sniff!
1324885441338769410 2020-11-07 09:24:39 +0800 <jwhallin> The corporate media fascists are doing all possible to give Spanky an opening to blow up the election results. It’s good for “business”...🤨
1324884927331004416 2020-11-07 09:22:36 +0800 <jwhallin> Yes! Let’s stop with the compulsive urge to gin up more click bait outrage. It is dangerous &amp; irresponsible. In short, MSM, act like mature, responsible adults.
1324884182795919360 2020-11-07 09:19:38 +0800 <jwhallin> Everybody but Spanky...

1324883068499341312 2020-11-07 09:15:13 +0800 <jwhallin> I’d pay good money for a front row seat!
1324882901922508800 2020-11-07 09:14:33 +0800 <jwhallin> @CCLcaribecrew @realDonaldTrump Better idea, Spanky...imagine yourself doing the rumba at the Friday night circle jerks up in Cell Block A!
1324882371254972416 2020-11-07 09:12:27 +0800 <jwhallin> Spanky is finding out, the hard way, he is not at all charming.
1324880886051921920 2020-11-07 09:06:32 +0800 <jwhallin> @chipfranklin 😂😂😂
1324880521629900801 2020-11-07 09:05:06 +0800 <jwhallin> @CCLcaribecrew I demand a second audit! No worries! I’ll do it myself! 😉
1324849635198869504 2020-11-07 07:02:22 +0800 <jwhallin> @aroseblush @educatedadult1 Why? Because Bill Barr decided not to prosecute, but he did go after Senator Burr because Spanky wanted him taken down.  See how that works? In a Fascist State there is no “justice”, rather there is selective persecution of the dictators “enemies”.
1324848723743047680 2020-11-07 06:58:44 +0800 <jwhallin> When John O. Brennan speaks, it is wise to listen. He is a man for all seasons! A true American Patriot!
1324847817479778305 2020-11-07 06:55:08 +0800 <jwhallin> And, she’ll be POTUS one day, too!
1324847469746778112 2020-11-07 06:53:45 +0800 <jwhallin> @AudreyStJames1 Each of these traitors has a long overdue reckoning with Justice!
1324845050384113664 2020-11-07 06:44:09 +0800 <jwhallin> Once Barf is gone, I want to see this smug, entitled bitch indicted for insider trading...along with every other mofo who did it, too!
1324844465622691841 2020-11-07 06:41:49 +0800 <jwhallin> Ditto!

1324827668097818624 2020-11-07 05:35:04 +0800 <jwhallin> That, and Canada is very selective about who they allow to emigrate..most MAGAts are not really welcome.
1324805975656734725 2020-11-07 04:08:52 +0800 <jwhallin> @nowthisnews @realBigBalls Sage advice, but Spanky has no “big boy pants”. He’s a cryin’ punk in a diaper, and he’s been one his entire life!
1324804707441729536 2020-11-07 04:03:50 +0800 <jwhallin> @AndreaR9Md @CURTISGWIZ You are correct. The GOP has no idea how things work in this country. Like Spanky, they just make shit up. We’re done with that!
1324803717439266816 2020-11-07 03:59:54 +0800 <jwhallin> @ABC @catlover1943 I’m with ya 100%! ✊🏻🇺🇸🗽
1324769348595064832 2020-11-07 01:43:20 +0800 <jwhallin> @RBReich @rkonizeski Look, this isn’t hard. A concession speech is not necessary. He leaves or he’s removed. If he foments armed insurrection, lock his ass up! That is all.
1324768582044057600 2020-11-07 01:40:17 +0800 <jwhallin> @NYTupelo7 Not a warning...a promise!

1324766800282742784 2020-11-07 01:33:12 +0800 <jwhallin> Thank you, Jake, for telling it like it is. The morons in the peanut gallery may now show themselves out.
1324763770678173696 2020-11-07 01:21:10 +0800 <jwhallin> @Waiting42020 @realDonaldTrump So...word is Melania is moving in with Rupert Murdoch; Kim G. has dumped coke-head Jr. for Karl Rove; Lara is on Tinder lookin’ for a new, big money squeeze &amp; Ivanka got an offer she can’t refuse from MbS...what’s Jared gonna do?
1324761329542983681 2020-11-07 01:11:28 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump Uh, are you paying attention to anything going on right now? You’re LOSING! And, when the curtain comes down &amp; the fat lady sings, you’re #1AndDone. Pack up your shit &amp; wait on the front porch for the paddy wagon to fetch you.
1324759718418505729 2020-11-07 01:05:04 +0800 <jwhallin> @TheRickyDavila We don’t require his “acceptance”. He’s going to be prosecuted for his crimes, starting with giving up that DNA sample in the E. Jean Carroll rape case.
1324759107040014338 2020-11-07 01:02:38 +0800 <jwhallin> @mhdksafa You are visible, but those you follow have been purged. Check w/ Twitter support.
1324757503947649025 2020-11-07 00:56:16 +0800 <jwhallin> Asha, the GOP are ALL punks &amp; cowards. They don’t have the gravitas to oppose Hair Furor, not one of them. He could be dead &amp; buried 100 years ago, and you’d never hear a peep from any of these losers. That is all.
1324756055482458113 2020-11-07 00:50:31 +0800 <jwhallin> @Deadpool650 @ashlie_weeks The Trump Fascist State has succeeded in making half of America as dumb as the moron in the WH. #MoscowMitch scores a bigly WIN for his paymasters in the Kremlin, as he &amp; the other GOP traitors sell out our country to the enemy. BAD!
1324718060440182784 2020-11-06 22:19:32 +0800 <jwhallin> @lauferlaw @realDonaldTrump But, who’s gonna spank him with a copy of Forbes magazine when he’s in prison? 🤔

1324715400496467969 2020-11-06 22:08:58 +0800 <jwhallin> @RandPaul Fake News from a trump sycophant, corrupt Politico &amp; traitor to his country. You may show yourself out now. We are DONE with you!
1324714944256860160 2020-11-06 22:07:09 +0800 <jwhallin> Every day. There can never be a time to relax our vigilance. As Benjamin Franklin famously said “You have a Republic, if you can keep it.”. We have almost half our population supporting a fascist regime in America. Bad!
1324713059114344449 2020-11-06 21:59:39 +0800 <jwhallin> #MoscowMitch is not a leader. He’s a corrupt traitor shilling for his paymasters in the Kremlin &amp; their paid stooge in the WH. Justice is Coming for #MoscowMitch!

1324705908224483328 2020-11-06 21:31:15 +0800 <jwhallin> Sadly, I must agree. The DNC election “strategy” was a near total fail. And, GOP voter suppression &amp; voting fraud continue to compromise “free &amp; fair” elections.

1324526046264225792 2020-11-06 09:36:32 +0800 <jwhallin> There must be a very thorough investigation of voting fraud in this country. From hackable voting machines to fascists dumping or hiding ballots, we have a BIG problem. Let’s start with TX, KY, GA &amp; FL.

1324364663379828738 2020-11-05 22:55:15 +0800 <jwhallin> @TheRickyDavila It starts with Joe taking off the gloves &amp; appointing all Cabinet members as “acting”, thus bypassing #MoscowMitch purposely obstructing his Cabinet appointees. Otherwise we’ll have 2 wasted years fighting this battle!

1324349434499461128 2020-11-05 21:54:45 +0800 <jwhallin> @RawStory Easy fix: all Cabinet appointees are deemed “acting”, bypassing Senate confirmation.

1324341907028234241 2020-11-05 21:24:50 +0800 <jwhallin> Well, to be fair, the GOP has done all possible to compromise free &amp; fair elections. They can’t win without cheating, lying &amp; violating their collective oath of office, daily.
1324340593732902912 2020-11-05 21:19:37 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump Sez the dude who welcomes all forms of foreign vote hacking &amp; voter suppression &amp; active voting fraud by the GOP. Take a seat, Baby. You’re #1AndDone. Prepare yourself for prison!
1324339414726705157 2020-11-05 21:14:56 +0800 <jwhallin> DB will get stiffed for the full amount like all Trump debt holders get stiffed. He’ll be headed to a living purgatory of lawsuits; felony indictments &amp; prison. It will serve DB right for all the Russian money laundering they’ve been doing for decades.
1324338666790006785 2020-11-05 21:11:57 +0800 <jwhallin> Georgia Democrats! Let’s get it done!
1324338458840608770 2020-11-05 21:11:08 +0800 <jwhallin> Spanky won’t concede under any scenario because it means the END of Spanky. Nevertheless, he’ll lose &amp; be removed, if necessary.
1324337867565330432 2020-11-05 21:08:47 +0800 <jwhallin> Fascists want democracy to put them in power...then they can’t move fast enough to destroy it. We cannot let these idiots prevail!

1323653957948903424 2020-11-03 23:51:10 +0800 <jwhallin> Question: how many Russian Oligarch private jets are now “standing back &amp; standing by” proximate to Trump properties in VA, NJ &amp; FL?   I’m bettin’ Spanky tries to flee the country when he loses. Leaving his 3 elder progeny behind, holding the bag, of course.

The only downside is bunking with Rudy...😎

1321817446144073728 2020-10-29 22:13:31 +0800 <jwhallin> @soledadobrien The sad truth is Perdue is the template for the corrupt GOP, Senate &amp; House; local State &amp; Federal. This isn’t a political party, it’s a crime syndicate dedicated to destroying democracy, condemning the 99% to abject poverty. We must get rid of them!
1321814921055645697 2020-10-29 22:03:29 +0800 <jwhallin> Stunning how hypocrisy seems to be the leading attribute of the GOP. It’s right up there with being tone deaf; corrupt to the core; anti-American. It’s time to send these clueless bums home to civilian life. Let us 🔥FIRE🔥them all!

It’s looting the U.S. Treasury &amp; skimming all the government contracts he parcels out to his donors. That, and selling out the U.S. to hostile foreign powers for bribes. Can we agree it’s time to show this bum the door?!

Next stop on Spanky’s Crazy Train is Rikers Island...the new HQ for Russian mob criminals &amp; traitors! Rice &amp; beans at every meal! 🤣🤣🤣
1319673632109584389 2020-10-24 00:14:46 +0800 <jwhallin> Absolutely!
1319673261018521601 2020-10-24 00:13:18 +0800 <jwhallin> Let’s see Spanky bragging when he’s called forth to answer for his crimes against humanity...👇  https://t.co/XfLnBBb3YQ
1319672857845288964 2020-10-24 00:11:42 +0800 <jwhallin> Give me a moment to find my “surprised face”!
1319672050529828866 2020-10-24 00:08:29 +0800 <jwhallin> @ValJone99376043 @JoeBiden I agree completely.
1319671725236289536 2020-10-24 00:07:12 +0800 <jwhallin> Bottom Line: Spanky &amp; #MoscowMitch know they have to deliver real relief to the 99%, much as they don’t give a shit what happens to the unrich. They think this will save them on November 3rd (it won’t!). Nancy has them on the hot seat to deliver.
1319670032000077825 2020-10-24 00:00:28 +0800 <jwhallin> It doesn’t affect Corny, so he doesn’t care. It’s time to dump these turds, en Toto!
1319669556760268804 2020-10-23 23:58:35 +0800 <jwhallin> Absolutely!
1319668595945885696 2020-10-23 23:54:46 +0800 <jwhallin> Uh, there is a follow-up to voting them out. We need to investigate exactly who has received illegal foreign campaign contributions from hostile foreign powers. Much of this money has been cleverly funneled thru the NRA &amp; other alt-right orgs.
1319666817670012928 2020-10-23 23:47:42 +0800 <jwhallin> @ValJone99376043 I can’t answer that question. But, it will be a priority of the new administration upon Joe’s inauguration. Regrettably, great harm, physical, mental &amp; emotional has already been inflicted in these children.

1319651298841591809 2020-10-23 22:46:02 +0800 <jwhallin> @HelenaofTroy60 Bannon, Rudy Stupid &amp; Spanky make the Three Stooges look smart. It’s safe to say America’s 4 year “experiment” with anarchy &amp; fascism has been a dismal failure. The RNC/GOP must &amp; will pay the price for enabling these buffoons!
1319647178374193153 2020-10-23 22:29:39 +0800 <jwhallin> @EricTrump Gumby been huffin’ glue again!  Ms. James has a bigly surprise for you, Gumby. Your days as a grifting loser are OVER!

1319627937067446277 2020-10-23 21:13:12 +0800 <jwhallin> That’s a fact! We all know how that campaign cash disappeared...Spanky stuffed it in his offshore accounts. He needs all the getaway money he can grab. He’s going to discover it’s not easy to flee the country when you’re a traitor on the lam!

1318927601256247298 2020-10-21 22:50:19 +0800 <jwhallin> Indeed!
1318926661837082624 2020-10-21 22:46:35 +0800 <jwhallin> Spanky’s campaign is broke because he’s been looting it for getaway money. He knows it’s over. Now, he thinks he’s going to escape Justice. Not gonna happen, Baby! You will be prosecuted for your crimes! Prison awaits you!
1318926025359822848 2020-10-21 22:44:03 +0800 <jwhallin> @shannonrwatts These “renegade sheriffs” must be removed from office. They are supporting an armed insurrection against the State of Michigan &amp; the United States. Traitors!

1318903419743199232 2020-10-21 21:14:13 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump Lemme fix this for ya, Spanky: Biden is going to raise taxes on all who earn over $400K, so we can start rebuilding America &amp; save SS, Medicare &amp; ACA. The GOP will be fired because they are don’t give a damn about the people. Spanky goes to Prison.
1318704875753144322 2020-10-21 08:05:17 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump Don’t bother. We’re not the least bit interested. Two more weeks &amp; you’re #1AndDone. Watch as Putin, Xi, Erdogan &amp; others suddenly don’t know you; never heard of you; thought you were a coffee boy.

1318671210394374145 2020-10-21 05:51:30 +0800 <jwhallin> @Yamiche Spanky has been a total failure in all categories, including foreign policy, unless anyone believes selling our country out to hostile foreign powers was some kind of coup d’ gras. 🤨

1318353834591342594 2020-10-20 08:50:22 +0800 <jwhallin> @joelockhart Spanky knows he can’t beat Joe, so he’s trying his usual tactics of deflect, disrupt &amp; distract. Problem is it only works on the Lamestream Media. The rest of us are onto this idiots games. Time to show him the door!

1318298519384576006 2020-10-20 05:10:34 +0800 <jwhallin> @1964chick @Happydog23 The GOP looted the SS fund back in GWB’s regime, paying for two wars on a credit card. They don’t want to pay it back, so the easy fix is to first reduce benefits, then shut it down. This has been on the RNC/GOP “to do” list for a long time.

1318266880717688833 2020-10-20 03:04:51 +0800 <jwhallin> @SenTedCruz @washingtonpost @seungminkim So....the GOP is proposing a plan to prevent “court packing”? The same “court packing” they’ve been doing for 4 years? We can bet it has no retroactive provision &amp; would take effect sometime in 2021, after they’ve been swept out of office. 🤨
1318259155094962181 2020-10-20 02:34:09 +0800 <jwhallin> @GeorgeTakei @ivyjofreeman As Adam Schiff warned these turds, “they are tied to Trump with a steel cord, for all time”. There will be no “mea culpas” accepted. All will walk the plank for their perfidy &amp; sedition.

You really need to keep up, Baby. And, we all know if you’re saying it, it’s a LIE! Now, go have bucket of extra crispy while we prepare your prison cell.

1317858749005074439 2020-10-19 00:03:05 +0800 <jwhallin> @EarlOfEnough He’s tapping into the abject stupidity that is apparently fairly rampant in America. As he once said “If I ran for POTUS I’d probably run as a Republican because they have the dumbest voters”. He was right.

1317855892663054336 2020-10-18 23:51:44 +0800 <jwhallin> @GeorgeTakei It is the electoral college vote that determines who wins, not the popular vote. But, one is linked to the other. An overwhelming popular vote for Biden should secure enough electoral votes to win. The key word here is “overwhelming”! We can do this!

To clean the very air we breathe &amp; the water we drink. We will adapt as necessary to meet this challenge.

It’s time to Man Up, Baby &amp; embrace your pending doom. We, The People,  are going to obliterate you &amp; the GOP @ the polls. You have 24 days to flee the country, if you can!
1315396183657979907 2020-10-12 04:57:43 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Let’s talk about #MoscowMitch packing the courts with unqualified alt-right lunatics. He’s been doing it for years. You can take a seat now, Baby, while we get your prison cell ready for your pending arrival.
1315395292217389064 2020-10-12 04:54:11 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump Spanky is on another delusional rant as the walls close in; the GOP starts to distance themselves; more criminal acts by #IMPOTUS3 are exposed; people are voting early in record breaking numbers. The END is HERE, Hair Furor! You’re going to prison!

Now the greedy cretins in the GOP think this is some form of “entitlement” they can seize or suspend. We, The People, say “Hell No”!

The corrupt traitors in the WH &amp; the GOP intend to establish a fascist dictatorship in America. We, The People, say “Hell No”!  Those enabling this criminal Fake POTUS will he brought to Justice!

Yeah, that’s actually happening in America, now! So, they don’t let politics get in the way of helping those in need.
1311760458261704704 2020-10-02 04:10:39 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump You LOST bigly, Baby ! Polls show you LOST 60-28. That’s a butt whoopin’ by anybody’s metric. They’re going to change the rules because you are incapable of civil discourse &amp; have no manners. So, children who can’t behave are subject to restrictions. Get it?

We’re gonna need your intelligence &amp; grit to sort through all the high crimes Spanky, Munchkin &amp; the GOP have been up to while looting the U.S. Treasury. These criminals belong in prison!
1310648385112887296 2020-09-29 02:31:40 +0800 <jwhallin> @JJohnsonLaw @HuffPostPol What say we trade Spanky’s IRS debt for 25 years @ Rikers Island, NO parole?!

1310646458153082882 2020-09-29 02:24:00 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump What’s going wrong is the low ratings, totally failing Fake POTUS &amp; 2020 election LOSER is propagating Fake News about ballots. None of your BS has any validity. Instead of digging the hole you’re in deeper, Resign Now!  https://t.co/m8TiLXuAd6
1310630142444793857 2020-09-29 01:19:10 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump You certainly are! That’s why we’re getting rid of you, Baby! Let’s see if can outrun Putin’s debt collectors!
1310629288090259463 2020-09-29 01:15:47 +0800 <jwhallin> @Terrence_STR So, lemme get this straight... Spanky pays ZERO, or next to ZERO taxes, but demands a $72.9M refund? How does one get a ticket on that gravy train? Askin’ for a friend...🙄
1310626474366513152 2020-09-29 01:04:36 +0800 <jwhallin> @mmpadellan @Scottcrates @realDonaldTrump Yo, Spanky! You see this, Baby? It’s true! Your days of playing kingpin are over. You’re broke, looting America just to get to a zero personal deficit. Wonder how long your felony sentence is going to be after your convicted, convict?

1310550158623617025 2020-09-28 20:01:21 +0800 <jwhallin> @LincolnsBible Not paying taxes is one thing...looting the Treasury to pay down his YUGE debts to Putin, the Oligarchs, MbS &amp; DB is quite another. We will be astounded by the amount Spanky, Mnuchin &amp; others have stolen from the federal coffers. Lock.Them.Up. !
1310389477605609473 2020-09-28 09:22:51 +0800 <jwhallin> @realDonaldTrump You will be expunged from the WH in January. A YUGE win for the USA!  Many people are saying this...Believe me!

The FAA &amp; the FBI need to be on high alert for a raft of Russian Oligarch private jets in our airspace come early November. And, it wouldn’t surprise us if the Russian military tried to create a “war panic” at the same time.
1309925342384214017 2020-09-27 02:38:33 +0800 <jwhallin> @CREWcrew So...by this count Spanky is batting 1000% or 3,400-0 against “Law &amp; Order”. Does anybody see a problem here? 🤨

And, the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast is “all in”. It’s time to revoke the tax exempt status of religious institutions in America.

This wasn’t an accident or oversight...it’s a portent of things to come if this traitor is given another 4 years in the WH!

One would think a U.S. Senator has more important business to attend to. But, then, we must remember he takes his important meetings at the Kremlin.

Likely via a contorted series of Trump LLC transfers. He probably had to dole out some of that jing to keep certain parties quiet.

The poorly educated &amp; the intentional slackers never make it past the outer fringes of society. Their rage &amp; frustration builds as they blame their “problems” on others. Spanky “demonizes” the “others” for them. Bad!

Soon, you’ll be unemployed &amp; fleeing Russian debt collectors &amp; angry crowds of Americans demanding Justice! No worries, Baby... we’ve got a new job lined up for you...on a prison chain gang! How good is that?! 😎

Regrettably, the GOP has systematically underfunded public education in America because they rely on the dumbest voters.
