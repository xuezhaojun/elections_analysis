1342586669820567552 2020-12-26 05:43:00 +0800 <fncischen> There will always be demand for bodies of fiction revolving around "the political economy of cities", b/c it is such a consistent universal theme that will only become more relevant as labor, culture, and capital are very defined by geography
1342585670741549058 2020-12-26 05:39:02 +0800 <fncischen> Writing for me is making sense of the physical geography of cities &amp; how they are shaped by global economic forces and emerging future work. The style I'm trying to capture is the tension btwn different political stakeholders in a larger urban landscape, and how they resolve them
1342585002874191872 2020-12-26 05:36:23 +0800 <fncischen> Now I understand why lawyers go into fiction writing lol. They have body of work to pull from via all the crazy parts of human nature they pick up

1341908135372410880 2020-12-24 08:46:45 +0800 <fncischen> anyhow this is a topic of another blog post
1341906757551996929 2020-12-24 08:41:17 +0800 <fncischen> there's a very strange libertarian ethos where "I just want to work on making money and not be involved in politics", usually to avoid the messiness of human nature... but now we're in uncharted territory where this polarization isn't something to ignore anymore
1341906128058236928 2020-12-24 08:38:46 +0800 <fncischen> i applaud Ray Dalio for really investing time into making economic inequality into the national spotlight... since these geographic wealth gaps harm the stability of the country    https://t.co/BRDGjEm3mo
1341903346123251712 2020-12-24 08:27:43 +0800 <fncischen> the problem is with the libertarian approach is that it leads to civil unrest, which only blows up if not addressed earlier. response is usually more police, which might improve public safety but ignores this cycle    history repeats itself    https://t.co/GpYsO4tb2W
1341902786594672640 2020-12-24 08:25:30 +0800 <fncischen> unless the feedback loop gets fixed, most business elite will take the libertarian approach and just move
1341902685671366659 2020-12-24 08:25:06 +0800 <fncischen> the problem is that high tax increases in the US lead to only incremental improvements of quality of life, and since the business elite get frustrated w/ trying to fix government (unless you're Michael Bloomberg, Bill Gates, or Ray Dalio), they go to a "low tax locale"
1341902167712514048 2020-12-24 08:23:02 +0800 <fncischen> lots of YouTubers in the YouTube space pretty open about this haha

1341891673773654016 2020-12-24 07:41:20 +0800 <fncischen> A lot of animators are drawn to AR Face Filters since they can apply character design to actual humans, but I believe if they take on the leadership role of being character designer for the AR avatar... Plus distribution and marketing, the rest is history
1341891160558559232 2020-12-24 07:39:18 +0800 <fncischen> The challenge with AR Face Filters is that it's easy to swipe and go without using the same one on a consistent basis. If used consistently, influencers can take on an avatar or alter ego that can be used to create a mini animation production
1341890688112238592 2020-12-24 07:37:25 +0800 <fncischen> The next iteration of AR Face Filters is converting them into consistent virtual avatars, that influencers can use to create their media empires around. Combined with world scaled AR, with digital production design sets, you have a remote media production company ready to deploy
1341887966407344129 2020-12-24 07:26:36 +0800 <fncischen> take on the the persona you want to be 5-10+ years from now; that confidence will take you far

1341838273291829248 2020-12-24 04:09:09 +0800 <fncischen> from an economic development perspective, this is a far more promising message as i don't think it's efficient to train an entire workforce to be "highly specialized widget plumbers"
1341838052109381632 2020-12-24 04:08:16 +0800 <fncischen> my philosophy has shifted from "lets train the entire  workforce to code" to, lets build the infrastructure that helps build the creator economy, so the existing workforce leverages their hidden talents, which were previously hampered due to technology / capital costs
1341837592275218433 2020-12-24 04:06:26 +0800 <fncischen> node-based programming systems will empower a new generation of creators into the workforce, who are more interested in the higher lvl creative direction, &amp; audience engagement, less in the "plumbing of code" - esp as our manufacturing capacity will be outsourced to AI/robots
1341835539691970561 2020-12-24 03:58:17 +0800 <fncischen> Good piece of why breaking down the language of anxiety makes a big difference in understanding where procrastination (or in some cases, imposter syndrome) comes from. thx to @becky_kybae for the recommendation    https://t.co/oKrPAMvmuv
1341832329602289664 2020-12-24 03:45:32 +0800 <fncischen> both the "node based" and "writing code" will still be needed, but.....  if you care more about removing the "cognitive load" of product development, and there are patterns that are emerging, the node based approach will win
1341831179008237568 2020-12-24 03:40:57 +0800 <fncischen> @ga7ahad lolllll
1341831089849962499 2020-12-24 03:40:36 +0800 <fncischen> It actually dawned on me how node-based programming systems just make sense for personalities that have both a logical way of thinking, but tackle problems best with tools that are highly visually oriented and less dependent on reading large code bases.

1340931874273705984 2020-12-21 16:07:26 +0800 <fncischen> @mattmireles they need the Miami hedonism as "inspiration" fused with their remote-first VC lifestyles
1340931034460745732 2020-12-21 16:04:06 +0800 <fncischen> i think my diverse interests (immersive retail, urban logistics, future of work, animation) are quite interconnected, if you consider that these topics are very integrated into a workforce that's dependent on a digital metaverse. "TikTok Memes as a landing page" says it all
1340929208839622662 2020-12-21 15:56:51 +0800 <fncischen> a lot of the news cycle in OBOR focuses heavily on the politics, financing, and infrastructure aspects... less on the impacts of urban development, industrial policy and digital economy (though this is changing); these topics merit exploration since they impact day to day life
1340928297673232387 2020-12-21 15:53:14 +0800 <fncischen> observing these themes in second and third tier cities in China gives us a glimpse into possible scenarios that will emerge in the next 5-10+ years
1340928123324403712 2020-12-21 15:52:32 +0800 <fncischen> a lot of first hand sources give me a trajectory of topics I'd like to read and write more about: how do projects like OBOR shape urban development, industrial policy, and digital economies in the global South?

1340926685877739526 2020-12-21 15:46:49 +0800 <fncischen> when i was in school, an area of interest for me was studying Chinese urban development. unfortunately, that was not a trajectory available to me at the time, so seeing essays like this on Zhihu make me happy since I can really readily get first hand sources

1338597216357781505 2020-12-15 05:30:20 +0800 <fncischen> its why studying the China model is important since there are business models for e-commerce that can be replicated in the United States with the right public-private partnerships
1338596972534456320 2020-12-15 05:29:22 +0800 <fncischen> ive definitely spoken to many people who are very interested in doing "digital agriculture social e-commerce" like a Shopfiy model, but there aren't a lot of formalized opportunities in the United States to do this... it is a very take your own initiative career trajectory

1337561073994514432 2020-12-12 08:53:05 +0800 <fncischen> @_tlr_ there's a lot of good career trajectories in environmental conservation / policy / planning, i think far better lifestyles than tech. policy is much easier to pick up
1337560985771503618 2020-12-12 08:52:44 +0800 <fncischen> @frankshi3d i want to be inside when the car crashes like in Miami Vices just for the shits and giggles lol
1337560021727514624 2020-12-12 08:48:54 +0800 <fncischen> @_tlr_ love the craft, tech lifestyle is a very different story
1337559930304307200 2020-12-12 08:48:32 +0800 <fncischen> @_tlr_ tbh having worked in another industry/profession like city planning gives me perspective, allows me to appreciate my old profession more, and grass is not always greener lol
1337559745075453953 2020-12-12 08:47:48 +0800 <fncischen> @_tlr_ It's ok I have them a lot too

1337556777706029056 2020-12-12 08:36:01 +0800 <fncischen> i hate using the word "luxury" lol. i like nice things too, but word i'd use is "authentic to self"

1337474184939593728 2020-12-12 03:07:49 +0800 <fncischen> for me this is a strange space to be in, since I'm a Millennial, and I know far less Millennials who are into virtual goods lol
1337472606941810689 2020-12-12 03:01:33 +0800 <fncischen> we're going to enter an era where emerging artists, not social media companies, will define the social and cultural institutions and infrastructure in a hybrid physical &amp; digital economy. put on your "Pop Culture Journalist" hat - it's going to be a wild ride
1337472133178408961 2020-12-12 02:59:40 +0800 <fncischen> this is especially true as now luxury fashion brands in China are collaborating with domestic artists - I believe future iterations of this will make this type of trajectory more viable in the next 5-10+ years    https://t.co/AUOjqho4Ph
1337469814818840576 2020-12-12 02:50:27 +0800 <fncischen> digital artists that branch out in creating their own virtual goods company, especially with integrated social e-commerce, and high gaming live-streaming penetration, will do well in 2020s as Gen Z will seek luxury status beyond physical goods    https://t.co/XSdy7lyGwU

1337468513489833985 2020-12-12 02:45:17 +0800 <fncischen> thats why noawadays, i bet less on social media companies, and more on immersive art spaces, pop up retail, or hybrid online to offline boutique retail.... there's a level of quality of attention, focus, and memory that you can't recreate on a mobile app    https://t.co/KZefH7gkuC
1337467991408037889 2020-12-12 02:43:12 +0800 <fncischen> if you see this.... you'll start to see everything like a game, and not put too much energy in building your self worth off that social media company, especially for the amount of hours or energy needed to maintain that
1337467533977239552 2020-12-12 02:41:23 +0800 <fncischen> The dirty secret of consumer social media companies is that innovation thrives from fatigue from existing platforms (i.e. status fatigue, audience fatigue, creativity fatigue, etc),   and its workforce is tasked to build and design the nuts and bolts to generate "new energy"

1337156662948286464 2020-12-11 06:06:06 +0800 <fncischen> i think that's always been the challenge - because of small team sizes (unless you're big tech and can hire tons of specialists), you're kind of forced to be "wearing multiple hats" b/c the infrastructure for pipeline development is all over the place
1337156267278622720 2020-12-11 06:04:31 +0800 <fncischen> as XR industry begins to have much more formalized career trajectories, it'll be much easier to focus on specific disciplines, rather than be a "developer/designer who wears w/ multiple hats", which will be great news for people who want better work/life balance lol
1337155818743951365 2020-12-11 06:02:44 +0800 <fncischen> also one thing to consider is that these don't touch things like game mechanics... i've found that some people really love focusing on the science of game mechanics, and others are really into the science of spatial design... two very different diciplines
1337155194820259843 2020-12-11 06:00:16 +0800 <fncischen> @cgallello damn no need to go to the movie theaters lol

1337151468848041984 2020-12-11 05:45:27 +0800 <fncischen> another course that i wish i took was the Physics of Sound and Light, which was under the architecture department at the time.... they really go over both the science and the art of acoustics in space; those lessons really become relevant once you're out on site
1337151109790461952 2020-12-11 05:44:02 +0800 <fncischen> when i was in school, some of my landscpape architect friends took courses on plant typology - understanding the nature of plants, soil conditions, best street / park design archetypes, etc. - being able to communicate this at a pipeline level goes very far in your career
1337150670600736769 2020-12-11 05:42:17 +0800 <fncischen> it's very similar to being like a creature designer at Lucas Film, where you basically become an expert at all the different types of animals in the Star Wars universe, and you have an extensive encyclopedia of the ins and outs of Star Wars creatures
1337150403184451587 2020-12-11 05:41:13 +0800 <fncischen> a great example is if you like designing Studio Ghibli trees, you become a master at painting it in Procreate, or knowing all the different lighting/shading/sculpting options on Blender, or studying the wind/foilage physics of Ghibili trees for tools like Houdini
1337150045997518848 2020-12-11 05:39:48 +0800 <fncischen> one advice that has worked for me is to focus on the things you enjoy creating the most, &amp; developing a "3D pipeline"  around all the relevant elements (light, color, VFX, etc.) to that particular piece - since you'll likely be making different iterations of this thru-out career

1336724157438955521 2020-12-10 01:27:28 +0800 <fncischen> @wwiillll @tiffani part of the challenge is ensuring the workforce has a strong trajectory of upward mobility... with tech, its usually a small % of the labor force, and there's usually a tech smug of "individual responsibility",  w/o recognizing the challenges of tech workforce re-skilling
1336722686056124417 2020-12-10 01:21:38 +0800 <fncischen> @tiffani what makes me sad is that the "resource extraction" part of tech culture lacks a public service element to it.   cities might love the much needed tax revenue from these tech VCs / startups, but the spillover effects won't be pretty
1336721459662602240 2020-12-10 01:16:45 +0800 <fncischen> We're in a weird time where the debate between "individual responsibility vs collective good" only got amplified via COVID and public health institutions, while seeping into the American primal roots of distrust of big government only amplified by social media.

1335103757479157760 2020-12-05 14:08:35 +0800 <fncischen> @naynerz @skinnylatte i can name so many Chinese-Americans who grew up in my neighborhood and parents who immigrated here in the 1980s-1990s who are way more HK/Taiwan focused, and that's also a product of media there
1335103418902274049 2020-12-05 14:07:14 +0800 <fncischen> @naynerz @skinnylatte yes its very different, depends a lot on geography &amp; era of immigration. i'm quite obsessed with Mainland China from a pop culture / architecture perspective, and thats b/c my parents coverage of China is mostly HK via 1990s HK movies.. so in hindsight, i'm trying to empty that

1335098756023250948 2020-12-05 13:48:43 +0800 <fncischen> @max_arbitrage partially b/c placemaking is a craft and process, it's not something you can just "optimize" or plop a low poly model into a 3D space.   but treating it this way makes a place lack character, and i find myself - with no shame or guilt - reading less about tech industry LOL
1335098335963705345 2020-12-05 13:47:02 +0800 <fncischen> @max_arbitrage that high level of sensory detail, draftsmanship, &amp; depth  gets harder to pick up as you get older.   def being in the tech side of things this last 4+ years made me appreciate tech less, funny enough, &amp; more of my old placemaking fields (urban design, landscape arch, etc.)
1335097701784899584 2020-12-05 13:44:31 +0800 <fncischen> @max_arbitrage i definitely will say studying landscape architecture helps a lot in terms of developing a habit/craft/draftsmanship in fields like VR/AR - specifically - spatial design, since you're taught to be very obsessed with things like plant material, playground design, watersheds etc
1335096904154157056 2020-12-05 13:41:21 +0800 <fncischen> @skinnylatte yeah my parents and grandparents generation is the "generational trauma" via the PRC Chinese Cultural Revolution and World War 2 China, so what they pass on to me as immigrants has definitely colored my own world view
1335096144054034434 2020-12-05 13:38:20 +0800 <fncischen> @max_arbitrage it's a good skill to get good at - probably far more than before. makes me wish i had studied landscape architecture, but hey, never too late than never to invest in this

1334254854110236672 2020-12-03 05:55:21 +0800 <fncischen> @jimmygunawanapp i think my interest in this virtual avatar space is less of the "I want to sell LV/Hermes bags using a Hatsune Miku / Kizuna AI avatar", but more of how virtual avatars serve to optimize animation pipelines for emerging animation directors

1332784682283352064 2020-11-29 04:33:24 +0800 <fncischen> @jason_waskey this is especially true if we're seeing VR companies adopt a VR remote workflow where you can be a fashion designer in Nairobi, Kenya, and do brand marketing campaign in Dubai UAE
1332784330515435520 2020-11-29 04:32:00 +0800 <fncischen> @jason_waskey i think more countries should adopt social e-commerce, or build public/private partnerships... too many cities focus too much on bringing back blue collar manufacturing jobs (or "Amazon Fufillment Centers"), when in reality, those jobs are going to be automated

1332779921257611264 2020-11-29 04:14:29 +0800 <fncischen> thats why these articles about social e-commerce interest me... it shows we need to consider revamping our retail infrastructure to be more resilient, and diversify depending on one country for keeping an industry afloat    https://t.co/ikk8McZlu5
1332779040722317314 2020-11-29 04:10:59 +0800 <fncischen> media, unlike industries such as AI, hardware/IoT, advanced manufacturing, is an industry that more of the workforce can participate in - the key is building the infrastructure such that more media business models become viable
1332778650739953664 2020-11-29 04:09:26 +0800 <fncischen> i like the emphasis of bringing manufacturing jobs via cross-border trade orgs, but media is the future of work, and foreign trade officers / chamber of commerces should facilitate the infrastructure to make this happen
1332778400407298048 2020-11-29 04:08:27 +0800 <fncischen> the key thing that I think governments should do - esp in the future of work - is to be invested in building the infrastructure for creative talent via cross-border trade. need more creative professionals in Chamber of Commerces, World Trade Organization, etc.
1332777876895240199 2020-11-29 04:06:22 +0800 <fncischen> i think especially with virtual production, photogrammetry, AI / computer vision, much more powerful 3D authoring tools - there exists an mainstream open-source infrastructure of creativity that didn't exist 20+ years ago
1332777601379647489 2020-11-29 04:05:16 +0800 <fncischen> i believe what steers people away from creative professions is that there's more work in developing your own goalposts and career trajectory goalposts, and without role models, it can be very intimidating
1332777424732499971 2020-11-29 04:04:34 +0800 <fncischen> i feel like for those reasons alone, i'm more comfortable with my future children pursuing creative opportunities; granted that they cultivate a strong sense of entrepreneurship, craftsmanship, and interpersonal relationships
1332776656356818944 2020-11-29 04:01:31 +0800 <fncischen> its why its still surreal that Blender is open source to me lol.... you could spend an entire weekend creating your own Blender 3D shader nodes / reading about it. the documentation is so extensive, it's like going to a endless library
1332775107312427011 2020-11-29 03:55:22 +0800 <fncischen> tbh, "the ability to take apart things" isn't a habit I had growing up until my late 20s, when I fell in love with 3D graphics.   i think it's b/c I like taking apart stuff with emotional resonance (animation / authoring tools, Blender), vs robots or Real Estate SaaS websites

1331794226930085889 2020-11-26 10:57:41 +0800 <fncischen> the anime cloud causing your mobile phone to drain batteries is a good example / use case, since your audience could be using a low-end Android phone in a rural area with bad wifi, so always have to optimize for that worse edge case lol

1331792848350453760 2020-11-26 10:52:13 +0800 <fncischen> 3D graphics / creative coding is a field where you pick up expertise, from getting stuck figuring out why the anime toon shader lighting is rendering funny for 4-6 hrs, or why your anime clouds are causing your mobile phone to drain batteries / performance.

1331515102613311488 2020-11-25 16:28:33 +0800 <fncischen> Focus on a few high impact activities attract the high quality personal and professional relationships you want, since you won't be average at many things. The quality of conversations will be much higher, since there's more depth into what you do.
1331514359869108225 2020-11-25 16:25:36 +0800 <fncischen> High impact activities allow you to be 10x at what you do.   It requires you to say no to things that you are lukewarm at - that's okay.   Relationships are built around humans who are high quality focused in their areas of expertise, and set strong boundaries around them.
1331512885952929792 2020-11-25 16:19:44 +0800 <fncischen> Focus on a few high impact activities, versus being average in many. Your quality of output will be richer.   Prune out the tasks that take out more energy than you put in.   Let your authenticity guide your quality of output.

1330252599161982981 2020-11-22 04:51:49 +0800 <fncischen> reading the bio of Lu Xun is fascinating since he captures the transition from using classical Chinese to vernacular Chinese as a medium for expressing human nature, and scaling it to the masses admist social and poltiical restructuring, and that is such a metaphor for our times

1330249735274369032 2020-11-22 04:40:26 +0800 <fncischen> why cultural amenities like "Burning Man" are convenient places to release steam, after a long fiscal year of ad optimization, SaaS productivity hacks, and eyeball clicks
1330249408580087808 2020-11-22 04:39:08 +0800 <fncischen> if your workforce is tied to building social media platforms or ad logistics platforms, its not surprising they will burn out since their main job is "optimization" - and there's only so much to optimize lol
1330248864897622024 2020-11-22 04:36:58 +0800 <fncischen> What's interesting about the SF exodus is that it reveals that its tech workforce:   once tied to the "startup" world as the means of self-actualization (thanks to the powerful tech marketing machine), recognizes that lifestyle matters much more in self-actualization
1330247330445062147 2020-11-22 04:30:53 +0800 <fncischen> Digital art auctioning's primary use case is 3D art asset "art collection" via a Art Basel -esque private art gallery, whereas Gen Z, via the Roblox generation, purchases 3D art assets to amplify their virtual avatars.

1330239772355420177 2020-11-22 04:00:51 +0800 <fncischen> the more interesting trend to watch is how these informal disparate metaverses   - the gaming, animation, fashion, social-ecommerce - evolve to become formalized media production companies with large scale distribution and marketing infrastructure
1330239119323230208 2020-11-22 03:58:15 +0800 <fncischen> the Western "nomenclature" of luxury implies many of the French fashion ateliers of the 20th Century, whereas in reality, culture is being produced all across the world, and haute couture is no longer exclusive to a few geographic hubs
1330238787444674562 2020-11-22 03:56:56 +0800 <fncischen> I think the nomenclature of "luxury fashion" will change as luxury fashion fuses with games/animation (see KDA, League of Legends, Louis Vuitton partnerships), since status will be achieved via hybrid digital/physical spaces    https://t.co/qORBCVt8Sa

1330235536804601857 2020-11-22 03:44:01 +0800 <fncischen> this is especially true, as the media landscape shifts from the  industry of mass media (Hollywood) to the industry of digital subcultures (metaverses)

That stuff will implode when one realizes the shallowness of that behavior
1328744885474652160 2020-11-18 01:00:42 +0800 <fncischen> @LysandraO @LucyJBoyle Thank you for writing this piece, Lysandra.   I had a close friend who went this direction, and I have a mixture of sadness and disgust; your piece resonates with my own coming to terms w/ my own friendship w/ her, and how we had to parted separate ways.
1328596451358896129 2020-11-17 15:10:52 +0800 <fncischen> Tons of the respect for manga artists who use Unreal Game Engine to set up the 3D composition for comics.  it's going to let them produce more volume of work at a faster rate, and allow them to focus on higher-lvl business urgent tasks   https://t.co/0ZWmQKe07d

1328535067900084224 2020-11-17 11:06:57 +0800 <fncischen> there's a quote from Ken Liu (@kyliu99), who states that his law career taught him: "good stories matter more than good institutions", and I definitely agree w/ him, after working in the public sector for several years   https://t.co/HZhn375o29
1328533747340173312 2020-11-17 11:01:42 +0800 <fncischen> for me, it's this weird fusion of city planning, economic development, animated content, VR/AR, that allows me to find cross-disciplinary insights that help amplify those industries
1328531351209865217 2020-11-17 10:52:11 +0800 <fncischen> for particle systems in 3D, its studying things like "particle time duration, particle velocity over time (can be mapped via 2D graph)" - all of which require a hybrid technical and creative acumen to find that right mix, especially to convey that sensory / psychological impact
1328530341850537984 2020-11-17 10:48:11 +0800 <fncischen> what can make art difficult is that its a combination of the study of the craft/technical draftsmanship of these highly detailed visual elements, combined with creating the composition needed to tell the story - all of which requires practice to develop strong taste
1328530013897908224 2020-11-17 10:46:52 +0800 <fncischen> @ga7ahad oh shit - legit for traveling
1328529950970789888 2020-11-17 10:46:37 +0800 <fncischen> its those subtle visual cues, which summed together, can make or break the story you try to convey
1328529841965072384 2020-11-17 10:46:11 +0800 <fncischen> the more you get immersed into 3D graphics, your eyes start to get sensitive to subtle elements like particle rotations, specular lighting, soft/hard edges, or color transitions
1328528128751255552 2020-11-17 10:39:23 +0800 <fncischen> @ga7ahad The future of menus, no more reading large wordy menus
1328524919366320129 2020-11-17 10:26:38 +0800 <fncischen> yep this is very true
1328518894940680192 2020-11-17 10:02:41 +0800 <fncischen> @damienics Yeah, I've spent a lot of time thinking about the saturated content market -   a lot of intangible elements like brand, personality, sense of humor, or visual storytelling become critical (but also takes longer to cultivate over time),
1328516634768666629 2020-11-17 09:53:43 +0800 <fncischen> @damienics I like Substack's minimalist design via email a lot; it removes the need to go on Substack's website directly to open up the newsletter.   Think this gets tricky if the user subscribes to 20+ newsletters, which definitely changes the game of the purpose of email
1328514969332109317 2020-11-17 09:47:05 +0800 <fncischen> i'd argue making that audience touchpoint via private DMs/emails is just as important as product development,   since it influences discoverability and the repeated feedback loops needed to build audience loyalty
1328514195755700225 2020-11-17 09:44:01 +0800 <fncischen> One under-looked UX design feature is the ability to make your content sharable / engaging via private DMs / emails.   Since many referrals to your product will likely come via friends, it has to be worth the cognitive load to open up a video, WeChat miniprogram, Snap Mini, etc.
1328499266445139968 2020-11-17 08:44:42 +0800 <fncischen> @JesseDamiani The Sandbox VR bankruptcy story mentioned in the article feels like a roller coaster, I remember when there was so much earlier press on how they raised funds from @a16z . How things have changed

1328476365016842240 2020-11-17 07:13:41 +0800 <fncischen> play is more exciting to build for,  since play explores the weight, pros and cons, and responsibility of each individual outcome,  this is more realistic to real life
1328473937919889409 2020-11-17 07:04:03 +0800 <fncischen> writing this made me realize the old way of social media (browsing endlessly on news-feed, monetizing based on polarity/extremes) will lead to cognitive fatigue, and thus its better to start building for that new future
1328473258862120960 2020-11-17 07:01:21 +0800 <fncischen> play is often a better form of cognitive development and learning, since it is a multi-sensory form of developing memory.
1328471641811087360 2020-11-17 06:54:55 +0800 <fncischen> any AR installation art piece should allow the audience to play, by testing out different hypotheses and their outcomes, to build a better understanding of the world around them
1328471241334788107 2020-11-17 06:53:20 +0800 <fncischen> @jiaqiluo sums up so much of a cultural problem we have in the US with mask aversion
1328469796246102017 2020-11-17 06:47:35 +0800 <fncischen> For any frontier type of art-form or technology, the biggest challenge is reducing the gap between R&amp;D and commercialization.

1328409745955442688 2020-11-17 02:48:58 +0800 <fncischen> @HarryAlisavakis though to be honest, there's an incredible benefit of understanding a lot of low-level graphics via shader, especially from a graphics pipeline perspective - its worth the work, especially if your product is running on mobile devices

1327680443349487616 2020-11-15 02:30:59 +0800 <fncischen> For me, it's all about finding ways to automate the process via Blender / Houdini Python hacks üë©‚Äçüé®üßñüèª

1327645178425819137 2020-11-15 00:10:51 +0800 <fncischen> VFX for enterprise AR helps break the montony of white collar desk jobs, by adding a layer of magic that doesn't exist in 2D computing - thus decreasing cognitive load.   The key is integrating this to the larger logistics of the big corp product/service pipeline
1327643919954239488 2020-11-15 00:05:51 +0800 <fncischen> One of the great things about technical art is that there are very cool business apps in XR (data viz, VFX for enterprise AR, 3D authoring for manufacturing).  However clients need help packaging what the final end product will look like, since the pipeline is so new 2 them

1327338162792775680 2020-11-14 03:50:53 +0800 <fncischen> rural retail, via a combination of digital social video e-commerce, XR, physical brick and mortar infrastructure, would be a critical lifeblood for the future of rural workforce;
1327335859159330819 2020-11-14 03:41:44 +0800 <fncischen> this paradigm of "cities being the lifeblood of economic productivity" will always be around, but it never accounts for health, which is why it'll be a paradigm shift to celebrate a rural workforce with hybrid remote workers and physical brick and mortal business
1327335491390193666 2020-11-14 03:40:16 +0800 <fncischen> the day when we see urban economists celebrate a highly productive rural workforce, versus stats like 70% of a country's workforce is urban, is when we'll see far healthier metrics of economic productivity
1327335221704880128 2020-11-14 03:39:12 +0800 <fncischen> people chose the "scalable low touch SaaS / enterprise B2B" SV route since there's more formalized trajectories &amp; goal posts...   but once the infrastructure for social video e-commerce, online 2 offline, Shopify brick &amp; mortar comes   i guarantee you they'll make that leap
1327334765964320768 2020-11-14 03:37:23 +0800 <fncischen> its mostly my personality (i'm ENFP) -   i value very highly personalized interactions, so I never really was into "scalable low touch SaaS" you see in Silicon Valley, b/c those don't have the personalized touch you see in traditional brick and mortar businesses
1327334434312314880 2020-11-14 03:36:04 +0800 <fncischen> i learned this from fashion designer Guo Pei - in haute-couture, you build customized, highly ornate dresses, which is why I'm drawn to AR installation art - designing customized elaborate art,   vs the traditional SV low-touch scalable SaaS business   https://t.co/0th0vaZ4bI

1327330257897021440 2020-11-14 03:19:28 +0800 <fncischen> 4) read your favorite 3D graphics APIs via Github repo, &amp; practice breaking apart (or explaining) how they work at a low-level, (i.e. as if you're contributing to open source)  this ritual preps you for debugging edge cases that pop up when 3D objs are not rendering properly  https://t.co/vvO3Y5TUgl
1327328181712457733 2020-11-14 03:11:13 +0800 <fncischen> 3) brute force is the fastest way to pick up 3D graphics.   no shortcuts work, since you have to make a lot of mistakes in order to develop the muscle memory to be familiar with each precise step in low level graphics
1327327571843772416 2020-11-14 03:08:48 +0800 <fncischen> some good tips for 3D graphics / WebGL / OpenGL stuff for particles:  1) tackle one problem at a time (physics, color/lighting, graphics API data structures, performance/rendering)  2) each time you test 3D graphics, isolate each problem and test all relevant edge cases
1327324411540566016 2020-11-14 02:56:14 +0800 <fncischen> for big picture people (like me), its a big shift from studying people to studying widgets (in this case, 3d graphics)
1327323478144348161 2020-11-14 02:52:32 +0800 <fncischen> for a lot of three.js stuff  a lot of time is spent reading about the craft &amp; widget via lots of 3D documentation....   way before you can get to the application and problem solving phase

1326697375688138752 2020-11-12 09:24:37 +0800 <fncischen> the best metaphor is playing a game like Simcity 4 or Civilization 6, and experimenting with the different victory scenarios in the game (and writing the scenarios in great detail).   if you can do that, you can rapid prototype in code

1325519160223256576 2020-11-09 03:22:49 +0800 <fncischen> cross-border trade &amp; cross-border cultural affairs help us create net economic productivity &amp; avoid populism, by matching hard to find highly skilled talent across borders.
1325518482247618561 2020-11-09 03:20:07 +0800 <fncischen> viewing the world in term of cross-border trade and cultural affairs recognizes the role of complimentary ecosystems, where we leverage different strengths, especially in a post-COVID 19 remote workforce. cross-border translators are needed so much
1325517513828962305 2020-11-09 03:16:16 +0800 <fncischen> "bootstraps mentality" ignores the role of ecosystems - leveraging highly specialized talent in your economic cluster to have far net economic productivity in your region. "it takes a village to raise a child"
1325516469183029248 2020-11-09 03:12:07 +0800 <fncischen> when you cultivate an economic ecosystem for "inventor maker culture", your workforce will think of themselves less as "logistical SaaS widgets" of large corporate machines, but larger net economic and cultural amplifiers that accelerate economic innovation
1325514879294320641 2020-11-09 03:05:48 +0800 <fncischen> i define public infrastructure for "inventor culture" as an ecosystem of strong leaders (inventors, teachers, 3d designers) combined with physical amenities, and the technology/tools for commercialization of products
1325513494670700544 2020-11-09 03:00:18 +0800 <fncischen> the problem with the "bootstraps" argument is that it ignores the role of public infrastructure in upward mobility, and the ppl who make this argument usually come from upper-middle-class backgrounds who take for granted access to good schools, etc.
1325511981600665601 2020-11-09 02:54:17 +0800 <fncischen> human capitalism is a combination of cultivating a strong maker culture that gives your workforce strong self-worth via tangible products, combined with public-private investments in public infrastructure &amp; that ensures your workforce can compete effectively in 21st century
1325511063585005568 2020-11-09 02:50:39 +0800 <fncischen> without that strong self-worth via cultivating the "inventor culture" in your nation, your workforce risks going into tribalism, Reddit conspiracy theory-land, and feeling that "my work has no meaning"
1325510592174632961 2020-11-09 02:48:46 +0800 <fncischen> cultivating an "inventor culture" in your economic ecosystem in your workforce can help prevent populism, by building a strong sense of self-worth identity via the creation of tangible physical products
1325510252524040193 2020-11-09 02:47:25 +0800 <fncischen> think why "inventor" culture grew with me was that I found the SV trajectory of making "real estate SaaS apps" very limiting,   since they don't address the US outsourcing of manufacturing overseas, which to many US blue collar workers, is a big part of US identity

1325341344852701184 2020-11-08 15:36:14 +0800 <fncischen> by having a strong grasp on the different lens of human morality, you'll have a much better vocabulary that helps make sense of the political polarity that exists in 2020
1325341006464647169 2020-11-08 15:34:54 +0800 <fncischen> policy thinktanks are great at capturing the fiscal or economic impact of a city's industry or political institutions  but don't explore why people develop the political views they do - which in 2020, given the polarity, very relevant to address
1325338556861050880 2020-11-08 15:25:10 +0800 <fncischen> which is why explaining how human morality manifests itself via politics - is better explored, not via policy thinktanks, but rather through the medium of the arts: fiction, film, fine art, etc.
1325337258199674882 2020-11-08 15:20:00 +0800 <fncischen> what ive learned is that its more important to understand how others convey or interpret (i.e. word choice, examples) human morality and manifest it via their politics.   you're more likely to address their concerns directly once you make sense of their mental models
1325336088555057152 2020-11-08 15:15:21 +0800 <fncischen> @brihui That post mask look

1325335956992389120 2020-11-08 15:14:50 +0800 <fncischen> A lot of NIMBY/YIMBY politics that exist come from how each individual weighs protecting individual interests and contributing to the public good on a sliding scale differently  - and those weights will come from their views of human nature &amp; life experience
1325334832574943233 2020-11-08 15:10:22 +0800 <fncischen> Discussing politics w/ others require having a nuanced vocabulary &amp; mental model of other people's view of human morality, which may differ dramatically from your own life experiences.

1325115402339246080 2020-11-08 00:38:26 +0800 <fncischen> Can jump in joy. The character and decency and emotional intelligence with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is needed to fix many of the divisions that grew these past 4 years

1325065898999209984 2020-11-07 21:21:43 +0800 <fncischen> @irosenb Yes - to get to that point requires a cultural shift, and nuanced vocabulary addressing their own primal fears
1325060373255344130 2020-11-07 20:59:46 +0800 <fncischen> I think it's why I've gravitated more toward writing these days...   no matter how good your career is, you'll eventually have to confront those lingering ‚ùìs of human morality, since they affect the world around you
1325059014665797632 2020-11-07 20:54:22 +0800 <fncischen> It's human nature to "avoid the messiness of politics".   It's only scary if "ignoring the messiness of politics &amp; human nature" threatens the stability of political institutions, which is 2020 and where we're at today
1325058467938279425 2020-11-07 20:52:11 +0800 <fncischen> One final thing I remember:  when I was in college, I remember many STEM ppl scorning studying politics, b/c they just wanted to get a good paying job after graduation  what I didn't realize later is that naviety avoids ppl from addressing the messiness of human nature
1325055831067422725 2020-11-07 20:41:43 +0800 <fncischen> It's never been a more relevant time to read up on philosophy or human morality, than ever since we'll need the vocabulary - without breaking into political polarization - to navigate our own politics especially as post-2020, the new normal is becoming reality

1325050953024770049 2020-11-07 20:22:20 +0800 <fncischen> What I've learned in politics is "everybody has a bit of NIMBY inside", and changing demographics and trends - accelerated by globalization, AI, tech - light up the primal identity politics in them. Politics is a fight between the inner NIMBY and morality of the greater good.
1325047642880057346 2020-11-07 20:09:10 +0800 <fncischen> What I never understood was how a Republican Party of decency (fiscal conservativism &amp; free enterprise) evolved into a mix of White Christian identity nationalist group combined w/ QAnon followers believing in a global conspiracy via Coronavirus to take over national sovereignty

1324819422951792640 2020-11-07 05:02:19 +0800 <fncischen> @frankshi3d ill ping you up post COVID when things are safer and we can hang out whenever one of us are in town
1324819237274177541 2020-11-07 05:01:34 +0800 <fncischen> @frankshi3d yeah bay area (and some parts of LA), being asian is like normal. foreigner vibe will creep up to you if you go to like arizona or ohio or lol
1324818718321373184 2020-11-07 04:59:31 +0800 <fncischen> @frankshi3d lol... hang out with me, I read Chinese culture stuff for fun and binge-watch Mongols of Douyin with no end hahahahahah
1324817869478141953 2020-11-07 04:56:08 +0800 <fncischen> @frankshi3d for me, there's certain cultural amenities that are better in Asia (giant multi-story bookstores, late-night coffee shops, high level of public safety, and good installation art scene) that are worth the tradeoff
1324816989970292737 2020-11-07 04:52:38 +0800 <fncischen> @frankshi3d i've kind of accepted that reality. if you can find comfort in your self regardless of country and place - and find a way to make it work, the cultural differences will be less of a hassle
1324812413720387584 2020-11-07 04:34:27 +0800 <fncischen> @frankshi3d I feel welcome in the SF Bay Area for sure.   Asia will always feel different as Asian-American.... there are a lot of cultural norms that I did not grow up w/,  but at the same time, center of economic &amp; cultural gravity will be in Asia, as US goes through restructuring
1324810997039685633 2020-11-07 04:28:50 +0800 <fncischen> @frankshi3d i feel the same - my family came here in the 1980s  imo there's more interesting B2C opportunities in Asia today, compared to US

1324778882185138176 2020-11-07 02:21:13 +0800 <fncischen> @MarlonCreative @StewartalsopIII yes; once Facebook / Twitter they're officially classified as media publishers, then the government can have more jurisdiction to regulate free speech liability.   being pure tech = they self police
1324778294911250432 2020-11-07 02:18:53 +0800 <fncischen> @MarlonCreative @StewartalsopIII by that legal precedent, yes.   there's also the precedent that social media companies don't consider themselves "media companies", but pure tech companies, which doesn't subject them to freedom of speech liabilities that regular media publishers are required to face
1324771945691316224 2020-11-07 01:53:39 +0800 <fncischen> @StewartalsopIII @MarlonCreative Which is why tech companies are in this weird gray area of enforcing media guidelines
1324771742154252288 2020-11-07 01:52:51 +0800 <fncischen> @StewartalsopIII @MarlonCreative Yeah, it's the people that get inspired to pursue violence from his messaging, and affect public safety. To be honest that should be under the jurisdiction of law enforcement, but law enforcement doesn't usually play the role of "community manager" on Internet

1324647843303354368 2020-11-06 17:40:31 +0800 <fncischen> its been difficult to make sense of many of the parallel realities that exist in the US.   too many economic &amp; social problems that grew for the past several decades have finally imploded  we can't compete in 21st century if we aren't healthy (from all aspects).

1324503274309836800 2020-11-06 08:06:03 +0800 <fncischen> @_tlr_ lol why they have staff and formalized live stream talent agencies to do all the "community management" work

1324495642161344512 2020-11-06 07:35:43 +0800 <fncischen> shared vocabulary meaning having more tangible and measured goalposts for a nascent medium
1324494059369476096 2020-11-06 07:29:26 +0800 <fncischen> formalized career trajectories for creative coders (or art/code hybrids) are important since it makes mentorship and professional development much easier by having a shared vocabulary for production pipelines. so far, this crowd is very DIY and R&amp;D esque - so it'll take time
1324493619324018688 2020-11-06 07:27:41 +0800 <fncischen> one thing to add: lots of cool opportunities like immersive retail, virtual production / avatars will have far more formalized career trajectories in 3-5+ years once the tech is ready.... so the creative coders who have strong VFX chops will rise then   https://t.co/Zue5woV2Ab
1324492145391099905 2020-11-06 07:21:49 +0800 <fncischen> nobody really told me this btw haha. took me 2-3 years to get to this point but it all makes sense
1324491604707602433 2020-11-06 07:19:41 +0800 <fncischen> if you see creative coding as a daily ritual of going to a physical library as a long-term study how paintbrushes work , this craft will be rewarding    https://t.co/GtxBtoRurE
1324490680215875584 2020-11-06 07:16:00 +0800 <fncischen> think what scares ppl away is that programming can be seen as a very specialized "detailed widget-master via API library expert to solve a client problem", so its a daily ritual to make sure yourself always chasing the big picture vision while celebrating the incremental rewards
1324489086799802369 2020-11-06 07:09:40 +0800 <fncischen> @MarlonCreative @VoxelKei @z_zabaglione cant wait to read about this more
1324488588415787008 2020-11-06 07:07:41 +0800 <fncischen> @amoration @YiyingLu Theres a great @Goldthread2 video on this explaination somewhere lol
1324488296412532736 2020-11-06 07:06:32 +0800 <fncischen> creative coding in VR/AR also unlocks R&amp;D problem areas that tackles white-collar office worker productivity problems with sedentary life - a lot of these topics are worth exploring since they amplify worker productivity
1324487598992076800 2020-11-06 07:03:46 +0800 <fncischen> i believe if creative coding were more integrated into programming curriculums, plus a more formalized career trajectories, you'd see more interest in programming (i.e. working on a fluid gesture interface for AR fashion fabric designer, is more frontier, versus a SaaS app)
1324485628415766528 2020-11-06 06:55:56 +0800 <fncischen> unfortunately very hard to find places that teach this well, outside of places like MIT Media Lab or NYU ITP... i didn't take those routes, so I had to DIY my way to that world, but creative community is way more open to non-traditional backgrounds, so its all good lol
1324484790469324801 2020-11-06 06:52:36 +0800 <fncischen> however, living standards must rise for both urban and rural workforce... and right now in the US that's not the case, and it's very much a political problem that needs to be addressed ASAP in order for the rural workforce to participate in the creator economy
1324484333923569664 2020-11-06 06:50:47 +0800 <fncischen> media as the next iteration of the future of work will be reality, once AI has automated many of the high cognitive load forms of professional white collar work -   living standards will have risen and people will demand play as a critical part of life
1324483926539325444 2020-11-06 06:49:10 +0800 <fncischen> guess why I gravitated more toward art and creative coding versus other professions - cultural trends have more emotional resonance on consumer trends - and those dictate identity politics far more than anything else since they're life experiences
1324483491283656704 2020-11-06 06:47:26 +0800 <fncischen> one of my favorite activities is breaking apart a Graphics, Animation, Physics, Sound API, and all the cool methods, since it's like taking apart a paintbrush, and figuring out how it works

1324283234394406913 2020-11-05 17:31:41 +0800 <fncischen> human progress is a spiritual practice, which require understanding many of our character flaws which we've adopted at childhood, where we make daily practice to remedy and fix via strong solitude and resilience
1324282833758642177 2020-11-05 17:30:06 +0800 <fncischen> Literature is a vehicle that allows us to make sense of the complex realities of adulthood; books help us make sense of the complex realities of interpersonal relationships, by giving us a nuanced vocabulary of the why and how of humans, such that we can achieve human progress

1324276407954935808 2020-11-05 17:04:34 +0800 <fncischen> @Alien_Visitor_2 strong male leadership are leaders like Bob Iger, Mark Benioff, Jeff Weiner; business leaders with strong emotional intelligence  Trump is a hell to the no on that
1324275957130145792 2020-11-05 17:02:46 +0800 <fncischen> @Alien_Visitor_2 right away, I'll admit that there is a masculinity crisis in the US, and Trump conveniently entered politics at the right time/place.  problem is, he's so toxic and has so many character defects that people are willing to tolerate
1324274983716073472 2020-11-05 16:58:54 +0800 <fncischen> @Alien_Visitor_2 yes this is the problem.   i think if those issues were resolved earlier, voters wouldn't have to choose extreme candidates via Trump. Trump voters find him to be a good example of "strong masculinity", but he's very abrasive and has caused more toxic damage to US society
1324273774158438400 2020-11-05 16:54:06 +0800 <fncischen> @Alien_Visitor_2 Yep; for me, I'm okay with political differences (I used to work in government); but if those differences mean ignoring public health regulations for the sake of "economic freedom" I'm out

1324258912875413505 2020-11-05 15:55:03 +0800 <fncischen> @lillianmli hahahahaha, yes.....  there's a great quote on Quora that defines Chinese socialism, as building the infrastructure that allows the ability to maximize their wealth potential  that definitely stuck with me for a long time
1324256515985797120 2020-11-05 15:45:31 +0800 <fncischen> art that creates a dialogue that allows audiences to discuss or challenge uncomfortable truths about society (or to make it better) are what will resonate deeply long term in society

1324254205603840000 2020-11-05 15:36:20 +0800 <fncischen> @kateparsonstv yeah this topic is super relevant, moreso than ever
1324252327818129409 2020-11-05 15:28:53 +0800 <fncischen> @Alien_Visitor_2 i think whats happening is that Trump's era are revealing a lot of very uncomfortable truths about human nature and the underbelly of US culture that have blew up these 5-10+ years, and we don't have a vocabulary of how to address them
1324251210250006528 2020-11-05 15:24:26 +0800 <fncischen> @Alien_Visitor_2 i had a very thick skin where I managed to spend time in both political circles (to understand POVs), until the COVID-19 pandemic really blew up and QAnon imploded like crazy.   now those differences are too irreconcilable even for me, and I'm a type B person
1324248647458910208 2020-11-05 15:14:15 +0800 <fncischen> @Alien_Visitor_2 @JiayangFan if you spend enough time with both crowds, you'll understand their reality more
1324248137708417025 2020-11-05 15:12:14 +0800 <fncischen> i don't see political compromise being a reality for at least 3-5+ years. US will need to implode itself first before it has the mental energy to come back to the table   the demographic shifts and the changing American workforce mean there are different realities in the US.
1324245759412240384 2020-11-05 15:02:46 +0800 <fncischen> to me, the current political climate in the US makes it not a stable place to do business - especially if civil unrest takes place. i myself have already explored overseas contingency plans, and wow, it seems more likely that this will happen
1324244304290746370 2020-11-05 14:57:00 +0800 <fncischen> three months ago, i had already predicted the election would be too close too call.   it was very clear to me that the pandemic did not change a lot of people's minds, but rather emboldened voters stances on views like economy, national sovereignty, etc.
1324241982164660225 2020-11-05 14:47:46 +0800 <fncischen> the parallel media narratives that dictate economic mobility and political life are what have led up to this polarity in today's politics and super tight election

1324153874484097024 2020-11-05 08:57:39 +0800 <fncischen> @JiayangFan Yep can confirm these views exist
1324117195434070016 2020-11-05 06:31:54 +0800 <fncischen> @drgurner @TeaOwls YES! thank you..... i'm just amazed at how warped everything is in the news today. these parallel narratives are quite astounding to me
1324115974237245441 2020-11-05 06:27:03 +0800 <fncischen> @drgurner @TeaOwls Yes I agree. The Democrats really have to hone their narrative better, since there's a perception that "liberal coastal elites" are seen as out of touch with day to day life Rust Belt or Midwest voters
1324114800473862144 2020-11-05 06:22:23 +0800 <fncischen> @drgurner @TeaOwls It is a success story. I agree - but that jealousy or hate toward coastal elites is very strong.
1324113575321858048 2020-11-05 06:17:31 +0800 <fncischen> @TeaOwls There's real hate from Republicans toward the "coastal elite Elizabeth Warren voter that talks social justice while chomping $50 steaks" with that coastal smug grin. I don't think that gap will go away

1324091551576805376 2020-11-05 04:50:00 +0800 <fncischen> @kateparsonstv No problem. Virtual avatars are great for democratizing a medium I like (animation)! But can really push the medium forward w/ better storytelling
1324090024527196160 2020-11-05 04:43:56 +0800 <fncischen> Also the fast turnaround time for virtual avatar production is another reason why the genre is still very limited
1324089758314713088 2020-11-05 04:42:53 +0800 <fncischen> @XRandrew @SMTOWNGLOBAL I'd like to see the usage numbers; really curious
1324089632053633024 2020-11-05 04:42:23 +0800 <fncischen> Virtual avatar storylines feel very limited. The type of talent who likes working on long-form animation will likely gravitate towards a Disney, Netflix, or DreamWorks, versus an ad agency, which is why the storylines feel very constrained
1324088894506164224 2020-11-05 04:39:27 +0800 <fncischen> Much needed critique of the nascent virtual avatar genre. Will agree that some of the characters feel too robotic   https://t.co/FnRFW9SGPE

They forget that there are stable societies in Western Europe that aren't at the brink of collapsing like the US, and get stuck in that "rugged individualism" cycle
1323877448967073792 2020-11-04 14:39:14 +0800 <fncischen> @splashmango @CeliaHodent @JamesBergCanada I spent some time watching 40+ MAGA caravan videos on TikTok and can confirm that they see Trump as a force to fight socialism and protect American sovereignty.

1323694619389956096 2020-11-04 02:32:44 +0800 <fncischen> anyhow it's so weird to live in a country like the US with such strange disparities in voting, but those little things have massive repercussions, especially at states with tight margins
1323694374983643137 2020-11-04 02:31:46 +0800 <fncischen> California has very lax voter ID laws - you just need to have the right signature and you're done. In Texas, they're very strict on the voter ID laws - must have drivers license, personal ID, etc.    https://t.co/dXq1switoX
1323693834761502721 2020-11-04 02:29:37 +0800 <fncischen> also if I had lived in the State of Texas, I wouldn't be eligible for mail in ballot since I don't meet the criteria (65 years or older, have an illness/disabled, out of country, etc.)    https://t.co/qy1ZA8Vbbq  https://t.co/utl8IB9pHo
1323693480116301824 2020-11-04 02:28:13 +0800 <fncischen> One thing I am grateful for is the ability to walk 5 minutes to my nearest voter ballot drop box in California.

1323441243469148160 2020-11-03 09:45:55 +0800 <fncischen> for me, my interest is less in being an expert, but rather in terms of, "what can we learn that we can apply outside of their ecosystem, that can make our own digital economy better" -   it's an important distinction to make, and its a skillset that i'd like to practice
1323437819390357505 2020-11-03 09:32:19 +0800 <fncischen> there's a lot of literature of infrastructure development and Chinese industrial policy (really important stuff), but I'm less interested in that and more about Chinese pop culture via social e-commerce - which is more human
1323437461603643394 2020-11-03 09:30:53 +0800 <fncischen> it would be a daunting challenge, because much of my Mandarin Chinese is like Latin to me - can understand it at a professional level, but I don't speak it on a day to day basis, so there's a bit of rewiring my brain
1323437192140656640 2020-11-03 09:29:49 +0800 <fncischen> one of things I've wanted to do is to spend time learning about Chinese media subcultures via Douyin, and the business models that power those operations, and how that could be an indicator of where the US creative economy could go
1323436932924276737 2020-11-03 09:28:47 +0800 <fncischen> think my writing style has shifted from like personal development to like the long-form model "political economy of media, cultural institutions, and creative work"

1323425369664315392 2020-11-03 08:42:50 +0800 <fncischen> unlike the legal profession,   with programming, you can delegate instances of human error to your product manager or product marketer,  whereas in law, analyzing human nature and human error is part of the job
1323425009285566465 2020-11-03 08:41:24 +0800 <fncischen> Lawyers and programmers have very transferrable skillsets, since both jobs require reading &amp; analyzing large documentation, breaking apart large systems, and demonstrating why your arguments/algorithms is the most optimal solution  // cc: @dtseto

1323397233337794561 2020-11-03 06:51:02 +0800 <fncischen> thus, the study of 3D authoring tools in the 21st century in the creator economy, is like the study of 20th century public infrastructure (rail, subways, etc.)   what are the creative tools that massively improve human productivity and increase the competitiveness of a workforce?
1323396744374218752 2020-11-03 06:49:06 +0800 <fncischen> unlike manufactured goods such as automobiles, ships/airplanes, or pharmaceuticals -   the creator economy relies on cultural goods/services as a main export, and thus participation in this workforce requires the cost of 3D authoring to go down significantly
1323395728207589376 2020-11-03 06:45:03 +0800 <fncischen> in creative ecosystems, case studies to study is to study how key creators &amp; inventors act as amplifiers in creating jobs, adding GDP, or massively improving human productivity such that there is seamless cross-border commerce
1323393272371245057 2020-11-03 06:35:18 +0800 <fncischen> however, geographic agnosticism falters if you consider that 3D production tools / authoring tools are expensive to make, and require proximity / geographic clustering to key economic tech hubs
1323393138430365696 2020-11-03 06:34:46 +0800 <fncischen> one of the most interesting things about the creator economy / passion economy is that it is very geography agnostic.   As long as you have 3D production tools, access to rapid prototyping / manufacturing, and social media marketing - the sky is the limit
1323392656530006017 2020-11-03 06:32:51 +0800 <fncischen> in economic development, you're taught to see the world in terms of cultivating a highly skilled workforce, creating a pipeline for talent to enter industries &amp; start businesses, and building an infrastructure to nurture economic resilience
1323392225770786816 2020-11-03 06:31:08 +0800 <fncischen> I realize I really enjoy writing about the future of work, industrial policy, and media infrastructure in regards to 3D/2D authoring tools  - going to really branch out more into long form writing as I try to make sense of these emerging patterns

1322277174351548416 2020-10-31 04:40:19 +0800 <fncischen> In a leader, its more important to observe character, look at what they do outside of work, and what they read in their free time - it reveals much about their personality, and whether the team will be successful. This is far more important than skill-set
1322276578953289728 2020-10-31 04:37:57 +0800 <fncischen> However, to reach this point is very hard, because emotional vulnerability can be perceived as a sign of weakness (and to be taken advantaged of) - it really takes a very awakened leader (very rare) to be able to get pass these cognitive biases
1322276139859992577 2020-10-31 04:36:13 +0800 <fncischen> Good leadership is building a strong foundation for your team to take ownership of "light at the end of the tunnel" opportunities, combined with building an environment where there is a smooth feedback loop between emotional vulnerability &amp; professional development.

1322064219617914880 2020-10-30 14:34:07 +0800 <fncischen> A lot of good R&amp;D for future technologies can create "future or frontier" jobs that may not exist now, but will make up the future workforce, due to massive levels of productivity - but commercialization is always always the challenge
1322062846432215041 2020-10-30 14:28:39 +0800 <fncischen> @NicolasDVillar1 this definitely is reflected in US business culture -  a very short-term profit culture can make it difficult to invest R&amp;D into researching technologies or ideas, that can amplify long-term benefits for its workforce in the long run

1321267539146543104 2020-10-28 09:48:23 +0800 <fncischen> National level trade relations are very important still to this day - I love the idea of a Shopify - TikTok cross-border social e-commerce workforce, but they only represent a small % of the workforce, and we need strong political institutions that can leverage this as a whole
1321266704400302080 2020-10-28 09:45:04 +0800 <fncischen> I learned this when I was doing economic development in the US-Mexico borderland (though I wasn't doing foreign trade) - this lesson still sticks with me even today, as populism is on the rise.
1321266277214609414 2020-10-28 09:43:23 +0800 <fncischen> The value of learning foreign languages, comes from understanding the cultural nuances that influence how ideas are communicated,   such that when cross-border trade opportunities arrive, you can leverage those nuances to find win-win trade deals that build economic resilience

1321245644053381120 2020-10-28 08:21:23 +0800 <fncischen> @mattsheehan88 It reminds me of the Regan days in 1970s California, when there were anti Vietnam War protests at UC Berkeley, but Ronald Regan channeled the "lawless urban youth" vibes to suburban voters - but with a 2020 twist.
1321245119740219393 2020-10-28 08:19:18 +0800 <fncischen> @mattsheehan88 Fox News really got the "Law and Order" tone haha.   No wonder the people I know who watch Fox News channel the "I'm afraid of crazy protestors entering my suburbs" vibe
1321244398064025601 2020-10-28 08:16:26 +0800 <fncischen> Remote work can be a powerful vehicle that redistributes social infrastructure across geography, allowing for cultures to be distributed across the globe - this will lead to new hybrid digital/physical subcultures that will change the identities for the cities to come
1321242897006510081 2020-10-28 08:10:28 +0800 <fncischen> Without a strong social infrastructure, your workforce will be constrained to a paycheck paradigm, and there will be limited intrinsic motivation outside of resource extraction &amp; fending for oneself, and it'll be challenging to create a high innovation economy
1321241132504739840 2020-10-28 08:03:28 +0800 <fncischen> @jchangsta The YouTubers that did FIRE in their 30s and came out of early retirement to go back to work will agree with you lol
1321238649036402694 2020-10-28 07:53:36 +0800 <fncischen> Social infrastructure is the soul and lifeblood of a city's economic ecosystem - without strong social infrastructure, your talent will always seek to leave because there's no incentive to invest in the community or give back.
1321238223050297345 2020-10-28 07:51:54 +0800 <fncischen> Social infrastructure where there's always "light at the end of the tunnel" via strong makerspaces, immersive retail, cafes with high emphasis on public life -   will give your workforce strength and initiative to create resilient businesses that will increase economic resiliency

1321114309343072256 2020-10-27 23:39:31 +0800 <fncischen> If you look at history, a lot of fiction writers reach the peak of their creativity during the eras of social upheaval and unrest

1320821772434878465 2020-10-27 04:17:04 +0800 <fncischen> If you think about it, California's municipal property tax model is essentially depending on Boomer landlords to fund city services, rather than exploring how to increase the individual wealth of middle class Californians, to increase sales tax transactions to fund city services

1320771959160934400 2020-10-27 00:59:08 +0800 <fncischen> @JoseGameWriter yeah and the law enforcement feels way more balanced in Spain.   It's kind of crazy how we have campaigns slogans like "law and order" president in the US, &amp; you have folks buying guns to defend property.  US media bubble normalizes that, whereas many countries don't
1320770643311259648 2020-10-27 00:53:54 +0800 <fncischen> @JoseGameWriter yeah also the nightlife feels safer in Spain - you have grandparents next to parents w/ kids in strollers near bars, children playing basketball late at midnight in the summer - there are more eyes on the street
1320769936289980417 2020-10-27 00:51:06 +0800 <fncischen> @JoseGameWriter yeah, I wasn't being specific in this case
1320768628875091972 2020-10-27 00:45:54 +0800 <fncischen> @JoseGameWriter I'll definitely need to think about this more - there are countries that have a far lower GDP per capita than the US, but have much better social infrastructure in many respects - which definitely makes me question a lot of what "infrastructure" really means
1320768052170952704 2020-10-27 00:43:36 +0800 <fncischen> @JoseGameWriter I think Spain has a very high level of social infrastructure. I get the vibes living there that, "Hey, if things mess up, you have family to get back on," and there's a much gentler cushion to bounce up from, where as in US it's very rough

1317530515075780608 2020-10-18 02:18:47 +0800 <fncischen> The "ecosystem paradigm" of incremental infill real estate development is a civic minded approach, that highly emphasizes brick and mortar development -   a high emphasis on placemaking, over hoarding real estate  https://t.co/V5pZ1quLU4
1317529639305138178 2020-10-18 02:15:19 +0800 <fncischen> Incremental infill real estate development is less of a "extractive" model of development,   and focusing on building strong neighborhoods at an ecosystem, one property, one street improvement, one park improvement at a time  https://t.co/ofTJZNZROp

1317525500877623296 2020-10-18 01:58:52 +0800 <fncischen> @minyoungleeis Yeah Chinese society is similar - quite a few Chinese international students are actually middle (or upper middle)  class, but their families had built up a lot of savings over time (amplified by One Child Policy)
1317524459712962560 2020-10-18 01:54:44 +0800 <fncischen> Many forms of large scale real estate development are "extractive" by nature - they cost $$$ in infrastructure, too car-oriented, and represent a large tax leakage out of the community (think strip mall developments):  https://t.co/blzxmSMjok

1317380112757579776 2020-10-17 16:21:09 +0800 <fncischen> What will probably be needed more are good case studies or video documentaries of how good political coordination between public and private  sector leads to economically competitive urban development   https://t.co/6pI7FaSYlV
1317378878055219205 2020-10-17 16:16:14 +0800 <fncischen> I guess why commercial real estate piqued my interest,  is that I'm a BIG believer of brick and mortar -   no matter how much VR/AR will replicate public life  You still need physical brick and mortar ground floor destinations for your friends and family to congregate
1317378163492618240 2020-10-17 16:13:24 +0800 <fncischen> The article above shows, local politics matter a ton. We just don't have a very good vocabulary for politicans to navigate placemaking in the US that leads to cohesive good urban development
1317376538942173185 2020-10-17 16:06:57 +0800 <fncischen> If any of you are familiar with SF Bay Area, I wrote a great answer on how strong city management and civic minded business leaders led to two different downtowns btwn Mountain View and Sunnyvale   https://t.co/rpyNmCv4eX
1317374967420350468 2020-10-17 16:00:42 +0800 <fncischen> Great urban design is very important, but it lacks the teeth that "civic" minded commercial real estate can bring to a neighborhood. For me, this level of public private partnership matters more than the aesthetic of a city
1317374080941584384 2020-10-17 15:57:11 +0800 <fncischen> A lot of this reflection really came out of the COVID crisis - especially since I've met tech ppl who wished there was more of a "public service" element to their profession.   There are solutions out there, but they require incredible coordination and good governance
1317373509748731910 2020-10-17 15:54:54 +0800 <fncischen> If I ever go back to city planning in my 40s, I'd focus more on commercial real estate or economic development, since you can shape the ground floor retail or future tenants or labor force of a neighborhood far more effectively - it's a topic for another day to discuss

1312283622850785280 2020-10-03 14:49:31 +0800 <fncischen> cross border e-commerce is the critical key of second or third tier nations to build economic resilience, especially if they may not have the same cultural hegemony of larger nations   and we must tread carefully on the debate of internet nationalism
1312282514757545987 2020-10-03 14:45:07 +0800 <fncischen> the big fear is when this happens, governments have to "scramble" to redirect national identity or face a huge correction on how consumers spend their local dollars    https://t.co/FFf3lpREzu
1312282122921504768 2020-10-03 14:43:33 +0800 <fncischen> To fight back against internet nationalism,   there needs to be heavy government investment into the digital modernization of work and commerce, such that strong emerging domestic brands can coexist with these new foreign brands
1312281835812970498 2020-10-03 14:42:25 +0800 <fncischen> The premise of internet nationalism is that there is a cohesive national identity that dictates domestic consumer spending   and by challenging this, foreign brands can enter the market and cause a leakage of spending dollars out of the country
1312281425392009216 2020-10-03 14:40:47 +0800 <fncischen> Cross border social e-commerce leverages the power of video   to build cross-border audiences that help create or expand new markets for businesses, previously not possible.  Internet nationalism is a form of primal fear, a fear of cultural identity threatened by others
1312280049714831360 2020-10-03 14:35:19 +0800 <fncischen> Cross border digital commerce is the key to preventing war.   When people can trade freely with high trust, there's a high sense of economic resilience since the Internet opens up new markets previously not possible.
1312279399954169857 2020-10-03 14:32:44 +0800 <fncischen> Internet nationalism is the biggest threat to creating a digitally integrated global workforce &amp; business climate,   where language and culture no longer is a barrier to conducting cross border commerce

1310767626356846592 2020-09-29 10:25:29 +0800 <fncischen> when i mean change, i mean that a lot of this has already been decided by genetics, parental upbringing, and how were socialized - so it's kind of our job to determine how to make the best of the cards we were given and maximize our full potential

I'm trying to recollect my own thoughts - I graduated university 7 yrs ago at the height of the SF tech app boom, and things have changed so much in 2020, where the hype has subsided a lot. Need some time to reflect
1310292588671324161 2020-09-28 02:57:51 +0800 <fncischen> It's strange to watch old YouTube tech videos of SF and Silicon Valley from 6 years ago, and see how much time has evolved or changed  - or how the characters have changed (or stayed consistent)

1309166707735437315 2020-09-25 00:24:00 +0800 <fncischen> aside from my mental anxiety due to COVID, be prepared to fight for the political and cultural institutions we want to see in the future, since we're seeing massive restructural change
1309164319792398339 2020-09-25 00:14:31 +0800 <fncischen> @Kasiality i'd say that we'd have to restructure these political institutions to account for those massive differences in GDP per capita, workforce, infrastructure &amp; public services.   b/c its clear that the old way isn't going to work
1309163609495416832 2020-09-25 00:11:42 +0800 <fncischen> @Kasiality i would agree about the USD being the reserve currency.   however, my only thing is that US federal governance doesn't address a lot of second or third tier city issues fast enough, which is why we have so much civil unrest
1309162729999982592 2020-09-25 00:08:12 +0800 <fncischen> I would say that in other words, in this Post COVID-19 US world,   a lot of our individual actions have more weight since our political institutions are turning more vulnerable,   so if this balkanization actually happens.... we'll all be rebuilding these new states from scratch
1309162188934914054 2020-09-25 00:06:03 +0800 <fncischen> Balkanization also is tricky for the US,   b/c each region has to establish its own AI industrial policy, infrastructure modernization policy, "passion economy" small business policy (yes I mean this lol)   highly dependent if their leadership can execute on these policies
1309160781066502163 2020-09-25 00:00:27 +0800 <fncischen> the only thing I would say is that this is highly dependent on the political leadership of these balkanized US states -   they can choose to be very nationalistic and Juche - via the TikTok route - in only supporting domestic industry - or be more open to cross-border trade
1309159969032462341 2020-09-24 23:57:14 +0800 <fncischen> having small nation states might make certain regions more nimble, such as:   the Midwest aggressively attracting foreign direct investment and setting up R&amp;D and workforce policy w/o going through Washington DC
1309158821844008960 2020-09-24 23:52:40 +0800 <fncischen> a lot of the problem with the US gov is that the large nation state isn't a efficient feedback loop for addressing issues like infrastructure or public services, b/c the polarity between states or cities are too great and thus you have gridlock
1309157786421309440 2020-09-24 23:48:33 +0800 <fncischen> If the US does break into a civil war &amp; balkanizes into separate nations,   each separate nation can form its own independent foreign trade, immigration, foreign direct investment, infrastructure and healthcare policy   which might make it more nimble than the current US gov

1306329259149942784 2020-09-17 04:29:00 +0800 <fncischen> @IsaacWangD5 i think the problem is the feedback mechanisms in the US aren't effective in things like infrastructure investment, or restructuring the workforce for 21st century jobs. South Korea, Singapore, PRC are actively making these steps, while US is stuck in domestic turmoil
1306328663101550592 2020-09-17 04:26:38 +0800 <fncischen> @IsaacWangD5 i also am afraid of a large % of the US workforce getting sucked into the QAnon / conspiracy theory wormhole, fighting the government and going anti-vaxxers for fear of "big government", rather than working w/ it. @dtseto
1306327888107503616 2020-09-17 04:23:33 +0800 <fncischen> @IsaacWangD5 the sad thing is that the US domestic news of its internal conflicts, will overshadow the news of what's happening in Asia. if the US doesn't get its act together, its workforce won't be able to compete against Asia and Africa in the 21st century

Optimize engagement, build trust, build better systems, increase sales, etc.   so the character part matters more and job title less

1305314230212521984 2020-09-14 09:15:38 +0800 <fncischen> At the end of the day,   I've been cautious about planning for 2021-2024 b/c it's becoming clear there will be a lot of unknown moving parts to take into account,   And at some point many of us will be involved in politics
1305313781174607872 2020-09-14 09:13:51 +0800 <fncischen> I really hope that doesn't happen, but it's becoming clear based on the lengthy conversations I've had with multiple friends these past few weeks that these political differences won't be resolved peacefully
1305313585812258816 2020-09-14 09:13:05 +0800 <fncischen> The systematic racism has to be addressed for sure -   but I think we're going into venture into unknown political territory where the US will have a very bifurcated political landscape filled with sectarian differences, similar to the Middle East
1305312990267228160 2020-09-14 09:10:43 +0800 <fncischen> It's quite overwhelming how many different diverging political narratives are emerging right now.

1304155273217466368 2020-09-11 04:30:21 +0800 <fncischen> that fire in 2020 is such a strong visual metaphor lol
1304138269463138306 2020-09-11 03:22:47 +0800 <fncischen> part of the trial and error process is finding an audience, retaining the audience, and monetizing products/services specific to that audience - which are three separate skill-sets

1304133045444775936 2020-09-11 03:02:02 +0800 <fncischen> the benefit of homebred DTC specialized manufacturing for rural economies   powered by a YouTube like media economy is they leverage highly specialized craftsmanship that many blue collar workers have, and there's less up-skilling needed -   it's now about marketing
1304132309260484608 2020-09-11 02:59:06 +0800 <fncischen> the limitation of a satellite office business attraction strategy is that there will always be a large percentage of profits going back to the home HQ   so you need a certain level of economic resilience that comes from homebred businesses, &amp; the homebred DTC model fits that well
1304131429106765825 2020-09-11 02:55:36 +0800 <fncischen> @carlosvalerioh and in China they're already doing this with rural influencers!  https://t.co/t3nnPnW0lu
1304131311980871680 2020-09-11 02:55:09 +0800 <fncischen> the strategy most cities do is usually attract a company like Amazon to create a satellite office for high paying tech jobs  in reality, in a TikTok social e-commerce world, a better strategy is to leverage media platforms to create homebred DTC businesses that are job amplifers
1304130557379375104 2020-09-11 02:52:09 +0800 <fncischen> @frankshi3d lol i actually want to have kids, but that's a separate story in of itself
1304130468707614720 2020-09-11 02:51:47 +0800 <fncischen> Especially in the DTC e-commerce world / audience first products,   a lot of rural governments don't think about - hey, why not create a YouTube channel to highlight a specialized craft, get 1m subscribers, and then generate jobs to support large scale manufacturing
1304130066356469760 2020-09-11 02:50:12 +0800 <fncischen> @frankshi3d yep we're delaying it to late 30s, 40s, etc.

1302517841350914049 2020-09-06 16:03:47 +0800 <fncischen> mental mind games are a very inefficient way to achieve your goals, so if you know there are ways to cut the fat, make that happen

1302306359367483392 2020-09-06 02:03:26 +0800 <fncischen> if you look at the sidewalk, its literally like about 15-20 feet wide. the street calming &amp; landscape and buffering is at least an additional 5 feet.  that's in addition to the parking in front of the Costco looking mall

It's definitely a tricky spot since you have to balance gamificiation vs the more "pragmatic" corporate blue collar worker
1301634297355407360 2020-09-04 05:32:54 +0800 <fncischen> @Blake_Jakely though what i've seen with enterprise AR is actually quite conservative, IMO.   mostly AR user interfaces and baked animations - my guess is it has to do w/ the team makeup or budget constraints  i've seen more risktaking on AR on some of the Snap Lens features

1301297751456530432 2020-09-03 07:15:35 +0800 <fncischen> guess what makes it easier for me to answer that question is that my body will get old at some point, so I don't like the sedentary nature of a lot of jobs, since they give a lot of back pain or eye strain.   too many health problems to make it not worth it lol
1301296560651644928 2020-09-03 07:10:51 +0800 <fncischen> I'd go 10000000000000000000000000000000x creator over platform guy any day of the week lol.

1301296150218121216 2020-09-03 07:09:13 +0800 <fncischen> @thatguyBG i chose creator lol. platform making requires more physical fatigue. my body can't tolerate that when im older lol

1301254778882719750 2020-09-03 04:24:50 +0800 <fncischen> @dtseto @IsaacWangD5 its so weird reading this, since I remember 5 years ago at work,   part of my job was to get data on "alcohol sales tax" revenue for nightlife, as a way to capture the happy hour crowd for future retailers  how irrelevant that skill-set is right now om the covid19 era lol
1301254429258080257 2020-09-03 04:23:26 +0800 <fncischen> @dtseto @IsaacWangD5 read that article 10x times yesterday man.   sucks so much that their retail businesses depends on the "daytime population" of office workers, and "nighttime population" of the happy hour crowd lol

1301220471166312449 2020-09-03 02:08:30 +0800 <fncischen> @andreeavr also, as one former VC told me in person,   most tech products are copies / iterations of previous products,   the difference is in the team, product experience, marketing etc.
1301220288227549186 2020-09-03 02:07:46 +0800 <fncischen> very good analogy
1301220120119840768 2020-09-03 02:07:06 +0800 <fncischen> @andreeavr yeah clarity of mind is very important haha.   you start to realize that those big problems you're debugging are just tiny problems of a very clunky system, and you could always use other software to solve the same societal / customer problem
1301218538049490950 2020-09-03 02:00:49 +0800 <fncischen> @andreeavr i think it benefited me massively to get that liberal arts 7+ years ago before going into tech, cuz it makes you more decisive on why you want to create something

1300930590967869440 2020-09-02 06:56:37 +0800 <fncischen> I think a lot of the "reset on life" was already needed sooner than later,  but COVID 19 is giving people a socially acceptable reason to reflect on their existing life / career trajectories, especially when so many things are broken
