If you are not, or live w/others, ask their permission. I live in an RCF w/11 others, plus rotating staff. I asked the supervisor of my home, she said yes. I had permission &amp; so I annointed.

I annointed the doors and frames (posts) of my home, as well as the door to my secret prayer room. We have done this as a family for years. I concur with you as to the protection.

1313248125902090241 2020-10-06 06:42:06 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports I suppose you have not read any of the documentation pertaining to the Flynn case. Documentation shows that Flynn was coerced to making a guilty plea. Exculpatory evidence was withheld by defense and prosecution. The DOJ got ahold of the evidence, and so dropped charges.

The former AG, prosecutors were all Liberal Progressive, formerly working in the Obama, Clinton, etc., administrations. They like lawfare, bending and twisting law to forward an agenda. They don't like Barr because he's actually enforcing established laws.

Just because you don't like those laws, or the process infringes on your Progressive agenda, is irrelevant. If you do not like those established laws, then either 1. Go into law; 2. Get elected to Legislate

If Hillary Clinton had won, and was able to fill judge seats Obama left open,  would you feel the same way about her appointing Left Liberal Progressive judges, who undoubtedly would legistlate from the bench, and not interpret via the Constitution?

Instead, he is taking on the Legislative, creating law.

If Hillary Clinton had won, and filled the various judge vacancies left behind by Obama with judges of the Progressive Liberal leanings, would you still have a problem? She wouldn't have pulled them from the Federalist Society, but from other DS org.
1313170236976304129 2020-10-06 01:32:36 +0800 <ElShaddai3171> @phuture101 @jsolomonReports And Trump's picks are their own single persons. There are other Federal judges and district judges that also legislate from the bench with Liberal based decisions. The 9th Circuit is replete with them, and Hawaii is a big one. The DC circuit and SDNY is quite Liberal, &amp; Sullivan.
