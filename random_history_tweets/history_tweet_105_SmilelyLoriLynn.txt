1326257075320729609 2020-11-11 04:15:02 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> Hi just so you understand the Election is NOT certified. Therefore there is NO transaction team or President elect. However, There is Your President who is Donald J Trump.
1326256519399284738 2020-11-11 04:12:49 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> Good! Now please order special session of GA legislature.  When Abrams came for you we stood Tall beside you. Do the right thing in a timely manor. Legal votes only. Punish the guilty of every election fraud instance found like @GovAbbott does.
1326255708648730630 2020-11-11 04:09:36 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> Keep Absentee ballots only. Then hold a new election for any state that did not report on election night requiring ID.  Then we can start healing which ever way it goes.

1325933729441779712 2020-11-10 06:50:10 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> @JoshuaWKuebler I can agree to that. All I know is something is very off with this election. I saw the numbers changing that night on TV. Also when Trump was up by crazy numbers, they just stop counting.. And then ballots drop from the sky and appear frm everywhere? Nope not buying it.

1324788133960044549 2020-11-07 02:57:59 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> @GOPLeader  This a bet you better not take. People are waking up in mass on the R and Indy side.
1324787875397935104 2020-11-07 02:56:57 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> @FoxNews  is dead to a lot of us. They died a year ago for me. Sadly I gave up @greggutfeld and @TuckerCarlson I do miss them but enough was enough for me long time ago. So happy other patriots are waking up.
1324787318394335232 2020-11-07 02:54:44 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> I bet not one state used it.

1324720155469979649 2020-11-06 22:27:51 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> 2022 too.
1324716194428014592 2020-11-06 22:12:07 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> @FloridaDude297 @ted06244154 Here's to hoping. For 5 years this BS has happened with no one being punished but Trump and his supporters.  So the media and corrupt judges will just make any proof go away.
1324715791313494017 2020-11-06 22:10:31 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> @ursuafan Sadly.. Yes
1324715407366856704 2020-11-06 22:08:59 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> @loves_kasmir I told my husband last night they will come for him now that they think they got away with the steal and anyone standing with Trump. And then this morning I see the special counsel article.
1324714669781798912 2020-11-06 22:06:03 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> Yep and in GA too...  I am so tired.
1324709497793818624 2020-11-06 21:45:30 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> We don't watch Fox and Friends anymore. Let me know when you will be on @newsmax
1324709166204755970 2020-11-06 21:44:11 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> Special Counsel opened an investigation on Trump using the White House on Election night?? This is not fake news.. WTF
1324696524652191749 2020-11-06 20:53:57 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> The media will tuck it away like they did everything else
1324696217822076933 2020-11-06 20:52:44 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> If you take too long it will be over. Speed is a must
1324696025156780039 2020-11-06 20:51:58 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> I think the massive R turn out and the amount of Black and Latino votes caught them off guard. That is why the fraud is standing out. They didn't count in that!
1324691903791747075 2020-11-06 20:35:36 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> @PamBondi

1324067041167450116 2020-11-05 03:12:37 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> Wisconsin has more votes than people who are registered to vote.
1324066859814105089 2020-11-05 03:11:54 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> That is what needs to happen. Nullify the election and do it right this time! Voter roles clean and, No mail in. Absentee or in person only with ID!!!!!!!!!!!
1324066582780354560 2020-11-05 03:10:47 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> We will see. In 2018 many seats were stolen with this very tactic and it was let go and for years the fraud issue was known and yet here we are again.
1324066162825678849 2020-11-05 03:09:07 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> EVERY damn State and let the chips fall. I am sick of this. We are NOT a Banana Republic and we are not under China Joe rule just yet.
1324064931008909313 2020-11-05 03:04:14 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> VA gave 100,000 votes to Biden by error.. Audit every damn state now.
1324064227762540548 2020-11-05 03:01:26 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> Nope
1324063993405779979 2020-11-05 03:00:30 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> Investigate every single state.
1324062919676596224 2020-11-05 02:56:14 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> Just like everything damaging to the Left.. Poof they make it disappear
1324062664159625216 2020-11-05 02:55:13 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> Every damn state. We need to declare this election crap and have a do over with in person, Absentee ballots ONLY
1324062181902745605 2020-11-05 02:53:18 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> Hit me up I have them in my garage.. Where do I take them?
1324050587021959169 2020-11-05 02:07:14 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> @intheMatrixxx Every swing state including CA and NY need a recount NOW

1324048860793180167 2020-11-05 02:00:22 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> @CritterBitz Yep. I know what is on the other side of the curtain.  That's why I must not give up. I will take today to lick my wounds and then try and get back up tomorrow I guess.  Lord give me strength.
1324046799083065344 2020-11-05 01:52:11 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> @cjtruth @MaryKayGregory2 I am about done fighting. What is the point anymore? Really feeling defeated today. Which is what they want but.. 5 years of battling almost every day.. @GenFlynn is still being held hostage and now the same judge is over seeing the post office/election to a big degree.. TIRED
1324045962629828609 2020-11-05 01:48:51 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> Funny how almost every Blue state called for Biden showed zero vote counts to us... The African American rate was 18% Hispanic 45%.. But we lost more states in 2020 than we did in 2016.. DOES NOT ADD UP!!!!!!!!! @potus What am I missing and where the hell is BARR?
1324045246217543684 2020-11-05 01:46:00 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> @VCRPartners @NickAdamsinUSA @BP99498844 I dn't either. 2016 we made our choice clear and then had 4 years of BS because the gvrnmnt didn't like the peoples pick. So in 2020 we did it again. Now they REALLY do not approve because they can't control our pick and are openly stealing yet another 4 years from We The People
1324031741393276932 2020-11-05 00:52:21 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> Supreme Court NOW
1324022106531766273 2020-11-05 00:14:03 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> But we lost all these states? BS. Notice they called many, many states with out disclosing one counted vote. How does that even work?
1324021024464216071 2020-11-05 00:09:46 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> Also 100,000 votes in another state was recalled from Biden and should go to Trump.. This is 100% fuckery!
1324018675184246789 2020-11-05 00:00:25 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> Such complete bullshit. A full audit of PA needs to be done NOW
1324017665552404481 2020-11-04 23:56:25 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> why do you think they stopped counting.
1324017524808273921 2020-11-04 23:55:51 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> Yeah, we are up around 700,000.. No voter fraud can fix that. A recount of any state not called last night needs to happen.
1324016309844279297 2020-11-04 23:51:01 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> @BlackFlagArmy10 From what I saw last night.. It looked like plus 1 seat in Senate but no Idea on house.

1323970260828114945 2020-11-04 20:48:03 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> How many states were called with out us seeing a single vote count last night?

1323967375461523462 2020-11-04 20:36:35 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> They did this in FL in 2018. We almost got Gillum. A recount is needed. Also, voting laws need to be the same in EVERY state if it is a Federal election. Mail in voting needs to stop. Vote on Nov 3rd or request a absentee ballot. Voter ID.  Simple fix.

1322306039673487365 2020-10-31 06:35:01 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> My neighbor who already voted Biden.. I  showed her the @nypost article, Tucker clips and G news yesterday. Tonight when I was fixing my Trump banners on my palm trees, she came to help. Her husband still not convinced but they said might remove the Biden sign from their yard!!!

1322273537583915008 2020-10-31 04:25:52 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> If @POTUS wins the Dems would be  smart to leave the election results alone. The voter fraud uncovered will be so massive it will force new voting laws! Not in their favor either.
1322273133211099139 2020-10-31 04:24:16 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> If @potus goes then I go. Only reason I am here.

I grew up in a very abusive home so don't @ me. I am not poking fun. It is heartbreaking to see this on a national level.
1313619291233808387 2020-10-07 07:16:59 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> If your voters actually read your BS bills they would know why. Take your pork and shove it liar
1313617322050027520 2020-10-07 07:09:10 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> @DBarkhuff Yes we saw all the tic toc videos. We also now know that this Plandemic has a 99% survival rate. We also know that greedy and corrupt Dr's and hospitals coded those 200, 000 deaths incorrectly to get $. The Governors are responsible. So yell at the right people.

1312824958951796736 2020-10-05 02:40:35 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> @RobbersonJon Can you believe my best friend since 2nd grade was abused by her brother for yrs. Until about 10years ago we never knew of each other's abuse. I applaud anyone who speaks up. It is not an easy thing to do. Thank you for helping the broken. We need more people like you.
1312824076604497921 2020-10-05 02:37:05 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> @RobbersonJon I had a very good therapist when I was 16. He told me I had the power!  I had to make a choice.. chose to become the victor or continue to be the Victim.  I chose victor. I even started a group called Teens who Care. We volunteered at Battered Woman shelters.
1312821572256890891 2020-10-05 02:27:08 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> @RobbersonJon Thank you. I don't speak out much. It was a family member and some of his buddies. Off and on until I finally fought back around 13. My mom admitted she failed to protect me when she passed 2 years ago. That is helping me more than anything has my entire life.
1312820249075560448 2020-10-05 02:21:53 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> @RobbersonJon Thank you. The dirty feeling remains no matter how hot the water or how hard you scrub. From 8 until now 40 years later. You go on but it's like an app on your phone always running in the background.

1309890225536200704 2020-09-27 00:19:01 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> No. You Dems have been screaming and clawing at the sky to rewrite our Constitution. Filling the seat keeps you one step further from your goal. You also know if Trump gets a 2nd term he has another shot of 1-2 more picks.  You animals would have already had it filled by now.
1309889234388561921 2020-09-27 00:15:04 +0800 <SmilelyLoriLynn> @adamhousley. So with all the info coming out I assume it's safe to say that Tarmac meeting wasn't about grand kids?
