1336827624052711426 2020-12-10 08:18:37 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @CoachJim4UM is unfortunately leaving Michigan for the NFL. Boosters and politics and stubbornness and cheaters got in the way. Michigan back to square 1 again. #GoBlue
1336409518004178951 2020-12-09 04:37:13 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @ESPNCFB 1917 lamos
1335742934524825602 2020-12-07 08:28:27 +0800 <MichiganNation2> I find it funny how everyone is like Jim Harbaugh isn't a good coach but then are like. "There are so many NFL teams interested in him." So dumb tbh. #GoBlue

1333819297005772801 2020-12-02 01:04:36 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @UMichFootball has too many boosters with opinions. They ruin everything good. Can we get rid of them? Maybe many of us can outdo some of them? We have the largest fan base in the world? #GoBlue
1333272591977619457 2020-11-30 12:52:11 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @JoeBiden should campaign for the democratic senators running to flip the senate in Georgia
1332020159192690688 2020-11-27 01:55:28 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @JoeBiden should listen to the left and liberals. We saw 4 years of extreme right with moderate conservatives doing nothing but enabling it. You betray us, then in 2024 there will be a republican president. We won't come out like this again.
1331444991512768513 2020-11-25 11:49:57 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @JoeBiden Ya better go after Trump and the corrupters

1331068805922107395 2020-11-24 10:55:08 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris a full audit should be done about what went wrong with our government. No stone unturned. By gones cant be by gones. If you let it sweep under the rug, then you have played a part in our dissemination. #PresidentElectJoe
1330556049636651009 2020-11-23 00:57:37 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @GSAEmily you won't be working for the government soon if you keep up like that. Get moving

1325300514695880705 2020-11-08 12:54:00 +0800 <MichiganNation2> If @realDonaldTrump tries to stay in politics. Put him in jail.
1325294954135105537 2020-11-08 12:31:54 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @CoachJim4UM can't hold a locker room because he hires stucks ups and old school hard heads like Don Brown. Taller isn't better. #GoBlue
1325293669931487232 2020-11-08 12:26:48 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @kayleighmcenany @JoeBiden I would be looking for books to read in prison if I were you

1325278498995441667 2020-11-08 11:26:31 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @MDPgoblue Yeah right. Doubtful, you don't understand all the bullsbit that comes with Michigan. The admin, boosters, the media, the fans, the politics, the lack of understanding and progress. Its a big weakness in Ann Arbor. And until the baby boomers aren't gone. It won't change
1325274972357615616 2020-11-08 11:12:30 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @brianschatz @KenGoBlue73 unless if we show out in Georgia, then we win

1325274670606802946 2020-11-08 11:11:18 +0800 <MichiganNation2> If any conservatives need a safe space let me know. We have redneck and hill billy rooms available for you to cry in.
1325273215007150080 2020-11-08 11:05:31 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @MDPgoblue So does he beat a cheating msu, psu, and osu team who get help from the B1G? Does he do it while dealing with the bs and academic standards of Michigan? Does he win 10+ games consistently? If not, then why change anything?
1324905092034797568 2020-11-07 10:42:44 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @realDonaldTrump @EveningEdit Im sure your advisors have already told you at that intervention

1324726088262627328 2020-11-06 22:51:26 +0800 <MichiganNation2> Stop the count everywhere right now. Just take the results as they are right now!  @realDonaldTrump
1324723685547233280 2020-11-06 22:41:53 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @inforthescore9 I think most do. Trump said to not do absentee. Georgia and Arizona and Nevada have Republicans. Same story there
1324721173020725248 2020-11-06 22:31:54 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @inforthescore9 Democrats voted early and by mail in large.

1324371325654360064 2020-11-05 23:21:44 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @MilFay21 Huh? Why won't he be sworn in.
1324356448021872640 2020-11-05 22:22:37 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @realDonaldTrump So you lose?
1324356066185039873 2020-11-05 22:21:06 +0800 <MichiganNation2> We need to win the 2 races in Georgia!!! And we need to look forward to 2022 to take back the senate. Its crucial.
1324218561879973888 2020-11-05 13:14:42 +0800 <MichiganNation2> I haven't seen a man with supporters so stupid as @realDonaldTrump

1323829564653637632 2020-11-04 11:28:58 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @FBI and @CIA need to do something. We can't have Trump again.!

1322019170905739264 2020-10-30 11:35:06 +0800 <MichiganNation2> Does anyone know if those mail in ballots that CNN is reporting are already received?
1322004285132054530 2020-10-30 10:35:57 +0800 <MichiganNation2> Do not mail in ballots!!! Early vote and vote on election day!!! #Vote #VoteEarly #Vote2020
1322003709707145216 2020-10-30 10:33:40 +0800 <MichiganNation2> Election day is about to he chaotic. More Republicans are gonna vote on election day. Meaning they will have large leads. However it will be because mail in ballots haven't been counted. Which will be largely democratic. #Elections2020 #VoteEarly #Vote

1310349330453274624 2020-09-28 06:43:20 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @realDonaldTrump homie how you spend 70k on hairstyling in one year and still have a comb cover? Second, teach me how to write off my estimated $200s in haircuts for 2020 please? #TrumpTaxReturns
1310345406048538625 2020-09-28 06:27:44 +0800 <MichiganNation2> Raise your hand and vote yes if you paid more than $1500 in federal taxes the past 10 years. #TrumpTaxReturns
1310339623302901774 2020-09-28 06:04:45 +0800 <MichiganNation2> Most of his debt is to Russian Banks. He has been bailed out so many times. No taxes paid, just ridiculous.
1310324716390043651 2020-09-28 05:05:31 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @ParkerChurchil1 lmao
1310308208184041480 2020-09-28 03:59:55 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @bluebyninety The corner getting beat is more of a concern tbh
1310307990361300992 2020-09-28 03:59:03 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @ParkerChurchil1 @CoachJim4UM @UMichFootball
1310307922908512256 2020-09-28 03:58:47 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @ParkerChurchil1 How did you get that?
1310222277544480769 2020-09-27 22:18:28 +0800 <MichiganNation2> Happens to white people too
1310023634107478016 2020-09-27 09:09:08 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @JoeBiden How bout u actually win first okay. Don't dona stupid Hillary
1309190150501605378 2020-09-25 01:57:10 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @aravosis Start shooting them
1309160512933048320 2020-09-24 23:59:23 +0800 <MichiganNation2> Time to start putting Chinese around the world in detention camps.
1308955415305244672 2020-09-24 10:24:24 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @MittRomney Don't give him a damn supreme court justice then you fool
1308954697886134273 2020-09-24 10:21:33 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @Saudi_Gazette @SaudiCMA_En @KSAmofaEN Saudi Arabia might want to start using the money it has to invest in schooling, futuristic buildings, and businesses for a new economy. Oil money won't be there for long. And travel capabilities are declining.
1308951016054890499 2020-09-24 10:06:56 +0800 <MichiganNation2> I hate saying it, but if you want for them to hear you. Boycott their businesses and arn yourself to protect yourself. Group together. That's the only way. #BlackLivesMatter #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor #Amerikkka #LouisvilleProtests #RIPBreonnaTaylor
1308908643522359296 2020-09-24 07:18:33 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @JoeBiden start having more rallies and start visiting more places.
1308472404268679169 2020-09-23 02:25:06 +0800 <MichiganNation2> Trump can't live forever cause no one can, we won't ever give up, people may die fighting for their rights, there may be a Civil war, but we will come back from this as long as we fight. Hopefully states separate from the U.S. when needed and pass their own version of Obamacare.
1308471702691741696 2020-09-23 02:22:18 +0800 <MichiganNation2> There are about to be some very trying times coming to the United States. We let our guards down. Guess its God's plan for the chaos we have caused around the world. #VoteReady #RBG #Covid_19
1308463686667907073 2020-09-23 01:50:27 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @MittRomney, you should advocate for no vote until a new president is installed. We need healtcare and our rights as Americans. We both know what Trump is about.
1308463308308189185 2020-09-23 01:48:57 +0800 <MichiganNation2> If you like your Healthcare, if you like for the option of abortions, if you like your right to vote, if you dont want other countries coming here to fight for us. I recommend you vote democratic up and down. Cause when the Supreme Court is packed. All that goes away. #VoteReady
1308131556192645121 2020-09-22 03:50:41 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @UMichFootball they seem to care more than us
1307751760329617409 2020-09-21 02:41:31 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @TravisAllen02 Yeah
1307751663290200066 2020-09-21 02:41:08 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @jsavantil I was about to go with thay but thought that wasnt enough hype
1307744018667843584 2020-09-21 02:10:45 +0800 <MichiganNation2> Let me one up you. Joe Milton has the legs and speed of Michael Vick and an arm like Mahomes. He is built like Ben Roethlisberger. He will break every single Michigan record ever and we will win every game by 20+ points. #GoBlue
1307730448228012035 2020-09-21 01:16:49 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @scheeltweets @bluebyninety @Qbjayy7 Hype it down pls
1307689979083026433 2020-09-20 22:36:01 +0800 <MichiganNation2> I say let the GOP nominate a judge. Will give us a reason to expand the courts and take back the court. #sundayvibes #RBG
1307501226024722432 2020-09-20 10:05:59 +0800 <MichiganNation2> I honestly hope they just start dieing off. They have ruined this country.
1306629462252019713 2020-09-18 00:21:54 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @NateLewis77 Yeah he's done, so is Nico, so is Dylan

1306260335721172998 2020-09-16 23:55:07 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @bluebyninety he already did
1306260280872140805 2020-09-16 23:54:54 +0800 <MichiganNation2> They need to quarantine for a certain number of days and be cleared by the cdc or health department
1306258031315808256 2020-09-16 23:45:58 +0800 <MichiganNation2> Congrats to @UMichFootball @umich @DrMarkSchlissel and @CoachJim4UM for getting it done and positioning ourselves to still be ready. #GoBlue
1305689248616665088 2020-09-15 10:05:50 +0800 <MichiganNation2> Oh hi 2020

1305663580491087872 2020-09-15 08:23:50 +0800 <MichiganNation2> As if 2020 couldn't get any worse.
1305540534442786816 2020-09-15 00:14:53 +0800 <MichiganNation2> I think @DrMarkSchlissel should be a leader and tell his take publicly. How he feels about playing and football. Be open and honest. #GoBlue
1305533816048680963 2020-09-14 23:48:12 +0800 <MichiganNation2> If there is no season and it is because of @DrMarkSchlissel. Coach Harbaugh leaves, players transfer, recruits decommit, we are set back years. And then Schlissel gets fired and sued. The university gets sued. Lets not be arrogant asses. #GoBlue

1304949758965043200 2020-09-13 09:07:21 +0800 <MichiganNation2> Has there ever been more Americans who have died under any other presidency than yours? @realDonaldTrump

1304218522147524610 2020-09-11 08:41:41 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @Johnubacon No, maybe the great @DrMarkSchlissel can make sense of it
1303888496386551808 2020-09-10 10:50:17 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @Johnubacon to think we went through years of Dave Brandon, Rich Rod, and Hoke. Only to have a guy named Schlissel come by and alienate our program. Its ridiculous. #GoBlue
1303548080596365312 2020-09-09 12:17:35 +0800 <MichiganNation2> @DrMarkSchlissel has made @UMich a laughing stock in the sports world. He has to be removed. #GoBlue
