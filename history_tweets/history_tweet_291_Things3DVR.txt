1313209862927646722 2020-10-06 04:10:04 +0800 <Things3DVR> "Wow, I was really surprised by this! definitely one of the best #quest experiences!" Brand new 5/5‚≠ê review for #DescentAlps ‚õ∑Ô∏è @SideQuestVR! | #VRgaming #skiing  |  https://t.co/pviuGsuS96
1312493894488084480 2020-10-04 04:45:04 +0800 <Things3DVR> Excitement. Adventure. A #Jedi DOES seek these things! #VR #VRgaming #StarWars @oculus |  https://t.co/vE9knREH1A
1312437642122805248 2020-10-04 01:01:32 +0800 <Things3DVR> For #TechiesDay we want to know what your #VRgaming rig has in it; #GPU recommendations, CPUs, cooling - what makes your #VR rig awesome?!
1312082543999676422 2020-10-03 01:30:30 +0800 <Things3DVR> For #ThunderbirdsDay we're thinking how double-awesome it'd be to have a #Thunderbirds #VR game for @oculus Quest! You can just imagine the barely-visible strings on the hand-tracking ü§£üöÄ  https://t.co/EOxd197ulU
1309775892479082496 2020-09-26 16:44:41 +0800 <Things3DVR> How amazing would this be in #VR? A room full of Rebels and/or Imperials, all in @Oculus Quest headsets, fighting in formation... the force would be seriously strong with that one! #VRGaming
1308492537980739584 2020-09-23 03:45:06 +0800 <Things3DVR> If you just pre-ordered a new #Xbox today (congrats if so!), would you like to see #AR or #VR games on the platform one day?
1308134045210021891 2020-09-22 04:00:34 +0800 <Things3DVR> Okay! So, #OculusQuest 2 is confirmed as having #WiFi6 - put simply, that means around a 40% speed increase, and significantly better performance on busy wifi networks. Lower latency for better connected and more #streaming #VR experiences! You'll need a new router, though...
1308024862728912896 2020-09-21 20:46:43 +0800 <Things3DVR> @snowblind Good call. Hand-me-down #VR would be a fantastic gateway for family/friends to get involved.
1307334907811835905 2020-09-19 23:05:05 +0800 <Things3DVR> We ran a poll earlier in the week, and it turns out that the #OculusQuest 2 is most popular with existing Quest users. So this headset looks like it's going to be driven by upgrades, as much as brand new #VRgamers.  https://t.co/Pu8zZy3wJA
1307007748849233920 2020-09-19 01:25:05 +0800 <Things3DVR> Getting that #FridayFeeling for some awesome FREE #VR games? Check these out!  https://t.co/Vg6K0Trvh0 #VRgaming  https://t.co/fHdGykeID4
1305920576578629632 2020-09-16 01:25:02 +0800 <Things3DVR> So far in our #OculusQuest 2 poll,  those who are most excited about the new #VR headset already own the first model. Still time to vote! #VRGaming  https://t.co/Ix6rJM5iEM
1305828371906129921 2020-09-15 19:18:39 +0800 <Things3DVR> @Wollan @JayHadHope I think you're right - new hardware to run better visuals seems like the driving force behind the Q2.
1305526568215773190 2020-09-14 23:19:24 +0800 <Things3DVR> New #OculusQuest! Which of these describes you as a #VR gamer? Do you have a #Quest, or are you waiting for the new model before jumping into #VRgaming?
1304993266035830785 2020-09-13 12:00:14 +0800 <Things3DVR> "It's very thrilling!" Loving the #OscarsMix #VR gameplay video of #DescentAlps, including the sweet 80s synth soundtrack and splash screen! Nice work dude!  https://t.co/P4usZxiedg  @sidequest

1304496214294097920 2020-09-12 03:05:08 +0800 <Things3DVR> "QubeFall reminds me a little of a the #AtariLynx game Blockout, which I played for hours as a kid."

1303401486240620544 2020-09-09 02:35:05 +0800 <Things3DVR> Was Geordie La Forge's visor technically an #AR headset? Or is it closer to #VR, since Geordie was only seeing a projection of the real world? If you could settle that for us on #StarTrekDay, @levarburton, that'd be great, thanks.  https://t.co/E3nxHgHisQ
