1337503343439204352 2020-12-12 05:03:41 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yes indeed. And we grew up around people who came to work/school sick. We are still walking around.
1337502990945693696 2020-12-12 05:02:17 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I didn’t think so.
1337502286042570752 2020-12-12 04:59:29 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Absolutely right.  Everyone is responsible for their childish, irrational fear and feelings. 😡
1337472170361036805 2020-12-12 02:59:49 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I saw that. Jeez.
1337470212304670721 2020-12-12 02:52:02 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I still call grumpy old women a cow!  😂😂
1337469929071767552 2020-12-12 02:50:54 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Insane bunch of people.
1337469688717205504 2020-12-12 02:49:57 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I guess. We are surrounded by communist.
1337469365084708867 2020-12-12 02:48:40 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yep. Stalin would be proud.
1337469070023790592 2020-12-12 02:47:29 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yep. Year of the boomerang.
1337452911161454594 2020-12-12 01:43:17 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yes indeed. We are already surrounded.
1337452632084893696 2020-12-12 01:42:10 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yes indeed. The Trump Middle East peace deals are certainly proof of division??
1337451402814218240 2020-12-12 01:37:17 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Time magazine says that they chose Biden/Harris because the forces of empathy are greater than the furies of division.  What. The. Hell?
1337447371383468033 2020-12-12 01:21:16 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Classic!  😂🤣
1337439048374374400 2020-12-12 00:48:12 +0800 <Iamahardhead> They call their cookies biscuits, too. They have a lot of funny terms. Love it.

1337416805510500353 2020-12-11 23:19:49 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Apparently, the dems don’t need jobs. They just steal what they need.

1337402114641960960 2020-12-11 22:21:26 +0800 <Iamahardhead> If Trump said, Let’s form the #MAGA party would you abandon the GOP and join?  Me, YES!
1337398011660537858 2020-12-11 22:05:08 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I didn’t know that they made them for dogs. Very practical. 👍

1337181120136441858 2020-12-11 07:43:17 +0800 <Iamahardhead> So, you’re saying that you wouldn’t know a free and fair election if it bit you on the ass. That’s shameful!
1337154765298544641 2020-12-11 05:58:33 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @GravesWilliams6 Are they making you pay for the tests? Just curious.

1336331697751638018 2020-12-08 23:27:59 +0800 <Iamahardhead> #Veto
1336331452405882890 2020-12-08 23:27:00 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Knowing what we know now, does anybody really believe that this dimwit was elected a second time? @AOC
1336330169171132417 2020-12-08 23:21:54 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I believe it is.
1336137935092068356 2020-12-08 10:38:02 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I know about 74m with the exact same experience.
1336122523466014721 2020-12-08 09:36:48 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yes!!
1336108054098612224 2020-12-08 08:39:18 +0800 <Iamahardhead> A Patriot?
1336107530393710596 2020-12-08 08:37:13 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @RobertM63211476 Indeed!
1336105092802600960 2020-12-08 08:27:32 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @RobertM63211476 Joe Dude gets all the credit. 🙏🙏
1336103822993870851 2020-12-08 08:22:29 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yep. And after that, Stacy Abrams will be crowned the Queen.
1336102995176673281 2020-12-08 08:19:12 +0800 <Iamahardhead> 😂🤣💯👍🇺🇸
1336080783157719046 2020-12-08 06:50:56 +0800 <Iamahardhead> All part of the plan.
1336080239554940928 2020-12-08 06:48:46 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @AChristianVet What?  I just typed it maybe 15 minutes ago?
1336078440097853440 2020-12-08 06:41:37 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Sounds about right.
1336073429393477633 2020-12-08 06:21:43 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I think you’re spot on. 💯 They have us backed into a corner and I believe we will have to shoot our way out.
1336071543139561475 2020-12-08 06:14:13 +0800 <Iamahardhead> That’s absolutely happening. To me for sure and everyone I have talked to about it.
1336070877914521600 2020-12-08 06:11:34 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Our Guv and his husband test positive for Covid last week. Last night the husband was admitted to the hospital for worsening symptoms.  Meanwhile, 4 restaurants get their liquor license pulled for defying lockdown orders.
1336056552667672576 2020-12-08 05:14:39 +0800 <Iamahardhead> That’s a fact, Jack!
1336056288825012225 2020-12-08 05:13:36 +0800 <Iamahardhead> As I said last week, there won’t be any unity from 75m of us Patriots.  For at least 4 years.  Js
1336054752338202625 2020-12-08 05:07:30 +0800 <Iamahardhead> They’re getting to bottom of it.
1336053820846174208 2020-12-08 05:03:48 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @buster_rip @Usatorz1 If you attempt a citizen arrest, be sure to take a social worker with you.
1336052134836641793 2020-12-08 04:57:06 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Usatorz1 Why? Are they due a cut?
1335977879381958660 2020-12-08 00:02:02 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @JoeBiden Thanks Joe.
1335967517827866625 2020-12-07 23:20:51 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Carolyn74947534 Commie bastards.  I hope I live to see the day when they regret what they have done.
1335966898199142402 2020-12-07 23:18:24 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Carolyn74947534 Done. 💯
1335966133552361478 2020-12-07 23:15:21 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Carolyn74947534 I can do that, but not many see me either. Sadly.
1335964447605739522 2020-12-07 23:08:39 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @thomasn61710689 Good. Got to get ready and get outta here soon. I am meeting my youngest kid to do some shopping.
1335964051181084673 2020-12-07 23:07:05 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @JanAChilton1 @eclipsethis2003 @YouTube Agreed. Very sad.
1335963853398667275 2020-12-07 23:06:18 +0800 <Iamahardhead> We never thought you were crazy. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
1335963570060881926 2020-12-07 23:05:10 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @thomasn61710689 Morning!  👍🇺🇸
1335962136347021313 2020-12-07 22:59:28 +0800 <Iamahardhead> If those cities are designated as sanctuary cities, I am against any bailout under any circumstances.
1335960383874605058 2020-12-07 22:52:31 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I know. That cat would’ve scratched his eyes out!
1335807282966384641 2020-12-07 12:44:09 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @thomasn61710689 Louisiana or Los Angeles?
1335807030255362049 2020-12-07 12:43:08 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @thomasn61710689 Los Angelis is big. Maybe an entire county is inside the city limits.
1335805533786402822 2020-12-07 12:37:11 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @thomasn61710689 True. Maybe just a rough choice of words.
1335803251611082756 2020-12-07 12:28:07 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Well, they’ll probably have a big problem with Act 2.
1335802200946315264 2020-12-07 12:23:57 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @DPembic @realDonaldTrump Joe doesn’t know squat.

1335722475485859842 2020-12-07 07:07:09 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @buster_rip @cassady_timothy @AdamSchiff Yeah
1335719811356221446 2020-12-07 06:56:34 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @DabiVoting @dananessel If you feel left out, maybe try being a part of the holidays instead of a victim.
1335719198274752513 2020-12-07 06:54:07 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @TheKatWill @dananessel Little white girl trying to be relevant. @TheKatWill    How do you know they were nervous?
1335715479747514371 2020-12-07 06:39:21 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @AdamSchiff Wrong. Election fraud is the real national embarrassment   #Trump2020
1335714067139469315 2020-12-07 06:33:44 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @buster_rip @AwakenedOutlaw Poor Seth. What a beautiful boy.
1335713693787693057 2020-12-07 06:32:15 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @buster_rip @MAGASHAMAN Yes we will!

1335682445165858819 2020-12-07 04:28:05 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @theblaze Don’t forget that the teacher’s unions have a huge role in keeping schools closed.
1335669567889289218 2020-12-07 03:36:55 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @ActorUSAPhoenix @ksorbs What exactly does one year of college do for these kids?
1335667471278354437 2020-12-07 03:28:35 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @DavidAlanCoia @JudieHall9 @nypost He absolutely could have. That would explain the comment about cause of death unclear.
1335666898135035904 2020-12-07 03:26:18 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @JohnTibbs65 He’s a military contractor. Retired Army bomb squad. I don’t think he had a choice.
1335666315005136896 2020-12-07 03:23:59 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @JudieHall9 @nypost I did think that sounded strange. But these days you just never know.
1335621653812957185 2020-12-07 00:26:31 +0800 <Iamahardhead> If Trump gets the Biden vote overturned, These worms will lose their minds. Either way, it’s coming.
1335612864787308552 2020-12-06 23:51:36 +0800 <Iamahardhead> My brother in law, who works in Saudi Arabia, got Covid vaccine last week that was made in China.  Now, he’s sick and being made to quarantine.  Waiting for the test results.
1335609444617613319 2020-12-06 23:38:00 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @buster_rip @laralogan No clue. Probably.
1335595100790022147 2020-12-06 22:41:00 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Notice that it’s a fair fight. In other words, Patriots do not swarm and stomp. 🇺🇸 Thanks for that.
1335593632800403457 2020-12-06 22:35:10 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @thomasn61710689 Much better after watching the rally last night.
1335588249071456256 2020-12-06 22:13:47 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Carry on then.  👍🇺🇸😎
1335587783923150848 2020-12-06 22:11:56 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @propilot123 @jakecoco @Julio_Rosas11 Movies?? Are. Not. Essential.
1335586568720048135 2020-12-06 22:07:06 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @thomasn61710689 Good morning Redneck!! How doing?
1335582734853558274 2020-12-06 21:51:52 +0800 <Iamahardhead> RSBN also showed the videos that Potus showed us at the GA rally. All of it.  Let’s show our appreciation for this great company.  True Patriots!!  🇺🇸❤️
1335579954617180162 2020-12-06 21:40:49 +0800 <Iamahardhead> That was great!  Purdue wanted them to stop while he spoke to Trump, but they wouldn’t. Loved it!
1335432392287379457 2020-12-06 11:54:28 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Best tweet of the day!
1335411582277398528 2020-12-06 10:31:46 +0800 <Iamahardhead> No way that man lost.  No fricking way.

1335407544999743488 2020-12-06 10:15:44 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @NeverTr23438327 @OrderChaosLife Sooo, my tweet was about the Dow. Hitting an all time high. That’s all. And, I didn’t give credit for that to Trump.  One last time. A record means it never happened before. Not during Obama. Not ever.
1335399653085499392 2020-12-06 09:44:22 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @NeverTr23438327 @OrderChaosLife Setting a record means it has Never reached that mark before. Ever. Do you not understand  English? Sweetie?
1335397228517748741 2020-12-06 09:34:44 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Welcome. I would act fast before YouTube takes it down.
1335396818709073921 2020-12-06 09:33:06 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Right!
1335396658155237376 2020-12-06 09:32:28 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I am watching it on Right Side Broadcast Network (RSBN) on YouTube. When it’s over, they will upload it.
1335395451642765312 2020-12-06 09:27:40 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Ohhh hell yes.  Potus just showed a video of the Trump supporters being attacked by antifa.
1335382586588327936 2020-12-06 08:36:33 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yes indeed. And he’s speaking facts.
1335381364196118528 2020-12-06 08:31:42 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @NeverTr23438327 @OrderChaosLife Sure it did.
1335379439207723010 2020-12-06 08:24:03 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Potus is all smiles and doesn’t look worried at all!
1335334674420412416 2020-12-06 05:26:10 +0800 <Iamahardhead> 👍💯🇺🇸🔥
1335320753600929797 2020-12-06 04:30:51 +0800 <Iamahardhead> It’s going to be interesting to see what Potus has to tell us tonight.
1335319725417574408 2020-12-06 04:26:46 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Not a fact!  The death rate has not increased this year over past years. That’s a fact.  Not in the US.  Not even worldwide.
1335301126955167744 2020-12-06 03:12:52 +0800 <Iamahardhead> 👍👍😂😂
1335283557523218433 2020-12-06 02:03:03 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Already happening here in Pitkin county, CO. Which is where Aspen is located. And many Hollywood fucks live. As of December 10 or 14, you have to show proof of a negative test results less than 72 hours old.  Or else quarantine for 3 days. Before you can ski. Outdoors.
1335280594822066188 2020-12-06 01:51:16 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Or it could be Dominion?
1335280318685847552 2020-12-06 01:50:10 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Good one!!  😂
1335278437813145603 2020-12-06 01:42:42 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yes. Non-partisan vote counters.
1335277982395600896 2020-12-06 01:40:53 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Well said.
1335277034172522498 2020-12-06 01:37:07 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I think they are. Especially in some areas.
1335261478081925120 2020-12-06 00:35:18 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Doesn’t make sense?
1335261146178351105 2020-12-06 00:33:59 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Agreed
1335260650105409536 2020-12-06 00:32:01 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I believe that.
1335260529317777410 2020-12-06 00:31:32 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Hope so!
1335259637608800261 2020-12-06 00:28:00 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yep. I heard they called it very early?
1335259376005881858 2020-12-06 00:26:57 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Absolutely. They’ve been cheating for years but their TDS got the best of them. 😂🔥🤣
1335258963298947072 2020-12-06 00:25:19 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I absolutely believe that.
1335258078233702405 2020-12-06 00:21:48 +0800 <Iamahardhead> A lot of rural areas are still red. I believe that about steamboat. Thanks.
1335257607595061248 2020-12-06 00:19:56 +0800 <Iamahardhead> And we were solid red for like 75 years prior to good ole mail in voting. Then, blue ever since. 😡😡
1335256947050868736 2020-12-06 00:17:18 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Sounds about right.
1335256423740170241 2020-12-06 00:15:13 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Jimmya16 Always and forever!  🥰
1335256179132538881 2020-12-06 00:14:15 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Agreed. I’d say we’re 50/50. Does that make us purple?
1335241890741055489 2020-12-05 23:17:29 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Hell yes. Dominion has an office here. And we’ve had mail in voting for 10 years, I think. Maybe 8.
1335234071253950466 2020-12-05 22:46:24 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Dems dominate all 3 levels of local government here in Colorado. This creates a power grab and allows the Guv to mainline EO’s that he keeps in place for months. This is not the way it’s supposed to work.
1335231770388815875 2020-12-05 22:37:16 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Governor (king) Polis.  Signs 300m Covid relief bill, but will not agree to give even 1% to farmers and ranchers which encompasses 45% of our state.
1335044966893178881 2020-12-05 10:14:58 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @LoneTurtle2 Actually, I am not so young. That’s a little lie. Sorry, I get carried away sometimes.
1335043592369352704 2020-12-05 10:09:30 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I am young and smart. Otherwise known as a smart-ass!  👍😂 Nice to meet you.
1335040534117830656 2020-12-05 09:57:21 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I like it!
1335038701219549184 2020-12-05 09:50:04 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Agreed. 💯
1335036330703728641 2020-12-05 09:40:39 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Don Imus was completely ruined by a comment that was almost identical.  The same thing needs to happen here. To Noah.
1335030969129197568 2020-12-05 09:19:21 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Dems have weaponized everything!
1335027663090618373 2020-12-05 09:06:13 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @JRockford_PFC 😏

1334516678034681857 2020-12-03 23:15:44 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @realDonaldTrump  I don’t understand why we can’t have a do over?  In the swing states only.  For the president only.  In person only.  Paper ballots only.  Counted by a human being.  Observed by a human.  It would be much easier.  And faster.

1334174004370960387 2020-12-03 00:34:05 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @brian_kentucky I get that.  My problem is that I still do.  GAF.  I don’t seem to fit in anywhere.
1334162034884284418 2020-12-02 23:46:31 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Denver legislators pass an increase in minimum wage to $14.77/hr.  Despite small business asking for a delay due to Covid.  The final nail in the coffin of small business. 😳
1334159252005548032 2020-12-02 23:35:27 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Any chance we could get a couple of these judges to hear the case on election fraud?
1334154430971777027 2020-12-02 23:16:18 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yes indeed.  If you really want to see some heads explode, ask some questions. About getting to the truth.

1333955531569057798 2020-12-02 10:05:57 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yes we will. It’s probably going to mean war because we don’t have a FBI/DOJ.
1333950195504189440 2020-12-02 09:44:44 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Absolutely right!

1333889718812094469 2020-12-02 05:44:26 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yes indeed
1333876887366545409 2020-12-02 04:53:26 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @FreakCountry76 I should have worded that tweet differently. Barr may not be...

1333872582924382215 2020-12-02 04:36:20 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Could be both...

1333868244126535683 2020-12-02 04:19:06 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Barr is not a swamp creature, but he is a coward.
1333859847247450113 2020-12-02 03:45:44 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Agreed. There’s some people who say you can’t catch the criminal before he’s committed the crime. Somewhere in the middle would be nice, though. And yes, Potus has no backup.
1333849117953585153 2020-12-02 03:03:06 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Defund Biden.  If he gets even close to winning.

1333542883526373379 2020-12-01 06:46:14 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yes indeed. There were many. Thanks.
1333542342578622465 2020-12-01 06:44:05 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I know. But this is enough for most people. 🙏
1333540628102336516 2020-12-01 06:37:16 +0800 <Iamahardhead> November 29-30, 1864 Sand Creek massacre.  Third Colorado Cavalry attacked a village of Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians. Killing and mutilating an estimated 500 mostly elderly, women and children. A very dark day in Colorado history.
1333506888487612431 2020-12-01 04:23:12 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Is it red?
1333506435649564674 2020-12-01 04:21:24 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @GenFlynn   on talk radio with @SebGorka  Says Americans need to accept that, in addition to foreign enemies, we also have domestic enemies.
1333487637819240448 2020-12-01 03:06:42 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Same team.
1333481997289861124 2020-12-01 02:44:17 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @EmeraldRobinson I would argue that the 2008 transfer/bailout was right up there. Another example of a corrupt government gone wild. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
1333480451298758661 2020-12-01 02:38:09 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Same

1333467267162660867 2020-12-01 01:45:45 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I guess it’s only blm riots if you’ve got to have a big gathering that can kill your family and ruin your city to get social justice?
1333463643665690626 2020-12-01 01:31:21 +0800 <Iamahardhead> You guys really need to get over the fact that @FoxNews  cheated on you with the enemy.
1333460863089577987 2020-12-01 01:20:18 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @JOHNNOB35752453 I think because there was no outrage when Roe vs Wade, or the separation of church and state was decided, they just kept digging in, until now it’s too late.
1333450434204274690 2020-12-01 00:38:52 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @rod21198 @CharlieVeitch Does it even matter?
1333448432200134660 2020-12-01 00:30:55 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Let’s be clear.  This is not about stealing the 2020 election.  This is about stealing our country.
1333429199277846528 2020-11-30 23:14:29 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Agreed. I thought it was interesting.
1333428486338453508 2020-11-30 23:11:39 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Communism 101.
1333425299170734081 2020-11-30 22:58:59 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @TayAndersonCO  Antifa activist and DPSchools employee tweets that his brother decided to have thanksgiving with a white woman. Instead of him. 😂🤣😂🤣 Later deleted.
1333423460056506368 2020-11-30 22:51:41 +0800 <Iamahardhead> The month of November has been it’s best in 33 years for the Dow.
1333421548393422850 2020-11-30 22:44:05 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Absolutely. We can work on cleaning things up later.
1333421169127645184 2020-11-30 22:42:35 +0800 <Iamahardhead> The local media is strangely quiet on reporting that the governor and his husband have Covid.  @KyleClark @9NEWS  Where is the outrage, like you had for Trump? Why won’t you do your job?
1333236347642007552 2020-11-30 10:28:10 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @DustyFueston Truckers are protesting a rigged election.

1333169503027519490 2020-11-30 06:02:33 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Sure. If it involves a public hanging.
1333160987168534529 2020-11-30 05:28:42 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @_paid2play @BlueSky_Report What??? Holy hell.  Terrible news.
1333152281429241857 2020-11-30 04:54:07 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Thank goodness for Trump. Before Potus, I, too, thought the news was really the news. Well, mostly.
1333151485287428099 2020-11-30 04:50:57 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Agreed. 💯
1333151193569353731 2020-11-30 04:49:47 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @nwgoboating I thought we have the server?
1333147359136665600 2020-11-30 04:34:33 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Maybe. 😂🤣

1333134014669053956 2020-11-30 03:41:32 +0800 <Iamahardhead> So, like Uppity Littleton? Because here in Aurora, we’ve always had homeless. Hickenlooper. Is. Complicit.
1333112091335663619 2020-11-30 02:14:25 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @OldRicOfTexas I didn’t think so either.

1333072582254481410 2020-11-29 23:37:25 +0800 <Iamahardhead> We just talked to my brother in law who is a military contractor in Saudi Arabia. He has already gotten the Covid vaccine and it was produced in China. Hmmm
1333071301653762048 2020-11-29 23:32:20 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Agreed. They’re so disgusting, I just wanna start shooting.

1333060874878279680 2020-11-29 22:50:54 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Covid has always, always been about shutting down the economy And squashing the citizen’s’ will, and mail in ballots to #stealtheelection. It comes from China and China wants Biden.
1333054212444393475 2020-11-29 22:24:25 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @LeroyKincaid @rdcarrington That too!  For me it’s about 50/50. 😀
1333048478126247940 2020-11-29 22:01:38 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @crazydebbie516 I’d say it’s the other way around.

1332859160216612864 2020-11-29 09:29:21 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Oh no!!  I’m sure you’re not that bad!

1332517680100892679 2020-11-28 10:52:26 +0800 <Iamahardhead> For sure. 💯
1332514841756659712 2020-11-28 10:41:09 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yeah. Bullshit. 😏
1332513682778165248 2020-11-28 10:36:33 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @trt0597jimmie Probably some public health expert. My Guv was spewing this crap at his last presser.

1332504396593303552 2020-11-28 09:59:39 +0800 <Iamahardhead> My Twitter name is not the subject at hand.  You spewing misinformation about women drivers IS.
1332502674181386241 2020-11-28 09:52:48 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @bungeeallday From the 80% on. 😝

1332468779306131456 2020-11-28 07:38:07 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Absolutely right!  I feel so sorry for people working in grocery stores, etc
1332468300652154880 2020-11-28 07:36:13 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Hi folks. My name is Joe Namath. This is the only time of the year that I get to make money...

1332463096632315910 2020-11-28 07:15:32 +0800 <Iamahardhead> They’re now saying that the masks are about 60% effective in preventing Covid.  So, if this was the birth control pill, I don’t think I’d bother.

1332442874609274882 2020-11-28 05:55:11 +0800 <Iamahardhead> This is not just about right vs wrong.  Or even good vs evil.  This is life vs death.  Fight accordingly.

1332424990604587011 2020-11-28 04:44:07 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Interesting that the people who never had a regular job are so against a president who has created so many jobs for regular people.

1332046069820256258 2020-11-27 03:38:25 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Eventually Patriots are going to have to look at the possibility of defunding the government. It may be the only way to reign it in.

1331955652730740736 2020-11-26 21:39:08 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I don’t. This has uncovered a huge amount of corruption and I think it’s part of the ass whooping.

1330535515175718919 2020-11-22 23:36:01 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @MrAndyNgo No more gatherings in or around cities that don’t permit open carry. Like DC.  All Patriots need to be prepared to fight.
1330534659147653122 2020-11-22 23:32:37 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @basedgoodstone @MrAndyNgo That’s already happened. One in Portland and one in Denver. Also several police earlier this year.

1330530937818505216 2020-11-22 23:17:50 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I suggest we change the name of the republican party to #MAGA  Since they hate it sooo much. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

To cut down on the possibility of hacking. So, the exact same thing as mail/Dropbox.  Actually, I cried.

1330168838902722562 2020-11-21 23:18:59 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I think the radical left has overplayed their hand ten-fold. From the summer of love to Insurrection. Now, you’re all gonna pay. 🔥 Patriots are pissed.
1330167176184147968 2020-11-21 23:12:22 +0800 <Iamahardhead> That’s a great idea. We also need to cut the fluff they get. 👍

1329931618593738752 2020-11-21 07:36:21 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Colorado Guv Jared Polis closes public schools, but the private school that his children attend remains open.

And contesting an election is nothing new. It’s happened several times in our history. It’s comments like that, that will provoke patriots like myself to say there’ll be no unity anytime soon.

1329806386281271300 2020-11-20 23:18:43 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Police said please avoid the area unless you are there getting a burger.  And avoid your family on the holidays. 😯

1329592593936691203 2020-11-20 09:09:11 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Hey Patriots.  #ChristmaslightsforTrump  Let’s all decorate our houses with elaborate light displays. To show Potus our support for everything he’s done for us. Added bonus: it’ll piss off the Godless enemy.

1329550952232325127 2020-11-20 06:23:43 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Denver Mayor Hancock says DPD Leo’s who travel out of town for the holidays will be made to quarantine upon returning. Furthermore, they will not be paid for this time unless they use PTO.

1329465333141397507 2020-11-20 00:43:30 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Thanks, but here in Denver, it’s too late. Most small businesses are already toast. And, please do not give to PP or NPR.

1328838558032015361 2020-11-18 07:12:55 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @rdcarrington Maybe it won’t happen. Back in May they were talking about doing contact tracing in the Ozarks. 😂😂 I don’t think it ever happened.
1328836948912443397 2020-11-18 07:06:31 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yikes 😬
1328836787247210496 2020-11-18 07:05:53 +0800 <Iamahardhead> It’s already happening. Down in GA, for example. GOP reported to be apathetic. They’ll be out soon and won’t even know what hit them.
1328835780136071169 2020-11-18 07:01:53 +0800 <Iamahardhead> This is a bad, very bad idea.

1328793443867512833 2020-11-18 04:13:39 +0800 <Iamahardhead> If you want to help the fight in GA for the 2 senate seats. Which is huge no matter what happens. Go to: Keep America America. Com. to donate.
1328790706173972480 2020-11-18 04:02:46 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @DennisPrager   show.  If you could go back and prevent Hitler from coming to power, but you had to cheat to do it, would you do it?  This is the justification that the the dems will use to steal the election. They believe it is their moral duty to get Trump out.

1328719968679157760 2020-11-17 23:21:41 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @shimoda_don Or, we could defund the corruption by refusing to pay our taxes.

1326581542961950726 2020-11-12 01:44:21 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Studio3141 💯💯😂👍
1326578544487575557 2020-11-12 01:32:26 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @AllenciaMiguel @NoahsArkworks Misleadia. That’s good.  Very good!  🇺🇸🇺🇸
1326578183450357760 2020-11-12 01:31:00 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Studio3141 I try not to lump everyone together in these areas, because some people are doing that to Denver because it’s so blue here. In fact it’s about 47-48% patriots.
1326576610808619008 2020-11-12 01:24:45 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Studio3141 Probably. There’s a few patriots here on Twitter from around Portland. But other than that...?
1326576105432772615 2020-11-12 01:22:44 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @HRHbutnotusing Yep. 😑
1326575564321398785 2020-11-12 01:20:35 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @weller_james Omg, yes!  Can you imagine what’s coming when they realize they have lost??
1326575257210204165 2020-11-12 01:19:22 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Studio3141 Agreed. And, fear and intimidation of regular citizens.
1326574942461304833 2020-11-12 01:18:07 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @HRHbutnotusing Absolutely right!
1326574700542226432 2020-11-12 01:17:09 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @socalfields I like that idea.  A lot!  🇺🇸

1326540321480601611 2020-11-11 23:00:33 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Every American citizen should demand an election where one person submits one legal ballot, counted by one human.  No machines.  No software.   No internet.
1326534191153094658 2020-11-11 22:36:11 +0800 <Iamahardhead> America last? We remember.

1326375660210761735 2020-11-11 12:06:14 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @SGTsaltbeef0430 I used to work in Mental  Health. With the homeless and then in group homes. Trust me, this job doesn’t pay enough.
1326374700180779009 2020-11-11 12:02:26 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @ReidHeinrich1 Sad but true. Soon they’ll have no one.
1326372593742569476 2020-11-11 11:54:03 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @MAGASHAMAN It really is. And all these people who voted in the demise of our country have zero awareness of what they’ve done.
1326372125159075840 2020-11-11 11:52:12 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @roberta98008705 Right!  What a clown.

1326338624422637571 2020-11-11 09:39:04 +0800 <Iamahardhead> You and Obummer are the reason for the burden.

1326328510076641280 2020-11-11 08:58:53 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @GeoffreyWeiss @pennyfarringto1 That’s not what I was trying to say. We need hard proof that can stand in a court of law. We need it now. Then, maybe we can win.

1325992968218669056 2020-11-10 10:45:34 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Ehnonymous3 Good point
1325991717397520388 2020-11-10 10:40:35 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Ehnonymous3 Maybe, but at least they wouldn’t come into office owing favors to big business.

1325931779556069381 2020-11-10 06:42:25 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Does anybody think that it’s suspect that the Covid numbers are through the roof at the same time the vaccine makes its debut?

1324768321116475395 2020-11-07 01:39:15 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @SpiritCollecto2 @DonaldJTrumpJr True. However, it’s statistically impossible for everyone who Only marked the president box, ALL voted for Biden.

1324728419783987200 2020-11-06 23:00:42 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I think we need to admit that, other than Trump, we’ve got no one. The GOP isn’t getting to the bottom of anything. Yet, still getting re-elected.  Example: Biden was in on the coup.
1324724735779942400 2020-11-06 22:46:03 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Meanwhile, here in Colorado.  Covid, Covid. COVID!!! We’re ALL gonna DIE!!

1323296232110985218 2020-11-03 00:09:42 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Pathetic local government here in Denver. Sends a postcard to businesses to board up in lieu of potential unrest.  I suppose making a statement that potential unrest will not be tolerated was out of the question? #Disgraceful

1321581206492819461 2020-10-29 06:34:48 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I am going to suggest that we do away with the oath of office for mayor and governor, especially in democratic states.  Replace it with the more accurate statement, “I do what I want!”

They just ignored millions of acres of dead, dry trees. They wouldn’t even let people get firewood. Now we’ve got total destruction. Sadly.

1320825609451429890 2020-10-27 04:32:19 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @larry18673887 Thanks. I grew up in Ohio where there were Duncards. I didn’t spell that right. So they are a little different but more the same. I didn’t know if this might be similar.
1320823891904864256 2020-10-27 04:25:30 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Potus just called them the Pennsylvania Dutch. That might be a little different than the Amish.
1320821391046967297 2020-10-27 04:15:33 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Potus in PA.  Several Amish men standing behind Trump. You can tell by the shape of their beards. And the straw hats. They also have no mask on.

1320787965023555584 2020-10-27 02:02:44 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Aurora mayor Mike Kauffman has tested positive for Covid and is in quarantine.  He was just with our Guv, @jaredpolis, at some function. However, Polis is not in danger of getting the Covid and will not be quarantined. Hmmm  #tyrant much?

1320760500859396096 2020-10-27 00:13:36 +0800 <Iamahardhead> We lost many beautiful soldiers during the Obama administration due to stand down orders.  While Isis ran wild and Iran was allowed unchecked aggression.  While John Kerry, Biden and Pelosi’s children got rich.
1320758154288861187 2020-10-27 00:04:17 +0800 <Iamahardhead> It’s pretty sad to think that when #Trump2020 is re-elected, that our fellow citizens are the ones we have to be worried about.  Attacking us.
1320749807984672768 2020-10-26 23:31:07 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @CStolzman Exactly. And sad.

1320745331882164224 2020-10-26 23:13:20 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @LoveHerMo Really?  That’s good!  I know CO is one, so they’re all talking about it here.

1320743591787012098 2020-10-26 23:06:25 +0800 <Iamahardhead> We only have to lose 7 seats to lose the senate.  Could it be possible that the dems are directing their fraud towards the senate? Then, they impeach Trump again.  🧐

Even if you are standing right there. Here, I still put my ballot into a box for someone else to cast. I was shocked.

Or pass laws that take away our guns. ? #NRA #2A

1319434908025094144 2020-10-23 08:26:10 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @rdcarrington @ObijwasForest You nailed it. 40 years of beetle kill and local government hasn’t done shit!!  They wouldn’t even allow citizens to go get firewood. And the first question at the presser was about climate change. Jesus!! 1,000 homes destroyed.
1319433067694620676 2020-10-23 08:18:51 +0800 <Iamahardhead> The new fire went from the 4th largest to the 2nd largest in the last 2 hours.  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

1319420488284835841 2020-10-23 07:28:52 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Our delightful governor could not have a presser about these devastating fires without bringing up Covid.  “If your throat is feeling scratchy, sneak over and maybe get tested for Covid.”  Yeah, no shit guv. Right after I evacuate my family.  Moron.
1319413829374267393 2020-10-23 07:02:25 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @NickDodger2 A gun after my heart!! Very cool.
1319413604903391232 2020-10-23 07:01:31 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Another fire in Colorado. Went from 10,000 acres to 150,000 acres in less than 24 hours. Why? Beetle kill. Dangerously close to meeting up with the Cameron peak fire. If that happens we are toast.  No pun intended.
1319412494373453824 2020-10-23 06:57:06 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @NickDodger2 Paint ball is a great idea!

1319407789094146048 2020-10-23 06:38:24 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @greyboy955 Exactly right!  The church has long been infected with the godlessness of pedophilia. They’ve paid out billions, yet no one goes to jail?  I walked away from these demons years ago.

1319358109173899272 2020-10-23 03:21:00 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I think that’s called heresy.
1319353231995068416 2020-10-23 03:01:37 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @JOwenHill Idk. But it’s everywhere (Governors, mayors) and it’s a problem.

It’s a thing called immunity.  They all have immunity.  Nothing’s gonna happen.  If they lie.  Do you think Congress passed that law?

1319339854795296772 2020-10-23 02:08:28 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yesterday I tweeted that the pope endorses pedophilia. I’d like to change that to the pope is a pedo.  According to the butt hurt left, only if it’s stated this way can it be considered my opinion.  Like when they call our Potus a racist. Just their opinion.  Carry on. 🍿

So, you put your vote in this box, and someone else,(non partisan) picks it up and takes it over somewhere else to cast. Even though you are standing right there  🔥🤬😭🤨🇺🇸

1317159363249950721 2020-10-17 01:43:58 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Hey mayor.  Party at my house.  Lockdown party.  I’ve invited about 50 people.  Hopefully they all bring a friend.  Hope you can make it.  Tyrant.

1317150612702756865 2020-10-17 01:09:12 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @DuaneDMartinJr2 That’s a fact. Sir.
1317150444142120961 2020-10-17 01:08:32 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Denver mayor. Presser.  More strict mask mandates. Masks will be required in more settings. Also public gatherings reduced from 10 people to 5.  How is that gonna work for the Broncos??
1317145559006957568 2020-10-17 00:49:07 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I can actually forgive people for voting for Hillary in 2016. Back then, some stuff was starting to surface, but mostly we didn’t know.  But today?  You might as well admit that you are a member of the mob if you’re voting Democrat. There’s just no way you don’t know.
1317144232960937987 2020-10-17 00:43:51 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Hillary is still walking free.
1317143601776910336 2020-10-17 00:41:20 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yeah. If we can get them to tell it. All of it. 🇺🇸

1317141975641034757 2020-10-17 00:34:52 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Extralien Yes indeed. Why doesn’t that concern the dems?
1317141649177382918 2020-10-17 00:33:35 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Dan_Acampora I went to go follow you and saw you were already following me. I missed it because I always follow back. So, let’s roll! 🇺🇸
1317139016014331905 2020-10-17 00:23:07 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Dan_Acampora I know. It’s just insane!
1317134094426308611 2020-10-17 00:03:33 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Joe Biden might announce that he will not pack the courts.  But what does the Harris administration say?
1317133083498467329 2020-10-16 23:59:32 +0800 <Iamahardhead> 1). Wear a mask.  It’s for your safety.  2). Lockdown.  Stay home. Stay safe.  3). The cattle train.  Line up. It’s for your safety.
1317105924704768001 2020-10-16 22:11:37 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Mapski3 @RealJamesWoods Agreed. But not in place for this election. Unfortunately.  Btw. This is on the Colorado ballot.  https://t.co/5yWsDxWXI6

1317104775083692032 2020-10-16 22:07:03 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Denver 9 news.  Interviews the guy who was clearly the provocateur and complicit in the murder of #LeeKeltner    Saying Dolloff acted in self defense.  This is the same guy that can be heard screaming, One less white supremacist. Immediately after the shooting. Lee was dead.
1317102778200788992 2020-10-16 21:59:07 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @CStolzman Size 18. ? At least.

1316922107952046085 2020-10-16 10:01:12 +0800 <Iamahardhead> ACB doesn’t care that the idiot dems are attacking her. She and Potus talked it over weeks ago. He asked her, can you handle it?  For the greater good?   She said, Yes Sir.  Let’s ROLL!!

1316911099929890816 2020-10-16 09:17:27 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @donna_viestenz Fact, ma’am.
1316910635075207168 2020-10-16 09:15:37 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @springssailor Agreed. And none of the other actors will see any charges. DA is an incompetent fool.
1316904532039839744 2020-10-16 08:51:21 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Denver mayor hinted at another lockdown. That’s for everyone except antifa.  Also bad mouthing our Potus about his Covid response. Just admit it, Hancock, Potus cut off federal funds because you’re STILL a sanctuary city. LOSER! Losers.
1316902183212810244 2020-10-16 08:42:01 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Denver DA finally announced charges of 2nd murder in the #LeeKeltner killing.  I fully expect a plea deal.

1316850638479912970 2020-10-16 05:17:12 +0800 <Iamahardhead> My chiropractor.  We often spar about Covid and masks.  Yesterday, we were talking about the spike. I asked him why the spike if the masks work?  He said, People like me who don’t wear the mask over my nose every minute.  I had to fire him. 🔥🔥

1316796905247191041 2020-10-16 01:43:41 +0800 <Iamahardhead> On the Colorado ballot. 9 judges asked to keep their jobs. Supreme, appeals and district.  I say No.  All 9.  No.
1316787377197780992 2020-10-16 01:05:50 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Local government out giving a presser. Assuring the public that the election will be safe and secure. We vote by mail/drop box.  But they cannot assure us that the spike in Covid cases are not manipulated.  Still no condolences to the family of #LeeKeltner

1316745473735229442 2020-10-15 22:19:19 +0800 <Iamahardhead> If the Denver DA was smart she would ask for help from the Feds. Based on the tattoo that links Dolloff to Antifa.  @randycorporon  @SWTubbs  @TubbsShow
1316741754092236803 2020-10-15 22:04:32 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @denver_mccomb Sounds right. This is beyond disgusting.
1316734588794929153 2020-10-15 21:36:04 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @denver_mccomb Also there was a 3rd and 4th guy. One was a black guns matter guy who was a clear provocateur. Many videos of him calling patriots vile names during the entire event.
1316733028559970305 2020-10-15 21:29:52 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @denver_mccomb Lots of local talk radio on that subject. Exactly. The event was over and they were running out of time to get the good photos. 🤬
1316730646304378881 2020-10-15 21:20:24 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Whether or not Dolloff goes for a self defense game has nothing to do with the Denver DA filing charges. Charge him or recuse yourself.
1316729441213657089 2020-10-15 21:15:37 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @geeoo52 Exactly right!
1316727541466566662 2020-10-15 21:08:04 +0800 <Iamahardhead> NFL reports they will not be playing the Pro Bowl this year. Due to Covid.  Right.  Isn’t the pro bowl their version of an award show? Pretty hard to get excited about that when there’s no fans there to witness the gushing.
1316725891570061313 2020-10-15 21:01:30 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @ArtSanc29169714 Agreed
1316723739405488131 2020-10-15 20:52:57 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Matthew Dolloff. Being held on suspicion of first degree murder, in Denver, still has not been charged in the brutal slaying of  #LeeKeltner
1316722732445425665 2020-10-15 20:48:57 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Army8589 Same here.

1316541610247806977 2020-10-15 08:49:14 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @GovtsTheProblem I totally agree. Sooo sick of Polis. He’s a commie bastard!!
1316541086274400256 2020-10-15 08:47:09 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @MollyMyDeer It should’ve been. DA asked for a 72 hour extension. Probably so she could skip town. 😡🔥🤬
1316540546236772357 2020-10-15 08:45:01 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @GovtsTheProblem That’s very possible. Also interesting that the spike is right on cue to bump the kids further out from returning to school. October 21. Now they wait 3 more weeks. Shameful.
1316536849385611266 2020-10-15 08:30:19 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @MollyMyDeer Also did you hear, Denver DA still has not charged Dolloff?

1316492947601457158 2020-10-15 05:35:52 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Colorado see’s a spike in cases of Covid. Guv says likely due to small family gatherings. Urged caution during upcoming holidays.  Of course it is.  Well done, guv. Take away Christmas.  #tyrant.
1316491073607421957 2020-10-15 05:28:25 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @springssailor Really?  Well fuck that!
1316487183822467082 2020-10-15 05:12:58 +0800 <Iamahardhead> #LeeKeltner  Was murdered in Denver.  No one at last night’s local debate spoke his name.
1316486391065391104 2020-10-15 05:09:49 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @PJQMIKE1 @GreenDvr Of course he did. 🔥
1316448166531731461 2020-10-15 02:37:55 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @charliekirk11  On his show today suggests that Potus ignore Biden and keep referring to “the Harris administration”.  Brilliant.  @realDonaldTrump

1316427262007353344 2020-10-15 01:14:51 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Why don’t we see Kamala at Biden’s rallies. Or on any commercials? Because she scares the hell out of people. Even dems.
1316401846261608450 2020-10-14 23:33:52 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Yesterday I tweeted that local nine news has private security paid for by taxpayers.  That’s wrong. I misunderstood my source. They pay for the security.  🙏

1316374955412643853 2020-10-14 21:47:01 +0800 <Iamahardhead> If the Denver Post photographer and her “security guard” were not at that squeeze point, along with a black guns matter agitator, trying to get a photo,  #LeeKeltner  would probably be alive.
1316373033989406720 2020-10-14 21:39:22 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Cory Gardner pissed down his leg last night at the debate. Way to go.  You’re the man!

1316369002692739077 2020-10-14 21:23:21 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Increase in numbers are right on time to prevent Denver public schools from letting the kids go back to school. They were supposed to go back October 21. Even halftime.

Maybe this wouldn’t have happened.  One million dollars in damage to our capitol.  No consequences.  Taxpayers pay.  #LeeKeltner

1315808939167145987 2020-10-13 08:17:52 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @KyleClark Why wasn’t this guy wearing a shirt or hat that says security?
1315807968584249346 2020-10-13 08:14:00 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Tennessee_Bones @realDonaldTrump That’s okay. I’m in love with @PressSec ❤️💯🇺🇸

1315806461046517760 2020-10-13 08:08:01 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @MSgtVet Recently. I think about a year or 18 months.
1315806273741434882 2020-10-13 08:07:16 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Bricker24294292 Ha!  Me too.
1315805829791199232 2020-10-13 08:05:30 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Local talk radio.  Mayor Hancock gives a virtual presser on Covid. Says, about the murder, it’s a tragedy. That’s all. Nothing else.  Can you imagine what would be happening here if this was a black man?  Or if the murdered was part of the communist party of Denver?
1315804019311480835 2020-10-13 07:58:19 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Jimmya16 Shit. Guv and mayor needs to step down.

1315736613318782976 2020-10-13 03:30:28 +0800 <Iamahardhead> There’s nowhere in the land that doesn’t call out murder.  As a crime.
1315735730061225985 2020-10-13 03:26:57 +0800 <Iamahardhead> As far as I am concerned, the first shot has been fired. By the enemy.  We are taking casualties.  Time to fight.  FIGHT!  🔥

1315682874398515200 2020-10-12 23:56:56 +0800 <Iamahardhead> The only reason these people in congress are bitching about ACB killing Obamacare is because It’s Unconstitutional.  They know it.

1315655130814066688 2020-10-12 22:06:41 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @9NEWS  Lying to the people telling us that the murderer worked for Pinkerton. He never worked for Pinkerton.
1315653868294938624 2020-10-12 22:01:40 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @jackhutton It is also immoral for a man to wear his hair in a bun.
1315652436980363264 2020-10-12 21:55:59 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @GovofCO  Time to resign. You have failed to uphold our constitution. By allowing the communist party to go unchecked all summer, You are now complicit in the murder of a Colorado citizen and a US Veteran. RESIGN!

1315455011409793025 2020-10-12 08:51:29 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @TTalker2 Yes indeed.
1315446842642100225 2020-10-12 08:19:01 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @springssailor Exactly.
1315446492761600000 2020-10-12 08:17:38 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @CStolzman I feel bad for you boys in TX. CO was red for 70 years then 2004 went blue and promptly into the crapper.
1315444574836449280 2020-10-12 08:10:01 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @dtoner67 Yes indeed.
1315441957049692161 2020-10-12 07:59:36 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @livinglife1027 Agreed. That’s why we mostly watch old stuff.
1315441452604944390 2020-10-12 07:57:36 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @TheCota83 Indeed. Libs everywhere. They’re rude and terrible drivers. lol

1315434498310406145 2020-10-12 07:29:58 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @MollyMyDeer No. Me either.
1315430817397714944 2020-10-12 07:15:21 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @JakeDenver6 Exactly right. It’s a combination of a lot of illegals and a lot of out of staters. I have grown kids and 2 grandchildren here so if I leave the city, it won’t be too far.
1315429384208211968 2020-10-12 07:09:39 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @rfish1998 @JackPosobiec Ha! Good stuff. 💥
1315427827366400000 2020-10-12 07:03:28 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Every time I try to watch some new show. For the last few years. There is either a gay/lesbian story line. Or, if there is a traditional family, it’s always multi-racial.  I don’t have anything against either, but why is a regular family not okay for prime time? Any color.
1315423908389101569 2020-10-12 06:47:53 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @mcgeebs01 Did you see over in Tehran, I think, they were building gallows all up and down Main Street. For the government. ☝️They don’t mess around over there.

1315420041085685761 2020-10-12 06:32:31 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @mcgeebs01 Which is exactly why they should all be fired. 🔥

1315377977430073344 2020-10-12 03:45:23 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @oldriccid It is. 💔
1315377326386024448 2020-10-12 03:42:47 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @oldriccid Exactly. The city council and police and schools. Everywhere.
1315376482215174144 2020-10-12 03:39:26 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @MollyMyDeer Absolutely
1315376145370615809 2020-10-12 03:38:06 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @springssailor Or they are communist too.
1315375924863524864 2020-10-12 03:37:13 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @oldriccid Based on what’s happened this summer it’s looking like a go. Maybe they’ll turn it around after this murder, but we have a corrupt government and judges. Hard to say.
1315374533730328578 2020-10-12 03:31:41 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @MollyMyDeer Yes indeed. Such a beautiful and special place. I’ve lived here 40 years. 💔

1315364625265897472 2020-10-12 02:52:19 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @AriFleischer @LesterHoltNBC 9news Denver. NBC.  Running a story that the shooter, in yesterday’s killing, is not antifa.  Even though it can be heard clearly that the victim is called a white supremacist after the shot.  Why would a regular killer make that distinction?
1315358890167500801 2020-10-12 02:29:32 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @TavorX95 Hillary.  No contest.

Let me remind you that this is Always how it goes. Eventually, they won’t need/want you and you’ll be out and they’ll be in.  It’s called OVERTHROWN.  Just saying.
1315289784890294273 2020-10-11 21:54:56 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Who shut down Occupy protests?  Obama.  Right after he gave Big Banks the biggest bailout in history.
1315287652795666432 2020-10-11 21:46:27 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Anything’s possible.  But I heard he does have a day job as a security guard for Pinkerton. Local news.

1314935794298220544 2020-10-10 22:28:18 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I am really tired of the bratty left. From what I can tell, the Supreme Court has been leaning left ever since RBG was appointed in 1993. That’s 27 years! Now, it’s our  turn to have a couple decades.  So you all can shut it!! #whinnybitches

1314010006237392897 2020-10-08 09:09:33 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Went to see my PCP today. He is also an endocrinologist and has a huge practice. I asked him if he knew of anybody who had Covid, or died from it. He said No. He had been told of a couple cases. But no deaths. Only elderly people. #scamdemic2020
1314008250619170818 2020-10-08 09:02:34 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @other_wa Exactly.  Rules for thee, not for me.  Same in Hollywood.

1313968986812493824 2020-10-08 06:26:33 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @tfino191 Yes indeed.
1313968699691479053 2020-10-08 06:25:25 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @SiSunkist58 Absolutely. 😂

1313968372611198976 2020-10-08 06:24:07 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @oldriccid Yes indeed.
1313968245775446018 2020-10-08 06:23:36 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @tfino191 True. But the big money has come through foreign aid kickbacks. I will always believe that.
1313963895221104641 2020-10-08 06:06:19 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Taxpayers?

1313929646258388994 2020-10-08 03:50:13 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Could we see some arrests??
1313924019243151360 2020-10-08 03:27:52 +0800 <Iamahardhead> We the people strongly urge you, and Pelosi to Suck it!!

1313920905085702145 2020-10-08 03:15:29 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @KenWilcox17 No. What I meant is it’s safer for all to not get pregnant.
1313920562675290112 2020-10-08 03:14:08 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @DineshDSouza  on the  @DennisPrager  show.  We have nothing in common with the left and we never will. It’s time to admit that we need to establish our own institutions. Schools, hospitals, sports, movies and universities. Even after Trump, we will not be able to go forward.
1313900368066035712 2020-10-08 01:53:53 +0800 <Iamahardhead> That’s a fact. Jack.  😂😂
1313898588578017282 2020-10-08 01:46:49 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @forestandfield_ @GovtsTheProblem Agreed. And yet Polis comes out this morning criticized Trump for his Covid remarks.  What a douche.
1313898050117529601 2020-10-08 01:44:40 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @JRubinBlogger Now if we could just get you to stay remote.  Like China.
1313896590612942848 2020-10-08 01:38:52 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @2a_way I have a real problem with them referring to abortion as healthcare.
1313893533850329088 2020-10-08 01:26:44 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Getting on the pill is safer.  For the unborn baby.
1313888155913932804 2020-10-08 01:05:21 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @rdcarrington Jennifer has some bad judgement sometimes. I mean, she married Ben Afleck.
1313865502968762368 2020-10-07 23:35:21 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @GovofCO @jaredpolis  Critical of Potus for his comments on Covid. Polis the tyrant says we still need the communist approach here in Colorado.  Resign!

1313845195688087554 2020-10-07 22:14:39 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Remember back in 2016 when, in an attempt to explain how she lost, they said that people came out of the back hills and the woodwork to vote? It’ll be the same this time. This his time, it’ll be dems walking away. There are a lot of people disgusted with the radical agenda. 💯🇺🇸

People enjoy sports as a way to take a break and be entertained. No one gives a damn what these athletes do on their own time.

This is where the little changes are made. Chipping away at our civil liberties and constitution. And they are never satisfied.

1312767215083683842 2020-10-04 22:51:08 +0800 <Iamahardhead> The year was 1973.  Average income $12,500.  Price of rent $175.  A dozen eggs. $.45.   And Biden goes to DC.

1312105243669221376 2020-10-03 03:00:42 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Maybe Potus really does have Covid. Maybe it’s something else, meaning they need him to be insulated against some threat. We may never know. Either way, the angels have spoken and all is well. Patriots are still in control.  #GodWins

1312078145936384003 2020-10-03 01:13:01 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @ReidHeinrich1 Agreed. The year of the boomerang. 👍
1312069365991383041 2020-10-03 00:38:08 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @BarryObiden Yeah!!!!  Why???
1312069056929898497 2020-10-03 00:36:54 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @tomselliott @SRuhle @SpeakerPelosi Trump ain’t dead yet.  In fact, I predict he’ll outlive both of you witches.
1312060666413449218 2020-10-03 00:03:34 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Bloggasaurus Agreed. Absolutely right. And this will backfire on the left. More people seeing their hate will #WalkAway.
1312059837661016064 2020-10-03 00:00:16 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Is that what Allah says? Talib?
1312058349874286592 2020-10-02 23:54:22 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @JohnTibbs65 Yes. But I thought he looked flushed that night. Did not seem to be himself.
1312049434428137475 2020-10-02 23:18:56 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Mapski3 @ZaraRahim Agreed.
1312049340240855042 2020-10-02 23:18:34 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @KenWilcox17 @ZaraRahim I guess the tweet has been deleted. Don’t know if it was her or jack.
1312041575678177286 2020-10-02 22:47:42 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Still cannot accept the 2016 election results? @ZaraRahim  Buckle up.  #Trump
1312034328818450433 2020-10-02 22:18:55 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I’m sorry guys, but this just stinks to high heaven. I hope Potus can be tested with the tests from a different manufacturer. From a different part of the country. They didn’t want him out there having his rallies or even debating. This feels like sabotage. Js

1312029855979130881 2020-10-02 22:01:08 +0800 <Iamahardhead> When was the last time you saw a mural painted on a city street that said White Supremacy Rules?

1311781822712381440 2020-10-02 05:35:32 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Everytown Your protection is a local government responsibility. Not federal. Seek and study your state constitution.

1311771222993141760 2020-10-02 04:53:25 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Just got this in my mailbox. Apparently there is no law in Colorado that prohibits late term abortion. The radical left wants to join NY and VA in allowing this barbaric act between weeks 22 and 40 of a pregnancy. 😡😡  https://t.co/MGbwOOYbjG
1311752550249627656 2020-10-02 03:39:13 +0800 <Iamahardhead> National health care fraud and opioid takedown results in charges against 345 defendants and billions in losses. 1 day ago.  A big chunk of the fraud was in treatment center and sober living homes. Both were required to be covered by Obamacare/taxpayers.  Pretty sure.

1311671595723829249 2020-10-01 22:17:32 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @LauriLe48862677 Yes indeed.

1311665611253063686 2020-10-01 21:53:45 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I don’t know if I trust these electronic voting machines either. If a paper ballot is okay for mail-in voting. Why can’t we have a paper ballot for in-person voting? That way votes could be counted by more than one “office” if necessary.
1311664297269895174 2020-10-01 21:48:32 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Bloggasaurus That’s right!  We were still asleep. Now we either stand or it’s over.
1311662415067729920 2020-10-01 21:41:03 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I think that if they try to steal this election, and it’s seriously looking that way, that this is when we rise up. If we don’t have a fair and honest election, we don’t have a country. Trump has said this many times. We cannot let this stand. Make some phone calls.

1310398874792624130 2020-09-28 10:00:12 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @JessieJaneDuff Not just the Biden’s.  Many others, too.  Many.
1310395265086521348 2020-09-28 09:45:51 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @RobertBelfi The law doesn’t apply to them?

1310345502093963269 2020-09-28 06:28:07 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Potus throwing down with the lamestream media. Said he is waiting for WaPo, NYT, CBS, CNN, ABC, etc to endorse him. If they don’t, their ratings will go down like a thud. 😂
1310343731057483778 2020-09-28 06:21:05 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @MomJar1 Exactly!!  Lame 😒
1310343413070471169 2020-09-28 06:19:49 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Alyssa_Milano Your opinion is irrelevant.
1310338942508699655 2020-09-28 06:02:03 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Fucking media. Sooo disrespectful. Asked Potus how much he pays in taxes. They would Never ask Obummer this question.
1310335451279040526 2020-09-28 05:48:11 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Patriot5611 Move.

1310322210201108480 2020-09-28 04:55:34 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @FopPriggish If you could see my hair, you’d know why I said that. It hasn’t been this long since the 70’s. 😂😂😂
1310321745996517377 2020-09-28 04:53:43 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @GETBIBLE Absolutely!  Nothing’s gonna happen.
1310321445768232961 2020-09-28 04:52:31 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @eileen6616 Indeed. What a witch!
1310317282820849665 2020-09-28 04:35:59 +0800 <Iamahardhead> What finally did it? The haircut?
1310316068515315713 2020-09-28 04:31:09 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @other_wa Right. I don’t think the majority could do it.
1310308061131821061 2020-09-28 03:59:20 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @ewarren I’d like to see your tax returns. Last 20 years.
1310307282824187904 2020-09-28 03:56:15 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @pvtjokerus They’re way down on illegals voting.  C’mon man.
1310306772784119811 2020-09-28 03:54:13 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @amdorgan If only he could get them to show up for work...

1310303051169910787 2020-09-28 03:39:26 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @N_AmerSolutions @drugb0t Yes
1310301703112097792 2020-09-28 03:34:04 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Just be honest.  Once in your life.  Biden doesn’t have the answer to jack shit.
1310300649414971399 2020-09-28 03:29:53 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I think you’re confused here. Illegals are not Americans.
1310290865760460807 2020-09-28 02:51:01 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Every single congressman or woman that votes for legalizing full term abortion should be required to attend one. From beginning to end.  With their eyes wide open.
1310274289791381510 2020-09-28 01:45:09 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Studio3141 Oh yeah. Okay. 😎😂

1310271644867362816 2020-09-28 01:34:38 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Will you fix my computer? 😁
1310268361692020737 2020-09-28 01:21:35 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @uglydudejoe Goebbles is more in line with jack and zuck and Soros. With censorship. And msm with lying.
1310256966112079872 2020-09-28 00:36:18 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @dynamex Nailed it!  🤪
1310248689361969152 2020-09-28 00:03:25 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Agreed. And some others.
1310245176384925696 2020-09-27 23:49:27 +0800 <Iamahardhead> You mean like when the libs/dems had “the wrong Trump died” trending when your President’s brother died?  That kind of horrible?
1310243282618810370 2020-09-27 23:41:56 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @RileyParkerJor1 @Johan_Schnitzel Now I’d like to see some background on the author, Ross. Who is he? Where’s he work and the date he wrote that.
1310241313045073920 2020-09-27 23:34:06 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @kevincorke And yet when they receive a petition to recall Polis, they scrutinized every single signature and threw out about half.  We the people see you.  Your days are numbered.
1310238209218052101 2020-09-27 23:21:46 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @SenBlumenthal No where else can an employee refuse to do the job they were hired to do and be asked to continue with that employer.  Citizens better grow a pair and put a stop to this kind of arrogance.
1310237323053989892 2020-09-27 23:18:15 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @SenBlumenthal Harm real lives? Like full-term babies?
1310234331839897602 2020-09-27 23:06:22 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Stonewoodforge @Juliaathomas59 This shit right here just chaps my hide. How many other tests/biopsies etc have been wrong?  How many unnecessary surgeries? I don’t trust anyone. And I am making my new tin foil hat with heavy duty foil this time.
1310229090813739009 2020-09-27 22:45:32 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @DrNealHouston @Cointuckeywind1 Better stir up some biscuits to have with them. 🥰

1310222946179395584 2020-09-27 22:21:07 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Trump parade here in Colorado. Florence to Canon City. 500-1000 vehicles. #Trump2020Landslide  https://t.co/awsJCQ71Jz
1310219750056787970 2020-09-27 22:08:25 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Johan_Schnitzel That’s exactly right.  He was white.

1310034018121981957 2020-09-27 09:50:23 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @PiamentaShimon I know this one too.  Has anybody got it yet?
1310032524618403840 2020-09-27 09:44:27 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @eileen6616 Yes. Very sad indeed.

1310020771637530626 2020-09-27 08:57:45 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Bricker24294292 @PiamentaShimon Sounds like it!!  Sooo fun to be at those shows. And so many already gone. Like Petty. 😔
1310018320062656513 2020-09-27 08:48:01 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Heavy smoke has filled the sky here in Denver. Cameron peak is kicking up. No rain in sight.
1310017143258447873 2020-09-27 08:43:20 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Bricker24294292 @PiamentaShimon Exactly. Back then it wasn’t enough to be musically talented. You had to be business savvy too. That’s some of the reason it was such an amazing time.
1310015621149716480 2020-09-27 08:37:17 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Bricker24294292 @PiamentaShimon Queen will always be one of my all time favorites.

1310012318185594880 2020-09-27 08:24:10 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Bricker24294292 @PiamentaShimon Omg!!  Too funny. I saw my first concert  in 1973. Elton John Yellow Brick Road Tour.  And yes. No fair.
1310010710857052160 2020-09-27 08:17:46 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Bricker24294292 @PiamentaShimon Yes and people were chill. I am so grateful to have been a kid in the 70’s.

1310009351378214914 2020-09-27 08:12:22 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @LibertatemPax Not all. But almost.
1310007917920227328 2020-09-27 08:06:41 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @LibertatemPax They are possessed by Satanic hate and greed. They crave power and they will fight anyone who gets in their way. To the death.

1309940100692881408 2020-09-27 03:37:12 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @rdcarrington 😂. I like it too. 👍

1309851414382997510 2020-09-26 21:44:47 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I think a lot of everyday Democrats are embarrassed too. Not all dems are radical. And as we’ve seen, many are walking.

1309669161111519246 2020-09-26 09:40:35 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Interesting that Potus passes a law that makes animal cruelty a federal crime on the same day that some scum rides/beats a horse to death. I hope they make an example out of you and you rot in hell. You sick fuck!!

1309620142490497029 2020-09-26 06:25:48 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Just saw a Biden sign in my neighbor’s yard.  They also had a sign Hickenlooper for senate.  I’m thinking they should consolidate and just say any crook for DC will do.

1309283199965630464 2020-09-25 08:06:54 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Sinnersaint39 Agreed. It did sound like some of the changes had to do with not letting big Insurance get away with murder. Unchecked. That’s why I got kinda excited 😜

1309278756352262145 2020-09-25 07:49:15 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Sinnersaint39 I think the healthcare that Potus is referring to is the one where sick people go to a doctor and are actually okay with the doctor treating them.
1309277973951000577 2020-09-25 07:46:08 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Sinnersaint39 Okay. Sounds like I misunderstood.

1308762828363440131 2020-09-23 21:39:08 +0800 <Iamahardhead> In many states when a pregnant woman is murdered, the perpetrator is charged with 2 murders. Just saying. 2 lives.  Period.
1308758722135687170 2020-09-23 21:22:49 +0800 <Iamahardhead> And?

1308594153387941888 2020-09-23 10:28:53 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @ReidHeinrich1 Agreed. Shows like South Park were some of the first to come out with taboo topics.

1308563135276740613 2020-09-23 08:25:38 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @MrsS0S I respect that. But I don’t think the writers were promoting this. More like bringing attention to the subject that people were trying to normalize it.  Just me.
1308562075753549824 2020-09-23 08:21:25 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @robert_plissken Yes exactly!!  😂😂
1308560835565027328 2020-09-23 08:16:29 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Still watching South Park. Now the episode is about NAMBLA. North American Man Boy Love Association. The year is still 2000. People have been trying to normalize this for decades.

1308516410969260033 2020-09-23 05:19:58 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Just watched an episode of South Park. Cartman hits Token with a rock and gets sent to juvi for a hate crime. The year 2000.

1308488293684830215 2020-09-23 03:28:14 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @marklevinshow There saying the same about social security. They know a lot of Trump supporters are retired. Nice try. It. Won’t. Work.
1308487146953682944 2020-09-23 03:23:41 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @ph_hall80 Totally. 👍💯
1308484190623629315 2020-09-23 03:11:56 +0800 <Iamahardhead> That won’t last long. Taxpayers will sit down on the sofa and quit their jobs and no more taxes.
1308472257107427335 2020-09-23 02:24:30 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @BatTatGuy Yep. Done.

1308426714134052866 2020-09-22 23:23:32 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Either way.  If you’re voting for Trump they’ll probably end up in the trash.

1307690648309583872 2020-09-20 22:38:40 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I am really sick of people claiming that the right to control over a woman’s body is attached to whether or not abortion is legal.   The control over your body was relinquished, by you, some weeks earlier when you spread your legs and allowed yourself to get pregnant.
1307687714511376385 2020-09-20 22:27:01 +0800 <Iamahardhead> The American people do have a voice.  Our voice elects our President, who then chooses.  That’s the way it’s always been.  Get over it.  #Trump2020

1306976363950280706 2020-09-18 23:20:22 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Have you checked in with your local  blm activist @TayAndersonCO ?  I think he has a job at Denver public schools. Anderson has tweeted “No lives matter unless black lives matter”
1306973927260946436 2020-09-18 23:10:41 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @glenn_perkin That’s hard and it hurts.   Sorry.

1306662140099596288 2020-09-18 02:31:45 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Do you speak English? Do you know the definition of the word Oath?
1306661243823026179 2020-09-18 02:28:11 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I don’t think you’ll have anything to worry about unless you are out committing felonies.

1306644744404164609 2020-09-18 01:22:38 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Glenn Beck one month ago. Netflix has the director for inclusion content  and marketing, Darnell Moore, a gay activist who co-wrote blm’s founding principles, deciding what your children watch.  The goal is to destroy the nuclear family.

1306300061362593792 2020-09-17 02:32:59 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Mitch McConnell today calling out senate dems on judge confirmations. Senate dems have forced us to break more filibusters since 2017 than had occurred cumulatively in all of senate history before Potus was elected.

1306221961492692993 2020-09-16 21:22:38 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Any coverage on the historic Abraham Accord peace deal this morning? Or is today about the NFL’s ratings being in the crapper. And how this is Trump’s fault.

1305961348807917582 2020-09-16 04:07:03 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I want to hear what Obama and Hillary have to say. 😂
1305960802516701184 2020-09-16 04:04:53 +0800 <Iamahardhead> That’s right!  For all you stupid antifa fucks, allow me to translate. QAnon’s are way more pissed off than you are. Next time you want to stand in the street, or pick on a senior you might just find out.
1305942456253513728 2020-09-16 02:51:59 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @vacoastie This is huge!!  ❤️🙏💯
1305940419587567616 2020-09-16 02:43:53 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I am speechless after watching this Abraham Accord signing. All 4 leaders are smiling and appear to be delighted with what is happening. Wow!!
1305936970716188675 2020-09-16 02:30:11 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Check out the Abraham Accords signing between Israel, UAE and Bahrain. Just streamed on YouTube. This is HUGE! Netanyahu said during his speech that this would not have been possible even a few years ago. (Like during Obama). He thanked our Potus. Holy frickin world peace Batman!

1305915934666825730 2020-09-16 01:06:36 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Has anybody heard from the dems about how they feel about the “Harris Administration” being shoved down their pie hole?Seeing how she didn’t even have enough support to make it to Iowa. Wasn’t that just a few months ago?

1305867363217178626 2020-09-15 21:53:35 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Republicans are too soft.  Even Potus said so.

1305536548104998914 2020-09-14 23:59:03 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I guess that makes sense if they had wiped the phones back in 2018 when the mueller report was released. That one that found Nothing.
1305531300313468930 2020-09-14 23:38:12 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I think we can all agree that all major sports have crossed over to the dark side. Marxist lovin’ commie bastards.  So, I’d like to make a suggestion that we give them zero attention from now on. No telly. No tweety.  Thanks.

1305252618390953985 2020-09-14 05:10:49 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I disagree. This is not Trump’s fight. This is the people’s fight. If you’re sick of it, go downtown and drag out your mayor and don’t leave until you get results.

But it’s a small price to pay to leave a country to our children and grandchildren. Hanging tough with my peeps!! lol

1304895104948240386 2020-09-13 05:30:11 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @thedarkhorse77 I agree. I don’t watch nfl for a couple years now.
1304894762919624707 2020-09-13 05:28:49 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @geeoo52 Because I don’t think college is taking a knee.
1304894580245114881 2020-09-13 05:28:06 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @ride1hour I don’t think so. That’s why I was wondering.
1304894413836095488 2020-09-13 05:27:26 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Godzirra_Hammer Agreed.
1304894203969798144 2020-09-13 05:26:36 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @thedarkhorse77 Okay by me.  I didn’t think so, but wasn’t sure.
1304893982540017664 2020-09-13 05:25:43 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Jimmya16 Sweet hobbit!
1304893839635820544 2020-09-13 05:25:09 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @geeoo52 Okay. Very confusing. 😂
1304892774320402433 2020-09-13 05:20:55 +0800 <Iamahardhead> So, guys. Are we watching college football? Yes or no.
1304871555600658433 2020-09-13 03:56:36 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Thanks for the heads up. I am sending a letter to ICE to nominate YOU for this same trip. You’re a fraud and a criminal.
1304850878160134147 2020-09-13 02:34:26 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @myjourneymyself I have had that happen too. Yesterday I had it over my mouth, just not my nose. They really aggravate me especially when I’m trying to meet them halfway.
1304819154051108864 2020-09-13 00:28:23 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @KidukSong @Bud_Doggin And don’t forget the parents. Without their consent this could never have happened.
1304810563793555457 2020-09-12 23:54:15 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @jaljr @Bud_Doggin Ask this moron if he was born with his penis or did he grow it later?   After he decided.
1304809936979980289 2020-09-12 23:51:45 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I hear Iran is looking at starting a team.

1304786927267307520 2020-09-12 22:20:19 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Quindel1plex Absolutely. Just trying to throw out some encouragement. It was such a heavy day yesterday.  ❤️👍💯❤️

1304782878824374273 2020-09-12 22:04:14 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Everything the dems, the deep state is doing is backfiring. They are turning more and more Americans into Trump supporters with their hate for law and order and their contempt for God. “Never interfere with an enemy in the process of destroying itself.” Sun Tzu  We got this!

Why send a plane full of cash?   And, Obama is not our president. Please don’t use that word when referring to the loser
1304774838821761024 2020-09-12 21:32:17 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @realDonaldTrump Antifa, blm, nfl, etc.  Is this the social justice you are hoping for in America?

I was there 30 minutes and 3 employees told me to pull my mask up over my nose. One did this After I had checked out. Each time I said fuck off. Politely.

1304454620111081474 2020-09-12 00:19:51 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Got my new carpet yesterday. I was struck by just how disgusting the old carpet had gotten while I was asleep.  This is exactly what has happened in our country. We didn’t realize because we live here, not because we don’t care. The longer it’s there the dirtier the job.

1304415111961083906 2020-09-11 21:42:52 +0800 <Iamahardhead> You left out extremists. It’s right wing extremists.  Far right.

1304237097738481664 2020-09-11 09:55:30 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I’d say that what is even more sad is the fact that New Yorkers and all Americans are going to stand around and say oh well, what can I do? This is sad. Terrible. Infuriating. Oh well. Guess the bully gets our lunch money again.

1304037475892035590 2020-09-10 20:42:16 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Republicans, Trump supporters or MAGAs are being labeled as “far-right extremists” by the media. We need to now refer to the dems/libs as ...?

He said you wouldn’t want a life without the things that Middle East oil buys. I said I’d do without it all if it saves even one soldier. This was about 15 years ago during the beheadings.

Ugh 😑 but you’d think the installers would have called it a no go early. But no. They load up my carpet, drive here in a blizzard and then decide it’s bad. 😠

1301590723674898435 2020-09-04 02:39:45 +0800 <Iamahardhead> They’re gonna put me in the movies. They’re gonna make a big star outta me.  We’ll make a film about a man who’s sad and lonely, and all I gotta do is, Act Naturally.
1301587818121175043 2020-09-04 02:28:12 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Sinnersaint39 I know. Sooo sad.
1301587592643829766 2020-09-04 02:27:19 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @MikeEzell10 Yes indeed. And all those benefits? Outrageous salary. Mansion provided by taxpayers? WTH!
1301584651308404738 2020-09-04 02:15:37 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @numberonepal Okay. Sorry.
1301584396345126912 2020-09-04 02:14:37 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Sinnersaint39 There’s no cure for TDS.

1301574277779554304 2020-09-04 01:34:24 +0800 <Iamahardhead> We the people need to take some responsibility for the way our elected officials behave. For far too long we have treated them like royalty. Every where they went, goo gooing over them. When this is over, some shit needs to change. Js
1301572655448027136 2020-09-04 01:27:57 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Has D’Blasio resigned yet? What’s the police chief doing today?

1301341909198176256 2020-09-03 10:11:03 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Careful Kyle. Your snarky comment could be interpreted as no matter the age, It’s open season on Trump supports.

1301314837335736321 2020-09-03 08:23:29 +0800 <Iamahardhead> It’s about much more than Biden’s mental decline. Or Pelosi’s hypocrisy. It’s about the tens of millions of people who support them.  With gusto.
1301313568386822145 2020-09-03 08:18:26 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Sparty80GoGreen That’s pretty good, blue.  Actually damn good!

1301285251403186176 2020-09-03 06:25:55 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Great question! 😂🤣 Love you Jesse!  ❤️
1301278491455959041 2020-09-03 05:59:03 +0800 <Iamahardhead> A newlywed gal runs into her priest. He asked her how’s married life? She says Father, my husband made love to me 7 times last night. The priest says, Go home and take the juice of 7 lemons. She asked, will that make me clean? He said No but it’ll wipe that smile off your face.
1301276243111940104 2020-09-03 05:50:07 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @debcre Exactly!  😝

1300887915824902148 2020-09-02 04:07:03 +0800 <Iamahardhead> So you are saying you are okay with the  Death to America  Thingy?  Robert?
1300881878174572544 2020-09-02 03:43:03 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Tennessee_Bones @Gummshrimp @RealMattCouch @KarlEspo True.
1300881662973284354 2020-09-02 03:42:12 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Potus calling out journalists referring to riots as peaceful protest. BOOM!
1300881320193798144 2020-09-02 03:40:50 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Trump in Kenosha at round table. Was just asked by a journalist if he thinks that systemic racism by police exists. He said No.
1300879756225843201 2020-09-02 03:34:37 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @TheRISEofROD @mykie3620 I’m guessing it’ll be Trump’s fault.
1300878506172309512 2020-09-02 03:29:39 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @numberonepal Thanks
1300861842248683521 2020-09-02 02:23:26 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @rdcarrington Yeah.
1300844515784355841 2020-09-02 01:14:35 +0800 <Iamahardhead> A friend of ours just stopped by. An east coast leftie. I asked him if he had heard about the cdc revision of Covid deaths. He replied, That wasn’t the cdc, that was a far right group that put that out. (Apple spotlight news)
1300829633915621376 2020-09-02 00:15:27 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I hope every single one of Ted’s “upscale” neighbors also voted for his sorry ass.
1300814908645351429 2020-09-01 23:16:56 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @missippimadman @lawyer4laws That’s good!  Stupid journalists would Not shut up about the Trump supporters and the paintballs. Not one word about the murder of #JayBishop
1300797238461988866 2020-09-01 22:06:43 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Metalivy74 Maybe because you’re not following back?
1300789096739213313 2020-09-01 21:34:22 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @HillaryClinton Tweets from gitmo?
1300788557599191040 2020-09-01 21:32:14 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Dago70_2 @KathyKraeuter Yes!! If you’re a Democrat.
1300786084176162822 2020-09-01 21:22:24 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Don’t forget the guy shooting paintballs.  Omg!  Americans want to know if Potus is going to condemn the paintballs!
1300784487945646081 2020-09-01 21:16:03 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Studio3141 Yes. And just the fact that they have brought charges is worrisome. This could be the spark that blows the whole thing sky high.
1300783879125639170 2020-09-01 21:13:38 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Denver is in 2nd place.
1300782033887727623 2020-09-01 21:06:18 +0800 <Iamahardhead> I wouldn’t want to be the judge in this case. Hope he knows what’s on the line.
1300779423403323394 2020-09-01 20:55:56 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @hungrybowtie 95 random “non violent” nights in a row? You do know that we all have social media... Just shut it.
1300612149031518208 2020-09-01 09:51:15 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Jimmya16 I think so too. I also hope it’s the beginning of the end for these tyrant governors.
1300609053085831168 2020-09-01 09:38:57 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @mjlinks4201 Very true!
1300608754774429699 2020-09-01 09:37:45 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @mjlinks4201 Very good point. Trump playing 3D chess.  Love it 😍
1300608149611778048 2020-09-01 09:35:21 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @al_ravenna @johnflipside Punks.
1300604807884034051 2020-09-01 09:22:04 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @mjlinks4201 Indeed. Let’s hope it’s over.
1300602405365714944 2020-09-01 09:12:32 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @drue_seefeld And we all know that pictures or videos don’t do it justice.
1300595633359859713 2020-09-01 08:45:37 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @TheMoralLibert1 That sounds like a good way to look at it. Thanks.
1300593751623172096 2020-09-01 08:38:08 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @dontcha_know1 That’s a lot of weed!
1300592818289860608 2020-09-01 08:34:26 +0800 <Iamahardhead> Does anybody wonder why the CDC has made the adjustment now?  It would have been just as easy to wait. Until after the election or the second wave. Why now?  I feel like something terrible is coming. Sorry.
1300590062200147968 2020-09-01 08:23:29 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @MikeWar22559297 Agreed.
1300587273940094978 2020-09-01 08:12:24 +0800 <Iamahardhead> @Studio3141 Indeed. A huge problem.
1300586916560207872 2020-09-01 08:10:59 +0800 <Iamahardhead> From all right-wing extremists. Otherwise known as taxpayers. We “appreciate” you and Polis being the commie bastards that you are.
