1343869272087547904 2020-12-29 18:39:37 +0800 <flynn_dec> Did Ferguson actually say that in an interview.
1343867928526135296 2020-12-29 18:34:16 +0800 <flynn_dec> The world and its mother knew what was coming with Allardyce and Klopp took 80 minutes to change it when it was too late. Shaquiri is another player that can change a game and not even considered and we then bring on Origi to continue lumping balls into the box.
1343671345712869377 2020-12-29 05:33:07 +0800 <flynn_dec> Like Shaq maybe.
1343654257019518976 2020-12-29 04:25:13 +0800 <flynn_dec> Now youâ€™re talking. ðŸ˜‚
1343606802995441666 2020-12-29 01:16:39 +0800 <flynn_dec> @JamesMilner The worry is that it also happened against Fulham, BHA and now WBA. Intensity is needed in every game but kop on is also needed. Constantly swinging balls into the box wasnâ€™t working &amp; we bring on Origi to swing balls into the box when clearly Shaq who can open a defence not used
1343546262944174082 2020-12-28 21:16:05 +0800 <flynn_dec> Canâ€™t make my mind up which is the funniest, MM clown face or Helen McEntees Pinocchio face.
1343263124229648385 2020-12-28 02:31:00 +0800 <flynn_dec> #LFC arrogance against these lower teams, Fulham, BHA and now WBA has cost us 6 points. Every Liverpool player today should donate their weeks wages to charity for that performance.
1343258777999601665 2020-12-28 02:13:43 +0800 <flynn_dec> #LFC the problem with Jones is his lack of concentration. Simple out ball was down the line but he goes across goal which is criminal b
1343215104666591232 2020-12-27 23:20:11 +0800 <flynn_dec> @ICCLtweet are you even interested in this.
1342966232723693575 2020-12-27 06:51:15 +0800 <flynn_dec> @Niall_Boylan is this what is coming down the tracks. Normalisation of this which is disgusting. Ryanair should rethink rapidly and withdraw this ad.  https://t.co/FSAqszgx2o
1341422149085622272 2020-12-23 00:35:37 +0800 <flynn_dec> Can you answer me one question which is, do you believe the virus is spreading based on cases which are the result of a failed PCR regime which is not fit for purpose.
1340989281666555907 2020-12-21 19:55:33 +0800 <flynn_dec> And the only ones who can afford this will be failed politicians with multiple pensions.
1340979508267147265 2020-12-21 19:16:43 +0800 <flynn_dec> Of course it will. Just like the 2 weeks to flatten the curve. FFS.
1339152006972387328 2020-12-16 18:14:53 +0800 <flynn_dec> Iâ€™m with you on that. Sure isnâ€™t every year a different vaccine for flu because it mutates. But they donâ€™t seem to care as it looks like their vaccine passport is their end game and people, like with the masks, will blindly follow.
1339148447925100544 2020-12-16 18:00:44 +0800 <flynn_dec> Sean this is the problem where theyâ€™ll do a Regina Doherty on it and say itâ€™s mandatory not compulsory. So if you want to do anything youâ€™ll have to show this.  https://t.co/D00bsDbC1M
1338472366561783812 2020-12-14 21:14:14 +0800 <flynn_dec> The #DÃ¡il will vote on #CETA #Tuesday Many TDs don't even know how dangerous CETA is. I've just emailed my TDs demanding they postpone the vote. Can you do the same?   https://t.co/Cek2Bv6xdO
1338446771584954370 2020-12-14 19:32:32 +0800 <flynn_dec> Hi Fergus is the confirmed SARS Cov 2 confirmed from the PCR test or through other means.
1337891997739331584 2020-12-13 06:48:03 +0800 <flynn_dec> Absolutely makes no sense. These kids are all still training so whatâ€™s the difference in letting them play. Just more nonsense.
1337726369111928832 2020-12-12 19:49:54 +0800 <flynn_dec> Fair play to Covid for only staying in the 5 steps to the podium. FFS.
1336393905479299073 2020-12-09 03:35:10 +0800 <flynn_dec> You clearly didnâ€™t read that WHO document so as I said earlier weâ€™ll just have to agree to disagree.
1336378641622704128 2020-12-09 02:34:31 +0800 <flynn_dec> They are accountable for their opinion because as medics they are going against the narrative and putting themselves out there. Also, the science hasnâ€™t changed only their opinion as this screen shot from WHO in June shows. And amazingly all within a week of each other.  https://t.co/zznuKrvKI9
1336350411150811138 2020-12-09 00:42:20 +0800 <flynn_dec> They are independent which means they are free to express that opinion. Hereâ€™s a link to cdc and screen grab if you donâ€™t want to read it fully. Also link to Holohan, Harris and Luke Oâ€™Neill stating masks ineffective.   https://t.co/5AEHe2qHGl    https://t.co/a7KV6Kavd8  https://t.co/RKGzCp2Bp1
1336331787211923460 2020-12-08 23:28:20 +0800 <flynn_dec> Just as yours is on masks. But at least Iâ€™ve tried to give you independent evidence from an independent professor working in the centre for evidence based medicine and a doctor with thousands of surgeries behind him. Show me the actual evidence for your opinion.
1336315400116727810 2020-12-08 22:23:13 +0800 <flynn_dec> Thatâ€™s right they are &amp; I asked him but like all kids he didnâ€™t want to be the only one amongst his mates to be seen not to wear it. But since he has as I said heâ€™s exhausted. Why??  Anyway I can go all day giving you evidence but I think itâ€™s best weâ€™ll agree to differ.
1336310923972259841 2020-12-08 22:05:26 +0800 <flynn_dec> He suffers from asthma and heâ€™s struggling to breathe which is clearly tiring him out. Anyway hereâ€™s another bit of reading that might inform you.  https://t.co/C8G9rDV7ru
1336274760486035456 2020-12-08 19:41:44 +0800 <flynn_dec> Must tell that to my kid who comes in from school every day so exhausted that he falls asleep. And while youâ€™re entitled to your opinion I think Iâ€™ll base mine on the many reports which are at best inconclusive and from independent experts like Professor Carl Heneghan  https://t.co/TafyzqvaeI
1336090336020606976 2020-12-08 07:28:54 +0800 <flynn_dec> They donâ€™t need evidence any more. Theyâ€™ve indoctrinated enough people now thatâ€™ll believe anything thatâ€™s thrown at them at this stage.
1335911604970459136 2020-12-07 19:38:41 +0800 <flynn_dec> On the one hand......clapping for nurses....but on the other!!! voting not to pay them.  Populism at its very best
1335572368715079682 2020-12-06 21:10:41 +0800 <flynn_dec> Iâ€™ll be glad to hear his doom sayer opinion when he goes onto the PUP payment scheme.
1335170589389107200 2020-12-05 18:34:09 +0800 <flynn_dec> Said the exact same thing when I saw that Clinton, Bush and Obama said theyâ€™d get the vaccine live on TV. Without your approach their gestures are meaningless.
1334966544049254401 2020-12-05 05:03:21 +0800 <flynn_dec> Anyone out there who goes into a panic every time Saint Tony and the NPHET doom sayers announces their case numbers daily need to take 10 minutes out of their day to listen to this and relax.  Dr. Vincent Carroll Nov 30 - 2020 from Zed on Vimeo  https://t.co/opH9Sf3wQC
1334579011561852928 2020-12-04 03:23:26 +0800 <flynn_dec> If there was no cases these continued to be paid civil servants would still give stark warnings.
1334499607993344000 2020-12-03 22:07:55 +0800 <flynn_dec> Because thatâ€™s exactly what he is. Though after selling his company a very rich one.
1334268555936870401 2020-12-03 06:49:47 +0800 <flynn_dec> Ah but that was just banter. Nothing to see here.
1334266487826210820 2020-12-03 06:41:34 +0800 <flynn_dec> Anything to detract from the vote not to pay student nurses and eagerly lapped up by the poodles in the media.
1334169828375076864 2020-12-03 00:17:29 +0800 <flynn_dec> I asked the question earlier when I saw your statement, are you just going to continue issuing statements or are you going to stop this destruction of your industry and peopleâ€™s livelihoods by taken a challenge to this dictate. Otherwise whatâ€™s the point of your spokesman on this
1334149787352961024 2020-12-02 22:57:51 +0800 <flynn_dec> So are they going to continue issuing statements whilst their businesses go down the toilet or are they going to do something about it.
1334144662140051458 2020-12-02 22:37:29 +0800 <flynn_dec> And were these same level of trials not done for the Swine Flu vaccine.
1334144059196190724 2020-12-02 22:35:05 +0800 <flynn_dec> I wonder how many of those will count towards Luke Oâ€™Neills stated 1st 100k test lab rats.
1333486110719287296 2020-12-01 03:00:38 +0800 <flynn_dec> How would you know if they were affected. Theyâ€™re all brain already anyway
1333484334272180228 2020-12-01 02:53:34 +0800 <flynn_dec> Will all the people who canâ€™t wait for the vaccine to come in so that theyâ€™ll get it ask themselves one question....would you buy anything without a warranty or not and if your answer is no then you really need to rethink your plans on a vaccine.
1333345761992564737 2020-11-30 17:42:56 +0800 <flynn_dec> Why do you think NPHET have so much influence over them. Theyâ€™re the buffer for when the shit hits the fan and theyâ€™ll say they were only following public health advice from them.
1333140986722181128 2020-11-30 04:09:14 +0800 <flynn_dec> Yes David youâ€™re right. But these were all fully tested vaccines over how many years. Not a vaccine that has been rushed through and which the likes of Luke Oâ€™Neill has stated will be tested on 100k people initially. Or guinea pigs Iâ€™d say. I think this is an irresponsible tweet.
1332659519571292160 2020-11-28 20:16:03 +0800 <flynn_dec> @ninnyd101 Business owners of Ireland take note.
1332642508019470337 2020-11-28 19:08:27 +0800 <flynn_dec> @PaulSommerville @lindawaters_t Why waste the opportunity to keep the fear mongering going when you have an audience of nearly a million. It suits RTÃ‰ narrative when government are pumping money into them.
1332608913624227849 2020-11-28 16:54:58 +0800 <flynn_dec> My kid was very worried about all this until one day weâ€™re driving and a car comes up next to us with the driver wearing a mask and a visor. He looks at me and breaks his hole laughing. It was our 1st laugh in months. But itâ€™s idiots like that that has kept this shit going.
1332606920591634432 2020-11-28 16:47:03 +0800 <flynn_dec> I hear your sentiments but the problem in Ireland is that elected representatives say stuff, like in your tweet, and then when Saint Tony issues his dictate youâ€™ll go into the Dail and vote for the same Marshall Law youâ€™re whinging about here.
1332605329746628612 2020-11-28 16:40:43 +0800 <flynn_dec> For them to do that weâ€™d actually need some political leadership in this country. I think over the last 9 months that has proved beyond us. The only thing theyâ€™ve achieved is scaring the living shit out of people. So much so theyâ€™ll acquiesce on anything at this stage.
1332407813465923585 2020-11-28 03:35:52 +0800 <flynn_dec> Wouldnâ€™t expect you to say anything else. This is farcical at this stage and on Xmas thereâ€™ll be hugs and handshakes in my house. Clowns.
1332235146360217602 2020-11-27 16:09:45 +0800 <flynn_dec> Martin has form in this. When Minister for Health he set up the HSE as a buffer between him and making decisions. That worked out well too.
1332233428931055616 2020-11-27 16:02:55 +0800 <flynn_dec> Why did you expect more from him in government. Heâ€™s been agreeing with #FG for a long time. This clown on one of the most important votes in our history didnâ€™t even bother reading the bill and completely agreed with that crook Noonan.  https://t.co/yLWY6C7gJb
1331958236073824262 2020-11-26 21:49:24 +0800 <flynn_dec> Has someone hacked your account. FFS.
1331923103044296705 2020-11-26 19:29:48 +0800 <flynn_dec> Also bear in mind the death rate over last 5 years.  2019 - 31,134 2018 - 31,116 2017 - 30,418 2016 - 30,667 2015 - 30,127 Based on deaths so far this year and the lag in registering deaths we are on course for about 30,000 this year. Whereâ€™s the pandemic.
1331742049327050754 2020-11-26 07:30:21 +0800 <flynn_dec> Put Holohan and the other pencil pushers in NPHET on PUP payments for a week and see how quickly their tune would change.
1331730228968894467 2020-11-26 06:43:23 +0800 <flynn_dec> Iâ€™m sure Sean you meant to say a bureaucrat whoâ€™s still getting paid his very healthy salary and will still qualify for his very healthy pension.
1331710996809920513 2020-11-26 05:26:58 +0800 <flynn_dec> #LFC why doesnâ€™t Klopp start with his best team and then make the substitutions when the game is won as opposed to giving the opposition hope by playing his 2nd/3rd string and then trying to rescue it. Itâ€™s so aggravating.
1331362619677167617 2020-11-25 06:22:38 +0800 <flynn_dec> I see the purveyors of doom Oâ€™Neill and Ryan on. Not that Iâ€™d be tuning in anyway to the government propaganda show but if there was any hope of me watching then certainly with those two on thereâ€™s no chance.
1330085262634995713 2020-11-21 17:46:53 +0800 <flynn_dec> @TwitterSupport lads you should change your handle because support is seriously lacking. Iâ€™ve just found out about â€˜Fleetsâ€™ which you rolled out. Well itâ€™s pity you didnâ€™t roll out how to turn it off. Itâ€™s seriously annoying and takes up so much space. Twitter should reconsider.
1329878816043438088 2020-11-21 04:06:32 +0800 <flynn_dec> @TwitterSupport any chance of answering this query lads.
1329704826750578690 2020-11-20 16:35:10 +0800 <flynn_dec> @TwitterSupport these photos have begun to appear on the top of my tweets. How do you remove them as they are very annoying.  https://t.co/QwhSS50jdr
1328615329480761344 2020-11-17 16:25:53 +0800 <flynn_dec> The lunatics have officially taken over the asylum.
1328406491167076352 2020-11-17 02:36:02 +0800 <flynn_dec> Well thanks for that. As if I was going to get a half arsed half tested vaccine anyway.
1328255277427253248 2020-11-16 16:35:10 +0800 <flynn_dec> The tide finally turning. Another article in the Examiner also asking questions. At long last. However, if they had bothered they couldâ€™ve reported on the Great Barrington Declaration ( https://t.co/DPuM2MYlS3) written by top epidemiologists saying the same things months ago.
1327631456995319809 2020-11-14 23:16:20 +0800 <flynn_dec> If you had scrutinised what NPHET have been doing for the last 8 months, instead of making celebrities out of them &amp; printing every word without question maybe we wouldnâ€™t be in this mess.

1327624855643172868 2020-11-14 22:50:06 +0800 <flynn_dec> Government need to shut these guys up and media really need to stop printing this shit.
1326256251622318080 2020-11-11 04:11:45 +0800 <flynn_dec> Can someone ask that weapon Humphries what the hell has that got to do with the leaking, by a Taoiseach, of confidential documents. Itâ€™s pathetic at this stage.
1325831247063617538 2020-11-10 00:02:56 +0800 <flynn_dec> 100% agree SeÃ¡n. Iâ€™m not anti vaccine but they need to come back to me in 20 years time when I know itâ€™s safe to take at which point I might still decide I donâ€™t want or need it. .

1325754014621954048 2020-11-09 18:56:03 +0800 <flynn_dec> For all the Biden cheerleaders out there, Gabriel Byrne hits the nail on the head with his analysis. If youâ€™re expecting anything different when you go back to the future good luck with that.
1325397415466332162 2020-11-08 19:19:03 +0800 <flynn_dec> In fairness I was in a Centra Store yesterday and they had 2 signs on their entrance asking people to be mindful of people without masks as they might have a medical condition  which precludes them from wearing one.
1325394718096809984 2020-11-08 19:08:20 +0800 <flynn_dec> You mean this Gerry Killeen. Jesus.  https://t.co/nmpCldnWEx
1325042772278206464 2020-11-07 19:49:49 +0800 <flynn_dec> No. Thatâ€™s just #FG policy. Theyâ€™ll love him for that.
1325030158055714817 2020-11-07 18:59:42 +0800 <flynn_dec> With you on that. If Varadkar dumped then #FG will have sweeter than thou Coveney in charge &amp; the absolute saps in this country who think heâ€™s less of a liar than Varadkar will be delighted. Bear in mind that Coveney lied to the Appollo House organisers to get them out at Xmas
1325010919332704260 2020-11-07 17:43:15 +0800 <flynn_dec> No Peadar. Make all TDs and public servants involved in making these decisions only get PUP payments and I can guarantee you this will be over before the debate is even had.
1325010140433698817 2020-11-07 17:40:09 +0800 <flynn_dec> The media are being well paid to continually, on loop, broadcast their annoying ads. They were on their knees before this so itâ€™s in their interests to keep quiet and let NPHET and the other celebrity doctors keep the lies going.
1324019453361872898 2020-11-05 00:03:31 +0800 <flynn_dec> Obviously not a supporter of the democratic process and peopleâ€™s right to choose who they vote for. The appalling atrociousness is actually your tweet.
1323688900242608128 2020-11-04 02:10:01 +0800 <flynn_dec> @rtenews Paul Cunningham just canâ€™t seem to get it into his head the Varadkar is Tanaiste not Taoiseach. Embarrassed for him.
1323571016531124225 2020-11-03 18:21:35 +0800 <flynn_dec> Lads did you use the same company to make this as you did to make those embarrassing soapbox videos of Paschal Donohoe talking to absolutely no one during #GE20.
1323333161716273152 2020-11-03 02:36:26 +0800 <flynn_dec> Anything to confuse and keep the fear going.
1323299043611738115 2020-11-03 00:20:52 +0800 <flynn_dec> That terminology has been changing for a good while now. They went from deaths/cases to cases/deaths. Also, Covid-19 to coronavirus as thatâ€™s a catch all. In England theyâ€™re using Covid related if you test positive and die within 28 days of that positive test.
1323039275630383110 2020-11-02 07:08:38 +0800 <flynn_dec> Iâ€™m sure he could advise him on how to put his resignation letter together.
1323023924825853954 2020-11-02 06:07:38 +0800 <flynn_dec> Said it many times that they are only rotten because people continue to vote the same scammers back in time and time again. Lowry being a case in point.
1323023358745784321 2020-11-02 06:05:23 +0800 <flynn_dec> It actually wouldâ€™ve been better if he had actually said nothing because what he did say is just nonsense.
1323020795547889665 2020-11-02 05:55:12 +0800 <flynn_dec> A mistake is when you inadvertently hit send on your email not when you deliberately send a confidential document over to a rival group who just happens to be your buddy. Kop on Cowen. Barry Cowen says Varadkar 'entitled' to make a mistake over GP contract  https://t.co/gqX1axzw1R
1322882074580258818 2020-11-01 20:43:59 +0800 <flynn_dec> What Iâ€™m surprised about is that from all accounts this was a whistleblower and the fawning media, in order to keep their vile system going, havenâ€™t found him and thrown him under the bus yet.
1322881323426611200 2020-11-01 20:41:00 +0800 <flynn_dec> Another spin merchant doctor in politics. Oh dear!!
1322867479497101312 2020-11-01 19:45:59 +0800 <flynn_dec> Indeed.
1322865575153049600 2020-11-01 19:38:25 +0800 <flynn_dec> Yes the nod and wink culture of vested interests, politicians, big business and the legal profession has destroyed many and for the most part championed by a compliant media and for some the only crime they see in this is that Varadkar got caught.
1322856398330515461 2020-11-01 19:01:57 +0800 <flynn_dec> #LeoGate Isnâ€™t Oâ€™Tuathaill one of those celebrity doctors that media organisations love to roll out to promote the 1 sided media narrative on Covid. Whoâ€™d have thought that he was in Leoâ€™s inner sanctum and shared his views on people less privileged than himself.
1321957597445005313 2020-10-30 07:30:26 +0800 <flynn_dec> The feckin eejits are the ones that continue to vote for him.

1321821107079532547 2020-10-29 22:28:04 +0800 <flynn_dec> Havenâ€™t watched any political programme for months as Iâ€™m sick of the same one side narrative. But will tune in tonight because of your alternative views. Keep up the good work.
1320705255651315714 2020-10-26 20:34:05 +0800 <flynn_dec> However if your one of our mates who uses loopholes to get around paying their fair share of taxes which will cause more damage by depriving the exchequer of much needed taxes for services then work away.

1320081817328885763 2020-10-25 03:16:45 +0800 <flynn_dec> #LIVSHU VAR continues to prove that itâ€™s not fit for purpose. That wasnâ€™t even a free kick never mind a penalty. Itâ€™s actually killing football.
1320050846260920325 2020-10-25 01:13:41 +0800 <flynn_dec> Itâ€™s as obvious as the nose on your face. But how many will fall for the bullshit and then moan about selfish xmas revellers when testing is ramped up again after xmas which will lead to the inevitable next lockdown.
1319688212076441600 2020-10-24 01:12:43 +0800 <flynn_dec> Finally RTÃ‰ facilitates a proper debate on Covid. About bloody time.  Amazing Debate on Lockdown Ideology versus Scientific Approach - Unmissable!! - YouTube  https://t.co/OdEFr0ALJk
1319321271562371077 2020-10-23 00:54:37 +0800 <flynn_dec> Deputy McNamara I congratulate you on your stance re: lockdown &amp; the ramming through of disproportionate measures without any debate. Itâ€™s sickening whatâ€™s happening in our so called democracy &amp;itâ€™s only people like yourself that has the courage it seems to question the narrative
1319319034358321152 2020-10-23 00:45:44 +0800 <flynn_dec> Just like to congratulate anyone that voted for the Green Tax and Injustice Party.
1319211692891512832 2020-10-22 17:39:12 +0800 <flynn_dec> Babs itâ€™s even more bonkers than that as sporting and fitness is a catch all. So in effect there could be none in gyms. They are just spoofing at this stage.
1319207918923845632 2020-10-22 17:24:12 +0800 <flynn_dec> @comreg I purchased WiFi boosters online in June, they arrived at end of August &amp; were impounded by ComReg. Iâ€™ve opened a case with you on 08/09/20 &amp; interacted through email &amp; web chat &amp; no contact on my case as yet. I want a refund &amp; have limited time to claim can you escalate
1319019793769504769 2020-10-22 04:56:39 +0800 <flynn_dec> Have been for a long time and now that the money is flowing in from the public coffers why would they change now.
1318834336133767168 2020-10-21 16:39:43 +0800 <flynn_dec> Said it ages ago particularly around media. They were dead on their feet and now they have a continual cash cow from Covid. Why would they change their narrative anytime soon when they are being kept afloat.
1318826734280650752 2020-10-21 16:09:30 +0800 <flynn_dec> They could be from April for all we know. Have journalists decided at this point just not to ask questions.
1318477269292244994 2020-10-20 17:00:51 +0800 <flynn_dec> Absolutely agree with what you said. However the only way to stop this madness is to have proper debate. Until you get medical people on your show with alternative views &amp;you the media start seriously questioning NPHET and politicians &amp; stop this celebrity culture nothing changes
1318384935594610693 2020-10-20 10:53:57 +0800 <flynn_dec> Hi Ivor just seen this and itâ€™s incredible. Varadkar is actually arguing against his own governments decision by giving every reason why there should be no lockdown. Why would he be bounced into supporting something that clearly he knows is a load of bollox.
1318291957265870848 2020-10-20 04:44:29 +0800 <flynn_dec> Aileen NPHET are like ageing pop stars who donâ€™t know when to leave the stage &amp;government not strong enough to tell them to get stuffed. As weâ€™re all in this together no doubt everyone in NPHET will be going on PUP payments by the end of the week. If they did thereâ€™d be no level5

1317457109294944256 2020-10-17 21:27:06 +0800 <flynn_dec> #VAR Itâ€™s a joke at this stage.
1317434938732519424 2020-10-17 19:59:00 +0800 <flynn_dec> Agree but with Wijnaldum brought on.
1317190064296906753 2020-10-17 03:45:58 +0800 <flynn_dec> 100% right. I actually think I have a saying like that in my bio.
1317179800377790464 2020-10-17 03:05:11 +0800 <flynn_dec> Think about a bad thing.   Imagine you got diagnosed with cancer today.   Imagine you were told it was curable.  Youâ€™re in for a tough ride but youâ€™ll be ok.  Now imagine youâ€™re told you wonâ€™t get any treatment for that curable cancer because of Covid   Thatâ€™s the tragedy in this
1317178745837572098 2020-10-17 03:00:59 +0800 <flynn_dec> Exactly. But youâ€™ll probably get called far right for having that conscience.
1317078841152733186 2020-10-16 20:24:00 +0800 <flynn_dec> Itâ€™s ok to follow WHO when it suits their narrative but now that WHO have categorically stated that lockdowns donâ€™t work and hammer the poorest in society they ignore that. Guess whoâ€™ll continue to get paid and still have their pensions.
1317041371837063168 2020-10-16 17:55:07 +0800 <flynn_dec> This sensationalism has to stop. This headline this morning but the real headline is to the right of that which will cause infinitely more deaths than C19. Notice number of ICU available beds has increased since last week. Madness.  https://t.co/NQndP2Z7DV
1317011632699154432 2020-10-16 15:56:56 +0800 <flynn_dec> Mick this should be what you highlighted because more people will die because of this than the sensational headline you highlight.  https://t.co/KQnLQK88H7
1316786401707462658 2020-10-16 01:01:57 +0800 <flynn_dec> Very simple answer. Media organisations were on the floor and struggling to survive. Now government are giving them wads of cash to carry all their communications. Why would they give that up when itâ€™s keeping them afloat.
1316500471457165312 2020-10-15 06:05:46 +0800 <flynn_dec> WHO has said lockdowns donâ€™t work so they had to come up with new buzzwords instead of saying lockdown.
1316499182182637569 2020-10-15 06:00:39 +0800 <flynn_dec> The only people they polled was NPHET.

1315997999475064833 2020-10-13 20:49:07 +0800 <flynn_dec> Will there be a hospitality sector by the time theyâ€™re finished.
1315997415120556032 2020-10-13 20:46:48 +0800 <flynn_dec> 100%
1315697134684037120 2020-10-13 00:53:36 +0800 <flynn_dec> Couldnâ€™t agree more. Every day it takes all my energy to sign on and do the job. However, Iâ€™m lucky as at least I have a job. I can only imagine the despair of the people whoâ€™s jobs have been destroyed and for what.
1315279222894661634 2020-10-11 21:12:58 +0800 <flynn_dec> RTÃ‰ are getting paid massively by keeping this going. Just like all other media outlets. As always follow the money.
1315212523793199104 2020-10-11 16:47:55 +0800 <flynn_dec> Like about 90% of the PCR positive tests.
1314709708364800001 2020-10-10 07:29:55 +0800 <flynn_dec> Itâ€™s time for NPHET to step back from this on a daily basis. All they do is scare the life out of people particularly as the PCR test is not fit for purpose and the amount of false positives is not taken into account.
1314337323606302722 2020-10-09 06:50:11 +0800 <flynn_dec> The problem is the threat of them being struck off which means theyâ€™ve no income. This man has integrity but the people damning him from the medical council donâ€™t.
1314326191164268550 2020-10-09 06:05:57 +0800 <flynn_dec> Maybe someone might like to bring that to the attention of NPHET. Though the BMJ will probably be classified as far right now.   https://t.co/0B7QaEZHHO
1313940627151876096 2020-10-08 04:33:52 +0800 <flynn_dec> Media have skin in the game. They were struggling financially and all of a sudden theyâ€™re handed a cash cow in advertising. Like everything else in Ireland, follow the money.
1313903797362667521 2020-10-08 02:07:31 +0800 <flynn_dec> This is a parody at this stage.
1313822952060846080 2020-10-07 20:46:16 +0800 <flynn_dec> She was admitted specifically to get the MRI but was on a chair for 12 hours and then a trolley for several more hours whilst they were trying to confirm if the machines were going to be fixed. She asked for a bed but told several wards were closed. Thatâ€™s why thereâ€™s no capacity
1313813898320019456 2020-10-07 20:10:17 +0800 <flynn_dec> At least sheâ€™s gotten her CT, youâ€™re still waiting. But hopefully you get there and all will be ok. But they keep going on about capacity but if wards are closed how can there be capacity.
1313787063641178112 2020-10-07 18:23:39 +0800 <flynn_dec> Jean my wife same earlier this week except she got CT scan which showed something, they needed an MRI for extra checking &amp;both machines not working. This in the top head hosp in Dublin. Appointment later this week elsewhere. Also wards closed which left her on chair for 12 hours
1313783727898718209 2020-10-07 18:10:24 +0800 <flynn_dec> Genuine question Alan. Why is someone who has a diverse view classed as far right. Have we got to the stage where debate is no longer allowed.
1313758055964774406 2020-10-07 16:28:23 +0800 <flynn_dec> That is a bullshit poll and was clearly done between every media outlet who are more than happy to sensationalise daily as the more this goes on the more money they get.
1313622582126620672 2020-10-07 07:30:04 +0800 <flynn_dec> Isnâ€™t that what governing is all about. You make choices and sometimes itâ€™s right and sometimes itâ€™s wrong but at least make bloody decisions and stop hiding behind the advice all the time.
1313453124766629894 2020-10-06 20:16:42 +0800 <flynn_dec> Itâ€™s amazing how people are hanging on every word of the HSE, the same people that have had more malpractice law suits against them than any organisation in the country. And people trusting them on this.
1313451866085363714 2020-10-06 20:11:42 +0800 <flynn_dec> Well be getting Tommy Gorman doing an exclusive next.
1312884056988749824 2020-10-05 06:35:26 +0800 <flynn_dec> Itâ€™s group think with them. No alternative opinions allowed and if there is itâ€™s nullified. Ask Dr Martin Feeley.
1312860298794143744 2020-10-05 05:01:01 +0800 <flynn_dec> Absolutely correct by Souness. Against Leeds it was the same no press high up and players just landing the ball over the top. Either fix that or drop off.
1312846112974307331 2020-10-05 04:04:39 +0800 <flynn_dec> #LFC Sky need to get Roy Keane to interview Klopp about the sloppy defending and see will he attack him like when he suggested it the last time he was on.
1312844111809048577 2020-10-05 03:56:42 +0800 <flynn_dec> #LFC when Roy Keane stated that Liverpool were sloppy at the back a couple of weeks ago and Klopp dismissed him maybe he shouldâ€™ve listened. This result has been coming.
1312830691357450248 2020-10-05 03:03:22 +0800 <flynn_dec> Iâ€™m amazed itâ€™s taken so long for teams to break it down. You canâ€™t defend that high up the pitch and continually expect to get away with it.
1312370715002318848 2020-10-03 20:35:35 +0800 <flynn_dec>  https://t.co/rTE3lJ4Yea
1311797205645303810 2020-10-02 06:36:40 +0800 <flynn_dec> Itâ€™s a pity a few more of you donâ€™t show the same frustration.
1311695251283869697 2020-10-01 23:51:32 +0800 <flynn_dec> Typical Varadkar seeing the narrative and jumping on the bandwagon as he did in 8th amendment and gay marriage and ensuring heâ€™s covering his ass now.
1311693592121966596 2020-10-01 23:44:57 +0800 <flynn_dec> ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
1311657179255054337 2020-10-01 21:20:15 +0800 <flynn_dec> It suits the media to continue the hysteria. They were on their knees with government looking at ways to fund them. Every 2nd ad on radio/TV now is Covid. Follow the money.
1311637741424316420 2020-10-01 20:03:01 +0800 <flynn_dec> Or how many knew they had it.
1311637388398133250 2020-10-01 20:01:37 +0800 <flynn_dec> When it suits them.
1311389119315169283 2020-10-01 03:35:05 +0800 <flynn_dec> The only surprising thing was that RTÃ‰ allowed an alternative view. Only took them 6 months.
1310986054778880001 2020-09-30 00:53:27 +0800 <flynn_dec> Sipo legislation to be reviewed following Michael Dâ€™Arcy case, Taoiseach tells DÃ¡il  Irelandâ€™s answer to everything dodgy.   A review, a report, a review of the report, a report of the review of the report and when everyoneâ€™s forgotten put it on the shelf.  https://t.co/9eOad2wcJY
1310962176014856192 2020-09-29 23:18:33 +0800 <flynn_dec> Have a look at the way @WhistleIRL slices and dices him in that meeting proving heâ€™s an idiot. But youâ€™re right heâ€™s a useful idiot for the vested interests and his cohorts.
1310591092035858438 2020-09-28 22:44:00 +0800 <flynn_dec> So @WhistleIRL showed up Dâ€™Arcy as the fool that he was in a finance committee hearing and Dâ€™Arcy is the one to walk into a lobbying job while @WhistleIRL is unemployed for doing the right thing. Classic case of how Ireland works.
1309845539836616705 2020-09-26 21:21:27 +0800 <flynn_dec> Young teenagers are being forced to wear masks in school for 6+ hours a day. If they donâ€™t theyâ€™re sent home. So what are they supposed to do. How many would wear them if they werenâ€™t being forced.
1309173165516521473 2020-09-25 00:49:40 +0800 <flynn_dec> And the fear continues.
1309124254437388292 2020-09-24 21:35:19 +0800 <flynn_dec> Your right itâ€™s BS. Hereâ€™s an open letter from Belgium doctors which explains how it works.  https://t.co/tpF7E0pS2O
1309120205457686532 2020-09-24 21:19:13 +0800 <flynn_dec> Sure hereâ€™s Varadkar admitting it himself.  https://t.co/Yno9Lmph1p
1308692848154472450 2020-09-23 17:01:03 +0800 <flynn_dec> This is an open letter from Belgium doctors on the disproportionate steps taken to control this.   https://t.co/tpF7E0pS2O
1307655114178596865 2020-09-20 20:17:28 +0800 <flynn_dec> The government need to limit their socialisation with NPHET and start governing.
1307652538938908672 2020-09-20 20:07:14 +0800 <flynn_dec> Peter even the mediaâ€™s go to and clearly only expert Luke Oâ€™Neill has admitted the test is not set correctly.
1307311532288749570 2020-09-19 21:32:12 +0800 <flynn_dec> More scaremongering from Government. Is there no end to it.
1307282505146544128 2020-09-19 19:36:52 +0800 <flynn_dec> Whether you agree with her or not itâ€™s about time that we got away from the media group think and had a questioning media who will hold the people making decisions for the public held firmly to account. Weâ€™re where we are because this hasnâ€™t been happening.
1307257001743921152 2020-09-19 17:55:31 +0800 <flynn_dec> Weâ€™ve been told that for 7 mths now. Itâ€™s illogical at this stage. Itâ€™s been known now for months that the PCR test is not fit for purpose &amp;admitted even by the go to expert Luke Oâ€™Neill. So unless thatâ€™s addressed the false positives will shape the narrative which is disgraceful
1307070935699263488 2020-09-19 05:36:09 +0800 <flynn_dec> Personal or political codology doesnâ€™t matter the results are still the same.
1307060118849236994 2020-09-19 04:53:10 +0800 <flynn_dec> Same liar, same policies but a bit less spin.
1307016584381313030 2020-09-19 02:00:11 +0800 <flynn_dec> Until that question is answered all the figures they release are questionable. Why do the media though not hold them to account for this.
1306660608817979392 2020-09-18 02:25:40 +0800 <flynn_dec> Why indeed.
1306647121504985088 2020-09-18 01:32:04 +0800 <flynn_dec> The reason why Dâ€™Arcy sat on it for 3 years is because heâ€™s an idiot and didnâ€™t know what he was talking about. Oh and it was the default position of #FG to let cartels do what they wanted
1306236674582642688 2020-09-16 22:21:06 +0800 <flynn_dec> @ciarakellydoc yesterday you called for proper debate on #Covid between doctors/scientists and I fully agreed with you. However I said they didnâ€™t want any debates which went against the narrative. Today theyâ€™ve proved it.  https://t.co/InoRQXra1g
1305861380097089537 2020-09-15 21:29:49 +0800 <flynn_dec> Whilst telling me I have mental issues cos I look objectively at things and try do research on whatâ€™s been said. Seriously.
1305851395011162112 2020-09-15 20:50:08 +0800 <flynn_dec> Absolutely agree with you about scientists/doctors debating except any scientific/doctor with an opposing view arenâ€™t invited on to any program to debate the issues. Thereâ€™s the problem. Government even ignored a professor they asked for their input. Enough to said.  https://t.co/Rl2dVyxTPT
1305844712868327424 2020-09-15 20:23:35 +0800 <flynn_dec> Exactly and people so mired in this and forgetting that life must go on and no one seems to be calling this out and when you do you get jumped on. Have people lost their senses.
1305836251996721158 2020-09-15 19:49:58 +0800 <flynn_dec> They wonâ€™t be happy until they crash the place completely. They are ignoring everything else and waiting lists for everything are skyrocketing as a result. Over 30 suicides in August and nothing done to arrest that. But hey letâ€™s continue focusing on Covid with little fatalities
1305832568739291136 2020-09-15 19:35:20 +0800 <flynn_dec> Is that Martin, Varadkar, Ryan and Donnelly.
1305827678910590980 2020-09-15 19:15:54 +0800 <flynn_dec> Youâ€™re right people with different opinions shouldnâ€™t be tarred with the same brush, hence why people who might question the compulsory wearing of masks and a lot of whatâ€™s being done are not c***ts
1305821063532687360 2020-09-15 18:49:37 +0800 <flynn_dec> If you continually support government making statements in the media, not scrutinising anything they come out with in the Dail and holding them to account and not getting society and the economy back to normality youâ€™ll be on continual protests going forward.
1305807910837137408 2020-09-15 17:57:21 +0800 <flynn_dec> @NewstalkFM @ciarakellydoc @BreakfastNT Never thought Iâ€™d agree with Ciara Kelly but sheâ€™s right. This â€˜Living with Covidâ€™ so called plan announced through the media and no debate whatsoever in the Dail. â€˜Living with Covidâ€™ should be called â€˜how to terminally crash the economy and societyâ€™ because thatâ€™s whatâ€™ll do.
1305790881820291074 2020-09-15 16:49:41 +0800 <flynn_dec> @1GaryGannon Hi Gary just to let you know my wife phoned &amp; then emailed Beaumont with instructions to opt out of this &amp; all future requests without her prior consent. Theyâ€™ve responded but only specifically about 1 research piece. Maybe make people aware they need to ensure full opt out
1305550287927681026 2020-09-15 00:53:39 +0800 <flynn_dec> So an independent professor brought in by government questions the use of masks and was ignored by same government who brought him in. Is he a far right agitator or his advice didnâ€™t suit the narrative or is it only Dr Glynn you listen to.  https://t.co/12iTWNSHAq
1305537802218676224 2020-09-15 00:04:02 +0800 <flynn_dec> Thatâ€™s nonsense. In UK thatâ€™d equate to 1.7m deaths. At the moment thereâ€™s only been 371k cases. In Sweden no lockdowns and theyâ€™ve 5846 deaths which is about .06% of population.
1305174465614094337 2020-09-14 00:00:16 +0800 <flynn_dec> Didnâ€™t matter who was in there from #FG, itâ€™s their policy and no one was changing that narrative.
1305158679185031168 2020-09-13 22:57:32 +0800 <flynn_dec> But lying to people about sorting out the homeless crisis, now thatâ€™s another thing.
1305073808844484608 2020-09-13 17:20:17 +0800 <flynn_dec> This is what is happening to people. Me included. The constant barrage of bad news, no end in sight of restrictions and the feeling of being not in control of my own destiny has drained me. Fortunately Iâ€™m strong but maybe others arenâ€™t which will lead to so many suicides.
1304825553002934274 2020-09-13 00:53:48 +0800 <flynn_dec> #LFC Gomez proving why we need a central defender. All over the place.
1304776845724979200 2020-09-12 21:40:16 +0800 <flynn_dec> â€˜Draconianâ€™ restrictions around Covid-19 condemned by HSE doctor  https://t.co/4gfNc7eJUW
1304732476028452864 2020-09-12 18:43:57 +0800 <flynn_dec> @Independent_ie If they continue with this nonsense pubs will be closed permanently.
1303793158237683720 2020-09-10 04:31:26 +0800 <flynn_dec> Doesnâ€™t it just show how useless Donnelly is when Kelly, who was going to vote no confidence in Harris, now has more confidence in him than Donnelly.
1303304277440503813 2020-09-08 20:08:48 +0800 <flynn_dec> When I suggested that I was called illogical. Putting a mask on healthy people canâ€™t be good. My boy back in school struggling to breath as heâ€™s asthma but told to wear or else go home. Heâ€™s enough stress in leaving cert final year without this.
1303014736272003073 2020-09-08 00:58:16 +0800 <flynn_dec> Just more bolloxology.
1302390989735309313 2020-09-06 07:39:43 +0800 <flynn_dec> Or maybe just politics  https://t.co/JGPzZYYjWk
1302357473190465536 2020-09-06 05:26:32 +0800 <flynn_dec> That was the reasons given by Luke Oâ€™Neill, Fauci and Tony Holohan all along, so what changed in June.
1302306035370266625 2020-09-06 02:02:09 +0800 <flynn_dec> No masks in the middle of this in March/April and curve flattened. Introduce mandatory masks and numbers start increasing. Is that the reason?
1302285057831378946 2020-09-06 00:38:47 +0800 <flynn_dec> Youâ€™re right. My kid is in leaving cert final year, has asthma &amp; dyspraxia but decided to go along with it as itâ€™s his leaving cert. Told me he had to pull it down as he was struggling. How can they concentrate, particularly in this important year whilst subjected to this.
1302217435349688320 2020-09-05 20:10:05 +0800 <flynn_dec> Would that be a whole 0.03%.
1302212161968668672 2020-09-05 19:49:08 +0800 <flynn_dec> Or ask Luke Oâ€™Neill, Fauci and Tony Holohan what changed in the science from March to June whereby they all changed their minds on mask wearing or do you just follow the money.
1301990856199753730 2020-09-05 05:09:44 +0800 <flynn_dec> Sure isnâ€™t he seeing a doctor.
1301983864135524354 2020-09-05 04:41:57 +0800 <flynn_dec> The greens policies extend to only 2 things...taxes and threats.
1301982609916997637 2020-09-05 04:36:58 +0800 <flynn_dec> In this coalition of chaos is it Martin or Varadkar whoâ€™s right because it canâ€™t be both of them.  https://t.co/EkZVd5yEf8
1301930582771986432 2020-09-05 01:10:14 +0800 <flynn_dec> Proving that heâ€™s as dumb as Donnelly.
1301927989555453952 2020-09-05 00:59:56 +0800 <flynn_dec> You can buy an education but not brains.
1301927193698803712 2020-09-05 00:56:46 +0800 <flynn_dec> Yes myself and Mattie have it all booked. ðŸ˜‚
1301874988107149312 2020-09-04 21:29:19 +0800 <flynn_dec> I know weâ€™re in surreal times when Iâ€™m agreeing with Mattie McGrath and with every utterance from this chaotic government it just goes to prove it.
1301845104592908288 2020-09-04 19:30:34 +0800 <flynn_dec> Simon Harris.
1301818049201426433 2020-09-04 17:43:04 +0800 <flynn_dec> The more stupid decisions made by this government and NPHET just give them more cover to ignore all the issues that was there before this government and pushes out when theyâ€™re going to have to address all those issues. We are been taken for mugs and continue to accept it.
1301813062996037634 2020-09-04 17:23:15 +0800 <flynn_dec> Only problem is thereâ€™ll be a waiting list of 2 years to have the X-Ray. Iâ€™d say the reason they are stupid is deliberate so that when they go in they wonâ€™t have a clue how to fix the broken system and HSE will just tell them to throw more money at it and employ more managers.
1301622752898678784 2020-09-04 04:47:01 +0800 <flynn_dec> I didnâ€™t think it was possible for anyone to make Simon Harris look like a genius but Donnelly is going a long way to proving it.
1301528777642717184 2020-09-03 22:33:36 +0800 <flynn_dec> The longer they keep the fear mongering going on Covid the longer they have to ignore these issues.
1300787445827543041 2020-09-01 21:27:49 +0800 <flynn_dec> So far out of his depth that he has to start threatening people now. This coalition of chaos is getting worse by the day.
1300775613129789443 2020-09-01 20:40:48 +0800 <flynn_dec> Time to take stock as even WHO are coming around to the conclusion that there was a better way.  https://t.co/JYiPckpEjK
