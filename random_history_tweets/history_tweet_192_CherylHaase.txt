1343598229489811456 2020-12-29 00:42:35 +0800 <CherylHaase> @JeannieNguyenTV @krqe In Judaism, human life takes precedence over all else. Our congregation continues to have services via Zoom, even during our high holidays.  Why? Because losing even one life would not be worth it. I think these pastors who are encouraging packed churches are shameful.

1328703039817936896 2020-11-17 22:14:25 +0800 <CherylHaase> This election again proved gun violence prevention is no longer the third rail of American politics. Now is a great time to join volunteers like me and @LorianKos in the movement to end gun violence! Text READY to 644-33 and start volunteering with @MomsDemand today!  https://t.co/KH137El6o6
1328365927990132737 2020-11-16 23:54:51 +0800 <CherylHaase> @gwschmedes Yeah, those refrigerator trucks being used as morgues down in Las Cruces and El Paso because of all the dead are NOT an exaggeration.  You are an embarrassment to your profession.
1328340182626574336 2020-11-16 22:12:33 +0800 <CherylHaase> @realDonaldTrump Please. We're all begging you to shut the fuck up.
1328339907006275584 2020-11-16 22:11:27 +0800 <CherylHaase> @realDonaldTrump Get over it! You crying baby. You're hijacking our democracy.
1327990226162118657 2020-11-15 23:01:57 +0800 <CherylHaase> What did Serb Hall think would happen with a bunch of MAGA Covidiots? This wasn't a Friday fish fry.
1327805565712535552 2020-11-15 10:48:10 +0800 <CherylHaase> @miltsdad Thanks for the info. We love The Crown! Although it takes a minute to get used to each batch of new actors.

1327566944829009921 2020-11-14 18:59:59 +0800 <CherylHaase> @shannonrwatts This makes me so sad. This poor kid's last minutes knowing his own mother is shooting him.
1327557361356029955 2020-11-14 18:21:54 +0800 <CherylHaase> @gwschmedes @GovMLG This isn't true. I don't understand why you would lie.

1327263441019564032 2020-11-13 22:53:58 +0800 <CherylHaase> @mcuban I think a Democratic Senate will help those in need--especially with healthcare during a pandemic.
1327262443374985217 2020-11-13 22:50:00 +0800 <CherylHaase> @Pearce4NM @BrianEgolf But did Yvette Herrell win? I thought you were questioning the validity of the election.
1327261570703888385 2020-11-13 22:46:32 +0800 <CherylHaase> @katiestone As a Wisconsinite I can tell you that's a "Wienermobile." üòÑ

1326634836497362944 2020-11-12 05:16:07 +0800 <CherylHaase> @Pearce4NM @speakeregolf Cry me a river. Your Republican comrades love to gerrymander.  I used to live in a district in Austin, TX that was heavily Democratic, but it had been so gerrymandered that we had a Republican congressman.
1326547455538688004 2020-11-11 23:28:54 +0800 <CherylHaase> Sending congratulations on victory in his election to #nmleg to my friend @nm_pope and a #HappyVeteransDay2020. Thank you for your service. Thank you also for being a @MomsDemand #GunSenseCandidate.  https://t.co/5wwduaQHQ3
1326281914643197952 2020-11-11 05:53:44 +0800 <CherylHaase> @NewMexicoGOP @Yvette4congress Pretty sure that race is invalid since the whole election is invalid according to you and your dear leader Trump.
1326260867135057922 2020-11-11 04:30:06 +0800 <CherylHaase> @NewMexicoGOP @norasack @GovMLG Why are you being willfully ignorant and endangering New Mexicans with your misinformation?
1326177723618766849 2020-11-10 22:59:43 +0800 <CherylHaase> @NewMexicoGOP Then I guess all the Republicans who won on the exact same ballots are illegitimate as well.
1325962444246642688 2020-11-10 08:44:16 +0800 <CherylHaase> @Walton_Emily Don't forget your potager garden and delicious desserts.

1325561199073714176 2020-11-09 06:09:52 +0800 <CherylHaase> @AriFleischer Ok. Then don't heal. You lost though.
1325560264373096448 2020-11-09 06:06:09 +0800 <CherylHaase> @Pearce4NM Maybe talk to your colleagues in Texas and Wisconsin.  They have gerrymandered districts in  a terrible way. I know because I lived both places. In fact, maybe Speaker Egolf should take a lesson from them.
1325313949852602369 2020-11-08 13:47:23 +0800 <CherylHaase> Because the President is a fucking toddler.

1311133748793090049 2020-09-30 10:40:20 +0800 <CherylHaase> Trump would not agree to encourage his supporters NOT to riot. It's disgusting and frightening. #PresidentialDebate

1306073853374816257 2020-09-16 11:34:06 +0800 <CherylHaase> @abbeyclements So many of my students and say that one of their goals is to make new friends, but that they don't have any friends. It's tough to make friends with online  learning. That makes me really sad.

The Republicans, who are in the pocket of the corrupt NRA don't care about New Mexicans' safety.

1304483632036245506 2020-09-12 02:15:08 +0800 <CherylHaase> @NewMexicoGOP Are you kidding me? He and his family are literally raking in the bucks from this presidency. The foreign delegations who want to kiss his ass stay at his properties. He goes on regular weekend getaways to his properties, and taxpayers like me foot the millions he charges.
