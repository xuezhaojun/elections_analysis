I couldn't afford 3 times more for Obamacare but thankfully I did find an affordable non-Obamacare insurance.  It's more than my original insurance, and doesn't cover as much, but Thank God it isn't Obamacare.

Climate has been changing since the beginning of all things and will continue to do so until the end of all things.  You cannot expect a planet with a molten liquid core not to be a volatile place from time to time.
