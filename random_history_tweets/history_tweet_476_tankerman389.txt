Wayyyy too many intangibles in a days work driving a truck. Plus. Think about this. Is it gonna load of unload itself. Who gives directions on dumping at a construction site? Who controls em all?

Things you don’t know about driving a truck can only be learned by doing it. Not from some damn bureaucrat that think they know more. And for your info, the majority of truckers aren’t white.

1316911177511960578 2020-10-16 09:17:46 +0800 <tankerman389> @1MichiganVoter @kayleighmcenany @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @ABC Joe is answering scripted questions. No doubt
1316909660348338178 2020-10-16 09:11:44 +0800 <tankerman389> @SexCounseling No. Audience seems to have scripted questions which naturally Joe immediately answers. Appears staged to me. IMO

1314253640367058945 2020-10-09 01:17:40 +0800 <tankerman389> @TomFitton Her butt is the one that needs to be removed. She’s went off the deep end
1314205663925432321 2020-10-08 22:07:01 +0800 <tankerman389> I can’t help but wonder if Biden sniffed Harris before he picked her for VP. Maybe that’s the difference between her and Warren.
1314059364706193408 2020-10-08 12:25:41 +0800 <tankerman389> @Travistritt Thank you Travis. That happened to me too. The whole time my fiancée, who pays no attention to politics kept saying, that ladies lying.
1314037376579252230 2020-10-08 10:58:18 +0800 <tankerman389> Listening to all these airheads after the debate talking about politics with Biden would be the same as before Trump... and that’s reassuring to Americans. These fools still don’t get why we elected Trump. We are sick of the politics prior to Trump.

1313255163201753088 2020-10-06 07:10:04 +0800 <tankerman389> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Funny thought for the day. Even Covid 19 picked Trump over Biden.
