1340618877261135874 2020-12-20 19:23:42 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @thehill As of Friday afternoon, CDC had already learned of vaccinated  3,150 people "unable to perform normal daily activities, unable to work, [or] required care from doctor or health care professional", this figure represents about 1.5% of the 215,000 that have taken the 1st dose.

1340433170877960194 2020-12-20 07:05:46 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @LaurenWitzkeDE True Christianity does not abide with abortion period. Anyone who teaches that it does is a false teacher and God has a special punishment waiting for them. A "pro-choice pastor" is not guided by the Holy Spirit, but ruled instead by satan... no gray area here.

1338395932472135681 2020-12-14 16:10:31 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @educateyoself3 @RealWayneRoot Nobody will catch it from me.. I already recovered.. herd immunity is the only way to beat this.
1338335073075007490 2020-12-14 12:08:41 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @danhill2011 Can't buy him off with a beach house either...
1338302675482419201 2020-12-14 09:59:56 +0800 <GrimmRoy> Well, the world is certainly due for the rapture of the church I am ready to go, just not ready to leave yet!  Work to be done!   The fields are white with the harvest and the workers are few, there is still time to turn to God and repent, but the hour is near, the time is short
1338301602449408007 2020-12-14 09:55:41 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @GisiAnthony @CB618444 Well the world is certainly due for the rapture.. I am ready to go.. just not ready to leave yet... work to be done!   The fields are white with the harvest and the workers are few.. there is still time to turn to God and repent, but the hour is near and the time is short.
1338290214461042689 2020-12-14 09:10:26 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @RealWayneRoot With now proven effective therapeutics and the 99.6% survival rate.. taking the vaccine makes no sense to me..  My worry is that the globalists will make it mandatory to travel.. yeah.. I know it doesn't make sense, but most all of this doesn't make sense..
1338240726837030912 2020-12-14 05:53:47 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @KyleKashuv Oh that's a hard call... lots of competition for that award.. Mad Max.. Hirono.. Ted Loo .. Hank "flip the island" Johnson.. but Swalwell is def in the running!
1338064347654832129 2020-12-13 18:12:55 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @thehill How in the world can you see this is his last time at this game as @POTUS?   #Fakenews Champs..
1337979550634967040 2020-12-13 12:35:57 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @Maximus_4EVR @realDonaldTrump Navy Vets too...
1337978857983340545 2020-12-13 12:33:12 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @mddems Love to kill babies?  That's the most Democrat thing I can think of ...
1337975340686221312 2020-12-13 12:19:14 +0800 <GrimmRoy> I love this !
1337974979606921221 2020-12-13 12:17:48 +0800 <GrimmRoy> YEP!
1337960030943891462 2020-12-13 11:18:24 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @tam4trump There is actually.. I remember one time my wife was wearing a sweater with sparkle threads in it.. she could not get it through the metal detector at the airport! Here ya go:  https://t.co/oq38wUGheA
1337902087250739200 2020-12-13 07:28:09 +0800 <GrimmRoy> Where to place the order we need several
1337507720979652610 2020-12-12 05:21:05 +0800 <GrimmRoy> 4 swing states STOPPED counting votes at the same time .. coordinated..  never before in history. Trump was way ahead in each state. Then a massive injection of BIDEN votes in each state as the numbers were manipulated digitally. Statistically impossible results.. use your brain!
1337493373876281344 2020-12-12 04:24:04 +0800 <GrimmRoy> When we all get to heaven, we will be surprised who we see there and who we don't.   “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven." Matt 7  God abhors abortion and will condemn those who preach it.
1337491718766137345 2020-12-12 04:17:29 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @dbongino Maybe they didn't after what we have seen in the #voterf_r_a_u_d  #SaveTheRepublic
1337253851469021187 2020-12-11 12:32:17 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @HLAurora63 No.. President Trump will be unleashed ... no more Mr Nice Guy.. with the mandate of the re-election and no upcoming election to worry about.. he will begin to really enact a conservative program.

1337178509513388032 2020-12-11 07:32:54 +0800 <GrimmRoy> My thoughts exactly!
1336948589411454976 2020-12-10 16:19:17 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @thehill Well at least they have 4 years to raise the money!
1336890632489451522 2020-12-10 12:28:59 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @Sheltieman3 Well, let's see how many years since Jesus was born? Talk about a reset!  2020!  All of time since then is known as Anno Domini .. a new reference.. a new covenant.. a new final sacrifice .. God on earth.. "I am the way"
1336882833122476032 2020-12-10 11:58:00 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @atensnut And his poor wife and kid
1336867421689241600 2020-12-10 10:56:45 +0800 <GrimmRoy> Against the most popular sitting president of all time...
1336835239264411648 2020-12-10 08:48:52 +0800 <GrimmRoy> Mayor Daley was a rank amateur compared to the current crop of corrupt Democrats.. these guys are pros!  But you are the man for the job Mayor!  #CorruptDemocrats @RudyGiuliani
1336824779337175041 2020-12-10 08:07:19 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @ReadMoreBible Yep!
1336814548712529920 2020-12-10 07:26:39 +0800 <GrimmRoy> Starting to look like @SenKamalaHarris was smart not to resign her senate seat.......

1336510890045132802 2020-12-09 11:20:02 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @ReverendWarnock You cannot justify the killing of innocent babies with Scripture .. God abhors abortion. False teachers have a special punishment coming. Resign and repent from this sinful support of abortion. Jeremiah 1:5 “I knew you before I formed you in your mother’s womb."
1336505055868932097 2020-12-09 10:56:51 +0800 <GrimmRoy> Like oil and water it cannot mix in the heart of a Christian.. God abhors the killing of babies .. period.

1336170510686646272 2020-12-08 12:47:29 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @thehill Well that sounds pretty dumb.. are these attys in court on these cases? Or just leftists activists try to make the news cycle..  https://t.co/zqrs2uLvZy
1336168402847637505 2020-12-08 12:39:06 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @MichaelCoudrey $40,000 sounds pretty cheap for several state dinners to me. Obama for a night of feasting on hot dogs and pizza on the other hand.... is more than horrible.
1336159611842306048 2020-12-08 12:04:10 +0800 <GrimmRoy> A true American hero.. a long history of service and bravery!  First to travel into the unknown of faster than sound flight!  May God comfort and bless the family 🙏

1335809829483343872 2020-12-07 12:54:16 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @alicetweet A real journalist would be asking why all the #StopTheSteaI2020 talk.. where there's smoke.. there is fire.. or you can just kick back and drink your kool-aid..
1335805280240615424 2020-12-07 12:36:11 +0800 <GrimmRoy> Illegal in the Philippines to beat people into submission for covid violations.. what about Democrat USA?

1335755298900873217 2020-12-07 09:17:35 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @drdavidsamadi 1. Alternative treatments are censored 2. Annual overall death rate is same as past years 3. It has been used as a political club by liberals 4. Suddenly Flu hospitalizations and deaths are gone 5. Africa has no pandemic.. hydroxychloroquine? 6. What's really in those vaccines?
1335752915252736000 2020-12-07 09:08:06 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @thecjpearson God has a special punishment in mind for those false teachers who would mislead His children.  God abhors the killing of babies period.... the Bible could not be more clear on the fact that He designed us and formed us in the womb to live for Him...
1335743223608745988 2020-12-07 08:29:36 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @alicetweet Uhh no.. not until we #StopTheSteaI2020  https://t.co/PsUEbeVVv5

1335366187283226624 2020-12-06 07:31:23 +0800 <GrimmRoy> Right? A few missing votes or dead people and cats voting is one thing.. this massive coordinated coup attempt is entirely another...
1335165335826092033 2020-12-05 18:13:16 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @RyanAFournier @csenje Data shows they were mostly all for Biden...
1335161932299505664 2020-12-05 17:59:45 +0800 <GrimmRoy> Curse of being an engineer and crunching data for years.. these things jump out at you and cry FAULT ERROR ANOMALY .. then when you correlate it to a cause .. you can't find peace in your mind until the issue is resolved.. it's kind of an OCD thing.
1335147435778338816 2020-12-05 17:02:09 +0800 <GrimmRoy> Wow.. that sure sounds like a confession of guilt!

1335013226799529985 2020-12-05 08:08:51 +0800 <GrimmRoy> Is this true?
1334976538953932800 2020-12-05 05:43:04 +0800 <GrimmRoy> Right?  In 1970 we could safely count paper ballots and put a man on the moon.. both within 2 days

1334454537990459392 2020-12-03 19:08:49 +0800 <GrimmRoy> I guess watching CNN is not the same as watching the mountains of evidence being presented by regular patriots to state legislatures .. overwhelming when taken together in the big picture.
1334453957108748288 2020-12-03 19:06:30 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @tyler_casper Yes.. it has the best sound system nowadays..

1333999803001233408 2020-12-02 13:01:52 +0800 <GrimmRoy> It is worth your time to watch these hearings... a preponderance of evidence of election fraud being presented... each personal testimony has merit.. but when you listen to them all, a pattern .. a big picture emerges and it's not a pretty one.  #CorruptElection
1333955348986617856 2020-12-02 10:05:13 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @LeahR77 @SherryC2013 hmm makes you wonder.. maybe a bank account audit is in order for all those involved.

1333552959905439748 2020-12-01 07:26:16 +0800 <GrimmRoy> In AZ, according to Dr Shiva (4 MIT degrees) Biden's vote was counted as 1.3 and President Trump's was counted as .7 Why does the SW allow for fractional voting to begin with? It should tabulate whole votes and count, not calculate.. Let's go back to paper = 1 vote per person!
1333552344156360704 2020-12-01 07:23:49 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @vicksiern @phirintra Biden's vote was counted as 1.3 and President Trump's was counted as .7 .. why does the SW allow for fractional voting to begin with.. it should tabulate whole votes and count.. not calculate.. let's go back to paper 1 vote per person!
1333542120519471104 2020-12-01 06:43:12 +0800 <GrimmRoy> The man, Dr. Shiva is a certified genius with not 1 but 4 degrees from MIT including his PhD. He invented e-mail in the 70's ... when he is presenting data to the AZ legislature, you can be sure he knows what he is talking about.

1325917643891564544 2020-11-10 05:46:15 +0800 <GrimmRoy> Incredible censorship of the President ... never in my lifetime have I seen anything like this!

1325757198404759554 2020-11-09 19:08:42 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @tyler_casper 17 I think
1325747783349886976 2020-11-09 18:31:17 +0800 <GrimmRoy> How so very strange?  Why would 450 THOUSAND people do that? hmmm? Especially since it hasn't been seen before ?  #CorruptDemocrats
1325746513021071361 2020-11-09 18:26:14 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @BretBaier @marthamaccallum @FoxNews Never again.. you guys blew it when you called AZ too early .. and then calling Biden as president?   I am afraid that your arrogance has caught up with you.

1325639601126432768 2020-11-09 11:21:24 +0800 <GrimmRoy> What are the odds?  Pennsylvania count: Trump: 1,690,589 Biden: 1,252,537  Count updates: Trump: 1,670,631 (-19,958) Biden: 1,272,495 (+19,958)
1325631309977251840 2020-11-09 10:48:27 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @amandacarpenter Just so we are clear here.. that will be President Trump, a whole bunch of constitutional law lawyers and about 71 Million or so fact checkers..

1325615880089169920 2020-11-09 09:47:09 +0800 <GrimmRoy> Yep!  And the fix was in on only in the critical swing states.. other states were left alone. so that's where they blew it.. normal margins in deep blue states compared to Obama and late night dumps and ridiculous numbers for only Biden in swing states. Whoops! #CorruptDemocrats
1325551652300943360 2020-11-09 05:31:56 +0800 <GrimmRoy> Right?
1325281715745533953 2020-11-08 11:39:18 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @CelebrityFind @dwheels281 Exactly.. it might glitch and stop counting... miss some counts or even double count.. but it will not change Trump to Biden!
1325279999838969856 2020-11-08 11:32:29 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @SexCounseling I think you are dead on target ma'am!

1325022656102461441 2020-11-07 18:29:53 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @EddieDonovan @nite_hawk61 @gatewaypundit Not buying into the "glitch" caused by "corrupted software" something like that could cause it to maybe miss some counts or even possibly double count.. but not change from Dem to GOP.

1324914591134961674 2020-11-07 11:20:28 +0800 <GrimmRoy> Exactly.. as we used to say "Does not compute"
1324825698263949312 2020-11-07 05:27:15 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @JackPosobiec I am trying to understand what kind of software glitch that could be.. my logical mind can't come up with one...

1324656716336672768 2020-11-06 18:15:46 +0800 <GrimmRoy> Right? They stop counting and "find" more buckets of ballots and they all just happen to be for Biden.. nothing to see here..
1324580687719006209 2020-11-06 13:13:40 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @IngrahamAngle We sent men to the moon 50 years ago... we could also count votes no problem 50 years ago...

1324295166065176577 2020-11-05 18:19:06 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @KMCRadio @Jali_Cat I read elsewhere that all of them 100% were Biden ballots?
1324289440466886657 2020-11-05 17:56:21 +0800 <GrimmRoy> WOW!

1324153090870702080 2020-11-05 08:54:33 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @carrieksada @MariEastman I feel exactly the same... what were we fighting for back then.. certainly not the heroes welcome when we came home.. but for America.. sad to see what is happening now.
1324100801791320064 2020-11-05 05:26:46 +0800 <GrimmRoy> Right? I feel the same.. in the past before Obama was reelected I never doubted our system, but now have lost confidence in the election system, any Dem, FBI, CIA, DOJ and the Legislature .. if Trump doesn't win I worry also about the Executive as well!

1323940174389080064 2020-11-04 18:48:29 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @35Leosa No state has ever stopped in the middle of counting votes.. now 3 states at the same time?  Coordinated fraud..
1323938377612226560 2020-11-04 18:41:21 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @RitaPanahi SO basically all of the "absentee ballots" were 100% Biden ? hmm fishy if you ask me
1323857614678077440 2020-11-04 13:20:26 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @Acosta I am not so sure
1323843058077626369 2020-11-04 12:22:35 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @DEPLORABLEREEG1 And Idaho for Trump.. it is no surprise actually.. expected

Knowing what was on those drives?  Strange .. hard to understand what happened to 3 different laptops to require such a recovery.. forgot passwords?
1318414646924095488 2020-10-20 12:52:01 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @paulsperry_ I was wondering also..  Interesting work order that requires data recovery from THREE MacBook Pros to the store's server?   Knowing what was on those drives?  Strange .. hard to understand what happened to 3 different laptops to require such a recovery.. forgot passwords?

1318375330965385216 2020-10-20 10:15:47 +0800 <GrimmRoy> @freepenfreemind Here it is.. ready?   Marriage is not a 50/50 proposition where you do your half and I'll do mine.. Marriage works when both parties give themselves 110% .. your partner is your mission field... and you are now ONE.. what hurts your partner hurts you.. and vice versa. Commitment!
