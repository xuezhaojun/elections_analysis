1336635190211465216 2020-12-09 19:33:57 +0800 <ConnorHaggarty> @LabSomato Top of the thumb. The damage was just below the joint.  Just one branch of the median nerve affected causing loss of most sensation to one side of the thumb. But yeah that side feels different (dryer) than the other

The damaged side of my thumb appears to be very dry and I wonder if this is connected to the nerve or just my over caution with the altered sensation there??

1317598526927478784 2020-10-18 06:49:03 +0800 <ConnorHaggarty> @joshtybur @HirstRj I would say that your CV include a handful of your “favourite” papers then a google search will reveal anything else.
