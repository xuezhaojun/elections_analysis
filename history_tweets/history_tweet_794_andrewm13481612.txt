Your happy for them to repeatedly state things and not be held to them just because it happens to suit you? If you wanted to make your own decisions you should have left the UK when you had the chance.

People that have kids in their care need take responsibility for them and feed them. Give them something once and they suddenly think they have a right to it for ever.
