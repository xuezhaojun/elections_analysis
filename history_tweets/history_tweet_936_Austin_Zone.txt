The service outage has affected 911 emergency systems, hospital systems, and has disrupted other systems such as ATMs and card readers.

1342621811599691777 2020-12-26 08:02:39 +0800 <Austin_Zone> What do you all think?
1342621094780526597 2020-12-26 07:59:48 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @AmosMosesGandy I laughed at that too.
1342613319279108097 2020-12-26 07:28:54 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @DoubleThink2020 I am severely disrupted from the AT&amp;T service disruption. I have not been able to follow that. Interesting.
1342612830424592390 2020-12-26 07:26:57 +0800 <Austin_Zone> This is bullshit.  1.Why be in touch with law enforcement on a matter of restoring services? 2.The bomb went off at 6:30 am. My services weren’t interrupted until noon.
1342611774378536963 2020-12-26 07:22:46 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @DoubleThink2020 This was not islamist terrorists. It was made to sort of look like that, but that’s bullshit. If they try to start a war as a distraction then... well fuck, they will probably get away with it like always.
1342611165533368320 2020-12-26 07:20:21 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @EJannies Welcome to the madness. The zone has been knocked off grid.
1342610974226993152 2020-12-26 07:19:35 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @DoubleThink2020 I feel like this could have been a “see, look what we are capable of”
1342610667803709447 2020-12-26 07:18:22 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @EJannies Did you just wake up?
1342609958119071748 2020-12-26 07:15:33 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @DoubleThink2020 Hmm.. maybe. But sounds like bullshit, right?
1342609076149243904 2020-12-26 07:12:02 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @DonShotti That is true.
1342608944947208194 2020-12-26 07:11:31 +0800 <Austin_Zone> The Nashville Bomb went off at 6:30 am.  My internet and cell service died at noon.  Why?
1342601844393189378 2020-12-26 06:43:18 +0800 <Austin_Zone> I don’t care if I sound crazy. This bomb has CIA/Deep State written all over it. #Nashville

1342508764331708417 2020-12-26 00:33:26 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @Fayepetunia Then you are deranged and need to seek therapy.

1342506504340037633 2020-12-26 00:24:27 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @UtimatePatriot I don’t think they are connected. But you never know. This definitely looks like a terror attack.
1342506178098683904 2020-12-26 00:23:10 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @dahadooshtube I mean this is usually a very busy and popular downtown tourist spot. But 6:30 am on Christmas is an odd time to set it off if you are trying to kill people.
1342505057821061121 2020-12-26 00:18:42 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @JAStacy16 @JoeBiden Of course he is. This is what he wants.
1342501998600605699 2020-12-26 00:06:33 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @TheRatstomper @TeeRizzle1 Yea I’ve thought that possibility as well.

1342495206860582917 2020-12-25 23:39:34 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @TeeRizzle1 No, that’s what is holding me back from making a conclusion on this. Obviously it wasn’t meant for mass casualties because doing this at 6:30 am on Christmas won’t accomplish that.

1341369830335721473 2020-12-22 21:07:43 +0800 <Austin_Zone> The stimulus is enough to give EVERY American $2750. More if it only went to 18+. You will (maybe) get $600. The rest is going overseas and to corporations. This bill will devalue the dollars that you are being given. This is outright theft from the American People. #VetoTheBill

Kyle was standing on the street when Rosenbaum &amp; Ziminiski chased him (eye witness testimony). Rittenhouse ran. Rosenbaum pursued, threw a bag at him, lunged for his weapon, grabbed it. Ziminski fired into the air, Rittenhouse shot, scared for his life.

Grosskruetz knew Kyle was going to the police, but attacked anyway

Rittenhouse fired after, killing Rosenbaum. And Grosskruetz had a handgun that he pulled out &amp; pted once Kyle told him he was going to the police.

1333896588616462339 2020-12-02 06:11:43 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @abigail_adams76 @kaitlancollins @FBI Rittenhouse was attacked by the BLM mob. What do you say to a the lefties fomenting violence from ANTIFA and rioters in general?
1333895528250269697 2020-12-02 06:07:31 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @HarryELees I see the point you're trying to make, but we don't see Rittenhouse deliberately try to provoke an attack. There is NO evidence of that. Carrying a gun is not provocation. And if, big IF, Kyle did any thing to provoke Rosenbaum's attack, it would be void once he retreated.

And he didn't murder anyone. They attacked. They got what they got.
1333894413744033796 2020-12-02 06:03:05 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @Daniell72391109 @rpmusicinc @PoliticalWhoFan @kingfaraone @Goodmoringmm @ChuckCallesto @realDonaldTrump @RichardGrenell @AdamLaxalt @mschlapp He definitely is innocent of murder. But keep repeating what the msm tells you
1333889527232991237 2020-12-02 05:43:40 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @Discordia48 @LibertatePro @brejackal76 @NRA @DonaldJTrumpJr @ReverendWarnock Receipts. Rosenbaum molested 5 children. Not one.  https://t.co/UMPSEQK5xu
1333888143213408258 2020-12-02 05:38:10 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @HarryELees Show me anywhere that says you can't claim self defense while committing a crime. So if someone tries to kill me while I'm speeding, I can't defend myself? That's absurd.
1333887272903733249 2020-12-02 05:34:42 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @Discordia48 @LibertatePro @brejackal76 @NRA @DonaldJTrumpJr @ReverendWarnock What's clear is that you haven't watched footage of the night Rittenhouse shot people who attacked him. It must be nice to let the Washington Post do your thinking for you
1333885160731848705 2020-12-02 05:26:19 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @mmmfiber @MotherJones That piece is pure sensationalism
1333884974056034306 2020-12-02 05:25:34 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @SimplyMagnius A white supremacist who kills white people who attack him. Nice one. Also, what evidence do you have to suggest he's a white supremacist?
1333884599752159235 2020-12-02 05:24:05 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @iDogeWasTaken @TheRightCant It is self defense, bro. My question for all of you people who disagree is how much footage of that night have you actually watched?
1333884265487097856 2020-12-02 05:22:45 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @ducksinmypool @Lavooe618 @MikeBalsamo1 @AP Rittenhouse acted in self defense. How much footage of the shootings have you actually watched because if you'd watched what happened you would agree. My guess is you let broadcast news do the thinking for you.
1333883928189526024 2020-12-02 05:21:25 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @Jimbojimjam1 @TheRightCant Self defense negates the lives of those who try to harm others.

1333883600014602242 2020-12-02 05:20:07 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @Daniell72391109 @rpmusicinc @PoliticalWhoFan @kingfaraone @Goodmoringmm @ChuckCallesto @realDonaldTrump @RichardGrenell @AdamLaxalt @mschlapp You should really look up the word murder. Rittenhouse did not commit murder. The gun charge us a misdemeanor and the rest are self defense
1333883387904397314 2020-12-02 05:19:16 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @trueblu06589289 @wrenwright @sezarplayer @BoogFather @hailie75643531 @dysinger @ravi_mangla You're not a close reader, are you? The sentence clearly states Rittenhouse isn't being charged for illegally obtaining the rifle
1333882837628547072 2020-12-02 05:17:05 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @HarryELees How much footage have you actually watched? Im guessing not enough. Because no, he didn't shoot him in the back. Most shots went through the front, and there are a lot of explanations for why there was a wound in his back
1333882381648994308 2020-12-02 05:15:16 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @DoodyGiuliani1 @fox32news Cause he's white? Are you racist? Or just stupid?

1332053516681170949 2020-11-27 04:08:01 +0800 <Austin_Zone> At this point, if your YouTube channel hasn’t been suspended, then you are a fucking commie.
1332047205029523458 2020-11-27 03:42:56 +0800 <Austin_Zone> I’m thankful for Dominion. Without Dominion I never would have known that my vote for Donald Trump was supposed to be a vote for Joe Biden. Thank you Dominion for switching my vote and setting me straight.
1331978339599441920 2020-11-26 23:09:17 +0800 <Austin_Zone> Chronic lockdown is killing America. If you comply and support lockdown you are complicit in the 100k excess deaths not atrributed to COVID.
1331978337544265732 2020-11-26 23:09:17 +0800 <Austin_Zone> Nearly 100k of our 298k excess deaths cannot be attributed to  COVID.  These deaths are caused by the lockdown cure, which increases depression and anxiety 3 fold, increases sedentary lifestyles, disrupts health care access, and has nearly doubled domestic violence homicides.
1331969577799049218 2020-11-26 22:34:28 +0800 <Austin_Zone> Speculation based on Dominion vulnerabilities: An industry expert said you can hack into these machines with a screwdriver and switch votes from one candidate to another.  https://t.co/YFQczVPjQw
1331968335362338820 2020-11-26 22:29:32 +0800 <Austin_Zone> 4. Speculation. Dominion software allows for malicious exploitation. Admin can tinker with the amount of ballot fill required for a faulty ballot. Faulty ballots go to higher ups for approval. At this stage, admin can delete ballots without record of their existence
1331968334317965318 2020-11-26 22:29:32 +0800 <Austin_Zone> 3. Evidence: video &amp; eyewitness.  On Election night, workers falsely claimed a water leak at State Farm facility required closure, forcing poll workers to evacuate at 10 pm. Several election workers remained at voting tabulation machine computers until after 1 AM unsupervised.
1331968332245966849 2020-11-26 22:29:31 +0800 <Austin_Zone> 2. Matt Braynard found thousands of Georgia voters being registered at fraudulent resident addresses like shopping centers, mail drop stores and non-residential facilities. Biden's margin for winning is  12,670 votes, and the complaint advocates discarding ballots completely.
1331968330186563584 2020-11-26 22:29:31 +0800 <Austin_Zone> Takeaways from Sidney Powell's criminal complaint in Georgia.  1. Evidence: National Change of Address Database (NCOA) and voter info.The complaint disputes the tabulation of 20,311 votes as the people were registered as moved, or as filed voter registration in another state.
1331958802606944256 2020-11-26 21:51:39 +0800 <Austin_Zone> If you are the type of person who will follow someone because they begged you to on here. Please unfollow me. I want smart followers. Not sheep.
1331880846136111105 2020-11-26 16:41:53 +0800 <Austin_Zone> Not to mention the fact that 74k "COVID" deaths are of people OVER age 85, many with several comorbidities. That's 30 percent of the death toll, which is not insignificant. See your family. Visit your friends while you're alive and have the freedom to do so.
1331880844726824960 2020-11-26 16:41:53 +0800 <Austin_Zone> COVID death toll is high because we overcount. ALL comorbidity-related deaths count as covid. If someone dies of a heart attack but has asymptomatic COVID, it counts as COVID (27k). If someone commits suicide or dies in an accident but also has COVID: it's a COVID death. (14K)
1331878706369998848 2020-11-26 16:33:23 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @zerocrossing @brhodes Let me get this straight, people can burn down businesses, destroy federal buildings, and gather en masse while calling black cops racial epithets as long as they pretend it's for a cause that impacts a statistically insignificant # of people, that's OK.

1327840122453233670 2020-11-15 13:05:29 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @natural_super1 I just "admitted" that BLM and ANTIFA are violent groups, usually at night. You just admitted that children of Trump supporters are unsafe around leftists.

1320116383410229249 2020-10-25 05:34:07 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @slamacao Likely because China has had this material as blackmail for a long time.

1319993752400896002 2020-10-24 21:26:49 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @NBCNews Democrats are trying to cheat. Thankfully the courts aren’t making that easier for them.
1319990407170871301 2020-10-24 21:13:31 +0800 <Austin_Zone> If you donated money to my streams through superchats in August please get in touch with me. This is theft.
1319990406289960968 2020-10-24 21:13:31 +0800 <Austin_Zone> They told me they were holding that money until I got monetized again. I applied in September and never got a reply. @teamyoutube apparently thinks it is okay to keep donations that were given to me. Not google.
1319990405383991297 2020-10-24 21:13:31 +0800 <Austin_Zone> Now that @teamyoutube has decided to delete my account without explanation, I’ve decided it is time to take this public. When @teamyoutube demonetized me at the end of August they owed me about $3000 in superchat donations.

1300922219984490497 2020-09-02 06:23:21 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @joepatriot2020 Yea no doubt there were people coming to the streams to say stuff like that in order to get me shut down. I finally wised up to that and got mods two weeks ago. Twitch said they suspended me for violent content. The same content streams like woke are showing.
1300918808098607104 2020-09-02 06:09:48 +0800 <Austin_Zone> @joepatriot2020 It had nothing to do with the chat. And I did have mods for the last two weeks.

Conservatives are constantly getting blocked, deleted, and suppressed on social media and streaming sites these days and it is happening even more the closer we get to election
1300898581809897472 2020-09-02 04:49:26 +0800 <Austin_Zone> AustinZone is under a coordinated attack from the left. Today I was suspended from YouTube for 14 days and from Twitch for 30 days. I plan to appeal these decisions, however those appeals can take weeks to months.   For now I will be streaming on DLive:  https://t.co/NMwdZ4Pacq
