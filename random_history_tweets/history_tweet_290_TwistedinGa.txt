Each precinct is run by the majority party of that area. So when minority polls get shut down, it's done by the Democrats who have the majority in that area!

1321176984358178819 2020-10-28 03:48:34 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @DrIbram Over the years, 29 justices were nominated in an election yr. All but 3 were approved. Those 3 were not approved by a senate run by the opposing party, (like they were in 16'). But hey, ignore the facts and twist reality to fit ur agenda!!
1321174421692993541 2020-10-28 03:38:23 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @Megawatts55 Another win! The US funded free press was not created for America, it was created to spread the word of Democracy across the world. The Firewall (started in 16') was used to tear down our President  not push democracy! God I love Trump!! #Trump2020!!
1321173381488779264 2020-10-28 03:34:15 +0800 <TwistedinGa> Another BS liberal move (enacted in 16') ended by Trump admn! US funded media was built to spread the message of democracy not to voice their opinions of a president! They r not helping the message by tearing down our President!

1320172728897441793 2020-10-25 09:18:00 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @CandyComedy Read about that case a long time ago, that woman who brought the law suit was a plant. They did it to get attention and get a bad policy changed.
1320172353473662976 2020-10-25 09:16:31 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @CandyComedy The cpark....there have been lots of cases where ppl were fooled by false news.  And the leasing...it was common practice back then, and Trump was "chosen"as the one to take to court and make a story out of it because his name was big enough to get attention!
1320169792712695808 2020-10-25 09:06:20 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @CandyComedy Obama did it, like DACA, he went around congress several times and Rinos said nothing!!!
1320165243402784771 2020-10-25 08:48:16 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @CandyComedy Schumer used the nuclear option , both used the fillibuster, and dems just not showing up to vote!!  It was Obama who ruled by exect. Order!! A lot of what Trump as done is to do away with the draconian measures Obama did!!
1320164021895561216 2020-10-25 08:43:24 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @CandyComedy Russia is a special case. Though Trump complements them, trying to smooth ruffled feathers, he has put more sanctions on them than any one else! (Hint: that is why they r now trying to help Biden)
1320163291323420672 2020-10-25 08:40:30 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @CandyComedy Some of our friends r not so much friends as they r friendly with our money, &amp; buddy up for it!
1320162783695044608 2020-10-25 08:38:29 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @CandyComedy Most successful  rich men have declared bankruptcy  on parts of their business that did not succeed, and ppl did not get paid.
1320162351992180736 2020-10-25 08:36:46 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @CandyComedy Every Rich adventists had failures. Babe Ruth said he struck out a lot more than he hit HRs!!

1320161152412909568 2020-10-25 08:32:00 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @CandyComedy How so? Do u not take of ur family first? Do u not want the best for them? Remember a rising tide raises all ships. Everytime America does well others do as well!
1320160420901146630 2020-10-25 08:29:06 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @CandyComedy God uses the imperfect to do his perfect work!!
1320160261072965632 2020-10-25 08:28:28 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @CandyComedy The progressives Dems (&amp;some R)have brought us to the brink of civil war, (AGAIN!!) The Republicans  preserved the Union the first time!! And it was a good thing!
1320159679419420674 2020-10-25 08:26:09 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @CandyComedy He reminds the idiots running the states that he could do it, but he does not do it. However I would prefer he did it, rather than having to fight another bloody civil war!!
1320159092275544065 2020-10-25 08:23:49 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @CandyComedy But we saw the lies long before #Trump came along, we did not need him to point it out to us!! We needed him to point it out to you!!
1320158676267814913 2020-10-25 08:22:10 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @CandyComedy I have also then them wrong About Obama, many times! I can form my own opinion by actually listening to the person!! Don't need some dude to tell me what he said!!
1320157734814306304 2020-10-25 08:18:25 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @CandyComedy U rely on politfacts?? What makes u think they ain't lieing to you? I have seen them "rate" many things wrong!! They take ppl out of context....a lot!
1320156817264181249 2020-10-25 08:14:47 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @CandyComedy Obama care has screwed up the insurance industry!!! My policy went from $180 to almost $900 and covered less!!! I now pay twice as much to see the Dr. And all the insurance. In my district closed down!! BUT my meds price fell drastically thanks to @realDonaldTrump!

1320049399515566080 2020-10-25 01:07:56 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @ChadSays3 U also do not avoid talking about other things just because there is a risk of a wreck! Life goes on!! If u fixate on anything u rob yourself of everything else!!
1320048589125681153 2020-10-25 01:04:43 +0800 <TwistedinGa> @ChadSays3 Ur risk of dying in a car wreck are higher than ur risk of dying from C19. We all take risk every day, several times a day! We do not hibernate to avoid dying! U can cut it chances of dying in a car wreck by buckling up, but u dont avoid the car completely!
