I recall with the Chrysler products you could move the distributer cap around on it's base.  Not good.  The Ford cap fit like a glove.

1339421180860780545 2020-12-17 12:04:29 +0800 <mcpoz> I was wondering
1339421112346808324 2020-12-17 12:04:13 +0800 <mcpoz> I knew of a story in Bedford , Indiana where the cops caught a peeping Tom. He was very short and carried a cement block so he step up &amp; could see through the windows.   He was spotted and ran carrying the cement block.   He was easily caught.
1339420075665842176 2020-12-17 12:00:05 +0800 <mcpoz> It reminds me of the Young Frankenstein scene when Gene Wilder was locked in the cell with the monster the monster.     Super brave before he faced reality, then reduced to sniveling fear with realization of the truth.

1339288989916860418 2020-12-17 03:19:12 +0800 <mcpoz> I remember the Anglia.  I think it had a Kent engine which was powerful and reliable.  I had an early Fiesta with the Kent engine.  The car was a rocket as it was extremely light weight.

1339288293582704646 2020-12-17 03:16:26 +0800 <mcpoz> Vintage Euro cars were known for electrical problems (They had unsealed electrical connectors) and also for leaky gaskets.  Both of those problems have been eliminated long ago.  I believe Lucas supplied the electrical connectors at least to British cars.  (joke follows) /2
1339286440031744002 2020-12-17 03:09:04 +0800 <mcpoz> Yes, both pics are from a Google search, but the convertible was exactly like that.
1339267282850246656 2020-12-17 01:52:57 +0800 <mcpoz> You probably are aware of this, but did you know that "MG" was named after "Morris Garage?"  https://t.co/pqGRxT9ZJl

1339223998371143680 2020-12-16 23:00:57 +0800 <mcpoz> They were loved by their owners much like the Hudson car.  My favorite for styling in that era was the 1953 Studebaker Starliner hardtop.  https://t.co/B4T4KgmS1p
1339222643896164355 2020-12-16 22:55:34 +0800 <mcpoz> Yes, and also the Pinto was something like $1970 in the year 1970.
1339221594967842816 2020-12-16 22:51:24 +0800 <mcpoz> I had a rare Maverick Grabber.  It was made only in the month of May, 1971.  It had a 5 liter V8.  This was the year just before emission controls and it was, I think, 245 hp.  This was a dangerous car.

As an example, at one time, DeSantis directed covid deaths to be reported as pneumonia, heart failure, etc.  This is not an isolated ruse.
