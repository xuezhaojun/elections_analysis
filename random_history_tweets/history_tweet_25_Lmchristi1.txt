Stick your mask, 2%’er. You’re a joke. Cheat. Illegitimate. You’re unqualified, but chosen for your color and gender. Disgrace.
1337588952761417729 2020-12-12 10:43:52 +0800 <Lmchristi1> Legislators have to refuse to certify. Welp, that doesn’t look like it’s happening.  Spineless.

The constant bull💩of releasing this &amp; that, people going to jail, bla bla bla...4 years! And now....stolen elections are all good.  No one has the balls to overturn this &amp; do the right thing.
1337575470401908738 2020-12-12 09:50:17 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @JoeBiden Obamacare failure. Illegitimate. Cheat. Camel-lah is about to replace you....or do you know that already?
1337572245070176256 2020-12-12 09:37:28 +0800 <Lmchristi1> 7 justices wouldn’t touch it....and the other 2 said “we should hear it, but won’t grant any relief” Wtf is that? 9-0, is what it is. Ffs.  The communist Dems r too deep from bottom to top. Once they’re in, they’re in. We see this in ChYna and Venezuela.

They are installed from judges to military. See China &amp; Venezuela. They will install Biden. Nobody wants to admit it, but they will.
1337568426194325505 2020-12-12 09:22:18 +0800 <Lmchristi1> And only 2 of them said they should “hear” it but NOT PROVIDE RELIEF!  What’s the point!?  The clock is running out.  SCOTUS wants nothing to do with the fraud election. It will not be overturned  by legislatures.   Installation of a fraudulent Pres. coming up. Watch. 😡
1337566698581483523 2020-12-12 09:15:26 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @JustinTrudeau Good.   Nobody cares.

1337564910696484867 2020-12-12 09:08:20 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @monica_remy They have no balls, was my lol. The overthrow of a country is no laughing matter to me, trust me.

1337559050230239232 2020-12-12 08:45:02 +0800 <Lmchristi1> How many actually believe the “legislatures” are going to do the right thing? Seriously.  Just like I did with SCOTUS....zero confidence in that.
1337557482869125120 2020-12-12 08:38:49 +0800 <Lmchristi1> They will install BasementBiden with a stolen election.  Had a feeling SCOTUS wouldn’t touch it.....let the chips fall where they may, type of attitude ....with every judge in this country. They don’t care. Dems did a good job.

1337551356433993728 2020-12-12 08:14:28 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @SebGorka They are not going to overturn this fraudulent election. It’s not going to happen. Why do you think communism cannot be defeated in Venezuela?

1336162442737573891 2020-12-08 12:15:25 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @Dblaze76 The question is...does any1 really have the balls to actually do it? Completely destroy the criminal Dem party? My guess is, no. Lots of things have to take place in a short amount of time &amp; I’m not sure how much of the pentagon can be trusted. Looking at other communist.....

1335990889450188800 2020-12-08 00:53:44 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @FKUJAK1 That’s what I’m afraid of. Lower courts are so corrupt, there’s no coming back from it. I don’t have high confidence that SCOTUS is going to do the right thing either, unfortunately. It’s going to be awful, if they don’t.

1331067842159124481 2020-11-24 10:51:18 +0800 <Lmchristi1> Hey remember how you said Trump couldn’t, and shouldn’t, do any executive orders because it was dictator like? I think you should do a bunch of those to enslave all your voters.  Tax them into government dependency. IllegitimateVP.

1327799806417391616 2020-11-15 10:25:17 +0800 <Lmchristi1> Yep, I said it. Today of all days, all those people there for him, to support him, while he watches the domestic terrorists attack them. Sick of it. The “do nothing” approach for these bottom feeders isn’t working.

1327445953658294272 2020-11-14 10:59:12 +0800 <Lmchristi1> He said .......... “Trump is resigned in some ways, he’s disillusioned, but realistic, he’ll do the right thing at the right time.”  What does that say about this whole thing? Grrrrrrrr.

They are not f’ing desperate. Ffs. They’ve done what they said they were going to do &amp; r moving forward with their plans. That isn’t desperation, it’s a takeover.

1327284202648190977 2020-11-14 00:16:28 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @RepDougCollins Are you actually recounting possibly fraudulent ballots? Every ballot needs to be looked at.  Every single one.

1324750228050817024 2020-11-07 00:27:21 +0800 <Lmchristi1> This is another RINO. He’ll know his place next election. They will always show their stripes sooner or later. Thank you.

They will not over turn Biden being “crowned” President once it’s done. That’s my bet. Not gonna happen.  Communism is thick.
1324738421252935681 2020-11-06 23:40:26 +0800 <Lmchristi1> Do people actually think.  ....given what we’ve seen &amp; what HAS NOT BEEN DONE about these criminals in 4 years.......    that when they call the election for Biden today, that it’s going to be turned over at some point??? Do people really believe that? It’s not.

1324190523930923008 2020-11-05 11:23:17 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @GeorgePapa19 California is fun.  Polls closed 8pm. Election called at 8:05pm.  This is the next day.  These peoples’ votes don’t matter.  https://t.co/9dPurmpJOC
1324189056427839489 2020-11-05 11:17:27 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @ussmidway Well, we thought we could contribute to the popular vote. But, yes, we don’t have elections in California.  It’s a 1 party communist Democrat rule.
1324186757043290112 2020-11-05 11:08:19 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @JoeBiden You can, but you’ll need to be President of another country.
1324184108566777857 2020-11-05 10:57:48 +0800 <Lmchristi1> California was called 5 minutes after the polls closed on election night!!  This is the next day! How are they able to call CA?
1324182328281878538 2020-11-05 10:50:43 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @rooshv @2Braptured777 They magically found more ballots in 2 Dem counties in Georgia too. “New batch” they called it. They are poised to steal Georgia, now, too
1324181025140985860 2020-11-05 10:45:33 +0800 <Lmchristi1> LMFAO!!! It’s like outta thin air!!!! Magical!!!! “New batches” are always exciting, aren’t they?   Democrats want EVERY SINGLE STATE!   They are going big!!!

A MAJORITY of people, in this country, don’t question the type of pen a poll worker hands you to vote.   You assume the friggin “pen” (writing utensil) is legit.

1324170779660111873 2020-11-05 10:04:50 +0800 <Lmchristi1> Can we say the election in 2016 was “more fair?”😲  They weren’t prepared.  They were this year.  Dems warned u many times, right up until last week, by this criminal. “Whatever the end count is..” Nothing was done. (For years) Consequences.  https://t.co/WIN5UvZpiN

1324137329120944129 2020-11-05 07:51:55 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @RyanAFournier @TheRISEofROD Weeks to deliver new ballots.  This is amazing.

1324134185032843265 2020-11-05 07:39:25 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @1shot1kill308 @TomiLahren I got nothing. Says I’m registered and my status is active and they changed me to a perm mail in voter.    That’s about all that is different.  No info on my ballot. 🤷🏾‍♀️ Thank you for that link. The other one is useless for in person people.

1324109352437977101 2020-11-05 06:00:45 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @GeorgePapa19 Only because they stole everything else and don’t need it.
1324109206199406592 2020-11-05 06:00:10 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @aubrey_huff We saw it a few years ago and nobody did anything about it. It happened then!  Consequences.
1324086860394631168 2020-11-05 04:31:22 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @EricTrump You won the other 6 states that they are trying to steal too. Doesn’t seem to matter. They did what they needed to, in the middle of the night.

1324083710547800064 2020-11-05 04:18:51 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @quinney_jessica Yep exactly right.

1324081277901811712 2020-11-05 04:09:11 +0800 <Lmchristi1> Ballots in California can be counted until December 13th? 😂😂 But they gave Biden, and every democrat, the state at 8:01pm last night. Polls closed at 8:00pm. 😂🤦🏾‍♀️ We are so screwed with democrat fraud. 1 party rule. All states will b called for Biden until he hits 270.

1324079061384089600 2020-11-05 04:00:23 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @imakedoyall I was given a stylus separately.  After I signed, I had to put it in a basket and he handed me my ballot and a sharpie.
1324078247471063041 2020-11-05 03:57:09 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @TomiLahren California 👇  This is what they gave me.  Can’t track my in person voting ballot either.  https://t.co/5DjvQAdItT

1324077405821050881 2020-11-05 03:53:48 +0800 <Lmchristi1> Should have listened to Pelosi. She said Biden will be President, regardless. There you have it.
1324074665170497536 2020-11-05 03:42:54 +0800 <Lmchristi1> You and your entire dictator 1 party rule are criminals.
1324062439420252160 2020-11-05 02:54:20 +0800 <Lmchristi1> Furthermore....... This is the type of “pen” that we were given at our polling site....at least I was.  Not ballpoint pen.  https://t.co/KugzR8Oj0z
1324053217907408899 2020-11-05 02:17:41 +0800 <Lmchristi1> Where is the “vote tracker” for people who voted IN PERSON? Your site says “mail ballot” and it says mine is on the way to my house! I voted in person!! There is no option for that. So we have to wait until Dec 3rd, possible? Corruption. Now, FIND MY BALLOT!
1324053016408858625 2020-11-05 02:16:53 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @CASOSvote Where is the “vote tracker” for people who voted IN PERSON? Your site says “mail ballot” and it says mine is on the way to my house! I voted in person!! There is no option for that.

1324049579432574976 2020-11-05 02:03:14 +0800 <Lmchristi1> This is what is happening in California right now.  I just checked “track my ballot”...I voted on Sat. Oct 31 in person. 🗣There is no option to track that vote! Only “mail ins” on that site?  https://t.co/kBsx6WNlRH
1324048850751954946 2020-11-05 02:00:20 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @CASOSvote Ummmm, what about tracking the ballots for people who voted in person? This site tells me my ballot was in the mail, to me, on 10/4....and that’s it. I voted in person.
1324043116114976769 2020-11-05 01:37:33 +0800 <Lmchristi1> 😂👇Biden has now won Wisconsin. Biden to claim victory as our next President at 5pm today?? Shouldn’t have ignored the warnings of fraud.....the Dems touted. Pelosi told u...”Biden will be President, regardless....”
1324041923196170242 2020-11-05 01:32:48 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @realDonaldTrump Yea.....and nobody even tried to stop the fraud when we all knew it was happening and would happen. Administrations inaction on this brought us to this point.
1324036404293341190 2020-11-05 01:10:52 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @GeorgePapa19 How many times do they have to call Arizona for Biden before people stop pushing this narrative? Let’s just stop.
1324035363317469192 2020-11-05 01:06:44 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @realDonaldTrump We know......and you knew!

1324033757679099906 2020-11-05 01:00:21 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @ScottPresler They will not allow it. This should have never gotten to this point. This is the result of inaction against Dem criminals. Period.
1324016119355637760 2020-11-04 23:50:16 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @TomFitton @Redtowel4 Too late.  This is the outcome of inaction. Democrats brought their fraud  A-game. Nobody cared. It was ignored.
1324015807894974465 2020-11-04 23:49:02 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @Cat_Luvs_Trump They need to create the illusion. Fraud is taking place.
1324014526920978432 2020-11-04 23:43:56 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @Matthew_4_Trump No, that’s why we are here now.
1324011234434326529 2020-11-04 23:30:51 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @nypost @ajusmc85Wwg1wga So, where is the violence coming from again? Criminal democrat communists.
1324008506199068672 2020-11-04 23:20:01 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @marklevinshow @ajusmc85Wwg1wga It’s not normal!!!!! They changed election laws! There are no protections for elections any longer. We have crossed over into 1 party communist rule. Bottom line. We couldn’t even win the House!
1324007661172645888 2020-11-04 23:16:39 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @SebGorka Elections are now over. Supreme Court isn’t going to overturn 5 states ffs. We couldn’t even win the House! They had a plan and executed it.
1324006542010650629 2020-11-04 23:12:13 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @SebGorka They already have. That’s what happens when nothing is done about fraud. Can’t cry now.   Should have done something about it in 2017, 2018, etc. Instead, it was ignored. Fckd around and found out. They upped their game. Lol
1324002684513517570 2020-11-04 22:56:53 +0800 <Lmchristi1> Well, this is what happens when 0 is done to protect the elections. We’ve been saying it for 4 years &amp; 0 was done. So, they upped their game &amp; it’s paying off. It will continue to happen. There won’t be elections in the Democrat future. They told u, u should have listened.
1323897320086319104 2020-11-04 15:58:12 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @benshapiro Yes he did.  It’s math.

1323884611248758784 2020-11-04 15:07:42 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @janaya0913 Yea, but they are worried about those blue counties still counting.   Newsmax said red counties are pretty much in. I dunno.
1323884027712077824 2020-11-04 15:05:23 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @TweetThisBabe Oh man....Virginia and Pennsylvania stopped counting until tomorrow! They gave Arizona to Biden with a million votes to still count! They had to retract! NOW, they are giving Georgia to Biden. They need him ahead to steal PA &amp; VA.
1323883527553863683 2020-11-04 15:03:24 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @valamontestony @newsmax Newsmax is actually looking at the totals in real time unlike fox.

Even harder to believe is 4 more years of Pelosi &amp; company, with impeachment’s every month &amp; nothing getting done in the House. Im over it.

1323850708391776257 2020-11-04 12:52:59 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @miles_commodore Yup. It’s mini California.  That’s where CA people moved to.
1323850511548928000 2020-11-04 12:52:12 +0800 <Lmchristi1> Dont be so shocked that Arizona went Blue! This is what happens when Californians flee their regime to take over other states. They are working on Texas.  They are sending them down in droves!
1323849839940194307 2020-11-04 12:49:32 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @DawnEMcKenzie @CaliConserv1 They call the state for any democrat before the polls are even closed &amp; ballots counted.
1323849500310577152 2020-11-04 12:48:11 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @CaptMarkKelly Poor Arizona.
1323849214049345538 2020-11-04 12:47:03 +0800 <Lmchristi1> Yes they do.
1323845103958413314 2020-11-04 12:30:43 +0800 <Lmchristi1> Why do you think vote counting has stopped in VA, PA etc......as Arizona flips BLUE??!  Every west coast state was called before polling places barely shut their damn doors!  They need to leave Biden in the lead. There you have it.
1323843703924957185 2020-11-04 12:25:09 +0800 <Lmchristi1> All west coast states get called before polls even closed  LMFAO!!!😂😂🤣🤣
1323843485389090816 2020-11-04 12:24:17 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @lori52993 Biden flipped it blue.

1323840637708374021 2020-11-04 12:12:58 +0800 <Lmchristi1> Arizona will finally flip blue. CA cesspool &amp; illegals have taken  over. So sad to see that state sink to what CA has become.
1323840191073669121 2020-11-04 12:11:11 +0800 <Lmchristi1> @PpollingNumbers Arizona going communist. This is what you get when cesspool CA bleeds into your state. Good luck.
