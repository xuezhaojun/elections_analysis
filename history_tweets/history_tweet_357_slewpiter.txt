1306555095501410306 2020-09-17 19:26:24 +0800 <slewpiter> @abelniak This is a GREAT idea, however our antiquated and dilapidated public school systems have their feet locked in cement, their wrists chained together and our teachers have their mouths taped shut.  Radical ideas like this need funding support from parents and private enterprise!
