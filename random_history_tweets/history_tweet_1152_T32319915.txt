Control of the masses, the destruction of Trump’s economy, jobs &amp; soon they will come for the guns. The great reset to usher in globalism &amp; the New World Order has begun. We are greater in numbers &amp; must not sit idly by.

She finally went to the ER with a 103 degree temperature &amp; all they gave her was Tylenol/antibiotics &amp; then sent her home telling her to drink lots of Gatorade/water.

1334177440999088128 2020-12-03 00:47:44 +0800 <T32319915> @PS__Patriot I just recently got a new online 6th grade student that sent me an e-mail introducing herself and let me know that she went by the pronoun "She/They" and would like to be referred to as such. She said I didn't have to, but it would be nice to have a teacher that acknowledged it.

Teacher unions in lib states have received a lot of press, but I doubt if all of the members are onboard with their decision. They are being controlled by the same people that are controlling their states.

None of which speaks highly of them &amp; their ability to do a satisfactory job as investigators. Citizens &amp; lawyers are doing their jobs for them &amp; then they won't act on it.
1333873709656977411 2020-12-02 04:40:49 +0800 <T32319915> @helpwithcredit Trump should nip this in the bud until it's all straightened out. When the dems were pushing for mail-in voting, we knew that this wasn't going to end well &amp; now it has exposed the fraudulent voting machines. Trump has turned back the curtains on the corruption in our government.

I don't take a flu shot and I rarely get the flu. My wife gets a flu shot every year and she gets the flu almost every year. She would not fare well.
1333858712952463365 2020-12-02 03:41:13 +0800 <T32319915> @RyanAFournier This election should be redone in person, no mail-in, using govt issued I.D.'s on reliable machines.

They have to cheat to win. Their ideas and policies aren’t popular with the majority of Americans. They represent foreigners, not the American people.

However, if they did it, I doubt if we would have the same kind of crimes happen again for a very long time. Treason used to be a punishable offense and now it will get you a book deal.

El Paso hospitals are so crowded that they are sending these people to other cities in the state. This is contributing to our spike and the continuation of some businesses being closed.

Again, the MSM &amp; polls were selling us on a blow out. Trump went directly to the people on social media &amp; rallies to get his message out. He brilliantly concentrated on the electoral vote &amp; pulled off the upset.

The MSM is in on it as well. The Deep State is a massive undertaking and has taken decades to put together. Trump is standing in the way, but for how long, I don’t know.

It allows for secret spying on citizens and people were OK with it because it exposed the “bad guys”. The Dems and Rhinos are being exposed. They are on the same page.

Votes can actually be added from someone’s home. Witnesses have come forward. Observers weren’t allowed in. Some areas had more votes than voters. It goes on and on.

Imagine my surprise in 1st period, after the morning announcement that include listing symptoms, to have a student pop up &amp; ask to go to the clinic, then, see them coded for Covid. You didn't know your kid was sick?

Whether it’s voter I.D., registering dead people &amp; cartoon characters, fraudulent mail-in voting or machines programmed to change votes, they don’t do a thing because they all benefit from it. They can’t win on their ideas.

They live in Texas, so most of the people they deal with on daily basis are Trump supporters. Last time I checked, there wasn't an NBA team in the Rio Grande Valley.

1327725172074438660 2020-11-15 05:28:43 +0800 <T32319915> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews We are in this together Mr. President. Nobody is going to steal this election without a fight. Our democracy hangs in the balance.
1327724754011385857 2020-11-15 05:27:03 +0800 <T32319915> @marklevinshow So Cindy McCain chooses socialism/communism over freedom? Just because her husband was a sellout, useful idiot for the Democrat Party, doesn’t mean you have to keep carrying that torch. Trump may have hurt his wittle feelings, but you stand for your country and it’s people first.
1327705991396339712 2020-11-15 04:12:30 +0800 <T32319915> @realDonaldTrump Amen, Mr. President. We’ve had our fill of this nonsense and nobody is going to roll over and let this injustice happen to you and our country.

I can’t remember a President that fights as hard for the citizens of this country than Trump. He has set the bar high.

This should be relief for suffering Americans &amp; nothing else. Just as the President had asked for. If you’re serious, then support him on this.

1327013449629577222 2020-11-13 06:20:35 +0800 <T32319915> @seanhannity Shouldn't she be pounding some Maze somewhere?
1327013048545107970 2020-11-13 06:19:00 +0800 <T32319915> @TrumperWavin @Thomas01938829 More than likely, we will also overtake both the House and the Senate as well. Conservatives did not vote for democrats after the way they have treated our president over the past 4 years, and that should be reflected in the vote as well.

Conservatives did not vote for any democrats after what the did to our president the past four years. Straight red tickets should have won both Houses of Congress as well.

1326245078877286400 2020-11-11 03:27:21 +0800 <T32319915> @washingtonpost How the Democrats used one of the arrows from Pelosi’s “quiver” to try to steal the election through fraudulent mail-in voting.

Unfortunately, the swamp will remain with nobody else left to try to drain it. At least nobody that is strong enough to withstand the treasonous plots. Our election system is broken now and nobody else will be able to come close.

I only vote for these guys to keep the Dems from gaining seats. Cornyn’s commercials were all about his bipartisan bills and distanced himself from the President. I voted for him to keep the seat, but I felt dirty.

How long will that peace last? Look out Israel, the antisemitism party just stole our election.

As a political outsider, he has exposed the evil corruption of many of our politicians &amp; their  influence of our media. Their endless, desperate, failed attempts to take him out while ignoring this country has been eye-opening.
1325045330161885184 2020-11-07 19:59:59 +0800 <T32319915> @SheepDogSociety The MSM just shrugs it off. What if Trump admitted on tape to Russian collusion? Would they be as uninterested? We never knew how corrupt our political system/media has become until Trump exposed them to us &amp; it’s frightening to realize just how deep the Deep State really is.

Trump was winning on election night when the current blue states shut down. He had a lead of 200,000 to 500,000 with 75% to 86% of votes in. He had it in the bag.

It is heart-breaking. The democrats have made a mockery of our election process. They have cheated the system and made half of the country distrust the way our democracy runs.

I think it would be quicker to scrap this election and start over with in person voting. Mail for absentee, the way it always has been. The Dems can blame themselves for this hot mess. Too many instances of rampant fraud.

MaCaul is also very quiet and didn’t respond to a concern of mine over the summer. I’d love to toss both, but not for a democrat.

1324142765786177538 2020-11-05 08:13:31 +0800 <T32319915> @drawandstrike @honor_dennis Joe pretty much told us when he said he didn’t need the votes to win &amp; the Dems have created a huge fraudulent voter scheme. The plan, all along, was if Trump looked like he was winning, they would shut down &amp; know how many votes they had to get to give their state to Biden.
1324141274165891074 2020-11-05 08:07:35 +0800 <T32319915> @DineshDSouza What ever machines they are using in states like Texas and Florida, need to be used in all 50 states as those states have large populations and the counts were ready within 3 to 4 hours after the polls closed. There is no excuse for not having these counts done by this morning.

1324139157745242113 2020-11-05 07:59:11 +0800 <T32319915> @TRHLofficial I’m fine with that.
1324138333845553157 2020-11-05 07:55:54 +0800 <T32319915> @BernardKerik @Verity_Ley I switched off Fox to Newsmax. I don’t understand all of the libs they have at Fox &amp; their placement on an election panel for one thing, but the others were strangely going along with the BS. They  wouldn’t call FL or TX, but jumped on AZ while people were still in line voting.
1324136298882441219 2020-11-05 07:47:49 +0800 <T32319915> @Gman1939 @Thomas01938829 @MsAvaArmstrong I hope you are right. This can’t be allowed. Or election integrity and democracy lie in the balance.
1324135903904804864 2020-11-05 07:46:15 +0800 <T32319915> @pnjaban Yes! I thought Covid was the reason these treasonous hacks couldn’t vote in person.

1324134312061640705 2020-11-05 07:39:55 +0800 <T32319915> @JoeBiden Yeah, we are. The Dems spied on our candidate/president, made false accusations against him based on a fraudulent dem paid for dossier. Impeached him along party lines for your crimes &amp; are stealing this election right in front of our eyes. No, we aren’t buds. Far from it.
1324132648567136257 2020-11-05 07:33:19 +0800 <T32319915> @stclairashley Are the feds helpless here? This is a federal election that is being hijacked, out in the open, by a bunch of treasonous shysters. We, as a country, shouldn’t have to sit back helplessly and watch them do it.
1324123413921910796 2020-11-05 06:56:37 +0800 <T32319915> @TomiLahren I could use a new TV. Perhaps we should start? Aren't we entitled to other people's stuff if Biden wins? What's mine is mine and what's yours is mine. Seriously, conservatives would never destroy this country, property and businesses to protest a perceived injustice.

1324063465330401280 2020-11-05 02:58:24 +0800 <T32319915> @realDonaldTrump They were one of the first states to finish and they can't get their act together on this? There are states with larger populations that had their totals within a few hours. Inexcusable. Obvious fraudulent activity happening in the remaining states.

1324034326737145857 2020-11-05 01:02:37 +0800 <T32319915> @TheRightMelissa @GodFamilyHealth @realDonaldTrump Hopefully, President Trump wins and we regain the Senate. The first order of business is to save the integrity of our elections with voter I.D. laws and other protections. Then, we need to go after all the treasonous dems who have been involved in this 4 year long coup.

1324032265475788800 2020-11-05 00:54:26 +0800 <T32319915> @benshapiro Trump won the fair election. After he was in the lead with a large portion of these states already counted, the democratic run states have fraudulently rigged the election in Biden's favor. Now the illegal election is up in the air.
1324026067468865539 2020-11-05 00:29:48 +0800 <T32319915> @SebGorka We have known for months they would try to do this. Republicans complained &amp; yet nothing was done about it. Now, here we are watching dem states rig the outcome of an American election right before our eyes. Elections have lost their integrity &amp; our democracy along with it.
1324025159972491264 2020-11-05 00:26:11 +0800 <T32319915> @BrennaSpencer The election fraud is so obvious and there needs to be criminal charges brought. Our election integrity lies in the balance. Without faith in our elections, democracy is a sham and only those in power controlling the lawlessness will remain in control.
1324024312299458566 2020-11-05 00:22:49 +0800 <T32319915> @KayaJones I'll do it again as long as the entire country does in-person voting &amp; the votes are calculated in real time. It's ridiculous that some states seem to be able to get their totals within a few hours of the polls closing &amp; others, many with smaller populations, need multiple days.
1323979734557040643 2020-11-04 21:25:41 +0800 <T32319915> The Democrats were in on the China virus. They both had a motive to get rid of Trump. They needed to destroy our economy &amp; create disheartened unemployed American voters &amp; they needed an “in” to fraudulent mail-in voting.  https://t.co/vo84dFkO4m
1323976508256493574 2020-11-04 21:12:52 +0800 <T32319915> This election has created a lack of confidence in our election process. The crooked dems are stealing this election right before our eyes &amp; will do nothing about it in the future. We have lost our voice. Where have we seen this before &amp; wondered how it was allowed it to happen?
1323972745923887105 2020-11-04 20:57:55 +0800 <T32319915> @AOC You, and the Democratic Party, are traitors to this nation.
1323971767497641988 2020-11-04 20:54:02 +0800 <T32319915> @DavidJHarrisJr If Biden wins, all investigations against the treasonous acts of the Obama administration, Hillary Clinton, the DOJ, democratic members of Congress, Joe Biden, etc. will disappear. It appears that the Democratic traitors may have pulled it off.
1323965522493538306 2020-11-04 20:29:13 +0800 <T32319915> @seanmdav They already stole Wisconsin in the dead of night.
1323964333995511808 2020-11-04 20:24:29 +0800 <T32319915> @ACTBrigitte How come some states are so efficient, giving us totals within a few hours, while others can’t count it’s votes for days? Many states, holding up the process, have smaller populations. The American people know when someone is pissin’ on our boots &amp; telling us it’s a rainstorm.

1323813519595347969 2020-11-04 10:25:12 +0800 <T32319915> @stillgray Texas cities usually vote democrat. It’s the rural areas that will carry the state for Trump.

They aren’t going to sit back and risk a Trump victory, and by all indications, he should have a landslide victory. Many of them know they will be exposed with participating in treasonous plots if he wins.

1323328196176158720 2020-11-03 02:16:42 +0800 <T32319915> @ACTBrigitte 1. Putting treasonous dems &amp; DOJ Deep State players on trial for putting this country through Hell for 4 years. 2. Opening our economy &amp; putting people back to work 4. Getting back to normal 5. Locking up Antifa &amp; BLM rioters. 6. 4 more years of the best President ever!

You basically said you were going to shut down one of the biggest industries in the state &amp; put millions out of work worldwide. More than 6,000 products are made from petroleum. It ain’t all about filling tanks, Joe. You don’t stand a chance in hell of winning Texas.

Democrat leaders have done all they can to make that happen. Problem is, it’s already coming back and your plans are going to hurt the economy. Raise taxes? Do away with the oil &amp; gas biz? Open the border?

That would be closely followed by cracking down on illegal immigration, better trade deals, lower taxes, energy independence &amp; the fact that he's not a democrat.

How can Biden lead in any poll? What is being allowed is Election fraud, right in front of our eyes.

When my mother was in the early stages of dementia, I was not allowed to enter the voting booth with her to help her with the machine. This woman is showing the elderly woman who to vote for. It is none of her business to know how she is voting.

1319469663122788356 2020-10-23 10:44:16 +0800 <T32319915> @TheJordanRachel If you work in an oil &amp; gas producing state &amp; vote for Biden, you’re putting you or someone you know out of work. Then, there are those businesses that benefit from those businesses that will suffer. Thanks to Trump, our economy is no longer dependent on countries like Arabia.
1319468328331759620 2020-10-23 10:38:58 +0800 <T32319915> @Alyssa_Milano Funny. My brother-in-law and sister-in-law were retired comfortably with her 401K investments and lost it all under Obama’s economy. He had to go back to work and is still working at age 70 because of it.
1319466461589610496 2020-10-23 10:31:33 +0800 <T32319915> @dbongino Or one of Biden’s scientists.
1319462374718439426 2020-10-23 10:15:19 +0800 <T32319915> I’m a white guy and my parents had, “the talk” with me about making officers comfortable to approach the car. Dome lights on, hands on the wheel in plain sight. Be respectful. I have been pulled over and I did what I was told. All parents should have this talk.
1319457448126779394 2020-10-23 09:55:44 +0800 <T32319915> @pnjaban Come on!
1319454027524997120 2020-10-23 09:42:09 +0800 <T32319915> @ElishaKrauss @Liz_Wheeler My school opened 10 weeks ago. 3 weeks of online, 7 weeks of online/in-class. A few cases of Covid, no deaths. More kids coming off online to in-class each grading period. I’m a senior with health issues. I don’t want to live what’s left of my life hiding. I’m a free American.
1319448480360894466 2020-10-23 09:20:06 +0800 <T32319915> @Liz_Wheeler Strange, there are less deaths this year than all combined deaths from all sources in previous years.

Trump will probably give them a ratings boost as people will now try to see how they try to edit the show. Not me personally, but somebody else might.
1319380159150120960 2020-10-23 04:48:37 +0800 <T32319915> @stillgray I kissed my father all of my life into my adulthood. I remember telling him I would stop that practice when I became a teenager and he just smiled and said that would be fine. However, I didn't stop and I'm glad I didn't as I no longer have him in my life.

1319350669074173955 2020-10-23 02:51:26 +0800 <T32319915> @KThomasDC @KBeds What we're seeing here is Biden taking &amp; laundering money off of his position as VP, using his deadbeat son to take the risk as a bagman to keep Joe's nose clean. No way Joe is letting that snot-nosed punk get rich off of his name without taking his cut. Other Dems are involved.

1319333634416037890 2020-10-23 01:43:45 +0800 <T32319915> @SebGorka It's a shame that it has come to this. It's also a shame that the shop owner, who turned in Hunter's laptop, felt he had to make copies of the hard drive to give to trusted friends in case the FBI swept it under the rug and to ensure his own personal safety.

1319323779793932288 2020-10-23 01:04:35 +0800 <T32319915> @DavidJHarrisJr It's one thing to tell everybody that you are demanding answers, and another thing to follow through to actually get those answers and yet another thing to do something about them. I see too many GOP folks demanding stuff and then nothing happens and it gets swept under the rug.

1319307630121275393 2020-10-23 00:00:25 +0800 <T32319915> @HillaryClinton Trump wants a stand alone package to help suffering Americans. Pelosi &amp; Co. want to add a bunch of unrelated crap that has nothing to do with helping the people that pay their phony baloney salaries. They forget who they work for. The American people will remind them on Nov. 3rd.
1319247736374439936 2020-10-22 20:02:25 +0800 <T32319915> @littllemel The Clinton’s did pretty well with their “pay for play” foundation as well. The Obama’s aren’t hurting either nor Pelosi and many others. The swamp is being prepped. Pull the drain on November 3rd.

They didn’t count on Trump reaching voters in social media and swing states to win the Electoral College. Brilliant strategy and the Dems are still reeling from it.

1318881861515575297 2020-10-21 19:48:34 +0800 <T32319915> @hrenee80 It’s cool when a 74 year old white man dances because he looks like a 74 year old white man dancing. Why is it that a 56 year old black woman dances like a 74 year old white man? Not cool.
1318880699680772097 2020-10-21 19:43:57 +0800 <T32319915> @KamVTV I remember when Hillary thought the presidency was hers &amp; the polls also supported that belief. She hardly did any campaigning as the election was nearing. Now, the polls show Biden in the lead and he goes into hiding as well. Why do they feel they have this thing in the bag?
1318878863896858624 2020-10-21 19:36:39 +0800 <T32319915> @Lrihendry What ever Joe knew, he forgot it already.
1318878492658982913 2020-10-21 19:35:10 +0800 <T32319915> @RealJamesWoods Seems like a threat that law enforcement should be investigating.
1318700076257169408 2020-10-21 07:46:13 +0800 <T32319915> @JoeBiden The whole family voted for President Trump. Young and old. Preserving our freedoms for ourselves and future generations.
1318685791049207810 2020-10-21 06:49:27 +0800 <T32319915> @Millerita Like influence. Apparently, that pays pretty good.
1318666630990319626 2020-10-21 05:33:19 +0800 <T32319915> @makingitpay No masks on the beach. Masks to enter a restaurant , but can take them off after you sit down.
1318666450748538880 2020-10-21 05:32:36 +0800 <T32319915> @makingitpay More to do it Galveston than other beaches along the TX coast. Plus, it's close to Houston. However, the beaches are prettier on South Padre Island. Fun bars on the bay side to watch the sunset and listen to music. Nice hotels/beach house in Galveston. Condos/beach houses in SPI.

1318628398600695810 2020-10-21 03:01:23 +0800 <T32319915> @JoeBiden But President Trump isn’t running for the Senate.

After that, it's been a mix of in-class &amp; online. After the 1st grading period, when everyone could see that we all weren't dead, more kids returned to in-class school. We suspect that the numbers will continue to grow.

That should be his priority.

1317516237803585536 2020-10-18 01:22:04 +0800 <T32319915> @JohnStossel Trump is the only candidate that has backed up what he promised. Everything he does is with the country’s best interests in mind. He is the only “politician” that is actually losing money to be in public office. He isn’t a socialist. He set records with the economy &amp;  jobs.

The Dems play dirty and might have something on him or they made him an offer he could’ve refuse. I think Wray just pulled the wool over everybody’s eyes and was Deep State from the beginning.

They have put together a relief package &amp; Pelosi won't support it, choosing to hold it up on unrelated BS rather than relief for suffering Americans. They will get this judge confirmed as well.
1317166818193215489 2020-10-17 02:13:35 +0800 <T32319915> @DineshDSouza Hunter was Joe’s bagman. He took the risk for a cut. No way Joe strong armed foreign countries just for his son’s benefit. Clinton’s did the same with a different approach by starting a foundation to front their operation.

1317076829975568385 2020-10-16 20:16:01 +0800 <T32319915> @chicagosmayor The Constitution is inclusive of everyone. When people try to misinterpret it, it allows for necessary changes to eliminate those misinterpretations. The fact that you, as a gay, black woman, are a mayor of a large city in this country, is proof that the Constitution sees you.

1317071459399905282 2020-10-16 19:54:40 +0800 <T32319915> @JoeBiden The rich will pass that additional tax burden back on the little guy by reducing their work force &amp; raising prices. Not to mention, sending the jobs, Trump worked so hard to bring back to this country, back overseas. This is a prime example of why career pols should not be prez.

Too bad Hillary failed to win the 2016 election, or she would be selecting the justice. Elections have consequences.

1314023382145470465 2020-10-08 10:02:42 +0800 <T32319915> @michellemalkin Harris is getting way more time than Pence.

1313981598413598731 2020-10-08 07:16:40 +0800 <T32319915> @ACTBrigitte Can members of the Senate spend some time taking turns reading the newly released evidence of the treasonous Russian hoax and list all of the participants to date, the way Dems, in the House, took turns reading the fraudulent Mueller Report?

1313958556299915265 2020-10-08 05:45:06 +0800 <T32319915> @TeamTrump What is it with Democrats and feeling like they know what's better for us than we do? Who is she to tell an free adult what they can or cannot eat, or even my children and grandchildren what they can and cannot eat? Keep your hands off of my hamburger you pompous beotch!

1313940051848564737 2020-10-08 04:31:34 +0800 <T32319915> @MajorPatriot Obviously, they rely heavily on the blackmail tactic as you can watch people switch their positions after stating their support for the president. You have to ask yourself if somebody got to them. Right now, I am concerned about Barr and Durham. Where is their investigation?

1313889733983055872 2020-10-08 01:11:38 +0800 <T32319915> @seanhannity I remember the days when you didn't say things like this about a president out of fear you would be picked up and never heard from again. Now people can get away with talking about killing a prez, writing plays with him as a victim, doing photo shoots with his bloody head, etc.
1313888508810014720 2020-10-08 01:06:46 +0800 <T32319915> @AdelleNaz @stillgray What's wrong with these lazy ass postal workers? Somebody needs to be held accountable for these mail dumps.

Then, when the shit was about to hit the fan, wiped all evidence of the investigation. Bring charges, Bill Barr!
1313872535038156801 2020-10-08 00:03:17 +0800 <T32319915> @mattdanzico @realDonaldTrump You went through a lot of trouble to put your TDS on public display. Get some help.
1313871920430014468 2020-10-08 00:00:51 +0800 <T32319915> @realDonaldTrump Since when can there be so many people, with evidence of committing treason, be allowed to walk free to write books &amp; start podcasts to spill their lies even more? When did treason become such a trivial thing? When did treason stop being a crime and start becoming profitable?!
1313870160495771648 2020-10-07 23:53:51 +0800 <T32319915> @seanhannity Now we know why they were all so upset with Trump's surprise victory. The dems and the MSM made a valiant effort to keep the lies focused on Trump and are all now accessories to treason.

1313863897468854272 2020-10-07 23:28:58 +0800 <T32319915> @davereaboi Somebody had this bright idea. Somebody thought it was worth spending tax dollars on. Somebody was, once again, wrong.
1313863365534474240 2020-10-07 23:26:51 +0800 <T32319915> @davereaboi Think about those driving alone in their cars! What's up with that?

1313859799092781057 2020-10-07 23:12:41 +0800 <T32319915> @seanmdav I think the fact that dem poster boy, Butt Hole O'Rourke, couldn't even win a city council seat in his hometown of El Paso if he wanted to, much less a spot in Congress or a candidate for president, would suggest the dems don't stand a chance in Texas.

1313847156818800641 2020-10-07 22:22:26 +0800 <T32319915> @Jim_Jordan The MSM played a huge part in knowingly pushing this misinformation. Pelosi, Schiff, Nadler, Schumer &amp; others are accessories to treason for their part in hiding the truth &amp; going so far as to pursue a partisan impeachment of the president over it. This better end in indictments.
1313845588677492738 2020-10-07 22:16:13 +0800 <T32319915> @IlhanMN Shouldn't you be in jail? It's coming. Once again, you democrats are trying to add unrelated BS to a bill that is intended to help suffering Americans and businesses. You are killing it and blaming it on the GOP who are trying to help Americans. The people see what you're doing.

1313813557990035456 2020-10-07 20:08:56 +0800 <T32319915> @Qtah17 Pelosi, Schiff, Nadler, Schumer, Waters and fellow Democrats, as well as the MSM, purposely played along and spewed misinformation to the people to help hide the treasonous crimes and sell the lies to the gullible.
1313810418343833604 2020-10-07 19:56:27 +0800 <T32319915> @makingitpay Pence needs to be coached by Tulsi Gabbard. Harris will be down and out for the count early.

Once again, you are adding help for foreigners &amp; money for dem led cities that were allowed to be attacked. Before it was pay raises for yourselves, theaters &amp; help for foreigners.

1313526978809655299 2020-10-07 01:10:10 +0800 <T32319915> @Lrihendry It's more than just political power, It's closing down the investigations that will implicate a lot of them in treasonous plots, including Obama. Their party would be toast.
1313526588974170112 2020-10-07 01:08:37 +0800 <T32319915> @Lrihendry I believe they had a hand in it's development a well. The only chance they had in this election was to crash Trump's record economy &amp; job numbers. It had to be on a global scale or in wouldn't have been as effective. They have shown that they will stop at nothing to get him out.
1313516485927751681 2020-10-07 00:28:28 +0800 <T32319915> @PaulaReidCBS Move to the back where you belong.
1313515455857020929 2020-10-07 00:24:23 +0800 <T32319915> @CNBC Chump change for a man whose son serves as his bag man while collecting serious bucks from foreign countries seeking favors from his father while he takes the risk for a percentage of the take. Similar to the Clinton's but without a tax right off foundation to front it.
1313513840546648064 2020-10-07 00:17:58 +0800 <T32319915> @Lrihendry Tara Reade would like to disagree if the MSM would give her the same voice they gave Christine Blasey Ford.

Something you morons seem to have forgotten while reaping the benefits it has provided you thankless, disrespectful, pompous jerks.
1313507208680951808 2020-10-06 23:51:36 +0800 <T32319915> @mcuban Kung Pow Cuban is rather sensitive when he's losing money.

1313294393965719558 2020-10-06 09:45:58 +0800 <T32319915> @KatMcKinley I love that the woman, who helped break up Jimmy Kimmel’s marriage that left his two children without a full time father, acts morally superior to the President because he dared to survive a deadly virus in record time, despite being at the age of greater risk.
1313286220634562561 2020-10-06 09:13:29 +0800 <T32319915> @Lrihendry I believe that Covid was  released in states like Texas &amp; Florida when they tried to open their economies &amp; their numbers suddenly spiked, all while riots were happening in other states with thousands in the streets without incident.
1313277070777225217 2020-10-06 08:37:07 +0800 <T32319915> @TeaBoots @hrenee80 What a crowd.

It seemed fishy to me as an deliberate attempt to scare everyone back inside.
1313242713370898435 2020-10-06 06:20:36 +0800 <T32319915> @JeMari81 My coworkers would be shocked, as I don’t discuss politics (and really can’t because I'm a teacher). My real friends would not be shocked.

1313241275295043584 2020-10-06 06:14:53 +0800 <T32319915> @ACTBrigitte I have to admit, I watch my team only and no other games. My son is out in LA and we enjoy texting back and forth about our sports teams during their games. Hard to give up the chance to spend some time with him in some way. However, they have sucked this year.
1313240058250625029 2020-10-06 06:10:03 +0800 <T32319915> @glennbeck @TheLastRefuge2 @realDonaldTrump I voted for Trump in 2016, after being a Ted Cruz guy, because Hillary said that she would expand on Obama’s policies &amp; I didn’t like the direction they had the country going. They also put foreigners ahead of Americans &amp; they still do. I couldn’t risk them picking judges either.

They try to knock down the opposing side to make themselves look better. It's all they have. They do have one very large weapon and that is the MSM pushing their lies to their gullible constituents.

He was talking about democrats because conservatives didn’t want it and they didn’t vote for Obama. They want to vote for Biden and more taxes? Just reinforces what he said.

The constant flow of evidence and the lack of consequences is frustrating. In the meantime, these traitors are writing books and creating podcasts of lies. Who knew treason was so profitable?

1311483611376386051 2020-10-01 09:50:33 +0800 <T32319915> @JohnStossel Trump could kick Biden in what’s left of his hangy downys, &amp; I would still vote for him over socialism, globalism, open borders, reparations, antifa, BLM, defunding police, treason, packing SCOTUS, corruption, Medicare for All, etc. My vote goes to Trump &amp; our country’s future.
1311481026338848768 2020-10-01 09:40:17 +0800 <T32319915> @OregonGovBrown Anybody that stands down to domestic terrorists burning their city, attacking its citizens, allowing them to destroy the livelihoods of its citizens for over 100 day’s on end, should not be in a position of “leadership” &amp; anything that comes from your mouth, should be discounted.

I will not vote for socialism, globalism, more taxes, defunding police, open borders, Medicare for All, Antifa, BLM, New Green Deal...

Trump could punch Biden in the nose &amp; I would still vote for him. I will not vote for socialism, globalism, open borders, defunding police, higher taxes, BLM, Antifa, or treasonous plots against my Prez.

1309901496142704646 2020-09-27 01:03:48 +0800 <T32319915> @KatMcKinley Ginsburg has two children. She didn’t seem to have a problem with that. Is she saying women can’t work at a high level job and raise children?

1309893102761644037 2020-09-27 00:30:26 +0800 <T32319915> @CGAdamo @Ann_marie1231 Just the average Joe on the street can see that Antifa and BLM are organized and well funded. His response to this and other issue within the FBI are eye-opening. He should be replaced ASAP. He has been compromised.
1309891433059495936 2020-09-27 00:23:48 +0800 <T32319915> @PaigeSully88 I just got back after a week for speaking the truth about the lack of consequences for treason in this country. Seems like a lot of us are being silenced for a lot less than I see on a regular basis on this site.
1309886865026297857 2020-09-27 00:05:39 +0800 <T32319915> @KatMcKinley Shame on Madonna, Steven Spielberg, Tom Cruise, Sandra Bullock, Charlize Theron, Angelina Jolie, Katherine Heigl, etc. Do libs really want to throw their own under the bus over this? I believe some libs are Catholic, including Pelosi, so that shouldn’t be a sticking point.

1309608736600854530 2020-09-26 05:40:28 +0800 <T32319915> @ACTBrigitte A Nancy Pelosi presidency. A Hillary Clinton, Adam Schiff, Maxine Waters, AOC, Sheila Jackson Lee, Kamala Harris...really any democrat is as bad as the next.

The Dems have pulled out all of the stops over the past 4 years and their desperation is growing more and more dangerous. Stop it!

Don’t try to block traffic with a dangerous mob that poses a danger to innocent drivers trying to get to their destinations. They have a right to protect themselves.

1309460129901875202 2020-09-25 19:49:58 +0800 <T32319915> @HillaryClinton Hillary Clinton. The woman who has never conceded her loss for the Presidency of the United States. Childish and shameful. It says a lot about her character and only reinforces how right the voters were in 2016.

1309311062156677120 2020-09-25 09:57:37 +0800 <T32319915> @Millerita I hope that if I am ever resisting arrest and get myself killed, people will take to the streets and destroy innocent people’s businesses, jump on people’s cars as they are trying to get from point A to point B, burn cities and help themselves to looted merchandise in my honor.
1309305438526148608 2020-09-25 09:35:16 +0800 <T32319915> @DavidJHarrisJr They better put it in high gear. If the Dems steal the election through mail-in voter fraud, etc. This investigation is over.
1309303705884340224 2020-09-25 09:28:23 +0800 <T32319915> @Lrihendry Bloomberg can pay me to vote for Biden. He’ll have a tough time proving that I didn’t.

Obamacare architect, Gruber, admitted that it passed because of the stupidity of the American voter. GOP voters were against it. Now they are picking your candidate for you.

So, they shouldn’t investigate treasonous behavior within the CIA because it might effect moral? What about how they effected Trump &amp; this country? That’s why there is even an investigation!

1306136994263838721 2020-09-16 15:45:00 +0800 <T32319915> @RealJamesWoods Has there ever been a time when a political party let their supporters feel like they were voting for a presidential candidate, but were ultimately left out of the final decision because their party leaders felt they knew better than them on who should actually run the country?

1305348386271490049 2020-09-14 11:31:22 +0800 <T32319915> @makingitpay @stillgray This made me think of a news story where a local black activist in Houston had the opportunity to go through a police training. It was an eye opening experience for him.  https://t.co/xjrejl8u9y
1305344317033246720 2020-09-14 11:15:11 +0800 <T32319915> @makingitpay @stillgray Put in the same situation, anybody would react the same exact way or they would be dead. Police can’t defend their lives anymore? It’s easy to be an armchair QB in these situations unless you’re the one whose life is at risk. These officers stand between us &amp; them.
1305337534289973249 2020-09-14 10:48:14 +0800 <T32319915> @ComfortablySmug @heckyessica I just finished my 2nd week of in-class school. We’re all still alive and kicking and I’m 65 with a lot of the health issues on the list that puts me at risk. The district is doing all it can to keep us all safe. Most people you encounter do not have this virus.

1305307266464264193 2020-09-14 08:47:58 +0800 <T32319915> @charliekirk11 It wasn’t easy, but enough is enough. When real social justice is overshadowed by a political one. When they disrespect our country in our faces in favor of criminals who resisted arrest &amp; paid the price for it, yet are honored as if they are heroes over their victims &amp; police.
1305234936199352328 2020-09-14 04:00:33 +0800 <T32319915> @BeeJaySee Hopefully, they’re about to unload a huge can of whip ass of those domestic terrorist antifa thugs.

Apparently, he and Aunt Nancy’s wine businesses are OK. Thank goodness for them, climate change and Covid are able to be selective enough to spare their hypocritical, pompous asses.
1304967652750897155 2020-09-13 10:18:28 +0800 <T32319915> @DC_Draino I’m so glad I live in a place where climate change doesn’t set fires.

1304964084274782208 2020-09-13 10:04:17 +0800 <T32319915> @RealJamesWoods Pelosi’s so gullible, she got duped by a hair salon and a Russian hoax.
1304874609746083841 2020-09-13 04:08:45 +0800 <T32319915> @ChuckCallesto No doubt some state shutdowns are related to the election. The pandemic, riots &amp; now wildfires are all related to the election &amp; all brought to you by the desperate treasonous dems who don’t stand a chance without disrupting his record economy to try to blame it all on Trump.
1304873232965791746 2020-09-13 04:03:16 +0800 <T32319915> @AnnCoulter Illegal immigration isn’t the only issue on the ballot. There’s this socialism thing, defunding the police, raising taxes, New Green Deal, etc. The Dems want open borders and healthcare for illegals, so I wouldn’t hold my breath for them to build a wall. Trump is still the man.
1304872170246504449 2020-09-13 03:59:03 +0800 <T32319915> @stillgray Fast food workers are going to start needing hazard pay.
1304871420187508736 2020-09-13 03:56:04 +0800 <T32319915> @chuckwoolery They probably had multiple contacts with Pelosi, Schiff, Nadler and other Dems leading the treasonous farce they created to bring down a duly elected president.
1304783964897382400 2020-09-12 22:08:33 +0800 <T32319915> @seanhannity I want to create a distraction. I think I’ll broker a historic peace deal in the Middle East that nobody else has been able to accomplish for decades. That should do it. I’d much rather have a Trump productive distraction than a destructive democrat one.
1304780137104318464 2020-09-12 21:53:20 +0800 <T32319915> @Lrihendry He’s not supposed to know the questions beforehand. What good would a teleprompter do unless somebody is quickly feeding him the answers? Would he have a teleprompter to deal with heads of state?

1304768135594225665 2020-09-12 21:05:39 +0800 <T32319915> @SebGorka It has never been about Russia. The American voter snuck a non political patriot businessman into office &amp; threw a wrench into their Globalist plans. They can’t afford to let him have 4 more yrs to make this country stronger &amp; expose the crimes they committed to get rid of him.

1304683543491158018 2020-09-12 15:29:31 +0800 <T32319915> @edawson78 And Governor Newsom takes the opportunity to make a little film of himself in a burned out part of his state, with a shit-eating grin on his face, talking about the indisputable proof of global warming. Funny, the fires are missing his &amp; his Aunt Pelosi’s wine country businesses.
1304673475106398209 2020-09-12 14:49:30 +0800 <T32319915> @jsolomonReports Then why are they voting for these liberal wackos?

The country needs to be run like a business &amp; not a vessel for a political agenda. It has been eye-opening watching to what extent they have been willing to destroy that vessel to get him out of the way.
1304597178606923778 2020-09-12 09:46:20 +0800 <T32319915> @mashable Liberal men lack balls, so they can sit in it. The rest of us need to give those puppies some space.
1304596698531061768 2020-09-12 09:44:25 +0800 <T32319915> @RealJamesWoods Apparently, they don’t have any balls.
1304580830891855872 2020-09-12 08:41:22 +0800 <T32319915> @realDonaldTrump Now, if they can only get those domestic terrorists to stop setting those fires in the name of climate change and further destruction to the country and American lives, we would be able to focus on the criminal aspect of the Democrats and their involvement in all of this.
1304559527271059463 2020-09-12 07:16:43 +0800 <T32319915> @KamVTV Students have asked who I voted for and I always tell them that it is a personal matter. However, by telling them that, I am actually answering their question. A lib will always try to force their politics on others.

1304537619636924416 2020-09-12 05:49:40 +0800 <T32319915> @JimGaffigan "Drunk Parents" sucked. Take a lesson from a class act like Johnny Carson who was smart enough not to show his hand and play mean politics. Corrupt and incompetent? Record economy and job numbers would dispute that. Biden was using his office to make he and his family rich.

One suddenly banked and appeared to be coming our way and my stomach dropped. Luckily, it banked back to Hobby. Shortly after that, they told us all to go home. We were sitting ducks.

I add up the years &amp; how old they would be now (40), wonder what they would look like, what sex they would have been &amp; what they would have become. I really didn't have a say in it, but I am ashamed to say, I helped pay for it.
1303720492222820352 2020-09-09 23:42:41 +0800 <T32319915> @RealJamesWoods Dan Rather is the forefather of "Fake News" from back in the day when they fired you for it.
1303719873156177923 2020-09-09 23:40:14 +0800 <T32319915> @AnnCoulter Unfortunately, Donald Trump's America has Democrats in it.

1303671344513658880 2020-09-09 20:27:24 +0800 <T32319915> You’re gullible enough to get set up by a hair salon and gullible enough to believe the Russian hoax against President Trump. Funny thing is, you think the rest of us have the same character flaw. You aren’t pulling the wool over anyone’s eyes. @SpeakerPelosi
1303670266464219139 2020-09-09 20:23:07 +0800 <T32319915> @SpeakerPelosi Perhaps, if you would stop forcing things unrelated to helping suffering Americans into the bill, it would easily pass. Putting foreigners, theaters raises for yourselves and now pushing for fraudulent mail-in voting to try to steal the election, is criminal at best.
1303669230223732739 2020-09-09 20:19:00 +0800 <T32319915> Pelosi is gullible enough to get set up by a hair salon and gullible enough to believe the Russian hoax against President Trump.
