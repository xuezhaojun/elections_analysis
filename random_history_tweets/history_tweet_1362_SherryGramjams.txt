He's a false prophet &amp; gullable folks still cling to this false promise.  The "church" promotes him to protect their tax free status.

We obviously have much work to do with our progressive members. Bottom line, we won't be successful by attacking each other.

1303876639177269255 2020-09-10 10:03:10 +0800 <SherryGramjams> A Tweeter said he looks for Trump to resign so Pence can dismiss all of his crimes. It makes a lot of sense.  We need to impeach both Trump &amp; Pence. President Pelosi, anyone?

1303701544123203587 2020-09-09 22:27:24 +0800 <SherryGramjams> Exactly!
1303700580544770051 2020-09-09 22:23:34 +0800 <SherryGramjams> Like the system of checks &amp; balances the GOP ignored the last 4 years?
1303697837205737473 2020-09-09 22:12:40 +0800 <SherryGramjams> Barr acts like Trump's private attorney.  Oh, &amp; Trump is running out of campaign donations to pay his private attorneys.
1303696265633501184 2020-09-09 22:06:25 +0800 <SherryGramjams> I'll follow when Twitter allows me.
1303695595752882178 2020-09-09 22:03:46 +0800 <SherryGramjams> Happy Birthday David. From a fellow OK Boomer Sr Citizen.  üíô
1303694512573816838 2020-09-09 21:59:27 +0800 <SherryGramjams> Seems they lengthened his legs to appear not-so-fat.  You know, like his Dr. did
1303396026167025666 2020-09-09 02:13:23 +0800 <SherryGramjams> Manson probably is Trump's saviour.  His murder rate is climbing every day.  Could be at 200,000 in a month.  Stupid Trump followers will fall for anything.
1303344966614372353 2020-09-08 22:50:29 +0800 <SherryGramjams> Poor little snowflake Donnie.
1303344574916694017 2020-09-08 22:48:56 +0800 <SherryGramjams> He's been doing that for weeks already.
1303344017845956608 2020-09-08 22:46:43 +0800 <SherryGramjams> I imagine the Mega MILLIONS trump has scored illegally while in office offsets his losses nicely.

1303080936528130048 2020-09-08 05:21:19 +0800 <SherryGramjams> Trump is a BULLY.   He knows no other way to communicate.
1303079847477104644 2020-09-08 05:17:00 +0800 <SherryGramjams> Interesting.
1303069750776541191 2020-09-08 04:36:53 +0800 <SherryGramjams> How about a baby gate?  Put it on top of the refrigerator.  Lol Good Luck!
1303069052055715840 2020-09-08 04:34:06 +0800 <SherryGramjams> What a desperate thing to say.
1303068483715059713 2020-09-08 04:31:51 +0800 <SherryGramjams> Ummm  Trump's talking about his M.O. VP Biden will return our country to sanity.  smh

1303006867396886528 2020-09-08 00:27:00 +0800 <SherryGramjams> Never.  Don't trust a vaccine unless Dr. Fauci approves it.  Just sayin.

1302661486830129152 2020-09-07 01:34:35 +0800 <SherryGramjams> Cheese or lunchmeat works well.  You may have to force it down their throat.  Wet it first. Good luck!
1302655172204810240 2020-09-07 01:09:29 +0800 <SherryGramjams> Please take a photo of your ballot, your ID &amp; yourself.  Trump will do everything imaginable to steal this election.  Putin had it rigged till Covid made it risky to vote in person.   No wonder trump is sharting his pants.
1302629528905412609 2020-09-06 23:27:36 +0800 <SherryGramjams> @realDonaldTrump Resorting to attacking Widows is not very "presidential " or scriptural.  Even for you.
1302339093297336322 2020-09-06 04:13:30 +0800 <SherryGramjams> Not really.  He is pure evil.
