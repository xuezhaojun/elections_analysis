1344046188169887745 2020-12-30 06:22:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JerpsBerps @JoeBiden I heard that, but we have to hold his feet to the fire. A promise is a promise unless he wants to be a one-term President.
1344043669582573568 2020-12-30 06:12:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> And then after that, @joebiden is going to have $10K of the remaining balance forgiven or maybe even the whole thing. Right????  https://t.co/ApMpKjSZHO

Now only is #10 unwatchable (I will be turning it off shortly), some are sequels, and the rest look pretty bad. I can't believe...I can't believe some of these movies were made.

1342155467875741697 2020-12-25 01:09:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @colefrom5to7 I would prefer to list actors and have people assign points to them (1-10), but that would take too long to tally, so I'm just going to pass on that for now.

You decided to choose one of the worst possible candidates when there were plenty of other qualified candidates like Barbara Lee or Katie Porter.

I don't think identity politics should play a role, but this is the first time in DECADES that CA hasn't had two female senators. Also I'm still waiting for Padilla to count the votes from the 2016 Primary. What a shitty choice!! This constituent isn't happy with you.

1341456449273094145 2020-12-23 02:51:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> Well, it's official: the news I've been dreading since the beginning of the pandemic. My maternal grandfather passed away. He hadn't been doing well for quite some time. But still it's upsetting especially since I won't be able to travel to the funeral due to the pandemic. 😢
1341447309113008130 2020-12-23 02:15:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @spyderdobro Yes kind of embarrassing but Breakfast at Tiffany's because I saw it with the wrong crowd and then saw it again on TCM years later and loved it.
1341446392191963136 2020-12-23 02:11:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> If a celebrity has the same name as me, so glad it's Allison Janney, because that woman is classy!
1341445647329681409 2020-12-23 02:08:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> Will post a schedule

1341440899184611328 2020-12-23 01:50:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> @lesbians4tulsi Yikes. I still like her. And even though that's disappointing every politician I've heard of got it so can't blame her for taking it when she got the opportunity.
1341440184919855104 2020-12-23 01:47:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ElaniKitten "Virgos are analytical to an almost pathological degree" I love to tell stories when I'm doing standup although I do rely a lot on expressions and reactions.

1341258938084282370 2020-12-22 13:47:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wwelifer1 Thanks for sharing. If it were on Letterboxd, I'd do a quick review. But anyway, keep up the good work and it's a sure way to build followers on YouTube.
1341245624084176896 2020-12-22 12:54:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR It's definitely an old-school thought. I consume art however possible and have adapted to watching most films on my laptop through streaming services during the pandemic.
1341236076761862146 2020-12-22 12:16:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Optigrab Mmm mmm! Either way, you win.

1341226740039917570 2020-12-22 11:39:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ginny_sais_quoi I got 18 or19K likes once and I forget how many likes I was getting per minute and when it stopped (kept going for a day or two). I think 10 likes a minute is usually pretty good. And when it doesn't slow down or halve right away then that's great.
1341143089709076481 2020-12-22 06:06:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scott4listener Of course! You deserve only the best things!!

1341127935403544576 2020-12-22 05:06:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SpeakerPelosi is that old person who thinks $600 is a lot of money because she's still thinking about how far it'd go in 1964...
1341127621048893440 2020-12-22 05:05:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @peterdaou @SpeakerPelosi The only thing significant is the amount of Jeni's ice cream in your freezer. You really want people to starve! You're so disgusting.
1341121665040707584 2020-12-22 04:41:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @haleyvemealone Wow! I imagine that would have to be a lot of oil.

1340557293486665728 2020-12-20 15:18:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Rinanloo I am working on a pairing for the next round. It might change if the results change significantly. There might be a some directors whose pairings make more sense than others'.
1340554426495332353 2020-12-20 15:07:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Rinanloo Europeans, really. A French/Italian pairing was the best I could do. Some directors paired quite nicely while others were a bit of a stretch.
1340553226987302913 2020-12-20 15:02:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> What if The Snowman was recut into a taut thriller that ended up being THE film of 2017? What if...?

1340545694495469573 2020-12-20 14:32:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> For Greatest Director Challenge (Round Five), should we give people a shorter time frame to vote so we can be done by the end of the year? Currently, it's one week and would be shortened to about 3-5 days between rounds.

1340144425561780226 2020-12-19 11:58:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @voilavarda And yes, the French actors were really great (Nathalie Baye too). It was 10 years ago and my French wasn't as good back then, so I don't remember much apart from that.
1340144230082039809 2020-12-19 11:57:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @voilavarda Yes, I could understand this one scene when they were speaking in English. Otherwise, I could only understand the emotions.

1339416640497221633 2020-12-17 11:46:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheGeneralLine Sorry. I personally like both. The director polls are going to get increasingly harder to choose between.

1338751699133984769 2020-12-15 15:44:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> And you're a genius if you refer to them as "cinema"

1338748914137059331 2020-12-15 15:33:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scott4listener He lied about his age and took two years off so he was really 39
1338742584252878848 2020-12-15 15:07:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> Just when I was beginning to like the movie, it finished with the ugliest and cheapest credits!

1338729049686863872 2020-12-15 14:14:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BernieBroStar @JeremyWard33 It makes no sense. It's a waste of time and then we get overchanged and our healthcare is tied to our employment and too many people are unemployed right now during a PANDEMIC.
1338728475583078400 2020-12-15 14:11:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SummerYuleRDN Sorry to hear that. Dairy was killing me and I've never been more healthy as a vegan. Also it's more sustainable and our planet needs us to cut out meat from our diet more than ever.
1338725794143588354 2020-12-15 14:01:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JoshFromIndy I forget how long it's been since I watched the original. Maybe 20 years?

1338718940239855616 2020-12-15 13:34:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> Watching REBECCA (2020). Caring more about Mrs. Danvers' sexuality at this point than Mrs. de Winter's.  https://t.co/ZGU2XirlOG
1338716844576841731 2020-12-15 13:25:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chaoticcduccy As a matter of fact...
1338715276137746434 2020-12-15 13:19:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TX_WalkerRanger Huh? He would be so fortunate to resign so that Pence can pardon him.

1338713237009776640 2020-12-15 13:11:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> A lousy adaptation of a great novel is still lousy.
1338708454685376514 2020-12-15 12:52:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> I'm switching
1338706870567989250 2020-12-15 12:46:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> HOLIDATE is so bad within the few seconds that I'm tempted to switch to REBECCA (and never go back to HOLIDATE).
1338705801133785089 2020-12-15 12:41:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> I am morbidly curious about REBECCA (my favorite book but still not wild about the Hitchcock adaptation), but might just go for HOLIDATE tonight

1338704376643289088 2020-12-15 12:36:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> I should probably watch something cheesy or terrible on Netflix tonight like HOLIDATE or REBECCA (respectively), so that I can feel *that* much better about checking out THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT

They discontinued their raspberry tiramisu cupcakes so I stopped going regularly and the last time I ate there I got kind of sick. They don't claim to have non-GMO/organic food, so I really wasn't planning to eat there again.

1338691107505369088 2020-12-15 11:43:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Whorlock2 @DanPriceSeattle Prices have been rising for years and the minimum wage hasn't, which means people at the top get more $ while the actual people doing the work haven't been getting a livable wage.

1338686428801208324 2020-12-15 11:24:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @spyderdobro I prefer non-dairy milk chocolate (it exists) but try to aim for the darker chocolate as much as possible.
1338686245866622978 2020-12-15 11:24:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie Hope I stay. 🙂
1338685258485493762 2020-12-15 11:20:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie Sure!

1338683244049362945 2020-12-15 11:12:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @bkrewind @charlottebronn When I was a kid, I watched this episode before I started developing crushes. Later, I'd realize how hot Holden was, but I trusted Lucy's taste and therefore always knew he was hot simply because Lucy thought so.

1338667400175124482 2020-12-15 10:09:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Whovian103_YT 11 &amp; 33 are the same question. 😭  Maybe #28
1338623121432068096 2020-12-15 07:13:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scifiagenda @letterboxd Yeah. It's kind of chill. Kind of decent.
1338618893351337985 2020-12-15 06:56:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scifiagenda @letterboxd It was basically binge-able. I spent my whole Saturday afternoon / evening on it and generally liked it. It's not mind blowing or life changing or like the book necessarily but still well done.
1338615397000511489 2020-12-15 06:42:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scifiagenda @letterboxd I think there might be another season next year.
1338613090523336704 2020-12-15 06:33:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scifiagenda @letterboxd I don't know if they allow series. TMDB could get mad at me and delete it.
1338612772171468801 2020-12-15 06:32:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> RATCHED is not available on @Letterboxd 😭, so I can't review it there, but I still want to review it, so I might have to post it on my blog or something. Stay tuned.

1338383137072508929 2020-12-14 15:19:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> Wanted to write a review for RATCHED but this will have to suffice for now.
1338379147102486529 2020-12-14 15:03:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AlaskanTush Yikes. Well, I have a ton of other stuff to watch on Netflix, so maybe I'll check it out again if I have time.
1338378721359667201 2020-12-14 15:02:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AlaskanTush It's getting late, so maybe I'll re-evaluate in the morning.
1338378108307525633 2020-12-14 14:59:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AlaskanTush I really wanted to check it out because of Elliot Page, but I'm on episode 5 and it went from okay to tiresome.
1338377741628973059 2020-12-14 14:58:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> Watching The Umbrella Academy and with all due respect it's like Kingsman meets a watered down X-Men.

1338372398823849984 2020-12-14 14:37:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Turtoro1 Yay!
1338372258964754433 2020-12-14 14:36:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rak_strong I was able to finish a couple that had been on my shelf but then not be able to make room for others
1338360751757488129 2020-12-14 13:50:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TeamPelosi Wow, how shitty! Wish we had #MedicareForAll like the rest of the civilized universe. We work and you get rich off of it! Resign now, Nancy or be recalled. You work AGAINST the interest of every day Americans.
1338345673251385345 2020-12-14 12:50:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LthiStefan1 @comradespice Thanks! I've been loving it.
1338340134157045760 2020-12-14 12:28:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie I'm so glad you're here! 🤗
1338339286635057154 2020-12-14 12:25:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LthiStefan1 @comradespice Yes, when I tried THC, I thought my pillow was trying to attack me. I knew it wasn't, but had to keep concentrating to calm my fears. Now I just have CBD.

1338307742436454401 2020-12-14 10:20:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cryborg One should be reserved specifically for them.
1338307590577483777 2020-12-14 10:19:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie I thought you meant Almodovar. 😭
1338304141018292225 2020-12-14 10:05:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @recklesstennis Thank you! 😅 I have seen the movie (long before I was vegan), but not the series. I might like it, but typically don't review series as Letterboxd generally doesn't have profiles for them.

1338282452838539264 2020-12-14 08:39:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @comradespice As long as you know how your body reacts to it and you don't have anything going on tomorrow. I would up it by 10-20 at a time. Doubling or tripling it might be a bit much.

1338281079459889152 2020-12-14 08:34:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @goodbadnerdypod I watched RATCHED all at once yesterday. It was sad when it was over.
1338280835162619904 2020-12-14 08:33:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JacqRiley I want to, though! 😅
1338280731252932609 2020-12-14 08:32:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @buffysxmmers You and me both!! I turned it OFF.
1338280646142087169 2020-12-14 08:32:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @comradespice Yes. I would start with 10-25 mg at first. It depends if you're talking about THC or CBD. You would probably feel something at 15, so take it slow, definitely.

1338274032928505856 2020-12-14 08:06:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sororityxnoise Oh no!! I've been sick a couple of times in Paris. Hopefully you'll be able to go back some time and do all the things you want.
1338273616845139968 2020-12-14 08:04:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> I really want to watch THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT, but I know I won't be able to finish it all today so I might start another day.
1338273403770339329 2020-12-14 08:03:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sororityxnoise I love Paris, but I was aware of the bad reviews. Also I did the no-money-student Paris experience and she is literally being driven around to her high-paying job and it eliminates any possible struggles that could make the show interesting.

1338267974059270144 2020-12-14 07:42:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> Yes, apparently Ted Cruz, Kamala, and Joe made it too. I apparently like to respond to politicians here on Twitter.

1337885455145025536 2020-12-13 06:22:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @agentofchaos22 Once you get through the theme song it's a "normal" show.
1337882865468510209 2020-12-13 06:11:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @agentofchaos22 They don't sing as a rule on that show, but maybe they do sometimes.
1337881797292539909 2020-12-13 06:07:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @agentofchaos22 Yeah Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, though.
1337881063146749952 2020-12-13 06:04:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @agentofchaos22 I guess it would have been funnier if I personalized the pictures before this tweet but whatev  https://t.co/dBQ88pFe6M

1337877477788565504 2020-12-13 05:50:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> @FilmLover85 Do you have a drive-in close to you? I have to drive a bit to get to one, but I'll do that for a film that is unmissable.
1337876684234604544 2020-12-13 05:47:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @FilmLover85 I miss it but things should get back to normal soon, finally!!
1337876404164182017 2020-12-13 05:46:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BonggJoonWhore Agreed. Hopefully this awakens more people and we are able to do things differently moving forward.
1337876186341363712 2020-12-13 05:45:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> I'm going to *personalize* my review of THE PROM.😊

1337874908806696960 2020-12-13 05:40:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scott4listener Is that a Midsommar reference? Also which Fassbinder?
1337874727981871105 2020-12-13 05:39:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DEATHNOTE2017 I know, right?

1337871308063789056 2020-12-13 05:25:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> When Grace's       When Mildred's Miniatures are       peach is stolen Destroyed in          In RATCHED DOGVILLE                          🤝
1337864289315516416 2020-12-13 04:57:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @agentofchaos22 If his girlfriend's lawsuit goes through, he might be thrown in jail.
1337863415595864064 2020-12-13 04:54:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JoeBiden "Limit"? People are still gathering with others. You need to do more than limit and give everyone monthly stimulus checks or UBI + Medicare For All.
1337863061873385473 2020-12-13 04:53:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @NatChrisRod Counseling is good. He's been given chances. Now he needs to be rehabilitated, not enabled.
1337862403883601920 2020-12-13 04:50:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CircuitOnMubiz 😰 Hope you're okay and you mean just logging off for now and will be back.
1337862199973347329 2020-12-13 04:49:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @agentofchaos22 He gave a woman a sexual transmitted disease and abused her as well. This is typical behavior for him.

1337839779589701632 2020-12-13 03:20:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @WilliamWehrs I would love it to...

1337838879177523200 2020-12-13 03:16:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MELADDWILLIAMS @beaumovies 😂
1337838537983463424 2020-12-13 03:15:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> If we can cancel Kevin Spacey, we can cancel Shia LaBeouf.
1337838349982158848 2020-12-13 03:14:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tiredartfriend @65Rickz Awesome, yes yes yes!!!
1337838288489496576 2020-12-13 03:14:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> I might get crazy and do a Ryan Murphy double and watch Ratched (even though it's a series)

1337611538958491648 2020-12-12 12:13:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RadNatureLove Yeah, I mean, our system has deep misogynistic roots, so only those who aren't a**holes will seek to learn and do better.
1337610851910500353 2020-12-12 12:10:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RadNatureLove Yeah, if they strive to change their behavior, great. Otherwise, it doesn't really matter too much.

1336791424218537984 2020-12-10 05:54:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @operadirector @wcbuecker I had it on my calendar. Read that it was the second Wednesday of December. Maybe they changed it or delayed it.
1336788921863180288 2020-12-10 05:44:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wcbuecker The electoral college was supposed to vote today. I guess Texas is trying to sue all states where Biden won and bring it to the Supreme Court. We'll see what happens.

1336569978351276032 2020-12-09 15:14:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cryborg If he were smart... Trump is a little cocky and I'm not sure he will necessarily do that.
1336568486357700608 2020-12-09 15:08:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> Someone will unfortunately be eliminated this round, and another will quite possibly be eliminated the next.
1336568164327383041 2020-12-09 15:07:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> I am an overachiever and it's nothing to apologize about.
1336566309732020225 2020-12-09 15:00:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheCurbAU They are both excellent. It's a tough choice.
1336565146647371776 2020-12-09 14:55:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @mtredden @cryborg Nasty. Can't she be removed for conflict of interest already? And imprisoned for insider trading? This is being investigated, right?
1336545564142419969 2020-12-09 13:37:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @metrotimes @PVujin Yes, I can imagine.
1336545006249672706 2020-12-09 13:35:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tedwheeler Nope. You admitted that you have a problem but you don't want people to hold you accountable. Your tweets are making no sense. Of course they should be protesting you and the fundamentally racist system. Are you out of your mind?
1336544809109004295 2020-12-09 13:34:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tedwheeler It's not judicial to evict someone during a pandemic.

1336469656308105216 2020-12-09 08:36:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thatbasicspoonn Definitely after the directors poll and the base would be Oscar winning actors with some nominees added at my discretion + nomination process so other actors could be included.
1336457646346358784 2020-12-09 07:48:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Doubleh55 She takes a boat to go to NYC. I agree that sometimes it would be challenging with a tight schedule.
1336450321871065088 2020-12-09 07:19:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> A h yes, no one wants to save the earth. Okay.😰
1336449556108595200 2020-12-09 07:16:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> How many have seen I AM GRETA and vowed to take drastic actions to save the earth?  What have you done? Given up meat?  Decided not to take planes anymore? I want to hear.
1336448021354057733 2020-12-09 07:10:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> Would do a top actors poll, maybe, but (most) people are already angered at me because of the top directors poll even though I'm just facilitating it, and not really voting?
1336446397667688449 2020-12-09 07:03:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @possessormovie @BlueOfShoe Hello and thanks!
1336446073271795712 2020-12-09 07:02:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot That was really rude that they did that. I had a chiropractor cut my visit short when his wife stopped in the office and didn't go back. They were charging the same price!

1336222920268337153 2020-12-08 16:15:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> It's a crime. Might use him if the #of polls are odd. But I don't know if it would be fair either way.

1336149501740924930 2020-12-08 11:24:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby, cry.
1336148432478633984 2020-12-08 11:19:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DWLundberg I'm just hoping independent theaters will survive through this and I'm supporting them too.
1336148341390905345 2020-12-08 11:19:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DWLundberg Definitely not. Everyone has the freedom to make their own decisions. If someone makes another decision than I do, that is okay with me.
1336148176739266561 2020-12-08 11:18:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DWLundberg If politicians did their part, we would not be in this mess. I'm not sure that things will get back to normal, but if it does, then it won't be a problem. Things are changing rapidly and the studios, theaters, and distributors need to be creative to stay in business.
1336147806315155457 2020-12-08 11:17:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> $2,000 a month would save lives.
1336147643064492034 2020-12-08 11:16:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DWLundberg I am not an HBO Max subscriber, but I will start my subscription on 12/25.
1336147554216493058 2020-12-08 11:16:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DWLundberg I don't feel it's similar to that. Channels of distribution are messed up due to the pandemic. Assumedly, they might make less, but not distributing it through HBO Max would cause even more damage. People would probably stream illegally and they would probably lose revenue.
1336132966162919424 2020-12-08 10:18:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MayorOfLA So I guess we will forget about that French Laundry episode.

1335803156450533377 2020-12-07 12:27:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> Was trying to write vegan alerts for SNL when I realized the latest episode is not on Letterboxd. 😭

1335752255732023302 2020-12-07 09:05:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> yes? The worst is when they try to give the character another profession but the character is definitely a screenwriter despite the screenwriter's attempt to mask it.

1335725320205307905 2020-12-07 07:18:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PussyGrenade Agnes Varda. I skipped the Coens' last one, because they included predator Jam*s Franco so I would have probably chosen the Wachowskis over Coens, though I've previously generally liked The Coens.
1335724942764122112 2020-12-07 07:16:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @HalalHoxha I was going to do couples next round but I wasn't sure both would make it until then.
1335722308346982400 2020-12-07 07:06:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PussyGrenade I was appalled that Friedkin was/is going to be eliminated. I can do Coen Bros. next round. I was actually surprised it's not close between them and the Wachowskis.
1335722100363993088 2020-12-07 07:05:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thenexthobbit Agreed. Sending hugs.

1335721279911940096 2020-12-07 07:02:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PussyGrenade It's going to get increasingly harder and harder to decide as more directors are eliminated.

1335720972008058880 2020-12-07 07:01:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @pabzicles It was kind of a toss-up between that and The Game since I really like The Game, but can't forget Fight Club.
1335720731171115009 2020-12-07 07:00:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PussyGrenade Believe me, I love Brian De Palma. There were pretty much only high-profile directors left and I wasn't trying to eliminate him in any way (usually if I'm trying to eliminate someone, I pit them against Hitchcock, Kubrick, or Scorsese).

1335693605499936768 2020-12-07 05:12:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @livinmediocre He suggested citizens should be able to fire any employee, a citizen's firing like a citizen's arrest.

1334713864655568897 2020-12-04 12:19:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @livinmediocre That's the problem of the people who own the copyright. They also have a responsibility to make their content available when and where the consumer wants it for a competitive price.
1334713160440270850 2020-12-04 12:16:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Seven16 😂 It wouldn't solve all of my problems, but wait, maybe it would? 🤔
1334712581483765761 2020-12-04 12:14:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Seven16 Agreed! That would be great.
1334712430534877184 2020-12-04 12:13:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @madfrieza Yes, exactly. If they had done that in the first place, we might not be in this boat.
1334709769743998977 2020-12-04 12:03:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Gutzman It was a lifestyle.

1334709048814399489 2020-12-04 12:00:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @mmatusoff That's cool! I have to drive 20-40 minutes to go to a drive-in, but for the right film, it's worth it.
1334708730307309568 2020-12-04 11:58:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @maxtastrophe Exactly. 🙌 The people who put money over human lives = atrocious.
1334708587797434368 2020-12-04 11:58:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> @madfrieza They are not well paid. I've worked at a couple of different movie theaters. In the meantime, they will have to find other jobs except for the places where theaters are still open.
1334708347711320064 2020-12-04 11:57:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @mmatusoff Oh no! Do you have a drive-in close to you at least?
1334708283823673344 2020-12-04 11:57:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Gutzman Exactly. I would average around 4-7x /week. I do not mind changing my lifestyle for the time being.
1334708135227916289 2020-12-04 11:56:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @misterpatches I hate my name blocking the screen but I hate the risk of getting COVID from people taking their mask down to eat popcorn even more.
1334707805421412353 2020-12-04 11:55:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @maxtastrophe Yes. Studios may suffer, but they need to get creative and adapt. There are other ways to survive and this pandemic hopefully won't last forever.
1334707527959789568 2020-12-04 11:54:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> Watch me tag all the whiners who are complaining about Warner movies going straight to HBO Max. Meanwhile, I'm thriving off of this news...
1334706970893275139 2020-12-04 11:51:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> Film critics should just shut up about seeing films on the big screen. Yes, it's a privilege and beautiful, but not worth risking your life and others' for.

1334362702089601026 2020-12-03 13:03:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> If so, what should that percentage be?
1334362558912811009 2020-12-03 13:03:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> If two directors are within a certain percentage, should there be a run-off?

1334346261600763905 2020-12-03 11:58:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> Unfortunately, Orson Welles lost the opportunity to a run-off race by .1%
1334336431804698624 2020-12-03 11:19:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @poshdoII I was also going to try to break the Guiness Book of World Record for most movies seen in a year in 2017 (I think the # was relatively low like 1,200), but you have to have 2 witness for every film and have someone sign each form so that would be 2,400 pieces of paper.
1334336057299456001 2020-12-03 11:18:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @poshdoII I don't have all the dates for all the films I've watched (only since 2005). I think a lot of people binge on TV. I don't know if you know PUNQ on Letterboxd. He watches more than I do. Also,I know someone who has logged over  36,450 on IMDB, but that includes shorts &amp; games
1334333852869746688 2020-12-03 11:09:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @poshdoII Plus my life is watching cinema.
1334333788965376002 2020-12-03 11:09:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @poshdoII Apparently, Roger Ebert had 15,000 during his lifetime. Also, several of those are shorts &amp; episodes.

1333857940311162881 2020-12-02 03:38:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> Also pretty happy that @TheElliotPage and I came out the same week! (Trans and bi respectively)
1333857606171934720 2020-12-02 03:36:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BryanDan1elson I also thought that at the time. Maybe he meant something a little more and I'm glad he can finally embrace who he is.

I was able to get help without it interfering with my work. A lot of people (even in HR) and not trained to deal with mental issues or are not compassionate, so I try to keep it separate.
1333852742872285184 2020-12-02 03:17:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> I saw Elliot Page at a Q&amp;A in 2007 and he described himself as an "actor". That always stuck with me. I am happy for him and accept him now that he has come out as a trans man.

1333274804531564547 2020-11-30 13:00:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> The first vegan alert is real (I wrote it), but the other ones are fake. I would most likely never refer to just an actor (I usually mention the character name)  Also, I capitalize Vegan but not alert, so the last 3 were made up.

1332909962910068736 2020-11-29 12:51:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rachelsfilm because we are drinking milk from another species. Milk is cruel to humans and animals alike.
1332909878541570051 2020-11-29 12:50:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rachelsfilm Vegan alerts are for content that it not vegan, bringing attention to acts of animal cruelty. A cow is raped in order for her to produce milk. I've talked about this a ton, so I'm going to have to come up with some form letter about it. The milk then clogs up the humans' systems
1332908989818970113 2020-11-29 12:47:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VeganRachel I have a Master List so I can write down the movies as I watch them. Also a watchlist so if I scroll through the watchlist later and see a film on it I already saw, then I can add it to the Master List.
1332908498212909062 2020-11-29 12:45:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> Animals WERE killed for that burger.
1332908280838950912 2020-11-29 12:44:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @UntitledBadger Yes but not every day or even every week
1332907700678606853 2020-11-29 12:42:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @1Twit2Twi I only rewatched Midsommar when I was ready to be traumatized. Also, the Safdie Bros. are a bit too stressful to me, but I'll still watch their movies.
1332900426774056962 2020-11-29 12:13:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @academy_queens @obrienjohnjack I seem to remember this happening at the 1951 Academy Awards ceremony when they both lost out to Judy Holliday

1332792533999607815 2020-11-29 05:04:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheRealJet2 @Mas_Stew Me too probably. And I think I used to think they were always one take and it would probably be easy to make a movie.

1332180448944898048 2020-11-27 12:32:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JustinGoss I wish, but PRO means I pay THEM.

1332180021629239296 2020-11-27 12:30:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @FHornHero1995 Yeah, I have two. One personal and this October I put on a short film festival. The link is to the Beyond Corona Film Festival.

1332127738312810496 2020-11-27 09:02:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> Saw Baby Jodie Comer in Rillington Place last night (left).  https://t.co/euFqstP0Xb
1332118241783685121 2020-11-27 08:25:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @themaestro1986 I love them both, but two visionaries in the same bracket. I don't know how Lumet could lose so early on but I like to see this amount of enthusiasm for Lynch!
1332117631185272835 2020-11-27 08:22:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie Read *moots* as *robots*! 😂

1332102548224835585 2020-11-27 07:22:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scott4listener Don't forget to watch it with commentary if you have the Criterion disc.
1332102435444125696 2020-11-27 07:22:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> This time last year I was watching Seberg in the theater on Thanksgiving. Today, I'm binging on films on Shudder.👌
1332099648383721473 2020-11-27 07:11:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jasminelydia17 @imFRUITYLICIOUS Yikes, yeah. I mean if it's as beneficial as he says he is, you'd think he'd be vegan all the time.
1332098012730933248 2020-11-27 07:04:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @imFRUITYLICIOUS Agreed! He was pro-vegan in The Game Changers and I wonder what happened?
1332093068426706946 2020-11-27 06:45:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @courtneygraben @fOrGiVeNcHy @ewarren @SenWarren @TeamWarren 😂 Yeah, I read that too.

1332085516322316292 2020-11-27 06:15:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @pleinsol lol, I understand. I like them both, but inevitably good directors will be eliminated.
1332082023507271680 2020-11-27 06:01:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @pleinsol Eventually it's all going to be narrowed down to one final director. However, yes, Jules Dassin is an amazing director.
1332081416511766529 2020-11-27 05:58:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> Closing the gap.
1332081344596197378 2020-11-27 05:58:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @pepguhly You're smart. Yes, it is. 😅
1332075079006490624 2020-11-27 05:33:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @littlefilme 😂 I don't think I have a chance. I enjoy looking at the pictures, though.

1332063994031472640 2020-11-27 04:49:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> Just wanted everyone to know that Twitter doesn't let you vote if you create a poll, so I'm strangely neutral in all this!
1332063121893048320 2020-11-27 04:46:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @madfrieza I could do that. It might be close again, though. 🤷‍♀️
1332060254453059589 2020-11-27 04:34:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> @paulinaplazas @Tessicat 6 million? Holy.......
1332060060323725312 2020-11-27 04:34:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> This seems to be the race with the most votes so far: 865
1332058765458169856 2020-11-27 04:28:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @NothingRllyMtrz Some directors are almost 50/50 and I want it to be fair in case I matched them up unfairly.
1332058579566641152 2020-11-27 04:28:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @bsimmonds21 I found the link! Sorry, I was so tired last night to look it up right away.  https://t.co/lX2Yr4Tt97
1332054490980044802 2020-11-27 04:11:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RepRoKhanna It would be freeing to a lot of people who wouldn't have to put themselves in dangerous situations.
1332054134938247168 2020-11-27 04:10:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LingoUnbound My biggest problem was not going to the restroom for 3.5 hours so I could sit through The Irishman in the theater. 🤦‍♀️

1332051557223858176 2020-11-27 04:00:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @traingers I've spent my life watching Curtiz's movies. He has a lot of good ones!!
1332051315480883201 2020-11-27 03:59:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SuffocationSong Why not?
1332050787736768512 2020-11-27 03:57:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @FormaldehydeFce All good. I really enjoyed the new one too.
1332050149460197376 2020-11-27 03:54:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @traingers Casablanca? Both are great. I was thinking it could go either way.
1332048712214872064 2020-11-27 03:48:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> @shriiiitt Of course!

1332047776302080000 2020-11-27 03:45:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @forthirtyhours Hitch had over 90% at one point. Wonder if Zombie is going to take this whole thing after all.
1332047518088065024 2020-11-27 03:44:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> I didn't mean to stress so many people out! Happy Thanksgiving and thanks for playing.

1332043912983179264 2020-11-27 03:29:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @katalin_pota Wow. I already know people affected by Disney's layoffs. And it's not just theme park workers who are being affected.
1332043303466930177 2020-11-27 03:27:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @juliacmarchese I worked in a movie theater and would always catch Shanghai Noon on my break. I saw it soooo many times.

1332024272047411201 2020-11-27 02:11:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> Polls where one director is currently winning by 90% or more (a thread):
1332023647020613633 2020-11-27 02:09:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MayoMayonnaise3 I think the person who nominated Zombie just wanted to see what would happen.
1332020512625627137 2020-11-27 01:56:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @hacksawjenny Right? That is the challenge, I suppose. Yes, I find films from both directors to be among my favorites.
1332020299353583616 2020-11-27 01:56:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BraedenGlickman OMG! I am so sorry. I checked all the director spellings, so I'm wondering if it was auto-correct. Thanks so much for pointing it out.
1332019807126863874 2020-11-27 01:54:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @hacksawjenny I know! I love them both.
1332019581796319234 2020-11-27 01:53:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @1001_Films Some were by chance and some were directors with the same last name and some were duos against duos.

1331825474260013056 2020-11-26 13:01:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheCedCed We made him (Dan Levy) trend. 😭
1331824129780064256 2020-11-26 12:56:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @okaypompeii lol got unfollowed by at least 3 ppl today. So cray! I think it's just Twitter can be fickle in general.
1331823194844532738 2020-11-26 12:52:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BlairCordelD It'll be interesting to see what happens! 🤔🤔
1331822388707688452 2020-11-26 12:49:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BlairCordelD Yes, so many great directors! It will be sad to see them be eliminated.
1331821807234547712 2020-11-26 12:47:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @gogettergweg Cool. Added.
1331821731401535489 2020-11-26 12:46:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BlairCordelD He's also been added to the list  https://t.co/B84ZMYUaTI

1331820901965254656 2020-11-26 12:43:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @dementedkirby I'll take it that this is thirding the nomination? I'll add her to the list unless that's not what you meant...
1331820762903109632 2020-11-26 12:43:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @dementedkirby Oh weird. I didn't see that movie but I have it watchlisted.
1331820338049556481 2020-11-26 12:41:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @gogettergweg If you write "third" or "thirded" i'll add her to the list.
1331819486010175489 2020-11-26 12:38:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @reeljoelcopling no, it's cool. 😅
1331819260302086146 2020-11-26 12:37:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sarahcpr my mom had issues. I barely survived what she put me through.
1331816407286259714 2020-11-26 12:25:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @okaypompeii I like to think I helped it become a sensation, but even I could never have predicted the level of a hit it would become.
1331815277575585792 2020-11-26 12:21:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @okaypompeii true fact: I played that song on my college radio station as a DJ before it became a single. LOL.
1331814722920878082 2020-11-26 12:19:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @okaypompeii wow, it's been 23 years? 😭
1331813800685694977 2020-11-26 12:15:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MareVegan1111 I don't know. But I tell my cat "night night" "yum yum" and "bye bye" anyway.
1331813484074418177 2020-11-26 12:14:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kylenicklachlan Run off is okay! 😅
1331810863011880961 2020-11-26 12:03:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RebeliciousUSA @LynnSharig8 I mean, Trump can learn from Nixon or go down in flames. It's HIS choice!
1331810559554043904 2020-11-26 12:02:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LynnSharig8 @RebeliciousUSA Let's hope. 🤞
1331810256473604100 2020-11-26 12:01:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LynnSharig8 @RebeliciousUSA 😂 I doubt pardoning himself will fly. Let's stay tuned and see what will happen. LOL.
1331809843141697536 2020-11-26 11:59:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RebeliciousUSA @LynnSharig8 Bannon seems like the kind of guy that if he is pardoned, he will commit new crimes they'll be able to lock him up for.
1331809514086035457 2020-11-26 11:58:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LynnSharig8 @RebeliciousUSA Yikes. It WILL be interesting to see what happens.
1331808440658718722 2020-11-26 11:54:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RebeliciousUSA @LynnSharig8 I mean, Trump should repeat history and resign so Pence can pardon him if he knows what's good for him. Who knows if his ego prevents him from thinking he did anything wrong though? It's mindboggling!!
1331806870277767171 2020-11-26 11:47:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TallGuyCM I will probably check it out at some point. 🤷‍♀️

1331804612022571009 2020-11-26 11:38:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie CBD, stress ease tea, eating tons of greens, rubbing lavender oil on you is supposed to be good (peppermint oil and or tea too). Lavender and peppermint are weaker, but still work to some degree.
1331799574025883648 2020-11-26 11:18:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @katalin_pota @SusanCollinsFan Same! Glad the first two women are out. And they are out for a reason.

1331792241346576390 2020-11-26 10:49:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> When thinking about posting a picture of a dead turkey this Thanksgiving, just remember... there are vegans out there that don't want to see it.

1331777706749423616 2020-11-26 09:52:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sc0ttymccreery will DM you
1331777416931340289 2020-11-26 09:50:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Nicole_Nonya @RWCombsJr2 I think they're just talking about Pelosi as Speaker of the House.
1331777119660085248 2020-11-26 09:49:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PaulSorrentino3 @PositivelyJoan They are not "worse" per se, but they are enablers, so still no good.

1331742697518862337 2020-11-26 07:32:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> Mackenzie Davis (5'10") standing next to Alison Brie (5'3") is quite the difference!!
1331741007440879616 2020-11-26 07:26:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> #HappiestWatchParty I haven't been reporting EVERY kiss so far but they did kiss again.

1331722613723316224 2020-11-26 06:13:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> Being asked by vegetarians about what I eat being vegan is interesting. They asked what kind of sauces I make and I've literally NEVER gotten that question before.
1331722194129338368 2020-11-26 06:11:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @eilishexpensive I love Billie Eilish, but why am I so crazy

1331621601180147712 2020-11-25 23:31:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @QueenInCalico Not sure, but hoping for the best!
1331493521027547136 2020-11-25 15:02:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @urbanherbiv0re That looks good! I'll be eating a Celebration Roast.

1331481325874757634 2020-11-25 14:14:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @liamhenneberry For me it was May, but yeah, same year!
1331478323571036161 2020-11-25 14:02:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @liamhenneberry Wow, amazing! That is so funny that we've been vegan and alcohol free roughly the same time. I also used to drink a lot and eventually it did more harm than good. No more alcohol for me after July 2018.
1331462692071116800 2020-11-25 13:00:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> I'll create a Teleparty link and pin it tomorrow. People can access it up to one hour before the film starts. Teleparty is an extension that can be added on Google Chrome. We can also use the hashtag #HappiestWatchParty and simultaneously post on Twitter too  @tsasa198 @TheCedCed
1331462157813248001 2020-11-25 12:58:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tiye_s Yes, it seems feasible to create a Teleparty viewing. Will create a link and will post it about an hour beforehand.
1331460410914918400 2020-11-25 12:51:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tiye_s I am not familiar with Teleparty! We usually synch up on Twitter, however, I can look into creating a Teleparty account. I've done NetflixParty a couple of times.

1331446751803318272 2020-11-25 11:56:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BadJohnBrown @FrankLuntz Agreed. Should tax Netflix and Amazon instead.
1331446686590222336 2020-11-25 11:56:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @FrankLuntz As if you were going to use that money to feed children...
1331446169071886339 2020-11-25 11:54:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @apocalliepse perhaps 3 PM PST would still be too late? Checking in in case you're able to make it!

1331442103843393536 2020-11-25 11:38:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheCedCed @tsasa198 Thinking of moving it up to 3 PM PST. I also am done earlier than I thought but I don't want to throw anyone off!!
1331441896820916224 2020-11-25 11:37:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DWLundberg @BNBuzz @Criterion I'd vote for Gilda. The Irishman is on Netflix. The Thin Red Line is good but very intense
1331441552355258369 2020-11-25 11:36:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tsasa198 @TheCedCed Noted.
1331441238948655105 2020-11-25 11:35:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Ogfhere I had pretty much given up on new music.
1331441151295983616 2020-11-25 11:34:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tsasa198 @TheCedCed  Would it work better for both of you to have the watch party be earlier? If not, we can just leave it at 7 PM PST.  Thanks!!

1331346438484234240 2020-11-25 05:18:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @adisonfoal If you go to JoJo rabbit, then sort by friends reviews there's an option to see your friends review or just you. Same thing on desktop or phone.

It's a very sad movie at times, but very good. People also didn't appreciate 7 Pounds and The Pursuit of Happyness by the same director. if you liked the other films he did you'd prob

1329652887887040515 2020-11-20 13:08:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @GnaGallina Unless Gwyneth supported Bernie, I don't really think so (and if Joe made a candle that smelled like his crotch).

1329644433717936128 2020-11-20 12:35:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @poshdoII Will you be stoked to hear that the Saoirse Ronan character was older IRL?
1329641522287890432 2020-11-20 12:23:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Dystopian_Rob Looks like you got bailed out, what about the regular people?
1329625290360856576 2020-11-20 11:19:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> @atomicface Ha
1329623405469941761 2020-11-20 11:11:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @realCEOofANTIFA @ThiaBallerina 😆
1329617610682470401 2020-11-20 10:48:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @anxfilms Saw it May 2018 🤷‍♀️
1329615645651025920 2020-11-20 10:40:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thebklynvegan ♥️
1329615481913761792 2020-11-20 10:40:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thebklynvegan That was in 2017. 2 months later I had them surgically removed and have been okay ever since.
1329615361063350273 2020-11-20 10:39:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @susanorlean @Sam__Weller If you're on the east coast and he's on the west, it WILL be lunchtime for you. 😆
1329615064446296065 2020-11-20 10:38:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thebklynvegan The doctor found some huge tumors and I decided to change my lifestyle.
1329614608210948096 2020-11-20 10:36:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Manimeconquest Exactly. This could have been over if people did the bare minimum.
1329614437028753410 2020-11-20 10:35:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sweetlilhifi I definitely was a junk food vegan at first. I got very healthy, but when the pandemic struck I did resort to some comfort foods. It can take some work to prepare, but it's worth it in the long run.
1329614125756891136 2020-11-20 10:34:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tinybuttler LOL, I've had much worse comments!! I'm good. 😆
1329612511117594625 2020-11-20 10:28:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sweetlilhifi Red meat is the most damaging so you're on a better path than most. I had to cut it out because of my health. If you ever need advice on tips feel free to reach out.
1329611457114243072 2020-11-20 10:24:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sweetlilhifi I know being vegan isn't for everyone, but definitely cutting out as much as possible is best. If you cut out red meat and only stick to chicken and fish, it's a really good start and pretty much where I was before I finally went vegan.
1329610942590504960 2020-11-20 10:22:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tinybuttler Well, I'm sure I didn't get vegans or vegetarians before I went vegan. I guess eating pizza is so entrenched in our societies that it feels weird if someone's speaking out against it.
1329610564943790080 2020-11-20 10:20:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sweetlilhifi I'm *this* close to turning them vegan. I can feel it.
1329610224869670912 2020-11-20 10:19:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RepSlotkin @cryborg Don't say please to these men. We demand they stand up for democracy.
1329609912335228930 2020-11-20 10:18:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @atomicface I was going to say, did you swipe left or right?
1329608814958505984 2020-11-20 10:13:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> Why did this person come back 40 weeks later to pick the same fight? 🤷‍♀️  https://t.co/py9jLQwjl1
1329592795896561664 2020-11-20 09:09:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JoeBiden It'd be your patriotic duty to give us #MedicareForAlll - pls do it!!!!!!! LOL

1329546620946374657 2020-11-20 06:06:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Skitsskat @whoisagrace Nasty! Cancel his ass!
1329546376309424128 2020-11-20 06:05:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> Bernie doesn't want normal everyday Americans who are suffering and getting behind on their rent payments and food and doctor bills to fail. Props to him! &lt;3 you @BernieSanders   Now if @SpeakerPelosi @SenKamalaHarris @SenFeinstein would wake up! IT'S NOT HARD!!!!
1329545448168718338 2020-11-20 06:01:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> $2000/mo? I knew I liked Bernie for a reason.
1329545190629994496 2020-11-20 06:00:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fOrGiVeNcHy No, I tried getting tested twice and they didn't have enough tests. Now they have more tests but I am sick of waiting for tests and if I get exposed to someone, I'd just have to take another test and I'm not important enough to get tested regularly. I usually just stay home tho
1329544477027962880 2020-11-20 05:57:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scott4listener 😆

1329542955892260865 2020-11-20 05:51:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @dontlickchalk I think I would say nothing and just wait until she got out. (and I wouldn't get in the elevator because of her COVID exposure and if she wsn't wearing a mask)
1329542653357092867 2020-11-20 05:50:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chronically1999 Honestly, hair grows back if you don't like it. I was going to shave my head at the beginning of the pandemic. I started cutting it and when it got to a certain short length, I stopped, because I liked how it looked. The biggest challenge is having it grow back evenly.
1329542163022049280 2020-11-20 05:48:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sarahcpr Some states are standing up against Trump, but can you just imagine if they voted for Trump when Biden had the lead with voters and electoral votes? There'd be an uprising.
1329540495526150144 2020-11-20 05:42:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CanuckScots I'm inside my house right now so no! But when I go out (which is rare), I do!!!
1329531887589621760 2020-11-20 05:07:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SpursOfficial It won like four Oscars, but who's counting? LOL!
1329529347107999745 2020-11-20 04:57:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TIFF_NET I like my review of AMMONITE. Hopefully, others do as well.  https://t.co/XYO0vZk0iT

1329524138411638785 2020-11-20 04:37:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tommy_culkin Great! I'll add you, of course. Some people didn't want to be tagged more than once, so I am putting out another call to make sure it's welcome for everyone who applies.
1329523912615424000 2020-11-20 04:36:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cineflixdaily Oh okay! That one has been covered a lot but I didn't see it on the website yet. Will let you know of any other upcoming high profile end-of-year screenings in case those haven't been covered yet.
1329523096462651392 2020-11-20 04:33:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cineflixdaily Will do! Also, I checked for the last couple high profile movies and it seemed they'd already been reviewed on CineflixDaily, however, I should be watching MANK tomorrow probably if you need someone to cover that film.
1329522345199824896 2020-11-20 04:30:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> If I like your reply, that means you're on the list.
1329521997047447553 2020-11-20 04:28:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheEricSpiegel Yes!
1329510331274575875 2020-11-20 03:42:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SimplyARMAAN And of course, if at any time it gets too tiring, you can ask me to stop tagging!!
1329509738455859201 2020-11-20 03:39:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> If you like to get tagged in movie reviews, please reply and I'll include you.

1329501960400093185 2020-11-20 03:09:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> Why the F*** does Twitter allow them to post this nonsense?

The people wanted this kind of thing to go, but Biden is perpetuating a system that will cause global warming. He's not going to be around in 30 years. What does he care?

1329307850921840640 2020-11-19 14:17:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BadgurlJac @_OT__ Thank you! I like to think I am strong most days. Sometimes I am stronger and sometimes I'm weaker than I used to be. So strange. I hope you stay strong as well!!!
1329307656146747393 2020-11-19 14:16:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @zombie_ducky_82 And then go down the line until there's a last director standing.
1329307589213966338 2020-11-19 14:16:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @zombie_ducky_82 Yes, basically, example:
1329307374121697280 2020-11-19 14:15:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ElaniKitten Geeeeeeee
1329304581935751168 2020-11-19 14:04:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BadgurlJac @_OT__ Yeah, I had to juggle some things around today and it hit me a little bit. I know that CBD and eating greens help a lot (with some stress ease tea too), but sometimes it just gets to be a lot. I know you know. 😢
1329302891186700289 2020-11-19 13:58:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> I often cook for my roommate and made a sauce for the pasta that I thought was the best I ever made. He told me it was "bitter" so I gave him another plate w/plain pasta. I came back to find he ate all the pasta with &amp; without the sauce, so glad to know it was edible after all.😅
1329302270006108161 2020-11-19 13:55:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BadgurlJac @_OT__ I hear that.
1329302232404160513 2020-11-19 13:55:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AndyLeeParker1 @SenSanders @MY_MUSLIM Agreed. We needed $15 4 years ago and now we need around $20-22 minimum in California.

1329290421529321473 2020-11-19 13:08:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DOUBT_COMES_IN Maybe this list but maybe we could have an extra week for people to submit the directors they want in as well.   https://t.co/7lVhicigzI
1329290104389607427 2020-11-19 13:07:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fOrGiVeNcHy it's what's inside that counts and...that is too gross and infested and ugly to talk about.
1329289836021202945 2020-11-19 13:06:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BlackBluesee I love Polish directors, but mostly Munk and Kieslowski.

1328533435170734080 2020-11-17 11:00:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> Wow, almost 8 months into this and you sign a mask order now! Better late than never, I guess.

1328505318318346242 2020-11-17 09:08:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RunTheFools4 @JoeBiden I'd love it.

1328502554263576576 2020-11-17 08:57:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Goal__Diggah Would be pretty inexpensive here but it still would exhaust too much of my income 😅

1328499216855879680 2020-11-17 08:44:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> The biggest "F U" is that she didn't sign the letter, so Shamrock couldn't even have the benefit of THAT. 😆

1328474445179092992 2020-11-17 07:06:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chronically1999 I've wasted time in the past liking people who did not like me. If it's not mutual, I just move on and leave that person in the dust.
1328469645272051713 2020-11-17 06:46:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AWood217 All good! My dad's mom is doing well. However, my mother's parents are still alive and not doing so well (and they live further away). I know family matters the most. I will be doing short films in the meantime.
1328468178188476417 2020-11-17 06:41:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AWood217 I sacrificed making my first feature. I also visit my grandmother each year (it's about a 6-8 hour drive), but even though some out of town family members did, I didn't.

1328448945702400000 2020-11-17 05:24:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot I also put it off as soon as I can. It's great having a cleaning, but not worth the risk. I also went at a time when the spike was down, but yes, now it's way back up again.
1328447216990633985 2020-11-17 05:17:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot I'd call your dental office to see what precautions they're taking. I needed something done so I finally went. They had a policy of one person in the waiting room (which someone violated) but wore protective equipment and had me wait until they sanitized the station. Mostly good
1328445097139007488 2020-11-17 05:09:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scott4listener ah ok

1328444621970579456 2020-11-17 05:07:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scott4listener I did see the Sven Nykvist tweet before it got deleted. 😆

1328218853210394624 2020-11-16 14:10:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> to clarify, if you have the talent, go for it. and if you don't, don't. I don't, so I won't.  some actors excel at both
1328217447367802880 2020-11-16 14:04:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> I would never have such a low budget that I would star in my own film. 😭

1328217009432141824 2020-11-16 14:03:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Seven16 Twitter called him out. The media is owned by billionaires and they don't mind the drama. I would hope a great enough % of Americans know the truth.

1328155954588704770 2020-11-16 10:00:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> It greatly annoys me that's it's been over 24 hours since I pointed out a typo in this writer's article (which was marred by her lack of her being aware of women that had come before her) and it's still not corrected. NOBODY misspells Yvonne Rainer's name and gets away with it!

1328126808181465090 2020-11-16 08:04:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fejimanz Some jobs test. They might be experiencing symptoms. Not sure as I believe in COVID and don't understand not believing.

1328123320391266304 2020-11-16 07:50:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MaraWilson Please delete this tweet. QUIET by Susan Cain explains about introverts &amp; gave me confidence as an introvert. We are not gloating over deaths, but dealing with things in our own way. I generally like your tweets, but it's VERY IMMATURE to vilify a whole GROUP
1328122369571897344 2020-11-16 07:47:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Gavin_L_Ross I guess I get how it might be perceived, but telling all introverts to shut up was a bit harsh. We're already not taken seriously and also struggling to find our voices.

1328119090532081664 2020-11-16 07:34:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @veryhyped It comes from a lack of understanding. I asked her not to vilify a whole group and directed to her to a book about introverts so she could gain understanding.

1328118063980371969 2020-11-16 07:29:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @skywlkr_lukem As an introvert, there have been certain aspects I've dealt with better. But for people to throw it in our faces. I haven't been rude about it. And on second thought, I should have just replied to her to delete the tweet. I think I will.
1328117787433177088 2020-11-16 07:28:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Phil_Lewis_ I'm not sure that it's going to make a lot of a difference, if schools and hair salons are open (through 8th grade). Either it's important/life threatening or it's not. Do you know how fast the virus can spread??

1328104048692662273 2020-11-16 06:34:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnthonyHopkins Love that shirt! Saw a trailer for THE FATHER last night. Can't wait to see it.
1328103428048912386 2020-11-16 06:31:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Manimeconquest haha I haven't seen that movie yet, but I guess chess is making a comeback right now

1328102971972874242 2020-11-16 06:29:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @1Twit2Twi @ossoff During a pandemic would be a good time to prioritize MedicareForAll since healthcare is often tied to jobs in the United States and around 1/3 of the workforce lost theirs

1328101020740636672 2020-11-16 06:22:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> I used to play chess with a 6-yr-old. I'd let him win 3 out of 4 times. He'd throw temper tantrums if he lost &amp; knock over the chess board. If he did, I'd clean up the chess board &amp; wouldn't play chess with him for the rest of the day.  Someone needs to take Trump's chess board.

1328057551234056192 2020-11-16 03:29:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> Retweeting because I saw a Gossip Girl meme resurface.
1328056969538617344 2020-11-16 03:27:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rosasreviews @letterboxd I usually keep track on IMDb and if it's not on Letterboxd, I just let it slide. They have been adding TV Series sporadically, though.

1328025491341602817 2020-11-16 01:22:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AdEntertain07 Yes, lol, do you want me to tag you too?

1327904040890449920 2020-11-15 17:19:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> By the way "let me know" means leave a comment. If you just "liked" this, I may be unclear about whether or not you want me to tag you.
1327903780931715076 2020-11-15 17:18:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fejimanz I was going to drive to my old hometown tomorrow (Huntington Beach), but then I heard San Diego and some other cities were shutting down and wanting to be as safe as possible. So I did the drive-in option.
1327902338388881408 2020-11-15 17:12:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ChristerEm Kind of. Not to give it away, but they talked about tagging in the film and I wanted to prove a point.
1327901974579224576 2020-11-15 17:11:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ChristerEm I'll be posting a review and then tagging people.
1327900560591208448 2020-11-15 17:05:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> Got an overwhelming response! Added everyone that asked as far as I know. Will tag when I post a certain review of a film I watched earlier today (not Ammonite).
1327900031190384642 2020-11-15 17:03:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sursharonans I'll probably post a review tomorrow. It was very slow, but great performances by Saoirse and Kate, of course.
1327899039346552832 2020-11-15 16:59:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fejimanz Yes!
1327898420770598914 2020-11-15 16:57:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @FHornHero1995 Why not? Of course, I will.

1327826695462604801 2020-11-15 12:12:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheBMDavies I'll be tagging people in my movie review, but it's also a social experiment to prove a point.

1327821979617873920 2020-11-15 11:53:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> Movie lovers: let me know if it's okay to tag you in a review. You can also let me know if it's NOT okay. This will probably be a ONE time thing.  (P.S. this might not happen within the next day or two)

1327747086482243584 2020-11-15 06:55:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @zachisvegan @DrFuhrman I get the people who are vegan for the animals and are annoyed about people who are in it for health. I was a junk food vegan at first, but ultimately was concerned about my health and changed my diet drastically to be healthy. Either way is fine as long as we're all vegan.

1327714599177650177 2020-11-15 04:46:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @officalilomilo Every day is another milestone. Good!

1327693878607024128 2020-11-15 03:24:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Mas_Stew Then it'll happen!
1327692701936959489 2020-11-15 03:19:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Mas_Stew It'll happen. Just keep paying attention and one day it'll become clear to you.
1327689880722231297 2020-11-15 03:08:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Matthew_Corr I might also watch this today, but one slight problem: I haven't seen 1&amp; 2.

1327686394966278144 2020-11-15 02:54:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PussyGrenade A lot of those movies I saw before I went vegan. I didn't know what to make of Taxi Driver the first time and wasn't used to movies so morally ambiguous (he shoots people up &amp; yet he's good but also very mentally disturbed). Now I can appreciate it more, but it's still not my fav
1327685230866558976 2020-11-15 02:50:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PussyGrenade If I hate it. I rewatched Taxi Driver about 4 years ago. I should have amended my score.

1327684047569522689 2020-11-15 02:45:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> Coolest picture of Martin Scorsese I've ever seen. 😆  https://t.co/ZE5rXqdcjB
1327683707994423296 2020-11-15 02:43:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> I am that person who basically only tweets about films, being vegan, and #MedicareForAll. I hope you're not sick of me... yet.
1327682629177524225 2020-11-15 02:39:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> What made Spicer and Conway funny = Melissa McCarthy and Kate McKinnon, respectively.
1327682102402289664 2020-11-15 02:37:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scott4listener Ah.   Didn't know about the director's background. :(
1327681924156903424 2020-11-15 02:36:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> My ★★½ review of The Nest (2020) on @letterboxd:  https://t.co/Sdo2DaqXLS #veganmoviereviews

1327674028576763905 2020-11-15 02:05:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cevangelista413 @zachbgilbert Is the quote on cancel culture about K3vln Sp*c3y?
1327673435162505216 2020-11-15 02:03:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chefphoteamuh Some people react to soy negatively. If you do, I'd avoid it. Also, was it organic or non-GMO? Most people would react badly to GMO soy and long term, it could be dangerous. If it was organic and you still had a bad reaction, you'll know it was the soy. It's not for everyone!!
1327673040142880768 2020-11-15 02:01:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @poshdoII Dang!!

1327664145378942976 2020-11-15 01:26:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @holmesburytings @TheAWEsumWorld I believe some of their products MAY not be vegan, but a lot of them are. So just make sure to check labels.
1327661835256905734 2020-11-15 01:17:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> I emailed the writer of the filmmaker. On a side note, anything that anyone claims is "historic" has probably already been done. Noting that something is the first this or the first that by people just shows you did not do your research, because it's most likely already been done
1327660385323794432 2020-11-15 01:11:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @holmesburytings @TheAWEsumWorld The options are endless!
1327660341312974848 2020-11-15 01:11:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @holmesburytings @TheAWEsumWorld Annie's has a vegan mac and cheese. Pasta and bread are usually vegan. Just make sure they don't have milk, honey, and eggs in the ingredients. Potatoes are great. I just baked a couple of small ones last night. Season them with salt, pepper, coriander, ginger +onions, mushrooms  https://t.co/e60CkOR6qd
1327659475520552961 2020-11-15 01:07:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> Let's not forget about Dorothy Arzner and Barbara Hammer when talking about history.
1327658230177173504 2020-11-15 01:02:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rejectnation Dorothy Arzner and Barbara Hammer are pretty historic. Know your history.
1327657714420305920 2020-11-15 01:00:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @WilliamWehrs @birbigs The pre-credits were often shorter, but I appreciate your point.
1327657110075703297 2020-11-15 00:58:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @philosophuquery I get it now. The leaf in your profile was a hint.
1327656493005475840 2020-11-15 00:55:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @philosophuquery Brown each side for 4-6 minutes. I can imagine that was gross. Also get organic or at least non-GMO. BTW, if you don't like tofu, there are other kinds of protein. I am not wild about it either and will eat it sparingly.
1327655645412171778 2020-11-15 00:52:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @holmesburytings @TheAWEsumWorld What are some things you like to eat? I can give you alternatives.
1327533479727226882 2020-11-14 16:47:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PoliticsUncens1 Probably not. I'd see photos and memes the next day anyway.

1327514490674442241 2020-11-14 15:31:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @maybe_simone I think it was the same director for both versions 😆

1327511297022279680 2020-11-14 15:18:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie I stumbled on some photos. So crazy!!!
1327510965223526401 2020-11-14 15:17:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> I want to see The Queen's Gambit for one main reason: THE HAIR  https://t.co/gYJ7sYMwFJ
1327508709522636800 2020-11-14 15:08:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Ricky_Vision Just super idealized. (SPOILER)  He did say the mother sold the house, so perhaps it seemed like she disappeared overnight. I could really go with either option.
1327506489980846080 2020-11-14 14:59:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> They quarantined for 14 days before touching each other, right?
1327506139374788609 2020-11-14 14:58:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @GhostArcher3 @iambuterastann It's not written that way though.
1327506018700382210 2020-11-14 14:57:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Ricky_Vision There were parts I liked, but it all seemed so unreal
1327505128002207744 2020-11-14 14:54:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> @GhostArcher3 @iambuterastann the 2 is up against the bracket and hence it's solved first. It's not written as a fraction. It should be in brackets if it's meant to be divided first.
1327504864163688450 2020-11-14 14:53:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> Just saw it tonight. Stargirl had star power, but ultimately despite the female director, the book's author stained it with his male gaze and they weren't able to disinfect it. Stargirl is the most perfect, idealized character and it suffered for it.
1327504235915661314 2020-11-14 14:50:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> it was originally a French film. Doesn't that BLOW YOUR MIND!?
1327504126167511040 2020-11-14 14:50:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> They should just make 17 of these in order to continue the joke.
1327504024736653313 2020-11-14 14:49:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> Pretty darn good.
1327503914489442306 2020-11-14 14:49:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ElsieKFisher is a star

1327490973337747456 2020-11-14 13:58:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> Sometimes I wonder if I am reading the news or elaborately constructed jokes.
1327489677322948608 2020-11-14 13:52:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TrueFactsStated LOL.  https://t.co/gABiRqTLws
1327489285348413442 2020-11-14 13:51:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> What!?!?!? Scarlett Johansson plays new Kevin's bratty older sister in Home Alone 3?
1327486298269966336 2020-11-14 13:39:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> Mickey Mouse forgive me
1327485186490077185 2020-11-14 13:35:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DanRather To think there are that many Secret Service officers! They are supposed to protect Trump, but who will protect them? I would definitely resign.
1327484659618381825 2020-11-14 13:33:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @poshdoII yeah, I think about that movie more now that we're in a pandemic.
1327481201771220994 2020-11-14 13:19:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @0xKasio @ScrtDrugAddict Okay, no one else's answer can top this.
1327480886305067009 2020-11-14 13:18:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Ricky_Vision Ooh!
1327480551167561728 2020-11-14 13:16:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Armin20260802 Generally, I don't like Biden either. He is subpar and it seems like he has dementia -- and I don't say that lightly.
1327480299740020737 2020-11-14 13:15:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ferengimarx When they bought Fox and buried the catalog titles, that's when I knew I had to bring them down.
1327479381904617473 2020-11-14 13:12:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Armin20260802 Oh wow! That is huge.
1327478501130133504 2020-11-14 13:08:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> The day I canceled Disney+ and already they're feeling it.
1327477938262921216 2020-11-14 13:06:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Armin20260802 Ugh! I hate that. Trump also used the Presidency to his advantage and campaigned while Americans lost their jobs and homes.
1327477083342131200 2020-11-14 13:02:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Armin20260802 That's what needs to be done here. People should wear a mask to preserve life. The homeless should be given masks and not penalized, of course. They can't pay anyway.
1327476861656436737 2020-11-14 13:02:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kd7svh @AJWathen @hiloy_ @tbyadriann @iambuterastann You're dividing first, though. That doesn't work.
1327476126432722944 2020-11-14 12:59:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Armin20260802 That's what Americans counted on as well. Centrists during the pandemic /climate crisis = useless.
1327475988993777664 2020-11-14 12:58:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kd7svh @AJWathen @hiloy_ @tbyadriann @iambuterastann Nope. You solve within the brackets first.
1327475514773106689 2020-11-14 12:56:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @iambuterastann 1
1327474990061502464 2020-11-14 12:54:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Armin20260802 Yes! Now if everyone said this, we'd be in good shape.
1327474780681900032 2020-11-14 12:53:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie Ooh, it's nice. I have dark mode on my phone but not on my desktop. So it looks different than your screenshot to me, but still great.
1327473809226559488 2020-11-14 12:49:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> And that's the problem with Americans. We are "cordial" to politicians instead of demanding that they meet the needs of citizens and represent us properly.

1327423876481961985 2020-11-14 09:31:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MasterDesperado He had MacGuffins. Also, his cameos SORT OF became a gimmick.

1327421418837983234 2020-11-14 09:21:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @adamncheek I mean, I remember being upset that they changed the lead actor and still pretended it was a Home Alone movie, but I guess I'm willing to give it a chance.
1327420195141414914 2020-11-14 09:16:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @NothingRllyMtrz 😆I watched it when it first came out. I was so excited and it was such a let down. That was probably before I even knew who our current President was.
1327419331144105985 2020-11-14 09:13:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> Might watch Home Alone 3 tonight before my subscription expires. 🤷‍♀️  Watching Julia Hart's movie first, though.

1327371570784862208 2020-11-14 06:03:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CCortave24 That might change with COVID and fewer ppl doing dramas. However, Saoirse is a top tier actress, so if anyone's throwing money right now, it will probably be at a project she's involved with.
1327371380782821376 2020-11-14 06:02:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @spyderdobro The times they are a changin'
1327371134325587968 2020-11-14 06:01:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CCortave24 Maybe when she gets older and moves into Cate Blanchett territory. She just doesn't seem that threatening right now.
1327370947926474752 2020-11-14 06:01:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CCortave24 *bad guy vibe lol
1327369869931679750 2020-11-14 05:56:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CCortave24 Saoirse doesn't give off a bad guy girl; simultaneously, she could probably do anything.
1327364798229594113 2020-11-14 05:36:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @alexlamerato Happy birthday!!
1327364507857874944 2020-11-14 05:35:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @robcordero I've seen The Kissing Booth but Joey King is the star of that.

1327309390337114112 2020-11-14 01:56:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR Books are mainly better, but there are some exceptions. I've made a list where I compared several books to their movie counterparts   https://t.co/hlzKRxXAyU

1327155144786632704 2020-11-13 15:43:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @letterboxd Rita Hayworth! I can see the comparison. 🤔 Both you and her are one of my favs.
1327150757028761600 2020-11-13 15:26:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> Officially canceled Disney. I had it free for like 6 mos. or a year through Verizon and they made canceling very scary (you'll never be able to sign up with Disney through Verizon again). Whatev.  https://t.co/7vEg7mwV4M
1327144206494814209 2020-11-13 15:00:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Popehat @IanSams Succeed in abolishing the judicial branch and keeping the executive and splitting up the legislative into House and Senate? 😆
1327134239897374723 2020-11-13 14:20:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> Hey guys, I didn't want to go vegan either. And I was like, what do you mean I have to give up eggs? But to me, I felt like it was a matter of life and death and I didn't want to eat animal products when they literally sent me to the hospital. Listen to your body.
1327131672173813760 2020-11-13 14:10:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @_morbidite Me too! 😆

1327074812494180353 2020-11-13 10:24:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @FlippyO @jwindh @susanorlean There is great vegan cheese from Chao, Follow Your Heart, Violife, etc. the only thing you'd be missing is congestion.

1327068607197581312 2020-11-13 09:59:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @susanorlean I hope you get better. My two cents: meat, dairy, and eggs cause inflammation. If you cut it out, you probably won't have to worry about your heart (it will greatly reduce your risk for heart disease and cancer).
1327068109069377536 2020-11-13 09:57:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> Thanks to Lloyd Kaufman for his awesome panel today and for taking time to split off into a smaller group at the end! @lloydkaufman #AFM2020  https://t.co/ZM3FIJHWoV

They're two of the most progressive senators and it's clear that he doesn't want change. The people were not excited for Biden--he is going to do the bidding of is donors.
1327056853868527616 2020-11-13 09:13:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @happygoingrid oh "easy". Well, whenever I want to make a special dessert, I google raw vegan cheesecake (typing in strawberry too usually works). You just have to soak the cashews ahead of time. A blender is good for chopping up the nuts. It's not too bad or difficult otherwise.
1327056050671915008 2020-11-13 09:09:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @veezy1690 @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris @Lakers @Dodgers She has conquered making meaningless platitudes.

1327023806582382592 2020-11-13 07:01:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @mario5et @letterboxd Yep!
1327017823986618368 2020-11-13 06:37:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @hello_adamm @Variety Now is the time, unless people forget to cancel (which I suppose they're counting on) or people need/want the content, because the pandemic is not quite yet over.
1327010725676544000 2020-11-13 06:09:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @dog_rates Beautiful! Very doe-like.
1327010527659233280 2020-11-13 06:08:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Manimeconquest I always review them. I notice that my doc reviews always get fewer likes and less interest, but I'll never stop championing the good ones!!

1326993105246023680 2020-11-13 04:59:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> This race was much like the Trump/Biden 2020 race. It wasn't clear until the last minute who would win, someone else was leading previously, and the  it was much much much too close.
1326992079080210432 2020-11-13 04:55:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BDGarp It depends on the Senate race in Georgia...

1326771861397659650 2020-11-12 14:20:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @littlefilme The first one was great. I saw the last one recently (after seeing the other ones in the series) and it was more of the same but not too bad.
1326771469221851138 2020-11-12 14:19:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Will he listen to the people? We want #MedicareForAll !

1326701852730126337 2020-11-12 09:42:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> Blocking any accounts that are sympathetic to Jamie Spears retaining control of his daughter's life. Maybe she needs a conservatorship? But not one that's run by someone who was violent with her children.

1326279163557244928 2020-11-11 05:42:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rosiecsilva I would heat up some water in a pan and then pour it over your head. Make sure it's not too hot. I've had to do that before.
1326278446482300928 2020-11-11 05:39:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ihavenoshape I'm almost done with my backlog. I'll say no to the rest

1326247762174730246 2020-11-11 03:38:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @pizzahut @BeyondMeat Confirm the cheese is vegan and the whole pizza is vegan!!
1326242040682741760 2020-11-11 03:15:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sweetlilhifi Criterion is much better quality-wise. You'll definitely enjoy most of the films on your watchlist.
1326182445444603906 2020-11-10 23:18:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @OptiUnderground Yes, I've already seen it, though, so I'm watching things I have not gotten around to.

1326059248862724096 2020-11-10 15:08:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> No, I'm not in a bad mood. I'm just watching all the movies on Disney+ I never necessarily wanted to see before my subscription expires. And since I avoided them for so long, most of them don't appeal to me and/or are uninteresting and/or bad.

1325859592832626688 2020-11-10 01:55:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fOrGiVeNcHy In Los Angeles, you can easily find a salad here for $10-12. $5 sounds like a steal! I often use lemon or lime for "dressing" if some is not easily available. But yes, they should have included some dressing.
1325702110822887426 2020-11-09 15:29:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ThiaBallerina Hopefully, they will steal Bernie's ideas which will only benefit us all. Taxing the rich at a higher rate is a good start. Next stop: Medicare for All. #MedicareForAll

I came here hoping to see an apology, but instead I see you thanked him. On behalf of all women, I'd like to say it's counterproductive to vote out a sexist president and then tell women they deserve to make 50-70% of what men do.
1325519180351729664 2020-11-09 03:22:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Di_holis @letterboxd It's my standard rating for Disney films. I didn't feel all the songs were strong.
1325517863256379394 2020-11-09 03:17:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @zombie_ducky_82 Yeah, exactly. That's all he promised, really. We deserve more, as a country.

1325356432116473856 2020-11-08 16:36:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PussyGrenade ah yes, Ed Wood is great. I knew there was a "best" one I'm forgetting. But for sheer fun, Mars Attacks! is my fav.
1325356209189261312 2020-11-08 16:35:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @therealchriswei So many people are agreeing. YES!!

1325345448479973376 2020-11-08 15:52:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @mrgrahamreed @eatentexp Exactly.
1325345058506207232 2020-11-08 15:51:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @robrousseau Yes. At least we got a half-step up from Trump, though. 😬
1325344661091672069 2020-11-08 15:49:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @clarkyfanzine @JohnSimpsonNews @realDonaldTrump 😮
1325344596906270722 2020-11-08 15:49:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> Tim Burton's best movie is Mars Attacks!  Change my mind.
1325343696267571203 2020-11-08 15:45:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JohnSimpsonNews @clarkyfanzine @realDonaldTrump I guess he shouldn't have been golfing all this time!
1325338991042781184 2020-11-08 15:26:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @__kdd2020 Maybe he was tired of all his tweets having warnings on them.
1325332403842293762 2020-11-08 15:00:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> 45 hasn't tweeted in 9 hours. This must be a record and I'm okay with it.
1325331534212001792 2020-11-08 14:57:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ultradamno True. He referenced a lot of old stuff Trump did too and I had to question if it was a re-run even though the intro was new.
1325327488004710402 2020-11-08 14:41:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @FormaldehydeFce Yeah, exactly. Some things never change. And I was enjoying Chappelle's monologue up until that point.
1325326363360858112 2020-11-08 14:36:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @FormaldehydeFce Exactly. People wanted to criticize Donald Trump for being the worst kind of person, but then going back to sexism (but it's okay since we have a liberal President) isn't going to cut it. I felt the same cringiness when I checked out Louis CK's special where he attacked teachers
1325324607398715392 2020-11-08 14:29:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @FormaldehydeFce Chappelle even backtracked by saying, hey, it's a comedy show. But I agree. No excuse for it.

1325318984137203712 2020-11-08 14:07:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> This could work out really well. Joe Biden could just be diplomatic and Jim Carrey could say the things that need to be said. And we could all win that way.
1325318316768980994 2020-11-08 14:04:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @allpwrfloracle Joe Biden wouldn't say it, so Jim Carrey did.

1325302699349274625 2020-11-08 13:02:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @mmatusoff @nbcsnl The news said SNL was going to come on in another 15 mins.
1325302571410489344 2020-11-08 13:02:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Armin20260802 Agreed. Just like the French elected Macron, because he was the better candidate there were still tons of protests and that of course is putting it mildly.

1325267056757911553 2020-11-08 10:41:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DonaldJTrumpJr They don't burn cities. They just like to drive through crowds of protestors. That doesn't make them any more decent.
1325263590371123200 2020-11-08 10:27:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @franklinleonard @TallGuyCM 45 was the first and hopefully last President to be concerned with ratings.
1325262263033344000 2020-11-08 10:22:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BenCloverfield @wbpictures She's on tape abusing him. Not sure why the courts in England didn't convict her. I'm not sure there is a consensus on this despite proof. It's lousy.
1325261967452303361 2020-11-08 10:20:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot Completely agree!! The next President REALLY needs to take drastic action.
1325246079726575617 2020-11-08 09:17:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CarlaRK3 @damnpamfromnamm he was not interested in helping us and we are not interested in helping him. 200K+ dead anyway and he can't buy those lives back
1325243854828654592 2020-11-08 09:08:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @damnpamfromnamm 45 doesn't care about us, never did. He said we could talk about a second stimulus check after we re-elected him and we did not. He will not feel so giving.
1325240126956478465 2020-11-08 08:54:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @lesbians4tulsi lol
1325227014484193282 2020-11-08 08:01:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thespacewetch @GoCubs49 Right before I retweeted this, Django was winning. 🤦‍♀️
1325226900860534785 2020-11-08 08:01:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @immwk @GoCubs49 Agreed
1325225651511590913 2020-11-08 07:56:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Ihatetaysomhill @GoCubs49 It's winning now.
1325224558559784961 2020-11-08 07:52:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DanPriceSeattle @emmauntiem won't get "evicted" until January, but he got the notice anyway.
1325224331920592896 2020-11-08 07:51:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ZackCz @nsbcat hahaha. Mary was the first. Maybe Melania will be the second.
1325224160038055938 2020-11-08 07:50:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR If he doesn't resign so Pence can pardon him, he is dumber than Nixon and deserves whatever he gets.
1325223953984442370 2020-11-08 07:49:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR I don't think so, but I voted "yes" anyway.
1325223815945756672 2020-11-08 07:49:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @mellyfratelli I haven't seen it, but I would at least check it out for Dakota Fanning.
1325222699249987584 2020-11-08 07:44:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> Today California loses a Senator and gains a Vice President.
1325222262610427905 2020-11-08 07:43:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BarryJenkins @littlefilme @AfroJediii Yes, Barry!! Thanks for the encouragement.🙌
1325221695242686464 2020-11-08 07:40:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @littlefilme What is that? The Onion or The MAGA Newsletter?
1325221463410896896 2020-11-08 07:39:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> These past four years are about to seem like a bad dream.
1325212569829715969 2020-11-08 07:04:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jason_pettus Yeah, I thought the "Landscaping Co." part was weird!!!
1325207727933595648 2020-11-08 06:45:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @antiwarmisfit @lesbians4tulsi She is better than Joe (to me).
1325207563718205444 2020-11-08 06:44:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BernieSanders We all know Joe needs to be pushed to the left. Thanks for your encouragement. We will get there by continuing to speak up.
1325207307920183297 2020-11-08 06:43:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @lincnotfound He's still not tired of spreading his hate and sickness.
1325206988016398337 2020-11-08 06:42:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> @lincnotfound Why TF isn't he wearing his mask?
1325206875105755142 2020-11-08 06:41:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @__kdd2020 That is sad AND scary.
1325205632635478019 2020-11-08 06:36:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> January 20, 2021 -- Trump's Presidential mic will officially be muted.
1325204959873282051 2020-11-08 06:34:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @EmmanuelMacron @ohyeahitsjoe @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Merci, President Macron!
1325204259827118080 2020-11-08 06:31:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @antiwarmisfit @lesbians4tulsi Kamala Harris would just take over...
1325195450324983809 2020-11-08 05:56:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @neal_katyal @ToolPackinMama The people have voted. Trump should not be able to do any more damage.
1325195374043127808 2020-11-08 05:56:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> Hopefully, Biden will pack the court and reverse all of Trump's damage
1325195132602179584 2020-11-08 05:55:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @HasBezosDecided It was sweet to see some liberals posting about how now all the kids will be released from the cages. The disconnect is real.
1325194642149666817 2020-11-08 05:53:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BernieBroStar @mcbyrne Biden's trashed Bernie each step of the way. Biden should be ashamed.
1325194119220588544 2020-11-08 05:51:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CinemaMack Oh, I personally did. However, the left as a whole did not. They just wanted Trump out of office. Trump is out of office. Now Biden should be scared about getting re-elected, because he has absolutely no platform.
1325193896029118467 2020-11-08 05:50:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Independent NOPE  https://t.co/XJJyepMhME
1325193505442983938 2020-11-08 05:48:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thehill Yes, he should investigate voting irregularities in his home state. It's a puzzle why Graham was re-elected.
1325193242925658112 2020-11-08 05:47:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> Just remember, Joe Biden made no promises to push the U.S. forward, so we've got to demand: -Medicare For All -Student debt forgiveness -National mask mandate -Livable wages -Higher taxes so companies like Netflix and Amazon pay their fair share -More stimulus checks
1325192653936291841 2020-11-08 05:45:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> There are at least two films on Disney+ I'm pretty sure I have seen, but I didn't log, so I am not 100% sure. This morning I watched The Apple Dumpling Gang, and am pretty sure I saw it as a kid, but rewatched it anyway.

1325190093917679618 2020-11-08 05:35:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kolbytoldme happy birthday!! 🍩🧁🍰🎂🎈🎁
1325189893828472832 2020-11-08 05:34:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @matthewstoller I don't think Biden will do this, but I wouldn't be opposed to it at all.
1325189563074060290 2020-11-08 05:33:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> @mellyfratelli @letterboxd Yeah, the movie is among the most stupid I've ever seen.
1325185262184329216 2020-11-08 05:16:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> My ★½ review of The Death of Dick Long (2019) on @letterboxd:  https://t.co/chdvOObbLz   Also, my A24 ranked list is updated:  https://t.co/UcDDpOK1nB
1325184666316369920 2020-11-08 05:13:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Jeep4x4Tours @BernieSanders @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Both. However, Trump thinks they are socialists. So you can agree with me or Trump, unless you think they are something different entirely.
1325184442097311744 2020-11-08 05:12:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @EboniqueBoyd @GavinNewsom Yeah, I think two. 😭
1325184139276947457 2020-11-08 05:11:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> The burning question is, who was praying harder than Paula White?  https://t.co/amgtwUJLxe
1325133730877370369 2020-11-08 01:51:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> I deleted my tweet about having a special election in California to replace Kamala Harris as Senator. Apparently, @GavinNewsom will be appointing a Senator to fulfill the remainder of her term and Californians don't have a say. 😭
1325130507819102209 2020-11-08 01:38:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @hanslejeune No, once COVID is over and it's safe to travel again, I will probably go back to Europe for at least a visit. I still prefer life over THERE
1325130017882345473 2020-11-08 01:36:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @GavinNewsom yes to Katie Porter for Senator and NO to Alex Padilla who never did count all the provisional ballots in 2016.
1325128750111940609 2020-11-08 01:31:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> The people have chosen: Jim Carrey for President and Maya Rudolph for Vice President
1325128021171302402 2020-11-08 01:28:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ElaniKitten Even when he's in... jail? 🙃
1325127750886125568 2020-11-08 01:27:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @bobbyberk That's nice, but can you practice social distancing? @JoeBiden and @SenKamalaHarris
1325119082182533120 2020-11-08 00:53:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JoeBiden Bernie knows what's up and should be the first person you elect to your cabinet.
1325118719626936320 2020-11-08 00:51:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> Next step: peaceful transfer of power (which might be difficult, since 45 is in denial, but his lies can't save him now)  https://t.co/Y2sDSkFq9w
1325118215400300545 2020-11-08 00:49:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @hanslejeune No, I will not be. I remember in 2016, a very progressive candidate was running and he only got just over 2% of the vote. It's a VERY competitive race.
1325118018075025409 2020-11-08 00:48:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @imnotcomingh0me No one believes this liar anymore.
1325116439833964545 2020-11-08 00:42:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @babyboymonaghan 🙌 I've been waiting for this moment.
1325115913943674880 2020-11-08 00:40:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @realDonaldTrump You never stop lying.
1325115590101540865 2020-11-08 00:39:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @littlefilme But he's not as pretty as Florence Pugh. 😆

1324951770548723714 2020-11-07 13:48:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Remroum @sadsexygemini Ha ha ha. Protesting against Trump. Protesting against Biden. Both are valid.
1324951203780857856 2020-11-07 13:45:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> Not so fast, Eric.  https://t.co/Paee3XSGKQ
1324950686144999426 2020-11-07 13:43:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thomaskaine5 The house of cards fell. He was setting himself up for disaster.
1324950538618761216 2020-11-07 13:43:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> @brooklynnygirl Bernie called it! LOL!
1324949411709898752 2020-11-07 13:38:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LynnSharig8 Instead of being transparent, they hide the fact they have COVID while exposing tons of people to it. The behavior is criminal.
1324949185863458816 2020-11-07 13:37:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BasharM81 We got this! As long as the voters get their ballots.
1324949059442937857 2020-11-07 13:37:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @hello_adamm The worst part is that Biden probably won't make room for Bernie in his cabinet when Bernie was campaigning for Biden when Biden was resting on his laurels
1324948736867360768 2020-11-07 13:36:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @edithdrod LOL!! Great.
1324940799809781760 2020-11-07 13:04:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BernieSanders We would like to thank YOU for always keeping our priorities straight. The neoliberals will fail to thank you and go back to brunch. We progressives will continue to fight!!!!!
1324940566941986816 2020-11-07 13:03:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> Bernie ready with a plan because he knows Biden doesn't know what's going on 😆
1324938442753548288 2020-11-07 12:55:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scott4listener lol

1324934545540481025 2020-11-07 12:39:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheTruthNiggaX1 Well, besides the dance scene. 🤷‍♀️
1324931660375236609 2020-11-07 12:28:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheCedCed Ahhhh, makes sense. I do not watch standard news channels, though.
1324927359456210947 2020-11-07 12:11:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheCedCed I don't know what channel he's on, so I am so out of the loop.

1324924912071397378 2020-11-07 12:01:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @okaypompeii So weird! No one tries to flirt with me. Guess I am too old.
1324923605419880448 2020-11-07 11:56:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka Yeah, but I wouldn't be able to look myself in the mirror working for his company.

1324912697318666241 2020-11-07 11:12:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> Same dude, or no?  https://t.co/RlTm1RvkpB
1324911747413651458 2020-11-07 11:09:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @agentofchaos22 I don't have a list. It's kind of hard, because most of the high-profile movies are released toward the end of the year.
1324910735533641728 2020-11-07 11:05:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> Just the dancing....
1324910653904052229 2020-11-07 11:04:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> Noé's CLIMAX should have been a 1 minute TikTok video and that's it.
1324909733279539200 2020-11-07 11:01:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @agentofchaos22 I'm just indie. A lot of the money goes to the actors, but there are exceptions to every rule.
1324908675975180288 2020-11-07 10:56:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @agentofchaos22 I write scripts and do all sorts of things.
1324908049727827969 2020-11-07 10:54:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cambregabriel19 Thanks.
1324906751599104001 2020-11-07 10:49:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> @agentofchaos22 Yes, the worst. He scams the system to get richer without accommodating his employees. I'm sure the film division is better paid, but still. I have to draw the line.
1324905306804035586 2020-11-07 10:43:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @spaceprincess77 Thanks!
1324904377782476800 2020-11-07 10:39:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Blackmigrantgrl He's pretty near the top when Donald J. Trump and Mitch McConnell exist. Elon Musk is up there too.
1324904120600289280 2020-11-07 10:38:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @agentofchaos22 Underpaid his Amazon employees, gives them 1.5 min. bathroom breaks, doesn't provide a livable wage while making billions, knowingly exposed over 19K workers to COVID, because he wanted to make billions upon billions upon billions. Basically, he is greedy, selfish, &amp;exploitative.
1324903654772547589 2020-11-07 10:37:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> Or Vanity Fair.   https://t.co/2eU3g91Who
1324901540025397248 2020-11-07 10:28:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @agentofchaos22 Sure did, without reservations as well.
1324901457686978561 2020-11-07 10:28:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BlairCordelD Yes, very tempting, but Bezos is vile.
1324901321820966912 2020-11-07 10:27:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TRVary77 Yes, but if they employed me, I'd be helping them make more money for Bezos. And that is not my goal.
1324901088168869888 2020-11-07 10:26:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BlairCordelD "Creative Assistant to Co-Head of Movies"
1324900208761692162 2020-11-07 10:23:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> Amazon posted a really cool job for their movie department, but I think I'd fail the interview when I explained that I think Jeff Bezos is the most evil man in the world.
1324899262908559362 2020-11-07 10:19:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LynnSharig8 That's a good one. Maybe "Crybaby", though.
1324896310860787713 2020-11-07 10:07:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Manimeconquest Thanks!
1324895623678631936 2020-11-07 10:05:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @veryhyped @wesjunkie Now the Supreme Court wants PA to separate the mail-in ballots that came in after election day. If the USPS (Louis DeJoy) had done his job, this wouldn't be an issue.
1324895414550630400 2020-11-07 10:04:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> I posted a casting notice to make a short film today on ZOOM. If all goes well, I'll never direct in-person again.
1324894911729078273 2020-11-07 10:02:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @veryhyped @wesjunkie Oh wow. I am avoiding the political conversation with some family members and people who I know to be Republicans. JUST IN CASE.
1324894074223042562 2020-11-07 09:58:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheCedCed Jaden Smith is vegan and has a vegan food truck for the homeless, so he has racked up serious points with me.
1324892078967451649 2020-11-07 09:51:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie After 2016, this seems like a piece of cake. I wasn't upset, because the real loss came when Bernie wasn't made the nominee so everything's shot to hell now anyway.

1324889484698087424 2020-11-07 09:40:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BasharM81 @wbpictures From what I can tell, he lost a lawsuit in the UK against the abuse from Amber Heard. So WB is punishing a victim of abuse (Johnny).
1324889138173145091 2020-11-07 09:39:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie *now
1324888771469299712 2020-11-07 09:37:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie Yes, but now it's looking pretty promising for Biden so Trump is melting down on Twitter and threatening with lawsuits (not how he can sue so much and be in debt so much as well)
1324888110589648896 2020-11-07 09:35:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BasharM81 I mean, it could, but I find that's highly unlikely

1324876982161584128 2020-11-07 08:51:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RobertPWoolford He doesn't want to lead. And he doesn't want not to lead. It's a lose-lose situation for him.

1324867640616218624 2020-11-07 08:13:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> For those awaiting Trump's meltdown, let me tell you: it's already begun.
1324867412106211328 2020-11-07 08:13:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @realDonaldTrump You could make the claim but you'd be wrong. That's the difference.
1324867316664864769 2020-11-07 08:12:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @realDonaldTrump You have no case!
1324866716719968256 2020-11-07 08:10:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tittyliciousjen I will recommend Traditional Medicinals' Stress Ease tea. Either that or anything with skullcap herb greatly helps with the cramps. I use it instead of Ibuprofen.
1324864188712275968 2020-11-07 08:00:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> And Biden takes the lead.

1324613553748205568 2020-11-06 15:24:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> A lesson I learned about 2.5 years ago: don't ruin your liver just because Trump and others are assholes.
1324611603916976128 2020-11-06 15:16:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> I blame Trump for all the COVID deaths this week and also all the ones due to alcohol poisoning.

1324501389771354112 2020-11-06 07:58:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RealMelValentin I lost some followers even some "friends", but... yeah, people come &amp; go.
1324499844048711682 2020-11-06 07:52:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @hanslejeune I'm sure! I wish our country would cut its military budget. We never seem to have money for anything else like healthcare or education.
1324499446659383298 2020-11-06 07:50:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> Thanks for everyone who's still with me through all the election talk.
1324496840281088001 2020-11-06 07:40:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @hanslejeune Sounds good!
1324467901865160705 2020-11-06 05:45:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> No matter who is elected, we will have our work cut out for us holding politicians accountable, holding their feet to the fire, as we demand racial, social, and environmental justice. 🙌

1324408907364626432 2020-11-06 01:51:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sarahcpr It's incredibly close. A GA or PA win would greatly help Biden and it's kind of what he needs.
1324391718993629184 2020-11-06 00:42:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @winchestee1 He's apparently getting 80% of the mail-in votes, so it looks promising for him, but it's incredibly close no matter what anyone says.  The delay in results could be good to lessen the time Trump supporters have to riot.
1324391428877770752 2020-11-06 00:41:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BeauWillimon It's incredibly close. Biden needs GA or PA and that's assuming he already has AZ or NV.
1324391134995468288 2020-11-06 00:40:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @webcodepro @BeauWillimon That's what they say every 4 years and nothing is done.
1324390936185462784 2020-11-06 00:39:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @winchestee1 It looks very hopeful. I've already assigned Biden the 11 delegates from Arizona so he'd better not lose them. He needs them.

1324371082766266369 2020-11-05 23:20:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @_ShauryaChawla @Twitter The President misleading everyone about the election process. Not sure why they are not screaming for his resignation.
1324260304293752832 2020-11-05 16:00:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheMike31 Nice try. If the election were delayed the Speaker (Nancy Pelosi) would take over and if it's deadlocked, the House decides.

1324098161300832256 2020-11-05 05:16:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka That is okay! I already have Biden down for winning Arizona and Nevada. NV is only 6 delegates. He still needs a state with a moderate amount of delegates 8-9+ to win.
1324093621587439616 2020-11-05 04:58:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka We need one more state that's on the fence. FL or Texas would be helpful but unlikely. GA or PA might pull through. Joe needs at least one more state, though.

1324037552429395968 2020-11-05 01:15:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @reospositivepov I was thinking more along the lines of Bernie Sanders
1324037493411311616 2020-11-05 01:15:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scott4listener They're just counting the mail-in ballots, that's all.

1324035969729720320 2020-11-05 01:09:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @hanslejeune Pretty good. It looks like Biden will win, but all the votes need to be counted. Biden doesn't have what it takes though, so I was upset when Bernie Sanders suspended his campaign. The people getting upset now kind of failed to see what was going on.

1324011587322089474 2020-11-04 23:32:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @happygoingrid Biden basically needs one more state like Pennsylvania or Georgia. It'd be premature to say anything so they really need to count the mail-in ballots.

1324003927247876097 2020-11-04 23:01:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rosiecsilva That's so close. Especially when they have 10% of their votes left to count.
1324003718358917120 2020-11-04 23:00:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Deadhunter10141 NYTimes has him at 227 and Trump at 213. There are several states that haven't counted all their votes yet including important states like PA and GA.

1323883088330457090 2020-11-04 15:01:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Darth_Pingu Ok. Thanks.
1323882399185342466 2020-11-04 14:58:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> @joanjuneau Biden is behind about 380K votes in Florida according to the New York Times.  https://t.co/fZ4Vid32H0
1323882033668476928 2020-11-04 14:57:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TravC77 @joanjuneau GA is looking pretty red right now. I was surprised but I guess we will have to see.
1323880455041511424 2020-11-04 14:51:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Terri_White Are you talking about Biden or are you talking about Trump?
1323879817083678721 2020-11-04 14:48:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @joanjuneau He REALLY needs PA, plus another state with a moderate # of delegates.
1323876886158614529 2020-11-04 14:37:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Afsanehbaf The Dems ran a horrible candidate so we will have to wait a couple of days to know for sure. I agree Trump was worse, but there are a lot of nutcases out there.
1323871409890758656 2020-11-04 14:15:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @somecrusader1 CNN was very slow in reporting early on in the night and AP &amp; NYT posted the results much faster, so I gave up on CNN early on.

1323868405225590785 2020-11-04 14:03:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cardamonfives PA and WI  (currently going to Trump) with AZ,MI, and NV would let Biden win. However, PA &amp; WI are not guaranteed at this point.
1323868027356471298 2020-11-04 14:01:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @michaelmnola I've been following NYT all night. Going by their predictions, mail-in ballots would have to flip 2 medium states and 1 huge state for Biden to win.
1323867312189927424 2020-11-04 13:58:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cardamonfives How? I've tallied up all the delegates and several states would have to flip at this point.
1323867062658199553 2020-11-04 13:57:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rosiecsilva It's possible.
1323866450403102721 2020-11-04 13:55:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AtomicToasterYo I guess so. It's gonna take several days to count the mail-in votes.
1323866297319370752 2020-11-04 13:54:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cardamonfives Biden would need both states + TX or FL
1323865597059321856 2020-11-04 13:52:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AtomicToasterYo To be fair, I thought he was going to give a concession speech.
1323864138414661634 2020-11-04 13:46:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> Joe Biden just remarked: "Keep the faith. We're gonna win this."  🤷‍♀️
1323863607021481984 2020-11-04 13:44:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RyanShead depends on mail-in ballots
1323862955805478913 2020-11-04 13:41:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ferengimarx I didn't have a prediction. The scary thing is I'm adding up the delegates according to what The New York Times is predicting.
1323859937248768002 2020-11-04 13:29:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TAGMovieReviews Stay safe! Hoping for a better 2021 as well.
1323859688157446144 2020-11-04 13:28:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @horrorandgamer I can't even imagine people voting for that man at this point.
1323859463204343808 2020-11-04 13:27:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @robcordero True, and yes. Very close.
1323859396456165378 2020-11-04 13:27:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BasharM81 All 3 states are currently showing as going to Trump. So yes, mail-in ballots could help change the course.
1323859187542077440 2020-11-04 13:26:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ktparker24 Nevada was supposed to go to Biden. With such a small % reporting, it could change fast. But Biden is going to need more than just NV out of the remaining states.
1323858583084171265 2020-11-04 13:24:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> Of course, we are expecting a ton of mail-in ballots to arrive. And perhaps this could significantly change things.
1323858357732569089 2020-11-04 13:23:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> Looks like Nevada (less than 1% reporting) and Montana may go to Trump. More votes have been counted for Texas, but that only made the gap between Trump and Biden votes wider. Texas currently going to Trump.   It could look like: Trump (291) - Biden (243) at this rate.
1323857327875764224 2020-11-04 13:19:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> Breaking out the hemp REALLY soon.
1323856829600858125 2020-11-04 13:17:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @nickiprice27 @davidfrum I ranked the initial 20 Dem candidates and Biden was all the way at the bottom for me personally.
1323856274283401216 2020-11-04 13:15:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @flixnut1 😉 Fair enough!
1323856084558213120 2020-11-04 13:14:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie Unfortunately, NYTimes is being over optimistic. Unless things change big time and mail-in ballots change the status of big states, we could be looking at 282 Trump- 252 Biden.
1323855605342203904 2020-11-04 13:12:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie California

1323853557842415616 2020-11-04 13:04:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ljwr_ Hopefully, or we are in real trouble.
1323851247795855360 2020-11-04 12:55:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ljwr_ All three of the above states are reported to go to Trump. Hopefully, something changes.
1323850800255311872 2020-11-04 12:53:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scott4listener I just added up all of the delegates. The NY Times is showing 209 (Biden) vs 118 (Trump) but all those smaller blue states add up to big numbers.

1323844962832719878 2020-11-04 12:30:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @veryhyped According to the figures as they stand right now, as reported by the New York Times, I have Trump getting 282 delegates and Biden getting 252. However, not all states have reported and it's very close in several big states.
1323842623619043329 2020-11-04 12:20:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Leo_from_Ohio Exactly.
1323842527791771649 2020-11-04 12:20:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie Already thought of it. I have no clue. It could happen. The Vice President breaks the tie for the Senate. Have no idea about a 269-269 standoff. Has never happened before.
1323841820497833985 2020-11-04 12:17:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @veryhyped NYT is projecting AZ will go to Biden. I almost have the delegates in my spreadsheet tallied. So far I have Trump at 250 and Biden at 218. Losing FL or TX or PA is detrimental to say the least.
1323840332287504384 2020-11-04 12:11:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @veryhyped I'm tallying up potential electoral votes in a spreadsheet. It's insanely close + all the mail-in ballots have yet to be counted.
1323839286853005313 2020-11-04 12:07:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @reeljoelcopling Yes, but with grape juice I could pretend it's wine.
1323839178384187392 2020-11-04 12:07:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Armin20260802 In CA, yes. I remember 2016 clearly. Trump was ahead early on and Hillary never caught up. It's very close for Biden, but he is ahead of where Hillary was.
1323838971827290118 2020-11-04 12:06:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> NY Times is projecting Biden will have 205 delegates and Trump will have 112.  The only problem here is they are throwing delegates to Biden from states that are reporting 0% of their votes. Several big states are too close to call or going to Trump (PA, FL, TX)
1323836543706959872 2020-11-04 11:56:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> Polls in California close in 3.5 minutes!
1323836271802740736 2020-11-04 11:55:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> Was going to drink organic grape juice in lieu of wine, but I opened up a big jug of apple juice that needs finishing, so apple juice it is.

1323814631115141121 2020-11-04 10:29:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rosiecsilva It may take all night... all the votes won't be tallied for several days, but they'll probably be able to figure it out once Hawaii and CA's votes are counted.
1323811408996265987 2020-11-04 10:16:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> Texas is too close to call. Don't  stress out just yet.

1323809630510751745 2020-11-04 10:09:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @realDonaldTrump Biden has 119 delegates and you have 94. Yeah looking good. lol!!
1323809340885618689 2020-11-04 10:08:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie It's close, but I believe Trump was winning early on in 2016 and I expected Hillary to catch up and she didn't. You can add 55 delegates to Biden because CA is going to go to him.
1323808045466480641 2020-11-04 10:03:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @valleyofthemud @ThiaBallerina They didn't learn when Hillary lost in 2016.
1323807849038819329 2020-11-04 10:02:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie They prematurely assigned Biden the electoral votes they thought were coming to him but Trump caught up.

1323791727157628933 2020-11-04 08:58:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> CNN's website is not updating fast enough. I guess I will look for another site to reload all night.

1323790994999963648 2020-11-04 08:55:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheSkepticalV Yes, but some are set on voting on election day. That, and not all states offered mail-in ballots.
1323790438701035525 2020-11-04 08:53:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie They are projecting. But we can give VA's electoral votes to Biden for now if AP is saying it. 🤷‍♀️
1323785994148216832 2020-11-04 08:35:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @agentofchaos22 Oh yeah. Not sure the film had a point. It's like someone threw $$ at some guy who said he had an idea. But that's all he had. And not a very good one at that.
1323785162686042112 2020-11-04 08:32:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RunTheFools4 They still need to count 50-57% of their votes, though.

1323771322967580672 2020-11-04 07:37:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> @NeonEilishghost That's less than 19K votes, though. I would imagine there are so many more registered voters in KY.

1323764522096553985 2020-11-04 07:10:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @zachisvegan Yes, I was super congested and now I can breathe way easier. I have my non-dairy ice cream, cheeses, milks, and creamers so I am not suffering.

1323762246158147584 2020-11-04 07:01:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @happygoingrid Oh yeah. And potentially a long next couple of days. And if Trump "loses" and throws a hissy fit, it could be a long next couple of months.
1323762105321881600 2020-11-04 07:00:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ClientJournoExp we knew by about 9 PM PST in 2016. This year could be different because of all the mail-in ballots.
1323761801385766912 2020-11-04 06:59:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @happygoingrid 2:59 PM PST here
1323761695215427584 2020-11-04 06:59:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @emilyxwade since there are so many mail-in ballots. However, if there's a landslide, it'll be easier to tell.
1323761593432240128 2020-11-04 06:58:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @emilyxwade Yes. In 2016, it was pretty fast. Donald Trump had a ton of electoral votes early on, so I thought Hillary would catch up when they got to the west coast. I think we "knew" by 9 PM PST. But not all votes were counted. It's just projected. This election could be more complicated
1323759119514267649 2020-11-04 06:49:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Mas_Stew Some titles are out of print. Plus, they can't go broke.
1323758807864934400 2020-11-04 06:47:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @emilyxwade Polls close at varying times from state to state. Some places close 6 PM EST and some 9 PM EST. It will take time to count, though so who knows?
1323757839857315840 2020-11-04 06:43:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> No matter who is elected, one thing will remain the same: assholes will be assholes.

1323733540471627776 2020-11-04 05:07:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DavidSagredo3 @NataliaShae I hope so too. Yes, it's embarrassing and crazy.

1323726762031738880 2020-11-04 04:40:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @NataliaShae I assume most of those people are not Americans.
1323724517043171328 2020-11-04 04:31:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AndyLeeParker1 @glowingcanary Indeed. If this is any indication...
1323724203154055170 2020-11-04 04:30:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> Not too late to watch!
1323723111947120641 2020-11-04 04:25:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @NataliaShae I accounted for the non-USA people voting and potentially people under 18 years old. Also, a lot of people with felonies or people in jail can't vote.
1323722238818877440 2020-11-04 04:22:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @astrdmagnussen Technically, you could get a sticker and NOT vote, but I doubt too many people would do that.
1323722102705250304 2020-11-04 04:21:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @astrdmagnussen Yes, you get a sticker if you get your ballot in the mail. Not all states allow for mail-in voting, but California does. If you choose to vote in person, they have stickers there. I have seen different stickers in different counties/states for the same election before.

1323643512491892737 2020-11-03 23:09:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> Today we decide whether we get Jim Carrey or Alec Baldwin for the next four years.
1323642832347779072 2020-11-03 23:06:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @goIdIungs Not that great.
1323533670892756992 2020-11-03 15:53:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @spyderdobro Organic grape juice (I am sober and I expect the results to be sobering either way)
1323528941437530113 2020-11-03 15:34:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sithlordolive I believe it's Norwegian.
1323528292876443648 2020-11-03 15:31:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @madfrieza People often write idealistically when talking about politics and ignore the way things are.
1323526958303490048 2020-11-03 15:26:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> Also, I saw Sightless, because the movie poster reminded me of Thelma and that was a huge mistake.  https://t.co/H8djyJuK06
1323525989528334336 2020-11-03 15:22:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JuddLegum we know
1323525785286635520 2020-11-03 15:21:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @_ShauryaChawla Especially since he's known to vote against his own interests and to go back on his word.
1323525113786986497 2020-11-03 15:19:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> Sister posters  https://t.co/mYP4KGQRyc

1323520485695528960 2020-11-03 15:00:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Finaedel @libe De rien
1323520396763688962 2020-11-03 15:00:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cryborg He could really just get escorted out.
1323515217980977152 2020-11-03 14:39:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jamesrai100 😆
1323514659073265664 2020-11-03 14:37:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @libe Je suis américaine et j'ai voté contre Trump.
1323511970809540609 2020-11-03 14:26:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @discountkyrie 😂
1323511534954270721 2020-11-03 14:25:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @discountkyrie Awesome!
1323510884946255874 2020-11-03 14:22:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @_SanEve I vote for George Gascón
1323510558239326209 2020-11-03 14:21:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie Some people are fooled at least.
1323509590856671233 2020-11-03 14:17:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> How many are planning to vote on Tuesday?
1323509116044632066 2020-11-03 14:15:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @KamalaHarris @stockguy61 @JoeBiden And then we will be right back to where we started. So.....what about #MedicareForAll??
1323508656411832321 2020-11-03 14:13:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie Basically a way to make sure the oligarchy gets to choose whoever rises to power.
1323507758071570434 2020-11-03 14:10:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> An O Brother, Where Art Thou reboot or a Trump biopic?
1323504097165635584 2020-11-03 13:55:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Manimeconquest I agree but I wasn't talking about him. 😂
1323503812271775750 2020-11-03 13:54:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> Why did my autocorrect think I meant Buñuel instead of Bibi?  https://t.co/SfuGXjpCyC
1323503386046599168 2020-11-03 13:52:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @happygoingrid No
1323503345068253186 2020-11-03 13:52:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scott4listener Where is the equal button. Liv is arguably more attractive but Bibi is beautiful in a multi-faceted way and could almost be Liv's doppelgänger.
1323501998944133120 2020-11-03 13:47:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @filmfeline 😂 Too bad for him!
1323500224531165184 2020-11-03 13:40:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @filmnerd85 I used to see someone that looked WAY younger. By the time I found out his age, I was okay with it. But I mean, the face should someone resemble what they are promoting online.
1323498021183655936 2020-11-03 13:31:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> @filmnerd85 Thanks. Not too bad on Zoom when you can end the conversation early.

1323488966260092928 2020-11-03 12:55:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> Tim Allen's face in Santa Clause 2 is as red as Trump's face is orange.  https://t.co/kHTYnQykTj

1323485067423883265 2020-11-03 12:40:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnarchoMael A bunch of people were requesting them for Halloween. That's all I know.
1323484602523029504 2020-11-03 12:38:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> I know it's not Thanksgiving yet, but I'm chucking my D+ subscription when it's not free anymore. Now watching: The Santa Clause 2 (2002)
1323484092818628610 2020-11-03 12:36:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> It's always important to spell a person's name correctly. Case in point:
1323473567053352961 2020-11-03 11:54:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> Whether I scroll on Twitter or try to watch a horror film on Shudder, people's reactions are all the same.  https://t.co/jB0odYhjBo

1323472059792465920 2020-11-03 11:48:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> I had a code to check out Hulu during awards season (just the film they were propping up) and it expired and I'm PISSED
1323471144582668288 2020-11-03 11:44:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @realDonaldTrump We've already had no school/graduations/weddings with you. Projecting much?
1323469958932647938 2020-11-03 11:40:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ditdots_ Lucid dreaming is the best part about being alive.
1323467567449567232 2020-11-03 11:30:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @veryhyped @RealRadReviews good cast good jokes good times
1323466461860356096 2020-11-03 11:26:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> @WFLA If he loses the election, they will storm in and take him if he doesn't leave. 🤷‍♀️
1323465201765679106 2020-11-03 11:21:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jiya6285 @Andy Yes, he is a POS as well.
1323463154878181377 2020-11-03 11:12:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @travis112096 I'm working on it!! I'm working to become my own version of the Duplass brothers.
1323462917107277826 2020-11-03 11:12:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> People asking for the Snyder cut when all I want is for Atom Egoyan to release CITADEL.
1323461600192327680 2020-11-03 11:06:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Doubleh55 @RealRadReviews 👍
1323461447926468608 2020-11-03 11:06:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ToeKnee_C Well, maybe if we had locked down immediately until the numbers were safe, we wouldn't be where we are.
1323461260793450496 2020-11-03 11:05:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> Me looking at jobs that specify they need someone immediately, passing, because I know that AFM is next week. 😌
1323460956811194369 2020-11-03 11:04:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @liamhenneberry 😂
1323460301275111426 2020-11-03 11:01:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka No, not him either. 😅
1323460027387011072 2020-11-03 11:00:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie I dropped off my ballot yesterday!  https://t.co/nEKsq1zduD
1323459866359341056 2020-11-03 10:59:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> Watching people post recent unmasked "night on the town" pics of themselves with friends makes me a lil' angry.
1323459360790515713 2020-11-03 10:57:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka I must be one of the few girls who Leo does nothing for, though.  https://t.co/cPk9wQAaRC
1323458950382063622 2020-11-03 10:56:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @oats_lady What a sweetheart! ♥️
1323458337992630273 2020-11-03 10:53:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie That awkward moment when I checked out the tweet that you quoted and realized it was from 2013. Once a narcissist, always a narcissist, I guess.
1323458105582120961 2020-11-03 10:52:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> Turning up the volume on the horror movie I'm watching on Shudder, because I really don't need to hear my neighbor's phone conversation. 🤫
1323457487064846337 2020-11-03 10:50:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie 😆
1323457320420958211 2020-11-03 10:49:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @comradespice No, she is too young for me to crush on, but I do enjoy her music a lot.
1323456900030029824 2020-11-03 10:48:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> I never really post about my celeb-crushes despite really wanting to.
1323456762595348480 2020-11-03 10:47:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RealRadReviews Yes 🤷‍♀️
1323454864446300161 2020-11-03 10:40:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @StevenBeschloss @Wasatchwarrior No wonder he's been campaigning despite contracting COVID.
1323453786862411776 2020-11-03 10:35:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fiImwife 😆
1323437251464884225 2020-11-03 09:30:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> Everyone: don't all be nervous and stress-out at once now. 😅

1323436724572229632 2020-11-03 09:27:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @davo_arid 😆 I don't recommend voting for Kanye, but if anyone does, I can't judge. It's not like we had great choices this time around.
1323436204604284928 2020-11-03 09:25:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> No vote shaming. We live in a democracy.

1323434985445969920 2020-11-03 09:21:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Mralienplayz1 Maybe The Birds, Shanghai Noon, or The Wizard of Oz.
1323434042348298240 2020-11-03 09:17:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> Don't worry: after election day, I'm going to forget about politics and go back to talking about film. Everything will go back to normal.  (just kidding -- it never stops, and we must always hold our politicians accountable)
1323431353577172993 2020-11-03 09:06:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thespacewetch Create one regardless

1323430345815937028 2020-11-03 09:02:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> I see three young women brainwashed to be "excited" about someone who wants to take away their rights.

1323424201257086977 2020-11-03 08:38:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @silverncopper Narcissistic liar  (if you had said 3 words, I'd have added "orange")
1323423812575133697 2020-11-03 08:36:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wherbkat 😂😂😂
1323415098711367681 2020-11-03 08:02:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Andy Joe fingered his staffer and vilified Anita Hill while fasttracking her abuser to the Supreme Court. Let's not wear rose-colored glasses now.
1323413989259309056 2020-11-03 07:57:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @latimes Um, hey, try putting this into the entertainment section... your newspaper comes off like a trashy tabloid.
1323413201812271104 2020-11-03 07:54:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @NothingRllyMtrz Pretty cool.
1323408207339909120 2020-11-03 07:34:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @realDonaldTrump Then why did you want to abort Tiffany?

1323405194848210944 2020-11-03 07:22:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @littlefilme I don't forget. I just move on to log on to the next movie.

1323398476072300545 2020-11-03 06:55:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @theveganting Long story short, I made mashed potatoes (with vegan cheese) and sweet potato casserole. The pumpkin purée I had got moldly so I made a raw vegan cheesecake a few days later.  https://t.co/i3V986j7WT
1323389681568948225 2020-11-03 06:21:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @NicUrbPMP @black_mixed Same. I sought to understand them, but there is no understand people who spit on democracy.

1323380863946514432 2020-11-03 05:45:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevinveegan I like his earlier work. His later work suggests losing touch with reality.
1323380732769656833 2020-11-03 05:45:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Georgelucaschin No, but some people thought so.
1323373807701143554 2020-11-03 05:17:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BruceLaBruce ...for picking up too-young boys in the park and for making SALO one of the most disgusting films of all time. He's a great filmmaker, but "assassinated" and "martryred" is going too far.

1323371554693029888 2020-11-03 05:09:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @KaeleeF You shouldn't have to wait if you have it pre-filled out, in the envelope, signed, dated, and written your address on it, etc.

1323364464742203392 2020-11-03 04:40:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> What if Joe Biden loses the election and SNL continues with Jim Carrey and Maya Rudolph as if he ended up being President?

1323354038490988545 2020-11-03 03:59:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fOrGiVeNcHy Agreed.
1323353961827459072 2020-11-03 03:59:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kolbytoldme For me, it ends up being whatever is most impressive. If there are multiple elements done well, all the better.

1323001687745863680 2020-11-02 04:39:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @streeeeep I dropped my iphone in a (clean) toilet once. This was about 4 years ago and after a couple of days in a bag of rice, it was good to go. Good to know that phones are more resilient these days.
1322997243209641984 2020-11-02 04:21:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @streeeeep They didn't even try to turn on the iPhone, though.
1322994079030890496 2020-11-02 04:09:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cmclymer @harrisonjaime Strange thing for Graham to say. He should embrace his role as Lady G full-time and gtfo of Congress.
1322978672165310464 2020-11-02 03:07:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @letterboxd I hear you. I wasn't quite ready to get up either.
1322968875042926592 2020-11-02 02:28:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @marcorubio Some democratic socialists are Independents because we don't like the system. Okay, bye now.
1322968264830451714 2020-11-02 02:26:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @alexachrome 25 would be good if the "system" were full of good people with ethics, but that might not be the case. And I'm going to vote no on stem cell and it seems that's what Knock L.A. recommended too.
1322967207639359488 2020-11-02 02:22:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @alexachrome Ugh, you're right. I'm going to change my answer. 25 is another one that seems tricky. The progressive guide says "no" even though it sounds good at first glance.
1322966185210638337 2020-11-02 02:18:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @alexachrome I'll look more into this. I hate when they make things sound straightforward. I may amend my answer on this one.
1322964521154039809 2020-11-02 02:11:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> It's important for patients on dialysis. Let's help those in need of treatment!!
1322964330313232384 2020-11-02 02:10:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @alexachrome Any pointers? Californians are suffering from displacement due to the fires. It sounds positive. Any negatives you have heard?

1322400384015499266 2020-10-31 12:49:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> @letterboxd Not sure yet. I'm binging on films currently on Shudder, so basically anything that looks interesting on there that I haven't seen yet. Will keep you updated, of course.

1322353577520623617 2020-10-31 09:43:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Libertea2012 It is something really ridiculous. IT goes to show @MayorOfLA is out of step with the needs of the citizens.
1322348396686897153 2020-10-31 09:23:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MayorOfLA @LADOTofficial WHich they'll be able to pay, because Californians are getting a second stimulus, right?????????????   Otherwise, this tweet is CRAZYTOWN, Mr. Garcetti.
1322347667138043904 2020-10-31 09:20:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ChristlStringer @PressBeet Yes. Some people also like to say no they won't run so they look humble when they accept the nomination, but ... who knows?
1322326089608278017 2020-10-31 07:54:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PhilipDMorton @ThatsJacqueline That is soooo horrible. :(
1322324846613733377 2020-10-31 07:49:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AquafabaMcGee Yes! I hope you like it. I discovered their feta not too long ago and it's great.

1322321305878888450 2020-10-31 07:35:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @bdgrabinski You know it's not Melania by the way she's embracing and kissing him and not pushing him away

1322308282871021569 2020-10-31 06:43:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BrandonMutala I totally get it. If I had feelings for him, it'd be different. I don't, really, so it's just awkward.
1322302447860150272 2020-10-31 06:20:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @zombie_ducky_82 hahahaa I'll just settle for awkward. It's okay.
1322300911381667840 2020-10-31 06:14:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> How embarrassing. Someone I "Know" by sight messaged me on the dating app. I mean, if you wanted to get to know me, should have said "hi" in person way back when. I don't know.
1322299168350588928 2020-10-31 06:07:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ThiaBallerina @GodandtheBear Yes, exactly. They shove the worst candidates possible, because they do the bidding of the oligarchy. No morals, no scruples.

1322275775999979520 2020-10-31 04:34:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> Guess I'd better review RADIUM GIRLS.
1322273674120945664 2020-10-31 04:26:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AP @damnpamfromnamm ...And not to mention, Trump held a bunch of rallies.
1322271569712877569 2020-10-31 04:18:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ThatsJacqueline Gatherings with 10 people are fewer! Oh yeah, that's going to help...

1322259612247101440 2020-10-31 03:30:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MeganStuart3 @KamalaHarris So our Senators literally were like whatever.....

1322258105137180672 2020-10-31 03:24:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ginny_sais_quoi That's potentially a problem. Jill Biden isn't worth getting excited over, but she's potentially our "FLOTUS".
1322257947976589312 2020-10-31 03:23:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> @aflairytale Gaby, cool! I'd love to see a reel or we could always talk on Zoom. I'm open to a Zoom film.

1321961252361437186 2020-10-30 07:44:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @spyderdobro ...Riiiiiight???????
1321960255694151680 2020-10-30 07:41:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tyler_distracto Oh yeah I stumbled on that.
1321959232275505152 2020-10-30 07:36:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SharisseNaomiZ Awesome!
1321959145797423104 2020-10-30 07:36:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @business How fucking thoughtful. But what about those who have been stockpiling?
1321959024397479936 2020-10-30 07:36:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BobbyCastro1994 Yay for Sylvia Sidney.

1321950803511242752 2020-10-30 07:03:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @excusemebutt Never know.
1321950750180741120 2020-10-30 07:03:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DrLearnALot Yes, or we could have #MedicareForAll and just cut through all the BS. Our politicians, though. 😑@SpeakerPelosi @SenKamalaHarris @SenFeinstein
1321950374786338821 2020-10-30 07:01:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @excusemebutt A lot of celebs are also voting for the other guy. It's a toss up to see where this goes.

1321933507547996160 2020-10-30 05:54:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @FiveFiveFiver Thank YOU!
1321925128943534087 2020-10-30 05:21:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @trumpharmsusall @deecheelobra 🤔😆
1321924670698840064 2020-10-30 05:19:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka Sounds good. But I usually find it hard to talk and eat at the same time.😆
1321924159048351744 2020-10-30 05:17:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jenny_toch Thanks for the retweet. I know the universe is listening.
1321924010662268928 2020-10-30 05:16:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MNajeddine Thanks for the retweet. I get more hopeful by the minute.
1321923891049103360 2020-10-30 05:16:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @FiveFiveFiver Thanks for the retweet.I have the feeling I'll find him any day now.

1321923498957131777 2020-10-30 05:14:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka True, but also it's okay to talk after the movie.
1321922595550232576 2020-10-30 05:11:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> My post in a few days:
1321920820181041152 2020-10-30 05:04:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chefphoteamuh Mmmm!
1321920540630609920 2020-10-30 05:03:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> Someone thought I was talking to them, but actually I was talking to Nina (the cat). 😺
1321919757851877376 2020-10-30 05:00:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> @isa_alterego It doesn't matter. Whatever is showing that we both want to see.
1321919610321473537 2020-10-30 04:59:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @yaaaaaaaaari 😆
1321919466821709824 2020-10-30 04:58:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> @mjac_film Best one I've seen recently and it's pretty inspiring
1321919030475644930 2020-10-30 04:57:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> more time
1321918981658169345 2020-10-30 04:56:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> best
1321918827072954368 2020-10-30 04:56:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> Dinner, movie
1321918390173229056 2020-10-30 04:54:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RafaelAlv2002 😆
1321917992251187200 2020-10-30 04:53:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RafaelAlv2002 It makes me sick if I eat too much so I understand.
1321917497822437377 2020-10-30 04:51:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @spyderdobro I try to lay something down in the outline, but also go where the story tells me.
1321916385258209281 2020-10-30 04:46:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @EboniqueBoyd @BGOnTheScene That would be nice, but a lot of their workers are on food stamps and Wal-Mart doesn't pay their fair share. They could pay $15/hour right now if they wanted to. They don't.
1321916227594248192 2020-10-30 04:46:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TVLine yep, it sounds "Icky"
1321913518975676416 2020-10-30 04:35:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @EboniqueBoyd @BGOnTheScene They make billions while giving their workers $7.25 per hour (min. wage depends by state) and that's not enough to live on.

1321910311834714112 2020-10-30 04:22:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RAGGEDYROYAL usually "hate" comments aren't funny 😭
1321909660358602752 2020-10-30 04:19:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LostInFilm Story, actors, and vision.
1321909536777674752 2020-10-30 04:19:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fanofthetroops Oh, and also, I see you're in NY. As soon as this thing is over, I definitely want to go to NY for some projects, but right now it's out of the question. 😰
1321909231990173696 2020-10-30 04:18:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fanofthetroops LOL!! 😆  Basically, anyone who has a house/apt we can shoot in in L.A. automatically gets executive producer credit
1321908605587660800 2020-10-30 04:15:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> I also don't mind casting unknowns. It's just like...might as well reach out to a few names and see what happens, right?
1321908406991507456 2020-10-30 04:14:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> The government reveling in the bribes they receive while doing f*** all for the people and COVID. And these two things are related.
1321906035905318912 2020-10-30 04:05:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @KaylaChowShow I do have a PO Box and it's excellent.
1321905810365009920 2020-10-30 04:04:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @margotswhore ♥️
1321904940176994304 2020-10-30 04:01:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tyler_distracto I know, right? I have her talent agency/manager info from IMDb, but they would not be interested in "microbudget" and there are plenty of actors out there who I'm sure would love to work.
1321904235492089856 2020-10-30 03:58:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Lulamaybelle Wow, yeah.
1321904060186808320 2020-10-30 03:57:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> Mackenzie Davis isn't on social media, it seems, so I'll put it out there: Mackenzie, if you're interested in being in my microbudget film, hit me up.
1321903243140558848 2020-10-30 03:54:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @mjac_film Yes, Totally Under Control and My name is Pedro for starters
1321902063790403584 2020-10-30 03:49:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ggreenwald Do what you gotta do. I was kind of disappointed in you for having Aaron Coleman's back, when it was obvious he was immature, hadn't changed, and was a threat to women.
1321901181258526720 2020-10-30 03:46:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jkervv The Burnt Orange Heresy in March, but I caught Shithouse at the drive-in recently.
1321900927775768576 2020-10-30 03:45:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> In Canada, in the U.S.A., and also the rest of the world!!
1321899825206456320 2020-10-30 03:40:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tommy_culkin Thank you! 😭
1321899674240864256 2020-10-30 03:40:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @paulwaldman1 @KatCapps There was already one in place. The Republicans just didn't want to impeach him (in the Senate), remove him from office, and lose their power.
1321894958865920000 2020-10-30 03:21:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tommy_culkin Thanks for the retweet! It shows you care.
1321894873419583488 2020-10-30 03:21:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @dnallaG Thanks for the retweet! I Have a feeling I'll find him soon.
1321894737876414464 2020-10-30 03:20:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ximenaaonate No way! Please give him word that his mommy is waiting for him. ♥️ I will cherish you both.
1321894291015262208 2020-10-30 03:18:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sadacidtrips thanks for the retweet. I'm really hoping to find him soon. 😰
1321893762314825728 2020-10-30 03:16:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> Has anyone seen my son??? I was forced to give him up for adoption as a scared 14-year-old, but now I want him back.  https://t.co/8GKpFxjIQl
1321893178086055936 2020-10-30 03:14:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @loaizamarks @letterboxd 7/10 IS pretty high for me! 😆
1321881946293612544 2020-10-30 02:29:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wildwildzombie Great to know!
1321880802993467392 2020-10-30 02:25:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wildwildzombie That's cool. Thank you!
1321880673280389120 2020-10-30 02:24:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @streeeeep To be fair, Bay doesn't know the definition of "taste".
1321880430367268866 2020-10-30 02:23:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sunandavashisht She looks great. You gotta admit that! 😆
1321879168087306241 2020-10-30 02:18:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> Finally, some good news! ♥️  https://t.co/dNJQl6UMEW
1321878620608950272 2020-10-30 02:16:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wildwildzombie Agreed. The last two chairs I got were $10 and free, respectively, and it shows.  Do you mind me asking what the brand is of the chair and where you bought it?
1321877939303034882 2020-10-30 02:13:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @mikemariano Thank you!
1321877864107573248 2020-10-30 02:13:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @coopercooperco We need Singin' in the Rain to go up by 33.1% in 22 minutes!
1321877736126783488 2020-10-30 02:13:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wildwildzombie looks good! I also probably need a chair that I can be comfortable in. I always find myself hunching.
1321877271469174784 2020-10-30 02:11:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @voilavarda If you watch his online videos, it's better. When I signed up for his class, I was working on a 48 Hour Film Project &amp; working 40 hours and then he revealed you'd need 40 hours a week to work on his class after I signed up. I just did what I could. Also, read Robert McKee's Story
1321876930803560449 2020-10-30 02:09:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @voilavarda It was okay. Since it was online it felt like kind of a waste. I remember kind of sarcastic feedback from the teacher, but they really get you working on something.  I also recommend maybe a workshop by Corey Mandell (be careful, he is sometimes nice but sometimes tough--)
1321875958563958789 2020-10-30 02:06:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @voilavarda I took one in 2006 from UCLA Extension. It was probably much cheaper then.
1321875613930541057 2020-10-30 02:04:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot Agreed. I saw it in the theater and I kept waiting.... for something to happen. Apart from the milkshake scene, who cares?
1321872612570525696 2020-10-30 01:52:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scottgoeke @fmanjoo Exactly what I came here to say!
1321870160693653504 2020-10-30 01:43:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RealMelValentin Weird. Maybe they just went away for awhile. I find it awfully weird when people vacation during the pandemic.
1321869905239498757 2020-10-30 01:41:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> Fix this, Twitter
1321868734928093189 2020-10-30 01:37:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RealMelValentin Either someone else moved in? There have been a few moving trucks in our area and I've seen people move out, so a stealth move would really surprise me.
1321868514815213568 2020-10-30 01:36:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ellaherself Yeah, they were party throwers and very social. So... wonder what happened. They were also gone for 5 days with mail piling up. I was about to call someone but then they came back. No sight of them at all these days, though...
1321867838743744512 2020-10-30 01:33:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @zachisvegan Whew! Good going.
1321867669650378757 2020-10-30 01:33:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> Haven't seen the neighbors in 12 days.   They are either: -on vacation -moved out while I wasn't looking -ultra quiet and have had no boxes delivered to them (which is so rare for them) -have COVID -both passed away (there isn't any smell coming from their house, though)
1321865489841233921 2020-10-30 01:24:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> Wanna get back on dating apps. Also never want to see another human person again. Also have no recent pics with makeup/washed hair.
1321863767852949504 2020-10-30 01:17:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fOrGiVeNcHy My favorite is when they denounce Trump and turn to Biden as a man of character. Like, seriously? That is some good pretending.
1321862343312039937 2020-10-30 01:11:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> Nina licked my nose and eyebrow this morning. She love me yeah, yeah, yeah! ❤️  https://t.co/qmLRgyOY32

1321859955834593280 2020-10-30 01:02:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @vanofvenus Tip: Unfollow them first. 😆  The best part is when they say "hey" and then I'm like... what do you want me to say?
1321846616182071296 2020-10-30 00:09:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> Watching Death Line, actress Sharon Gurney reminds me of Kristen Stewart.  https://t.co/cxfT7vm0RG

1321842446913863680 2020-10-29 23:52:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BabaODook It seems you're right from his comments. Wish there was some sort of oversight committee in the USA.
1321842160551960577 2020-10-29 23:51:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Doubleh55 Unfortunately, the virus isn't under control and we'll all be half in quarantine unless we can effectively eradicate it.
1321841558040190977 2020-10-29 23:49:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @keeshastoer Oh no! :(
1321840961840771072 2020-10-29 23:46:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @keeshastoer That's horrible! I heard about the resurgence in Canada. There is still no USA/Canada travel, whih is sad.
1321840775601139713 2020-10-29 23:46:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @leavemealooone_ True but we had one in Los Angeles. I keep forgetting our president does not lead us.
1321834550062800897 2020-10-29 23:21:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @65Rickz @letterboxd Yes! Yesterday, I did.
1321834265546403842 2020-10-29 23:20:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scott4listener Same but with me it was this site called Angelfire
1321833884397441024 2020-10-29 23:18:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> My ★★★½ review of Host (2020) on @letterboxd:  https://t.co/RvkH5F1Udw #horror #HorrorMovies #61DaysofHalloween #veganmoviereviews
1321711254625374209 2020-10-29 15:11:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BeeGirl902 @Slate @joshesphillips It might be. I haven't gone to Walmart in years and truthfully, I haven't ordered anything from Amazon in years either.
1321711007543160832 2020-10-29 15:10:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LegalRideshare It's not autonomy if the profits go to the top and the workers use their own money on gas.  Literally vote NO on 22 unless you want the companies to get all the profits and you won't get any rights or benefits.

1321709828851445760 2020-10-29 15:05:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> I really want to review HOST. I also really want to get some sleep. Maybe in the morning.

1321706672180457472 2020-10-29 14:53:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BeeGirl902 @Slate @joshesphillips It probably would. And it'd help society if people stopped ordering from Amazon - over 19K of their employees contracted COVID because of their unethical practices.

1321645088284405761 2020-10-29 10:48:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> F*** it. I'm probably just going to make an indie/mumblecore 2-4 person movie during the pandemic. Of course, by the time I write it the pandemic might be over but I'll take that chance.

Also Italians peel the skin when preparing tomatoes. Most of the "poison" is in the skin. Some people like us react to lectins.
1321619623184228352 2020-10-29 09:07:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chefphoteamuh All good. I am used to it now. I developed this allergy in my mid-twenties.
1321619448202059777 2020-10-29 09:06:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ChristerEm It doesn't do a lot of good if not everyone's on the same page. California's pretty good about mask wearing but the surrounding states: not necessarily. And then COVID never quite goes away.
1321619157847191552 2020-10-29 09:05:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chefphoteamuh No. I'm allergic to tomatoes, so I always request it without tomatoes and ketchup.

1321487918293155841 2020-10-29 00:24:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @noahgittell Mmm! Sounds good. I don't think I have pine nuts and I had tempeh bacon yesterday, but I will have to try that some time.
1321487480688758784 2020-10-29 00:22:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Reuters Dear Ivanka, speak for yourself.
1321487274639380480 2020-10-29 00:21:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> I always buy beets and never feel like preparing them, so today's lunch is probably going to be 4 beets with lightly sauteed garlic on top.
1321486808920719360 2020-10-29 00:19:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Celiners3000 Cool! I bought some, but it didn't rise. I will try a second round of planting, because I think my cat would really like it.
1321484517677297664 2020-10-29 00:10:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scott4listener That is great!!
1321482944226103296 2020-10-29 00:04:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @compassionchasr ugh
1321329794395426818 2020-10-28 13:55:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BadgurlJac Yes, definitely. I miss old places and friends, but I've also adapted to the times well.
1321322460835274752 2020-10-28 13:26:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> that this production NEVER happened! I had been meaning to check out YouTube to see if there were any clips and this is what I found:  https://t.co/MkwlxfELwJ
1321322207000195072 2020-10-28 13:25:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> I remember being a kid and seeing the billboards for Faye Dunaway for the theater production of SUNSET BLVD. When I grew up, Dunaway became one of my fav actresses and SUNSET BLVD. became one of my fav. movies! I would have KILLED to see this production. NOW I'm finding out (1/2)
1321319195196289025 2020-10-28 13:13:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @McFaul @BDGarp Try to convince Orange Boy otherwise.
1321318923350929408 2020-10-28 13:12:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BadgurlJac Exactly! Some people can't take it any more, but I'm getting too used to and too fond of this new normal.
1321318775803670528 2020-10-28 13:11:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fOrGiVeNcHy Agreed that W was horrible, but it's not unfair to ask the American President to stop killing his own.
1321318370000531456 2020-10-28 13:10:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BadgurlJac Oh yes. I mean, I enjoyed my job, but was working too much and not doing what I wanted to do.
1321317050367664130 2020-10-28 13:05:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> I am getting very close to accomplishing everything I had planned for the next 3-4 years at the end of 2019, thanks to COVID and staying indoors and not having to work toward someone else's dream.
1321316682044825601 2020-10-28 13:03:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> The President was already experiencing mental decline, so I hate to see how COVID will impact him even further.

1321312707971149825 2020-10-28 12:47:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Sayeski Oh wow, thanks. Hopefully, I'll be able to check out a lot of stuff.
1321303451989626880 2020-10-28 12:11:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Optigrab Thankfully, I have seen the movie, and I enjoyed it more.
1321299201213562881 2020-10-28 11:54:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CCortave24 Wow, yeah. I'm not super far away now, but  I used to literally live around the corner from Dodgers Stadium and I'm sure it's much crazier near there now.
1321297207694364676 2020-10-28 11:46:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CCortave24 Seriously, it's like the 4th of July right now. Too much!!

1321296047600263205 2020-10-28 11:41:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CCortave24 I'm hearing fireworks right now.
1321292092761669635 2020-10-28 11:25:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> And I did not apply to it. Maybe tomorrow... but I'm going to subscribe to Shudder, so I don't know.
1321291884954791941 2020-10-28 11:25:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @hauntingit @letterboxd LOL! I love it.
1321286211126792192 2020-10-28 11:02:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BasharM81 Agreed. Watched it in between Episodes 2 &amp; 3 of The Right Stuff.

1321272917217325057 2020-10-28 10:09:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> My dentist suggested that I order this product off of Amazon. I didn't tell him what I thought of Bezos.  I look up the product and it has dairy in it. 🙃 Guess I'm going to have to find an alternate product.

1321260778507300866 2020-10-28 09:21:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> @filmfeline I mean, if you want to check it out, check it out. I'm finding a lot of unnecessary love stories. I am not a huge space fan, but my beef isn't even with the space stuff. It feels like a lot of filler to me.
1321260536890191872 2020-10-28 09:20:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @0xKasio I know. Right?
1321259768111980545 2020-10-28 09:17:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ELCinemonster Oh yes. It's just a waste of time for me. I look forward to getting to some other things on my list.

1321257587996672003 2020-10-28 09:08:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fOrGiVeNcHy 😆 I hope you feel honored
1321257309322891264 2020-10-28 09:07:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ELCinemonster I had the good fortune to see the movie already. I can live without the series. But yes, good choice.
1321254739586117637 2020-10-28 08:57:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> By the way, I might not make it through Episode 3. It's so horrible!!
1321254090978934784 2020-10-28 08:54:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> I'm on Episode 3 of The Right Stuff (D+). Episodes 1&amp;2 were so subpar, but I needed something to watch and my subscription to D+ is running out soon. I guess I'm going to read a book before I binge on a 7 day free subscription to Shudder.
1321253338189475843 2020-10-28 08:51:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ditdots_ Stay strong and we are always here to support you. I'm sorry if your mom is having a weird reaction.
1321251053531099136 2020-10-28 08:42:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BernieSanders @DUALIPA We are protesting! People like @SenKamalaHarris and @JoeBiden don't give AF, which is why we wanted YOU to be President. Guess I'm going to have to vote GREEN PARTY.
1321250298120171520 2020-10-28 08:39:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> I finally mentioned it to the receptionist for next time and she explained the man had "problems". Wonder if she felt threatened. I was just trying to stay on the other side of the room.
1321250000127455233 2020-10-28 08:38:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @_morbidite I mean, he had a mask, and eventually, he put it over his chin. 🤐

1321194672442621952 2020-10-28 04:58:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @IvoryCopper He just left after 20 minutes. He was all friendly with her and they were laughing. Meanwhile they had a policy of only one person in the waiting room. So weird
1321194135106117632 2020-10-28 04:56:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @IvoryCopper My appointment was at 1:30pm and the receptionist isn't saying anything. It's annoying. Meanwhile he's talking up a storm.

1320955643310739456 2020-10-27 13:09:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TroyMP94 Yeah, that was a long time ago. That particular boss was weird sometimes, but he was better than a couple of particularly nasty female bosses I had.

1320952662368501760 2020-10-27 12:57:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TroyMP94 I once worked on a project I liked at a job and told my boss I liked the type of work I was assigned and you guessed it: he said I didn't have to suck up to him. But I was sincere and eventually I got promoted.
1320949940193906688 2020-10-27 12:46:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JesseLehrich @lonelydoll Vote him out.
1320949139975196673 2020-10-27 12:43:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TroyMP94 Yes, well, they usually like to hire people who are familiar with their products and company so it can be a very tricky situation.
1320947834623905792 2020-10-27 12:38:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LindseyGrahamSC You gross POS.

1320946385282232321 2020-10-27 12:32:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> I may apply to another Netflix job tomorrow, but it's getting tiring. I've sent my resume to them so many times and never hear back. I am Allison M. from Letterboxd, damn it! HIRE ME!

I am used to studios offering screeners of the films or promoting around this time, but obviously this year things are gonna be way different. I don't even have a list of the current 2020 movies.
1320937126221938688 2020-10-27 11:55:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka @luke4lk Definitely won't know until the end of the year.

1320872401152868354 2020-10-27 07:38:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AlexFirer @JacobDavison_ At least two are sex criminals.

1320849902457421826 2020-10-27 06:08:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @taky4 I haven't gone much since the pandemic, though. 😭  It's been my goal to learn how to make some carrot lox. They make it perfectly with the seasonings, but it gets pricey eating out, so I'll have to figure out how to make it.
1320847389192638464 2020-10-27 05:58:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ligdraca One way or another! ;)
1320846973121916928 2020-10-27 05:57:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @taky4 Here's the link. Their carrot lox is so good that I have trouble ordering anything else when I go.   https://t.co/M8M9tyHIEX
1320846706313887744 2020-10-27 05:56:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Sandrakicks1 @AnnaMeiler @wbz Exactly!!!
1320844651750805509 2020-10-27 05:47:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @gryffintea2 I hope you love it! Emma Thompson's adaptation is one of my favorites.
1320842992912007168 2020-10-27 05:41:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> Applying to some casting jobs. It's utterly amazing how many jobs are out there and how many people are applying. Wish me luck!
1320841318923300864 2020-10-27 05:34:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @gryffintea2 Which version? Pride &amp; Prejudice is probably Jane Austen's most popular work, but my favorite is Sense &amp; Sensibility.
1320841141990813696 2020-10-27 05:34:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Doubleh55 @AriBerman That's the problem. No one likes that idea, but not only is it allowable by the Constitution, but  conservative justices outnumber the liberal or even moderate ones and it's the only thing to do to balance everything out.
1320840813815820288 2020-10-27 05:32:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> Ram Amy Coney Barrett through to the Supreme Court if you please, but then understand if the next elected President who's a Democrat packs the courts. #AmyConeyBarrettIsUnfit
1320840442229915649 2020-10-27 05:31:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RepDougCollins How is she qualified?   And she literally wants to roll back our rights. What are you talking about?
1320840173496659968 2020-10-27 05:30:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SenatorTimScott Gross abuser of women's rights.
1320839999978270721 2020-10-27 05:29:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AriBerman Only one thing to do: pack the courts when the next Dem is elected.
1320839668171116545 2020-10-27 05:28:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> I hope there are people in Washington, DC planning to protest this!!!!!
1320838257555374081 2020-10-27 05:22:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @taky4 😆  In Los Angeles, we have a place called Jewel that makes some really good carrot lox.
1320833235824250881 2020-10-27 05:02:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tittyliciousjen Thanks for sharing the app! And congrats on being sober. Every day sober is powerful.

I often don't do vegan alerts for cultural things since it's a way of life for them. Since it's a Disney movie and features a vegan star, I did. Plus the movie's point is to respect all life and all spirits.
1320814122426982405 2020-10-27 03:46:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thatbasicspoonn All good. Lots of people think that. I just keep doing what I do.
1320813949843980288 2020-10-27 03:45:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @lindeauenfeu Don't go outside. Get a fan and air filter. I know people who have stayed inside but the smoke seeps inside. It won't do you any good if you can't get rid of the smoke.

1320605287003291648 2020-10-26 13:56:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> You gotta push them left BEFORE they're elected. It doesn't seem like you know who will fight for the people or for the earth at any point and that's just not acceptable.
1320605048208936960 2020-10-26 13:55:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JoeBiden You need to take a clear stance and BAN FRACKING. You need to fight global warming. You need to enact Medicare For All. You're a day late and a dollar short.

1320578916034072577 2020-10-26 12:12:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Seven16 Sometimes it's the younger kids. They either weren't schooled by their parents not to tell people to kill themselves or this is the first time with any sort of autonomy and they have no filters. Just.... who knows?
1320566876817092608 2020-10-26 11:24:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Seven16 Agree. Report and block this person. They're a little Michelle Carter and behavior like that can be prosecuted.

1319779962317012992 2020-10-24 07:17:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ElaniKitten @markmorto 😂  True. I usually skip the personals that say "no drama" anyway. Like, if you don't want it, I'll spare you completely.
1319779732150386688 2020-10-24 07:16:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> In the last 24 hours, more or less, I've encountered at least three older/elderly people who have had their mask over their mouth but below their nose.
1319761225731854336 2020-10-24 06:02:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ElaniKitten I've never understood the "No Drama". Drama is a part of life. I'm not one to make something out of nothing, but shit happens in life and I expect someone to stay through the tough times too. And if they have a wife, that explains it.
1319760341543186432 2020-10-24 05:59:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> Wrote a little bit more today, mainly about my experiences at AFI Film Festival.
1319721789526736896 2020-10-24 03:26:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> Reading Auster's The Invention of Solitude while in quarantine:  "It was almost like living in quarantine."  🤣
1319715076895432704 2020-10-24 02:59:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> I have been reading true stories about people who have tragically died and it feels fortunate to be alive.
1319709730462289920 2020-10-24 02:38:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CraigDotCarter @jeffreyboadi_ I recommend eating organic. I will have a bad reaction to strawberries that aren't organic and I often taste pesticides on fruit that's not organic. Anyway, at least you can eat strawberries.
1319709458256121856 2020-10-24 02:37:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cryborg looks like it

1319530944005500928 2020-10-23 14:47:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> So the Presidential debate was more terrifying.  Both had brief moments of humor followed by feelings of impending doom.
1319530404827705346 2020-10-23 14:45:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevin_thecritic I really want to say Agnes Varda. Also Erin Lee Carr who managed to make 4 great docs in the 2010s.

1319526033469534209 2020-10-23 14:28:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CraigDotCarter @jeffreyboadi_ Interesting. Soy isn't necessary to be vegan but out of curiosity, which fruits and vegetables are you allergic to? I am allergic to tomatoes.
1319518795795288064 2020-10-23 13:59:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @meow2008 @jeffreyboadi_ Oh, okay! I am a big dessert fan and when I first became vegan, I was very heavy with the vegan junk food. I am trying to eat better, but I've been binging on vegan ice cream and cocowhip lately. I can't help it. It's my one (?) indulgence.
1319517388178558976 2020-10-23 13:53:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> @meow2008 @jeffreyboadi_ The good thing is that she has a variety of things. Some things I haven't liked from her either. I just bought a vegan pot pie. It's in my freezer in case I need something quick to fix.

1319498249003098112 2020-10-23 12:37:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @liamhenneberry Trump was unhinged as usual and tried to talk over Biden and the moderator, but I'm sure they muted him at least twice.

1319486230787026944 2020-10-23 11:50:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @hanslejeune @AOC A Republican Senator called her AOC and she demanded her full title and name, so Trump probably got on board to taunt her.

1319479473981435905 2020-10-23 11:23:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cooljulian5 There seemed to be at least two occasions where they cut away to the moderator and Trump was suddenly silent. Otherwise, we know he would have never shut up.

1319474270158745601 2020-10-23 11:02:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @KFlash900 I had an idea for a feature that I was willing to turn into a pilot. But the truth is I wanted it to be a feature. Do what you feel in your gut you should do.

1319011931944939520 2020-10-22 04:25:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> I'd like to think I'm not vain, but did Cannes and AFI program My Donkey, My Lover, and I / Antoinette dans les Cévennes just to torture me?

1318993715118047234 2020-10-22 03:13:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> Just realized I was receiving notifications from TIFF during their festival, but since the festival is long over, I'll wait to receive notifications until next year.
1318954842287529984 2020-10-22 00:38:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ramdelossantos No. It was pretty sparse. There could have been a lot more in the film. Julia Garner is good though.

1318952293992075264 2020-10-22 00:28:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @priestenjoyer I call a certain TCM host Ben Wankiewicz.

1318811886763139075 2020-10-21 15:10:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @hauntingit That was the take away from the tweet. 😄 And thank you.
1318797773689376768 2020-10-21 14:14:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @lilymfar Cool. I found an article. It's insane how much voter suppression is going on this election. Since Pennsylvania is an important state, it could make a difference if the race is close. However, if it's not, they could call the election if one candidate has enough electoral votes.
1318796978772267009 2020-10-21 14:11:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @lilymfar I believe the ballots need to be received by Election Day. However, I'll look into Pennsylvania. That's interesting.
1318785603186520064 2020-10-21 13:26:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SaltTehFries Dzień dobry
1318784732100923392 2020-10-21 13:22:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @lilymfar That's weird! Usually it has to be turned in before a certain time on Election Day. Of course, this election is different. Do you know which particular states have an extended deadline? Otherwise, I'll try to look it up.
1318784442777751552 2020-10-21 13:21:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @KevOKeefe1979 At this rate, I don't think so. However, Nina Turner and others are working for a People's Party which I'm eager to join and support.
1318780675458093057 2020-10-21 13:06:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PeterAPeel Will have to check it out.
1318779578098229248 2020-10-21 13:02:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> @lilymfar I mean, it could be, because it's close. But even the results for 2016 were announced when not all votes were in and when there were a few states that were went after by Hillary and Jill Stein for recounts.
1318777421257011200 2020-10-21 12:53:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ThiaBallerina Now we are just too far gone...
1318777331779993600 2020-10-21 12:53:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> Making a last minute documentary in case Joe Biden loses about the parallels to 2016 and how the Democrats didn't learn anything from the last Presidential election. Then it'll be ready to be released in time for November 4, 2020.
1318776979450073088 2020-10-21 12:51:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @amra_midfield Joe Biden is basically running as a Republican and it's infuriating, because he's alienating Independents and Progressives and this is the same thing that happened in 2016.
1318775724401074176 2020-10-21 12:46:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @KevOKeefe1979 Oh.... 😅 I mean, I went through a phase of purposely avoiding it, but I'd watch it if the right opportunity presented itself.
1318771554574946311 2020-10-21 12:30:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @KevOKeefe1979 It's like one of the ones I haven't. And purposefully too, because I was forced to read a scene from it one time.

1318733918342836226 2020-10-21 10:00:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> When a "friend" unfollows all the people following them to inflate their follower count. Don't do this, especially if you're a celebrity. It just leaves a bad taste in your followers' mouths.  https://t.co/pTAr0vBQjh
1318732755853742080 2020-10-21 09:56:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> Was in London in July/Aug 2001. A random (documentary?) filmmaker grabbed my friend and I off the street so we could be extras in his film about the IRA bombings. I sometimes wonder about this film and if it's out there somewhere.

1318318085963620354 2020-10-20 06:28:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> @veganparsnip It can be healthier. Just depends. Some people don't deal with soy really well. If you don't like it, I wouldn't force yourself to eat it. But if you like the new ways you cook it, then it's a good thing.
1318311617935724544 2020-10-20 06:02:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @swamptalking Cool! Oh I see, your post was from 4 hours ago.😅
1318310435624349696 2020-10-20 05:57:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> @veganparsnip I recommend: organic only. I've heard fermented soy is the only safe way, so I have organic miso and usually have it in my salad dressing. Otherwise, I cut it up in squares and fry it with veggies I love. But I go easy on it.
1318309687167655936 2020-10-20 05:54:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Frankvdb1971 Almost but no

1318309228818280448 2020-10-20 05:53:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> Kill Bill Vol. II   So I saw the film with my dad in the theater. I unfortunately read spoilers so I knew what was going to happen. I kept wondering when it was going to happen. Then it did. My dad jumped halfway across the aisle while I just sat there not phased at all.  https://t.co/QTb7NGxUQ0

1318297101638402048 2020-10-20 05:04:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> I don't want to review films. I just want free passes to see movies.

1318288559292391424 2020-10-20 04:30:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> Sometimes I get a message on Instagram from a company. They want influencers to promote their product but then offer me 20% off. I mean send me the product if you want me to try it...

1317970269936365569 2020-10-19 07:26:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Eclipsolan BTW, with using Skullcap herb, I only have had to use Advil about 3 times in the past 3 years. It's been a lifesaver.
1317969955862630401 2020-10-19 07:24:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Eclipsolan Yes! It's saved me from anxiety and panic attacks multiple times. They are the things that work best for me. ashwagandha tea and Holy basil are also very calming, but I wouldn't use it for an emergency situation unless it was all I had.
1317848143216537603 2020-10-18 23:20:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Georgelucaschin @kayrosef Yes it was horrible.

1317610963621666816 2020-10-18 07:38:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @dopeqvveen Sounds good!! Skullcap helped me even when CBD failed once. Also peppermint and lavender are also semi-effective and are probably found in more things.
1317610548448514049 2020-10-18 07:36:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BP_MovieReviews @MikeCorreaGzz Yes but I would never casually bring it up
1317610418181795840 2020-10-18 07:36:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @dopeqvveen I'm sorry. Do you have access to CBD? I can recommend some teas /herbs for panic attacks that have helped me: -skullcap herb (found in Traditional Medicinals Stress Ease tea or online) -holy basil -Ashwagandha   Do you have a way to get any of these herbs?

1317605406550552577 2020-10-18 07:16:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JAKE_VAN_DYKE While I was thinking this morning that Jennifer Lawrence could save the world if she told everyone to vote and while I don't think she deserved a razzie for anything necessarily, I have a strange relationship to the movie Mother! so I wouldn't exactly necessarily tweet that
1317605055927742465 2020-10-18 07:14:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @vildhjartaa Unfortunately, I will have to respectfully disagree. De Niro can do anything.
1317604902479167488 2020-10-18 07:14:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RobOliver72 THey might be amazing, but unfortunately I haven't really listened to them that much so I can't make an informed decision. 😢

1317590897249316864 2020-10-18 06:18:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ditdots_ Controversial but I agree.
1317590692508561408 2020-10-18 06:17:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> The next 12 replies I agree with will be my next tweets.

1317343342049464320 2020-10-17 13:55:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka This tweet is more for the doctors and lawyers I know who find it "easier" to click a button when they can afford to go a different route.
1317343193457848321 2020-10-17 13:54:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka Hopefully there are other places. I would order something from Amazon if I were in a bind, but I've found there's usually always another way. Once I found that an item was $20 cheaper on Amazon than on the company's website so I just didn't order it (the co. didn't budge on $)

1317334758594990080 2020-10-17 13:20:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> That time I took a tour of some studio around 1994 (think it was @CNBC) and Dolly Parton just happened to be there and wave to everyone. It was really just like that.
1317326122598629376 2020-10-17 12:46:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PopCulture2000s And tweeting this. 😆  Thanks for the rec. I don't have it on my iTunes so I'll add it.

1317301078522621953 2020-10-17 11:07:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @montanasociali3 @AOC hopefully If Trump doesn't allow the election, then it'll be the Speaker, Nancy Pelosi. If Biden is elected and can't fulfill his term, then it'll be Kamala.   People didn't think they'd live to see a black President and we had Obama. So... 🤷‍♀️

1317282852715655168 2020-10-17 09:54:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DrBiden Damn straight! This is why we must have #MedicareForAll especially during a pandemic. You said it! You can be doing more. So do it! You do not have the vote of this independent voter yet. Also divest from fossil fuels! I have no faith in Biden/Harris right now.

1317246897971552258 2020-10-17 07:31:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> I was supposed to be songwriting this morning, but I was excited to hook up my keyboard and pushed play on my iTunes and started playing along to my favorite songs. I can play by ear a bit, but spent a little more time with the difficult songs.

But once I worked at a pizza place, so I made a customer a 2/3-1/3 split pizza with diff. ingredients and my manager told me we don't do that but he was impressed.
1317245474261225475 2020-10-17 07:26:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> I really wanted to buy a glockenspiel or xylophone or ocarina, but those options are on my keyboard, so I am good for now!!

1317228557584584704 2020-10-17 06:18:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TroyMP94 I found a music video that Jim Jarmusch did. Amazingly it's for The Raconteurs' "Steady As She Goes"    https://t.co/ktSzQhwgYJ
1317227934659141632 2020-10-17 06:16:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TroyMP94 It wasn't on the list when I checked out this particular one on Tiermaker.

1317224269663760384 2020-10-17 06:01:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ChristlStringer Seen it but they're very different.
1317224185895137280 2020-10-17 06:01:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Eclipsolan I recommend skullcap herb and if you can get it CBD. Skullcap herb is good and can be found in teas like Medicinal Traditionals Stress Ease tea. I have been using it for 2-3 years and now just got seeds to plant skullcap herb today. I'm excited.

1317221331428020224 2020-10-17 05:50:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TroyMP94 I'd recommend checking out Jim Jarmusch. Ones I've liked are Only Lovers Left Alive and Down by Law. I wouldn't recommend starting with Permanent Vacation. I also don't know if his latest, The Dead Dont Die is a good place to start.

1317186467739807746 2020-10-17 03:31:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> Finally hooked up my keyboard today after getting the proper adapter. It had been sitting in its case for 8 years!!! 😭  Nothing can stop me now!! 🙌
1317185739885408256 2020-10-17 03:28:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> @alissamarieek Me too. I was like. Are they cracking down on me? For what?
1317173021371609090 2020-10-17 02:38:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PageSix Oh okay.

1317172205264928768 2020-10-17 02:35:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> Listening to Jane Fonda talking about civil disobedience like 😼
1317161393586458624 2020-10-17 01:52:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MariaKChica @rak_strong Interesting.
1317156155144073217 2020-10-17 01:31:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MSNBC Finally! I hope this is the turning point.
1317154243367694337 2020-10-17 01:23:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @monkski252 @MSNBC Probably not.
1317152935780888578 2020-10-17 01:18:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @amyythevegan 23 was probably my favorite age. I hope you like it! happy birthday!!🎂🎉🎁🎈🎊🌱
1317148028747227136 2020-10-17 00:58:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ReynoldsTammy @rak_strong Oh wow, I thought it was weird at the time. But this was in the middle of the afternoon. Another time the same customer ordered a "Spritzer" with red wine instead of wine. I also thought it was pretty weird.
1317147799729754112 2020-10-17 00:58:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kelnoland2020 From Genius Visa to First Lady: My Struggle for Apathy
1317141721201799169 2020-10-17 00:33:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rak_strong I used to work as a bartender and someone wanted bloody Mary mix and beer.
1317001152152576000 2020-10-16 15:15:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BuddyKetelle And we will be so #spoiled! 😭
1317000774161817600 2020-10-16 15:13:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheWedgeSerpent He probably wouldn't pardon a murderer or a Californian. But who knows?
1316995940100628482 2020-10-16 14:54:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BuddyKetelle I'm doing pretty well putting it on the back burner, but I had it marked on my calendar for tomorrow and now I'm like 🤦‍♀️
1316994527933071360 2020-10-16 14:48:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> In a different reality, I'd be waking up to go see Wes Anderson's The French Dispatch tomorrow. And if COVID had never happened, I think it was originally supposed to come out in July. 😭
1316993280551211008 2020-10-16 14:44:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> So, Phil Spector is eligible for parole in 2025? I thought he was locked up for good.
1316982013245575168 2020-10-16 13:59:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> While I continue to watch screeners sent to me, I am also returning to my first loves of reading, writing, and music which all feel so peaceful! I may watch a movie or two per day, but now I'm trying to fit everything else in!

1316958967206203394 2020-10-16 12:27:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VileMK2 @TierMaker Laughton only has one film. ;)
1316951652012855304 2020-10-16 11:58:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> I remember Jonathan Rosenbaum posting this yrs ago. However, due to W.A. being one of my favorite directors, I dismissed it as a difference of opinion (despite J.R. being my fav film critic). Now that I have finally let W.A. go I am devouring this article.  https://t.co/j0DF4cMLKO
1316950257855508480 2020-10-16 11:53:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> There are some new films I've seen lately that unveil the emperor's new clothes for me. They're empty or lacking or not meriting the praise. Yet I don't want to completely diss them either, because they are often from beginning filmmakers.
1316949090257801217 2020-10-16 11:48:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cerisecastle @JacobDavison_ Out of control. @MayorOfLA FIRE CHIEF MOORE! YOU HAVE BEEN GIVING HIM EVERY CHANCE AND HE HAS BEEN FAILING

1316938729181892609 2020-10-16 11:07:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jilevin This is why I do not and cannot support Amazon!
1316938550005420033 2020-10-16 11:06:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ajamubaraka @PositivelyJoan If it has an 85% success rate. I don't know. 15% is an awfully high rate of failure.
1316936939455549440 2020-10-16 11:00:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @montanasociali3 Agreed
1316936804549955584 2020-10-16 10:59:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fOrGiVeNcHy same 🤩
1316935553422659587 2020-10-16 10:54:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> Lady who helped me at the nursery: so what are you going to use these pots for?  Me: Uh, herbs.
1316934463323054081 2020-10-16 10:50:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BasharM81 Chabrol would be on my list. He's one of my top 3 directors but wasn't in the database for this poll.
1316927620479668225 2020-10-16 10:23:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JustinWolfers Mr Rogers had more charm, but keep talking
1316924288289603586 2020-10-16 10:09:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JustinGoss LOL, yes
1316920920431349762 2020-10-16 09:56:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Manimeconquest LOL! Thanks
1316919173155520512 2020-10-16 09:49:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> The woman speaking after Biden's Town Hall (Sarah Fagan) likes fracking. SCREW YOU! @ABC
1316910696513286144 2020-10-16 09:15:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> Biden's foreign policy: Kim Jong-Un and Putin are thugs. #TownHall
1316907257171509249 2020-10-16 09:02:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @alissamarieek Yes! And still had problems after I replied.
1316907073330970625 2020-10-16 09:01:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AdamNicksAuthor That's what a lot of people say. I've always felt he was severely underrated.
1316906555237957633 2020-10-16 08:59:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VeraDrew22 I will DM you. I had to go to an electronics store today and they had it on display (they didn't have them last time). Will send you a link to their store.

1316904778295873539 2020-10-16 08:52:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @WajahatAli @thinkingtime55 Meanwhile Trump is yelling at his moderator!! 🤦‍♀️

1316903819322773516 2020-10-16 08:48:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> Feeling sorry that @sarahcpr feels obligated to listen to Trump's Town Hall. 😭
1316903697457336320 2020-10-16 08:48:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sarahcpr He's only $400 million in debt!!
1316903512152866817 2020-10-16 08:47:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> With these earrings, if I remain single, it's going to be because I choose to be. And YES they plug in. 🙌  https://t.co/N0CVQyd1jc
1316903110049234946 2020-10-16 08:45:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> Trump is taking a break from his Town Hall as Biden is returning from his Town Hall's commercial break. We did it, everyone! We tricked him into thinking he had a "separate" town hall while allowing the people to listen to both!!! #townhall
1316902314746236928 2020-10-16 08:42:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> Trump won't release his tax returns because he's "under audit". Same excuse as 4 years ago!!!
1316901958872072203 2020-10-16 08:41:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> Trump doesn't want to answer questions about how much he owes to. He thinks he has a low debt leverage. #TownHall   Trump thinks $400 million in debt is a small percentage of his net worth. 🤦‍♀️
1316901683549622272 2020-10-16 08:40:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> Joe Biden is NOT for defunding police. #TownHall
1316901420382056448 2020-10-16 08:39:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> Joe Biden is a fan of de-escalation and recommended to "shoot them in the leg". ☠️ #TownHall
1316898263333707776 2020-10-16 08:26:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> Biden thinks he's been making the criminal justice system fair his whole career. He should admit his mistakes and move on. #TownHall
1316898039076855808 2020-10-16 08:25:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> Trump's bragging about increasing employment, but not factoring in the jobs lost, just considering about the jobs gained back after they were lost.
1316897681516556288 2020-10-16 08:24:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> Trump admits he knew COVID was a big risk (back before it spread). #TownHall
1316897049678290944 2020-10-16 08:21:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> Trump: "I don't want a transfer, 'cause I want to win."   😬
1316896964340903937 2020-10-16 08:21:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> It won't let me post the link to the town hall, but you can click on the right ---&gt;
1316895979749007360 2020-10-16 08:17:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> He denounced white supremacy but is arguing with the moderator!  https://t.co/p3HSAyPdtL
1316895640715104257 2020-10-16 08:16:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> Trump is sitting across from his moderator unmasked!! So insane. When I tuned it he was talking about white supremacy... :/
1316895472838008834 2020-10-16 08:15:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> Regeneron is a useful "tool" - Biden

1316894824084041733 2020-10-16 08:12:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> Watching the town hall(s)
1316851535691739136 2020-10-16 05:20:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @EdvinBig I haven't read the Donald Spoto book about his "dark side" yet. However, he used to use actresses for sexual favors. And when they refused (like Tippi Hedren) he made sure they didn't work again.
1316850852825427969 2020-10-16 05:18:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @EdvinBig I can't account for their behavior. 🤷‍♀️
1316850619991220225 2020-10-16 05:17:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> Went to a plant nursery today and knew I was in the right place when they started talking about David Cronenberg and Steve Martin.
1316850125059235840 2020-10-16 05:15:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PussyGrenade From being a psychotic character. I read about it in a Rolling Stones article around the time of the movie's release.
1316848257365020674 2020-10-16 05:07:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PussyGrenade He's a good guy. Was studying to become a priest and deprogrammed Daniel Day-Lewis after Gangs of New York.
1316847794636775425 2020-10-16 05:05:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PussyGrenade Woody and Alfred were my favs but I cut them from my list.

1316843336146194432 2020-10-16 04:48:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @YEEZCORD Yeah I was torn on Welles undoubtedly an important filmmaker but too much bad feedback
1316843166696263680 2020-10-16 04:47:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @YEEZCORD 😭
1316836060450578432 2020-10-16 04:19:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @meow2008 @Veganella_ Coconut water isn't as thick and I've rarely drunk it myself. I also recommend macadamia nut milk. Elmhurst has non-dairy coffee creamer as well as NutPods. There are many brands that popped up. Hopefully your store or health food store will have them.
1316835652860690432 2020-10-16 04:17:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VeganRachel I set up a Zoom chat for 3 PM PST on Halloween just in case. I haven't picked out a movie and am still thinking about what we could all do.
1316833174295519232 2020-10-16 04:07:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @meow2008 @Veganella_ I'm also not a huge almond milk fan! I prefer coconut or cashew or hemp milk.

1316826292990353408 2020-10-16 03:40:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TAGMovieReviews For Varda: Cléo from 5 to 7.  For Almodovar: my first was All About My Mother which I really enjoyed. His latest is really good too: Pain and Glory.
1316825970389606400 2020-10-16 03:39:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DomHolder He has several good films mainly at the beginning of his career. He really hasn't done anything I really liked in the last 20 years.
1316825746514481152 2020-10-16 03:38:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Film_Freakk His films are good and I liked the way he treated animals, but I don't like the way he treated people.
1316825540494413824 2020-10-16 03:37:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TAGMovieReviews Ooh cool! I hope you're able to check out Varda and Almodovar soon!!!
1316821612419715072 2020-10-16 03:21:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Doubleh55 It was all-inclusive.
1316821500091985921 2020-10-16 03:21:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DomHolder I think Spielberg was on a different directors poll on Tiermaker but not this one.
1316821357708021760 2020-10-16 03:20:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PaulPascale I am just mad that the Coen Bros. cast a predator in their last film, but generally really like their films.

1316765903845949440 2020-10-15 23:40:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LesserWachowski Oh good! This one has women on the list. I was looking for one yesterday.

1316600990947135488 2020-10-15 12:45:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> So much content to plow through. I have the books and movies lined up.

1316594256430022659 2020-10-15 12:18:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @carriecoon @TheAcademy Why no more quarantining? The pandemic is still going on.
1316593798076534786 2020-10-15 12:16:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MasterDesperado I hear you. She's tone deaf, self-interested, and needs to RETIRE.
1316590570412797953 2020-10-15 12:03:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> @skiptracer Your dad needs to adjust what he thinks is cool. Yoga is healthy for the body and spirit.

1316588860562788354 2020-10-15 11:57:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> Apparently I am finding out now that it's a screener viewable at any time, so now it's just a matter of figuring out which shi*sh*w, I mean town hall to tune in to.
1316581409142661121 2020-10-15 11:27:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @OptiUnderground It'll be released in two days.

1316573626359898112 2020-10-15 10:56:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @dearapriII Oh I want to see that so bad. 😭
1316571214312169472 2020-10-15 10:46:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevin_thecritic Whew, yeah! Or until I have Netflix next...
1316560400222048258 2020-10-15 10:03:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> Earlier: waiting for the moderator to tell a participant in the Zoom chat to silence their phone (that dinged about 6-15x). They acknowledged it but did not ask everyone to "take a moment" to check their phones or mute the non-speakers. 😭
1316559966946246656 2020-10-15 10:02:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevin_thecritic I have it watchlisted.

1316557679037349892 2020-10-15 09:53:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> Today I thought about changing my name to Allison Méliès. I could still be Allison M. 😭
1316557380180606977 2020-10-15 09:51:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thehorrorkidd 😂😭 too true
1316556244878946304 2020-10-15 09:47:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @easy_andy 😭 Oh wow. I love Zoe Lund so how dare they.
1316541428713975808 2020-10-15 08:48:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fieldsofsoda Yeah, you always just "forget" to update it.
1316541323864801281 2020-10-15 08:48:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fOrGiVeNcHy Agreed. I'd vote for Kamala at this rate even though she is not perfect, but I'm not sold on Joe.
1316540862013218817 2020-10-15 08:46:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fieldsofsoda I wouldn't change it unless you feel ultra comfortable. Facebook is just a place for them to data mine anyway. Zuckerberg doesn't need to make $$ off your info.
1316540247681843201 2020-10-15 08:43:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @spyderdobro It would be cool. I'd be interested in doing something like this in the future, but maybe not as horror. And if it were horror, then hopefully a fresh take, because we've seen it all.
1316511919625314304 2020-10-15 06:51:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @generallydone Wow coool!!

1316510021971181568 2020-10-15 06:43:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DanielleNicki Depends if I am already working on something. I might just jot notes down first.
1316504938051039232 2020-10-15 06:23:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> My ★★★½ review of World of Tomorrow Episode Three: The Absent Destinations of David Prime (2020) on @letterboxd:  https://t.co/JH1iZvOuEj #worldoftomorrow @donhertzfeldt #veganmoviereview
1316493786583691265 2020-10-15 05:39:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> One of the last movies I saw before lockdown is showing at Anthology Film Archives (Oct 14-20). An essential film on the situation in the Middle East (past &amp; present).

1316482477091741697 2020-10-15 04:54:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Carlos_Film I need Mama Weed now.
1316482197331746816 2020-10-15 04:53:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fejimanz That's very sad. His parents did not take proper precautions and now he has to suffer. I hope he's okay. He's asymptomatic.
1316479494761320448 2020-10-15 04:42:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rhholt It'll be hard to bounce back after just one.
1316474661916475392 2020-10-15 04:23:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DarisHennen @marwilliamson @bigskybabs I had two benign tumors removed (at a hospital not through PP). They were so big that they caused a huge amount of pain. I dealt with them for awhile because I could not afford to see a doctor.
1316473427939651584 2020-10-15 04:18:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Atlinator @spyderdobro I bought lenses back in the day (these days the new Pro ones come with them). 4K wasn't available on iPhone back in the day so I used Vizzywig. I haven't used it in a long time, but it also offers the opportunity to sync multiple cameras (iPhones).
1316471077296459777 2020-10-15 04:08:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BrianSikoff I know. The "leaders" are leading us alright: down a path of destruction.
1316470404345520129 2020-10-15 04:06:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BrianSikoff Yes. How dare she simultaneously claim adherence to the original Constitution and yet not confirming she is pro peaceful transfer of power.  🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️

1316443930439774208 2020-10-15 02:21:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @spyderdobro Yes. You can set the quality of the video so it's higher. 4K is hard to edit unless you have a huge setup. I'd recommend shooting on 1080. It's high quality and won't shut your computer down.
1316443727771119617 2020-10-15 02:20:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DanRather Please don't give them any ideas.
1316441242880946176 2020-10-15 02:10:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @spyderdobro Yep, multiple. It's easy and looks good.
1316437473224880130 2020-10-15 01:55:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MaraWilson what about Anya Taylor Joy? And Olivia Cooke? No one would not know they're not American if they did not KNOW.

Also waiting for @SenFeinstein to not push through ANOTHER nominee of Trump's for the U.S. Supreme Court. It's infuriating that THEY THEMSELVES are covered and then act in the opposite of the people's best interests.

1316409245647077376 2020-10-15 00:03:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie It's going remote because Trump has COVID but he doesn't want to debate remotely so we will see what happens.

1316248417291530240 2020-10-14 13:24:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> "herd immunity" should not be "trending".  EVER.

1315710908186783744 2020-10-13 01:48:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thetevinator which surprisingly comes from family members sometimes, but it doesn't happen. If they do not care enough that you put your physical and emotional well-being first, it is okay to keep them at a distance. Without their toxicity, you will thrive. You have to do what's best 4u (2/2)
1315710649893175298 2020-10-13 01:47:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thetevinator I've had bosses say things. My mom had a very unhealthy view of herself which led her to always say she was "fat" even when she wasn't. This affected me. I was never diagnosed, but I am pretty sure I was anorexic at some point. The thing is: be healthy. Ignore toxicity (1/2)

And Northanger Abbey was kind of charming even though it's Jane Austen's first attempt at a novel.

They are not taking the necessary precautions and Trump probably feels comfortable taking down as many people with him as he can.

I went to a Starbucks &amp; ordered a sausage bacon breakfast biscuit but I asked them to make it vegan and they were like "no..." &amp; then I asked them to make a chocolate chip vanilla drink vegan and they said they couldn't make vegan with choc. chips.😭
1315083652464668674 2020-10-11 08:15:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PoweredBySeitan I'd love to eat most of the core except for the seeds. They are good for planting, although I haven't had success with planting apple seeds. I have started a couple of lemon trees though. Should take years to bear fruit, but 1 is 6-7 mos. old and the other is 1-2 mos. old.

1314822717036589056 2020-10-10 14:58:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> But this already happened at the first Presidential debate for 2020 and it was annoying AF

1314601371379752960 2020-10-10 00:19:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @KevOKeefe1979 No. Then the goal would be to vote out Pence. But we can't have a maniac in office.
1314578564604256256 2020-10-09 22:48:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @KevOKeefe1979 I mean, if Trump is unfit, why wait until Election Day? Trump could do a lot of harm between now and when he is hypothetically ousted.
1314451169092145153 2020-10-09 14:22:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @therealsibyl Oh no! For what it's worth, it's an alternative to antibiotics.
1314448807405391872 2020-10-09 14:13:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @therealsibyl I wonder what it's due to? I was suffering bad allergies and I tried everything. Finally took some colloidal silver. I went from feeling like I might need to go to the doctor to perfectly fine.
1314448515335163904 2020-10-09 14:12:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BasharM81 It could happen. I am just wondering if there's going to be a change in management and if so, how that might affect the voting process. Nancy Pelosi is also planning to outline what the 25th Amendment could mean.

1314398465460322304 2020-10-09 10:53:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie I would download clips from KeepVid. Pro  And then edit it together in FinalCutPro. You might also be able to do that in IMovie. Not sure about posting videos to Twitter tho.
1314397443182608385 2020-10-09 10:49:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie Thinking about doing an Isabelle Huppert one. I've never done one, though.

1314051957170999296 2020-10-08 11:56:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @the1weedqween @AOC Exactly!
1314047456724701184 2020-10-08 11:38:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> Had tix to see Mark Hamill or Fireball next week (at the same time). Guess I'm going to cancel the Hamill tix.
1314047038208655361 2020-10-08 11:36:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @evilhag Just make sure Trump tests negative. I don't want you to get COVID.
1314046315509149696 2020-10-08 11:33:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @marcorubio And she is...right.
1314042553763721217 2020-10-08 11:18:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @nunyabiz55 lol
1314039276242309120 2020-10-08 11:05:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheDailyShow @tornadodoc Where is "Mother" when you need her?
1314039135473033216 2020-10-08 11:05:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @nunyabiz55 😂 To be fair, it looks like Biden was in a field while Pence was on stage for the VP debate.
1314038931478831110 2020-10-08 11:04:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jilevin Same, though
1314038294963912704 2020-10-08 11:01:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @KimberDin It's not like I am undecided. I am anti-Trump and Biden isn't taking a stand against sexism, fracking, and global warming, so I'm just sitting here like  https://t.co/49wcSwhyLJ
1314037463459880962 2020-10-08 10:58:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @stateoflynn @JoeBiden Did Mr. VP stink that badly?
1314037338385735680 2020-10-08 10:58:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @flyinmikepence Very concerned about the fly right now.
1314037249374257153 2020-10-08 10:57:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> #pinkeyepence is a good name for Mikey, but I think I prefer Mr. Fly-Head  https://t.co/SVssY0Bq0m
1314037107824816129 2020-10-08 10:57:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AOC @Mike_Pence Mr. Fly-head thought he could "AOC" you, huh?
1314036915939631104 2020-10-08 10:56:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AOC To all those claiming that fracking doesn't cause earthquakes, it also causes sinkholes. What happens when you extract oil from the earth and there's nothing to fill it back up with?
1314034811128799232 2020-10-08 10:48:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> Thought I had a screening tonight but it was just a Q&amp;A for a film I hadn't seen so I watched the debates instead.🤷‍♀️
1314033556729950208 2020-10-08 10:43:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @YouthquakerMimi Agreed!  https://t.co/lhpTvIlIkJ

1314032102535356417 2020-10-08 10:37:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TonyBakercomedy Pence needs to get tested for COVID again!
1314031519241916416 2020-10-08 10:35:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> Kamala's husband wearing a mask while walking on the stage. Pence's wife not wearing a mask while walking on the stage.
1314031271773786112 2020-10-08 10:34:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> A bird landed on Bernie's podium. A fly landed on Mike Pence's head. Fitting in both cases.  https://t.co/uDJEbN5vWg
1314030723334979585 2020-10-08 10:31:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> Pence saying that it was learned after RBG's passing that she and Scalia were friends. Well, I learned that after watching the RBG documentary. I guess Pence missed that one.  🤦‍♀️ #VPDebate2020 #Debates2020 #VPDebate
1314030182311759873 2020-10-08 10:29:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> Mike Pence talking about how he and Trump are fighting against mail-in voting. I mean, he's not making a great case for citizens voting for Trump/Pence.  #VPDebate2020 #Debates2020 #VPDebate
1314027552843821056 2020-10-08 10:19:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @IngmarBoobman @therealaaronk I thought she was doing that in order to make Maya Rudolph's job fun.
1314026808090615810 2020-10-08 10:16:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> @KamalaHarris @sursharonans @JoeBiden Too bad. I am a registered Democrat. I am for fighting against global warming, not pandering to big oil. Please, do better.  👎👎👎👎
1314026267063193605 2020-10-08 10:14:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> I wouldn't mind if Harris/Biden pack the courts. After all, Kamala was talking about how Trump packed the courts with inept judges and out of all the lifetime appointments, did not appoint one black judge. I guess they'll have to make up for Trump's lousy picks. #VPDebate2020
1314025690036011008 2020-10-08 10:11:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> Kamala: "Let's talk about packing..." 😂 #VPDebate2020 #Debates2020 #VPDebate
1314025102929874945 2020-10-08 10:09:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> Pence talking about how Trump believes in the sanctity of life. 😂 Pleaase. 😂 210K dead and counting. 😭😭😭 #VPDebate2020 #Debates2020
1314024514347438080 2020-10-08 10:07:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @strangeharbors @NextBestPicture Did they also state it on the screen before the film started? Just wondering.
1314023858882535424 2020-10-08 10:04:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @johneberlejr Please go full force against him. He deserves it. #VPDebate2020 #Debates2020
1314023721493909505 2020-10-08 10:04:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> Mike Pence using his time to backtrack and answer the previous question when Trump is on tape calling our fallen troops "losers" and "suckers". We know Trump has no respect for them. Pence shouldn't even try to pretend like he does! #VPDebate2020 #Debates2020
1314023330651893761 2020-10-08 10:02:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @johneberlejr Did you just delete a much harsher tweet? 😂
1314022368029810689 2020-10-08 09:58:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> Mike,  I'll translate: "Thank you, VP Pence" means shut the f*** up and let Kamala speak. #VPDebate2020 #Debates2020
1314022160503988225 2020-10-08 09:57:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> Kind of distracted. The @aoc and Maya Rudolph conversation is much more interesting than Pence &amp; Kamala right now.
1314021845411065862 2020-10-08 09:56:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @bash0929 Gonna be known as the blink and turn.
1314021684823748610 2020-10-08 09:55:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @NextBestPicture @strangeharbors Oh wow! I haven't seen it. But it's clear some people don't pay attn to the rules.
1314021429805936640 2020-10-08 09:54:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Catheri08414490 @AOC Well, global warming is happening right away. We must react! I am anti-Trump, but we must hold our leaders in the Democratic Party accountable.
1314021084295880704 2020-10-08 09:53:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> Kamala tweeting and debating at the same time. 😉
1314020946211074049 2020-10-08 09:53:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @strangeharbors 😲 Did NYFF specify an embargo?
1314020189554368514 2020-10-08 09:50:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LiveFastDYEHard She's probably repeating Kamala's words, working on the intonation.
1314020056884363264 2020-10-08 09:49:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @IdeasDoneDaily @AOC 👏
1314019940584759297 2020-10-08 09:49:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Daminals76 @AOC Gotta win PA and gotta ban fracking. We must do both!!
1314019680428814336 2020-10-08 09:47:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> Checking out what @AOC has to say for a second as it's more on-point than what either of the candidates are saying. @SenKamalaHarris has to shill for her boss, I guess. #VPDebate2020 #Debates2020
1314019322990190592 2020-10-08 09:46:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @IdeasDoneDaily @AOC Hopefully, she'll be the Presidental candidate.
1314019037035200513 2020-10-08 09:45:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AOC  https://t.co/ZadVfnt9Gx
1314018918269288448 2020-10-08 09:44:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> Pence referring to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as @AOC  #Debates2020 #VPDebate2020
1314018703634128897 2020-10-08 09:44:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AOC Thank you! I am in California. Fracking causes earthquakes. It's terrifying that Kamala claims Biden will NOT ban fracking.
1314018519638401025 2020-10-08 09:43:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BDGarp Mike Pence: hater of women and gays.
1314018225647042560 2020-10-08 09:42:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> Kamala talking about how Joe Biden "will not ban fracking". Fracking causes earthquakes. Come on @SenKamalaHarris. Say something I can get BEHIND!!  #Debates2020 #VPDebate2020
1314017943525572608 2020-10-08 09:41:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> Mike Pence: "Wildflires"  #Debates2020 #VPDebate2020
1314017591673806850 2020-10-08 09:39:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> Pence was talking about how our (assumedly the USA's) water was some of the cleanest in the world. I don't know. I have to use a water filter. And the water coming out of my sink smelled like chlorine today. So, uh, no, try again Pence.  #Debates2020 #VPDebate2020
1314017118896058368 2020-10-08 09:37:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> Kamala insisting on more time since Pence interrupted her and kept plowing through calls for her to stop. 👏👏👏  #Debates2020 #VPDebate2020
1314016490333462528 2020-10-08 09:35:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> I wonder if Pence interrupts "Mother" as much as Kamala Harris. If so, I feel very sorry for Karen.  #Debates2020 #VPDebate2020
1314016187953475584 2020-10-08 09:34:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> Kamala talking about how Biden's prepared to take $10K off everyone's student loans. Not as progressive as Jill Stein's (2016 Green Party candidate) wiping out student debt altogether, but I'll take it!  #Debates2020 #VPDebate2020
1314014920803979264 2020-10-08 09:29:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sursharonans @natasharothwell I was wondering about that, but it sounded like he was gasping for air just now when he was talking about "fair trade".
1314014711189434370 2020-10-08 09:28:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SamSeder Is he not infected, though?
1314014225312800770 2020-10-08 09:26:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> @natasharothwell His voice is sort of dragging/lethargic.
1314014122296528896 2020-10-08 09:25:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> Pence talking about the "exceptional" care the President received at Walter Reed. Wish all Americans could receive such care.  #Debates2020 #VPDebate2020
1314013533835685888 2020-10-08 09:23:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RobertPWoolford When it's apparent that Pence is lying and the whole Trump/Pence campaign is a sham, it's pretty sad. I'm hoping they won't be misleading too many people tonight.
1314013258886475776 2020-10-08 09:22:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> I think Pence is far behind now that Kamala is onto the next question.  #Debates2020 #VPDebate2020
1314013103865036800 2020-10-08 09:21:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> Pence talking about how the swine flu is not as "lethal" as Coronavirus. 😜  #Debates2020 #VPDebate2020
1314012708769996800 2020-10-08 09:20:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> Pence wants to "go back" and talk about vaccines even though they've moved on to another topic.  #Debates2020 #VPDebate2020 👻
1314012310864715776 2020-10-08 09:18:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> Susan Page accidentally calling Senator Harris "Kamala" and "Kamala" was fine with it.
1314012114210574337 2020-10-08 09:17:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> Kamala talking about the current administration's "ineptitude".  #Debates2020 #VPDebate2020
1314011935101259776 2020-10-08 09:17:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> Pence thinks it's okay to meet outside and kind of forgot about the social distancing part.   #Debates2020 #VPDebate2020

1314011235130593280 2020-10-08 09:14:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> Pence interrupted Kamala and actually Kamala tried to cut him off. 😂 #Debates2020 #VPDebate2020
1314010938501066753 2020-10-08 09:13:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> Kamala Harris talking about over 210K dead bodies, putting everything right back in Pence's face. #Debates2020 #VPDebate2020
1314010683697111045 2020-10-08 09:12:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Chris8692 @TheSkepticalV I'll have a grilled COVID burger, please!!! (not)

1314006967296249857 2020-10-08 08:57:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot Agree. Not sure why it was allowed to continue "live" during a pandemic.

1313998585860558848 2020-10-08 08:24:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> I'm pretty proud of this tweet.
1313998530780905473 2020-10-08 08:23:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @realDonaldTrump You wouldn't know anything about needing affordable housing, so why don't you let the big boys &amp; girls help the "little" people. You know, the ones you don't care about, but expect to vote for you? You want to give us a 2nd stimulus AFTER you're voted in? No way! Pack your bags.
1313998131344801792 2020-10-08 08:22:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @mjs_DC @flightjkt They'd better not.
1313997651956822016 2020-10-08 08:20:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> Getting nervous for the VP debate tonight.
1313994648122085376 2020-10-08 08:08:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jurneesmollett Love it! You really rocked those costumes and that role.
1313972596799467521 2020-10-08 06:40:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wyrmgeard I think it helps because I recently saw the film twice.
1313971661192925184 2020-10-08 06:37:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> I am now reading I'M THINKING OF ENDING THINGS and I am going to compare the heck out of it and the movie.
1313969405269741568 2020-10-08 06:28:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> Especially since he murdered at a higher rate right before his arrest, I am sure he must have been inspired by watching it.
1313969217943658496 2020-10-08 06:27:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rlyrlysryDave Some kind of disconnect.
1313968184207175680 2020-10-08 06:23:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @GOPChairwoman It's not bigotry. Amy Coney Barrett is against the rights for millions of Americans and she is not trustworthy or competent. If anyone is the bigot, ACB is.

1313967364652761089 2020-10-08 06:20:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @susanorlean I hear you. My biggest problem is finding an idea to commit to. There are so many of them.
1313962758094778368 2020-10-08 06:01:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheEricSpiegel @CjHollidayWWG LOL, meanwhile they're dragging him off to jail.
1313957511251202049 2020-10-08 05:40:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CjHollidayWWG He will tweet"I am not leaving." Right before he's escorted out. I may be wrong. He may choose to tweet it in all caps.

1313674136661581824 2020-10-07 10:54:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Manimeconquest @Lulamaybelle That's great that it was canceled. L.A. Courts were supposed to reopen in July and they wanted me to be there the first week. I didn't keep track if the opening was delayed after I postponed my jury duty. But yeah, no one's life should be endangered for "business as usual".
1313673216544497670 2020-10-07 10:51:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Lulamaybelle I got one too. Was supposed to be a juror in JULY!! I was able to go online &amp; postpone it until December. I will most likely have to go online &amp; postpone it again if COVID hasn't wrapped up yet (I think they said you can get 2 extensions). I know how you feel. I was stressed out!
1313672378870763520 2020-10-07 10:47:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Dragonfly_Drama @stockguy61 when he goes around infecting people, the public deserves to know. If he can't be honest, he needs to step down.
1313671630434889728 2020-10-07 10:44:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @bewaredogkiller been there. keep with it if you can!

1313658759965675520 2020-10-07 09:53:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> I mean he should have said that we shouldn't have the debate next week if Trump was going to keep interrupting him.

1313620377310883840 2020-10-07 07:21:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LynnSharig8 So I guess we'll find out tomorrow what they're going to do about that. I can't imagine Kamala would be in the same vicinity as Pence. Trump has threatened to make an appearance. There's no way a reasonable person would not demand it be done remotely.

1313597113670889472 2020-10-07 05:48:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rosiecsilva @itsjojosiwa @claudiamconwayy Not sure. They tried to blame Hope Hicks who worked with Trump but apparently Trump had it first. Kellyanne went to an event for Trump's pick for US Supreme Court Justice and it seemed like she was a super spreader and several people got sick who were in contact with her.
1313595599409668096 2020-10-07 05:42:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TulsiGabbard @AOC @IlhanMN There's nothing wrong with voter harvesting. It's legal in California. You need to focus on the states where there aren't enough polling stations so people can get their votes in.
1313583850505875456 2020-10-07 04:56:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> Ryan Murphy @MrRPMurphy announcing Jeffrey Dahmer and Kellyanne Conway projects the same week makes total sense if you think about it.

1313567679677042689 2020-10-07 03:51:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BadJohnBrown He needs to bail us out after he failed to prevent the spread. It's an epic fail and it's not going to fool ME. Can't believe he's trying to do this.

Kellyanne Conway said she tested negative for COVID before testing twice so her daughter announced the truth to the world.
1313558732727435264 2020-10-07 03:16:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> @KellyannePolls Why the fuck did you infect your child? Also not everyone has access to the top doctors so stop spreading it!! Your line of reasoning sounds deranged and selfish

1313555606813339649 2020-10-07 03:03:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BuyMyScript And Kellyanne's calling her daughter the disrupter when she herself spread COVID around the whole Republican Party.
1313555296019644416 2020-10-07 03:02:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> Keeping up with the Conways would be a good reality TV series. I would settle for Kate McKinnon playing Kellyanne Conway and JoJo Siwa playing Claudia Conway if the show ends up being scripted.  @itsjojosiwa @claudiamconwayy

1313351177195581440 2020-10-06 13:31:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RufusTSuperfly I guess Rudy Giuliani's hand is awfully blue too. Wonder if it's the same strain of COVID.  https://t.co/u0ECf28Q4w
1313342004789571584 2020-10-06 12:55:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CajunBlueAZ1 Oh heck no! He is not better yet. They must not allow him. Kamala should insist on doing it remotely. Trump did not use the honor system to take a COVID test for the last debate. Kamala won't be able to trust Pence or the members of the audience. It's too dangerous.

1313324670905589760 2020-10-06 11:46:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @brenonade I guess that's what COVID'll do to someone.
1313323842949898241 2020-10-06 11:42:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fOrGiVeNcHy The way the Democratic Party has treated him and smashed him down has been angering enough. He should stay safe because it's obvious that Biden or Harris don't care enough about getting the Presidency. He should be doing videos only.

1313304078651334656 2020-10-06 10:24:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DemocratMachine @realDonaldTrump Same analogy for the Democrats though. Biden is a garbage candidate yet some will still vote for him.

If so, the conservatives keep spreading it to each other. What a disaster for them!

They are the ones making policy and it's dangerous that they do not enforce precautionary measures. Now look where we are. This time next week there are going to be a whole lot more sick people. The numbers are up already.

1312566518832537601 2020-10-04 09:33:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> Substituted cayenne for chilli pepper, didn't have sage (that was still fresh), and also substituted a bit of lemon juice instead of lemon pepper  Took about 20 minutes of me reading this until completing this vegan Alpha Burger from @alphafoods

1312513007830753280 2020-10-04 06:01:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ElMcClelland @realDonaldTrump It sounds like it's coming from a tired old man. And it begs the question: Was he having trouble breathing 7 years ago?
1312512770416410624 2020-10-04 06:00:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @prettygrimstuff @fOrGiVeNcHy Trump tests the Constitution almost daily it feels like. And it's so tiresome. I don't agree with Pence, but Trump deserves to be ousted and come what may with Pence. We can hold his feet to the fire if he acts like an ass as President.
1312511876517961728 2020-10-04 05:56:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fOrGiVeNcHy Pence would probably do a lot of harm, but Trump IS a sociopath and doesn't follow the rules (Constitution, etc.). I think Pence actually would be forced to abide by the legalities.

1311801977685209088 2020-10-02 06:55:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @EricAsher43 I nearly put Tuesday Weld, but I believe she was too young too.
1311751527007019008 2020-10-02 03:35:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @EricAsher43 I nearly listed her twice just out of enthusiasm, so I would understand.
1311746127004225537 2020-10-02 03:13:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thetevinator Almost chose Walter Matthau. I also chose Grant and Hepburn.

1311531875886800897 2020-10-01 13:02:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @zombie_ducky_82 Got rid of toxic people 1st Then eggs  Tried to go vegan &amp;sober at the same time but reincorporated alcohol thinking it was ok but when it wasn't, I gave it up about a year after going vegan. Baby steps. It's easier to give up 1thing at a time,but all 3 at once'd be impressive.

1311437794863063040 2020-10-01 06:48:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @lynnv378 It felt like Trump was a pre-schooler who wouldn't listen to directions and no one was brave enough to give him a time out.
1311437318050332672 2020-10-01 06:46:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> This has to be one of the craziest things Trump said all night. He doesn't know anything about negotiating drug prices. He thinks we have to send governors to other countries to get the drugs cheaper.

1311377817586728962 2020-10-01 02:50:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot It would have been fair if Biden walked out, but he and Chris Wallace stayed until the end even though they were nearly bludgeoned to death.

1311353464014991367 2020-10-01 01:13:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot If Trump couldn't pay attention to the rules at the debate, he should have been muted or thrown out. Same with holding office. If he can't follow procedure or pay attention to the Constitution, he should be thrown out. Americans are being held hostage.

1311155101789118464 2020-09-30 12:05:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> Can't wait to hear when California people are receiving their ballots. I haven't received mine yet, but am READY to vote early.

1311154398458867712 2020-09-30 12:02:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sadglamour @athrivingvegan Like if the Marx Bros. were only two people and if they kept interrupting each other.
1311154202438111233 2020-09-30 12:01:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> Should I write a review for THE GLORIAS tonight?
1311153242470887424 2020-09-30 11:57:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> @spaceprincess77 Thanks! It's basically done, but I'm just fine-tuning it.
1311153062145269760 2020-09-30 11:57:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cinemaidan @kassnfilm Never thought of that! 😂
1311152866795556864 2020-09-30 11:56:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kassnfilm Good Erin Brockovich. Guess that would have been weird. 🤣
1311152575740219392 2020-09-30 11:55:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> Realizing that in order to finish my script, I'm going to have to make the characters do the things I didn't want them to do.
1311152293551566849 2020-09-30 11:54:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @__kdd2020 Yeah, it was gross and idiotic.

1311143071854161922 2020-09-30 11:17:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> About to take a couple drops of hemp oil after that. #anxiety
1311142864450068480 2020-09-30 11:16:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sarahcpr Trump couldn't even get the two sons straight even when Biden corrected him.
1311141581852872704 2020-09-30 11:11:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Seven16 but he can interrupt one.
1311138575337975809 2020-09-30 10:59:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie 🙋‍♀️😭
1311138407649697793 2020-09-30 10:58:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kolbytoldme Exactly. He wanted to blame it all on the left and "Antifa" which doesn't even exist. Absolutely horrible. Not that anyone was expecting him to take responsibility. I was still waiting for him to denounce the KKK. Still waiting.
1311137795000291330 2020-09-30 10:56:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ThiaBallerina Biden was worried about Trump throwing 20 million people off their healthcare and not the 40 million people who already lost their healthcare because they lost their job in a pandemic. He doesn't know how to give any solutions.
1311136287953305601 2020-09-30 10:50:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> Insta's owned by Facebook so I'll stick with the bird.
1311135855797350404 2020-09-30 10:48:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> Everyone in America to Trump right now:
1311135246109163520 2020-09-30 10:46:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kolbytoldme he's more concerned with interrupting Joe.
1311135002457862145 2020-09-30 10:45:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> I'm out!
1311131435281989632 2020-09-30 10:31:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> I think they're going over now. #Debates2020
1311128209807650816 2020-09-30 10:18:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> Trump thinks we have clean water and air. Will someone tell him? #Trump2020
1311123636699328512 2020-09-30 10:00:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> Biden referring to bad police officers as "bad apples". Here we go again. #FAIL #Debates2020

1311122895242838016 2020-09-30 09:57:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @easy_andy It seems much worse, but honestly, Trump is interrupting Joe just as much or more than Hillary.
1311122652338159618 2020-09-30 09:56:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @goosername He needs to be able to have the power to shut off mics.
1311121742937513984 2020-09-30 09:52:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> Biden just called Trump a clown but Trump won't let him say one sentence uninterrupted. #Debates2020
1311121332415811584 2020-09-30 09:50:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @livinmediocre He just won't shut up like he has to keep talking.
1311121217294708736 2020-09-30 09:50:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> Omg Trump won't shut up!! #Debates2020
1311120775223455745 2020-09-30 09:48:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> Trump thinks job #s are tied to the stock market. ❓❓❓❓ #Debates2020
1311120454178938885 2020-09-30 09:47:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> Joe wants to pass a 28% tax on corporations.
1311119772776423425 2020-09-30 09:44:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> Trump's claiming he paid millions of dollars in federal taxes in 2016 and 2017. 🤪 #Debates2020
1311118860339167233 2020-09-30 09:41:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> It would have been nasty, but true. #Debates2020
1311118109248348162 2020-09-30 09:38:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> Really shocked Biden didn't mention that Herman Cain didn't die after attending one of Trump's rallies maskless when Trump was claiming there were no negative effects.
1311116257857400832 2020-09-30 09:30:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jamesrai100 Now Chris Wallace is going after Biden.
1311115117157736448 2020-09-30 09:26:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> Joe is unable to keep his composure and is laughing at Trump. I am unable to keep my composure too. It's a sh** show.
1311114910349180928 2020-09-30 09:25:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @dickexpert It's horrific. Makes for great comedy almost, but people are dead. UGH.
1311114696603312128 2020-09-30 09:24:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> Trump ALMOST didn't interrupt Joe as requested, but had to throw in a couple of "wrongs".
1311113952596647936 2020-09-30 09:21:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> Trump to Joe: "You gonna pack the court?" Joe asked Trump to SHUT UP!!!!

1311113454153998336 2020-09-30 09:19:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> It's a farce: the two stooges. #debates2020
1311113270716055553 2020-09-30 09:18:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tsasa198 Wow, didn't know that, but he's right about at least one thing.
1311113159223123968 2020-09-30 09:18:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> It's beyond rudeness and Donald Trump's mic should be cut off. #Debates2020
1311113048455704576 2020-09-30 09:18:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> Donald Trump just won't let Joe speak at all.
1311112773451968514 2020-09-30 09:16:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tsasa198 Trump thinks he can allow governors go to other countries to get drugs cheaper instead of negotiating prices with the pharmaceutical companies. 🤪
1311112522909413381 2020-09-30 09:15:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> Joe is laughing now that Trump is debating Chris Wallace, not Joe Biden.
1311112260807397376 2020-09-30 09:14:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tsasa198 Trump's insane and won't let anyone speak. I think they need to kick him off the #Debates2020
1311112115843772416 2020-09-30 09:14:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> DOnald is interrupted Joe like he's Hillary, like he's a little child wanting his dessert now and holding a tantrumuntil he gets it.
1311111901313556480 2020-09-30 09:13:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> Trump isn't letting Joe finish. #debates2020
1311111715317190656 2020-09-30 09:12:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tsasa198 "I am the Democratic Party right now." -Joe, 😭forbid
1311111541312249856 2020-09-30 09:12:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tsasa198 They're about to rip each other's heads off in any case. Trump's face is so red.
1311111410110226432 2020-09-30 09:11:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tsasa198 I didn't hear that, but it could have been the case. 🤣
1311111266761465856 2020-09-30 09:10:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> I'm sorry @JoeBiden what planet are you on????? We need #MedicareForAll
1311111127535763464 2020-09-30 09:10:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> Joe is worried about 20 million people losing their insurance if the ACA is stripped, but 40 million people are losing their insurance due to their job losses!! So please, we need #MedicareForAll
1311110771649077253 2020-09-30 09:09:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> Joe sounds like he's out of breath. #Debates2020
1311110548264689665 2020-09-30 09:08:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> Trump thinks Amy Coney Barrett is "respected buy all". Nope. Guess again. #TrumpLies
1311110147880620034 2020-09-30 09:06:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> I heard a "boo" or two.

1311024531411095552 2020-09-30 03:26:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @KamalaHarris @princeherman Where is Medicare for All? We are supposed to be a rich country. It is not asking for much. You need to get behind it or you are just as bad as the Republicans trying to take our healthcare away. Because healthcare shouldn't be tied to a job. And in a pandemic, we need it now.
1311024102975520768 2020-09-30 03:24:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MattWalshBlog Oh my goodness, please express your emotions before they explode in a fury.
1311023620483772416 2020-09-30 03:22:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DrLearnALot @MaxBoot @loudproudpissed Biden caring more about recruiting a few Republicans in order to alienate millions of progressives is a poor move. It didn't help when Hillary did it and it seems like Biden WANTS to lose.

With so many polling places being closed, it's NECESSARY to have as many options to deliver the ballots as possible. I have a car and I live near my polling station. But what about others?

It's not okay for people in power to continue to put down a community that is already experiencing violence and hostility.

1310696607784955905 2020-09-29 05:43:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sophiejoswald Also in 2002 I had a surgery to transpose a pinched nerve. 3 of my fingers were numb and the surgery was intended to help me recover and it did. Was also scary and I was looking for alternatives, but I didn't know of any back then. I waited about 9 months to make a decision.
1310696054925324288 2020-09-29 05:41:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sophiejoswald I had surgery 3 years ago with a 4-6 recovery time. As long as you trust the doctor and prepare for it, you'll be okay. :)

1310691006623277056 2020-09-29 05:21:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jamesrai100 Often Hollywood rewards films that seem to have a progressive message in order to appear woke without really considering if the material is valid or representative.

1310662493669224448 2020-09-29 03:27:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR They might find a way. She has albums worth of songs and is an activist. I'm sure there's plenty of material. They just need to make sure it's compelling.
1310661147834548224 2020-09-29 03:22:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR It depends on the filmmaker and the final product. I have seen horrible docs on people whose music I love and good docs on musicians I didn't really care about.

1310621866394959874 2020-09-29 00:46:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @OptiUnderground It's true. There are also many feasible alternatives. I may have thought I missed it at first, but now I really don't. Yesterday, I had a vegan patty melt at Burgerlords in L.A. Covered with vegan cheese but didn't contribute to my allergies.
1310620615917723648 2020-09-29 00:41:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> @OptiUnderground I react to dairy strongly too! Feel free to note things in movies. Hollywood tries to normalize milk drinking despite the violence to animals and humans.
1310606304763760640 2020-09-28 23:44:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RegalasFox I know I shopped at Wal-mart when I was in college. There are many other easy/cheap options, though. I can't judge consumers if they can't afford it, but there are MANY MANY options now.
1310605267113893888 2020-09-28 23:40:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @alissamarieek Some people go for the "ease" factor, but it won't be easy peasy when Bezos owns the world. I try to tell people about all the other options.
1310602923227799552 2020-09-28 23:31:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> Imagine if Americans boycotted Bezos' companies (Amazon, Whole Foods, etc.) for the greater good. Giving Bezos money won't help you or your fellow man. Keep clicking that button and you're complicit with Bezos abusing his employees and mom and pop shops going out of business.

Balanced meals help keep one healthy. Binging badly can throw everything off or encourage habits more than once week. 🤷‍♀️
1310105350167695361 2020-09-27 14:33:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SaltTehFries That would be okay. I was just imagining. What if he lost his healthcare? It was denied for preexisting conditions? Or was forced to work during the pandemic without proper PPE?

1310063852780810241 2020-09-27 11:48:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BenCloverfield @JoeBiden Healthcare was already taken when people lost their jobs. Healthcare shouldn't be tied to jobs especially in a pandemic. Biden has the worst plan for climate change during the Democratic debates. He is the most sexist and he doesn't care about POC. He track record proves it.
1310062771057295360 2020-09-27 11:44:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BenCloverfield @JoeBiden He promised things would remain the same. The DNC bullies everyone into endorsing Joe Biden. Both parties are like the mafia. They're enriching themselves and don't care about the people. I am completely disgusted with the system. Biden is not for basic rights like healthcare.

1310059214132318209 2020-09-27 11:30:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JoeBiden We need Medicare for All and an aggressive plan to combat climate change. You are a day late and a dollar short. You're uninspiring and won't help anything if you're elected. Now is not the time to assure everyone things will be the same. They'd better not.

1309991165274386432 2020-09-27 07:00:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @savannahpatoot I forced myself to present and then do stand up comedy. Face your worst fears. And then you'll know you can do it and then you never have to do it again.
1309990879541694464 2020-09-27 06:58:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot @astrdmagnussen It got better when I went vegan at 35 and now at 39 it's getting worse but just for normal reasons.
1309990489509175296 2020-09-27 06:57:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> Brandon Cronenberg must be filming his new project in Spain.
1309990087376080897 2020-09-27 06:55:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> I saw a tweet about someone concerned about their 3K films in their watchlist. I wanted to help them out but the post disappeared from my feed. 😭

1309920644419604481 2020-09-27 02:19:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @littlefilme I binged hard on Veronica Mars (everything within 6-8) days. I spaced out Twin Peaks the Return because I watched it once a week as it was being released.
1309919815625134080 2020-09-27 02:16:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @norrthpier @leo3375 @nypost Maybe there's a reason he would get eaten alive in prison. Because that would be justice
1309916194934202368 2020-09-27 02:02:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> Now starring yours truly as Liv Ullmann and Nina as Bibi Andersson in the Persona remake  https://t.co/ENIyclds89
1309913393940242432 2020-09-27 01:51:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> Holy Guacamole! I forgot to include Nina in the census!  https://t.co/4n5fS9CzeL
1309889522545557504 2020-09-27 00:16:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PplsCityCouncil @MayorOfLA We've been calling on him to fire Chief Moore, but they are "friends". We need the mayor to take immediate action. It makes me want to avoid going into West Hollywood.
1309889233985781766 2020-09-27 00:15:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JulesPostman @letterboxd Cool!

1309723330786725888 2020-09-26 13:15:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> Why is Trump using tax dollars for re-election ads... and getting away with it??

1309722361269112832 2020-09-26 13:11:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @letterboxd The best dream sequence in any movie is Los Olvidados by Luis Buñuel, so the quote is fitting.
1309716482301947904 2020-09-26 12:48:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie 123 according to IMDb. I feel like that's a small number.
1309714030978768898 2020-09-26 12:38:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka @wesjunkie Yes to the language (Korean), but unfortunately, I can't speak it.
1309713915442462726 2020-09-26 12:38:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie I voted for no but then remembered they're at least better than Marvel.

1309623549879934978 2020-09-26 06:39:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> Okay, it didn't go viral. Luke, I am going to give you your money back.
1309621708953772032 2020-09-26 06:32:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @astrdmagnussen Exactly. Like is that the age our faces start falling off?
1309619943311253504 2020-09-26 06:25:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> You mean to tell me that  1) this tweet is real and  2) the shelves are pretty empty but there was a Baby Yoda left in stock?  https://t.co/rAGQ1QZwu2

1309571589646610433 2020-09-26 03:12:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> That would be so funny if no one cared (until it was too late).
1309571417097207808 2020-09-26 03:12:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @lukerohandavid And if it doesn't blow up, thanks for being my friend.
1309571337665433600 2020-09-26 03:11:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @lukerohandavid 😂 The thought to write this occurred after finding "deals" for haunted houses in my inbox. I don't usually go even in non-COVID years, so...
1309570673904238592 2020-09-26 03:09:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> Haunted houses are super scary this year, because after visiting, you might come back with COVID.

1309367495241859073 2020-09-25 13:41:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ChristlStringer @letterboxd This one is much better than her others.
1309364628342726661 2020-09-25 13:30:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> It kind of felt like Harmony Korine and/or Todd Solondz remade SHOPLIFTERS, but that's just my take.  My ★★★½ review of KAJILLIONAIRE (2020) on @letterboxd:  https://t.co/DscX2fqTkh #moviereview
1309363741411045377 2020-09-25 13:26:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> My ★ review of Lost Girls &amp; Love Hotels (2020) on @letterboxd:  https://t.co/RqgrDUGoa4   I kind of feel justified that it got consistently bad reviews and it's not just me.
1309362372784435200 2020-09-25 13:21:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @FormaldehydeFce No, I liked Antebellum a lot. At least I'm very fond of Janelle Monáe's acting.  https://t.co/uYhTlPcqmV
1309359589842849793 2020-09-25 13:10:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @gabehudson Oh yeah.
1309359480623173632 2020-09-25 13:10:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevinveegan Well, it was an advance screening I think.  https://t.co/ims03ISWtI
1309359352034201600 2020-09-25 13:09:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RileyJoeyDeLuc2 My theater showed it tonight but it was a virtual screening.

1309357425854619648 2020-09-25 13:01:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevinveegan But good guess, regardless.
1309357323073150977 2020-09-25 13:01:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @madfrieza hahahhaa  I would do that, but I also have lots to say about the horrible film. I'd have to do it justice but elucidating how horrible it is.
1309357149332545536 2020-09-25 13:00:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevinveegan Nah, I already saw that one.  https://t.co/znJN0NyC5l

1309356569633595392 2020-09-25 12:58:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RileyJoeyDeLuc2 I shouldn't preempt my review but yes, it's worth watching.
1309355637298491392 2020-09-25 12:54:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fieldsofsoda Cool!
1309355588254445568 2020-09-25 12:54:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheTruthNiggaX1 Limited theater release. I don't know about other options.
1309355483468189697 2020-09-25 12:54:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> I saw a really horrible movie that kind of blew every other bad movie out of the water. And since I am backlogged writing reviews for like 10 films, I probably won't get around to giving it the nasty review it deserves.
1309355100662452225 2020-09-25 12:52:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fieldsofsoda It comes out tomorrow.
1309355052092387330 2020-09-25 12:52:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheTruthNiggaX1 Me too! I guess it gets released tomorrow.
1309354954130247680 2020-09-25 12:52:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> And yet here we are!
1309354602739843072 2020-09-25 12:50:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @EdanClay Oh wow, um, this could be his worst idea yet. The best part is that it really isn't up to him, though.
1309354425215983616 2020-09-25 12:49:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> Should I release my Kajillionaire review tonight?

1309176199453835266 2020-09-25 01:01:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> So if I stopped the vegan alerts, you'd go vegan, right?
1309175918464729088 2020-09-25 01:00:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MayorOfLA Fire Chief Michael Moore
1309173528126803971 2020-09-25 00:51:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BrianDeCesare @TeamPelosi And @MayorOfLA REFUSES to fire corrupt Chief Moore. Mayor Garcetti considers him a "friend". Yet this friend attacks and targets normal everyday people in Los Angeles.
1309173172672004096 2020-09-25 00:49:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TeamPelosi Yes. And we should have Medicare for All and you need to roll up your sleeves instead of stating the OBVIOUS and doing the BARE MINIMUM.
1309172843171676160 2020-09-25 00:48:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR Maybe The Wedding Singer or Happy Gilmore
1309172712519004160 2020-09-25 00:47:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @vildhjartaa I've seen festivals that have video games or virtual reality things on the side, but when I'm going to a film festival, I'm pretty much only interested in films. It's a crossover that may or may not work.
1309172445421727747 2020-09-25 00:46:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @faveamanda He was toxic, but he also spent years making his films, because he was a perfectionist.

1309165232707833857 2020-09-25 00:18:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @beepuke @evolvingSoulll ashwaganda and Holy Basil help for stress. So does organic skullcap herb. CBD is helpful. You're already getting your greens. Have you eliminated the toxic people in your life?

1309009483205619712 2020-09-24 13:59:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Lulamaybelle I usually only do that for watch parties when actually talking about the film.
1309008052176252928 2020-09-24 13:53:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @700wlw @LMPD Wow! They could have arrested and charged the cops responsible for the murder of Breonna Taylor so arguably "innocent" cops wouldn't get shot. But maybe, just maybe ACAB.
1308992338342051847 2020-09-24 12:51:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @edithdrod I've seen some people move. It's sad!! But yes, things are still changing and evolving and eventually we will know the new normal. COVID cases are dropping here according to the mayor's speech today. It has to remain consistent for 2 more weeks before they start reopening again.

1308818098431037445 2020-09-24 01:18:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chronically1999 It can be easier until you start cutting and blending things. It can get involved. But I make a raw vegan cheesecake from time to time and it's better and healthier than I can buy at the store.
1308817818842923008 2020-09-24 01:17:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @slasherhomo I saw it before I knew what they stood for. I'd watch it. Take the entertainment value and erase the rest of it.

1308550513378521088 2020-09-23 07:35:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Carmelcorn_pop Impossible burgers are vegan. They have GMOs so I generally don't eat them. Often fast food places will add cheese or sauce or buns that have dairy (like Carl's Jr. you had to hold the sauce and cheese to make it vegan). I don't personally know about the Impossible Whopper.
1308543580646993926 2020-09-23 07:07:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cryborg @NBCNews They literally created multiple accounts for customers without the customers' knowledge. Not sure ow Wells Fargo is still in business.

1308502222465126401 2020-09-23 04:23:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> Some guy named Phil Collins is running on the Prohibition Party ticket.   Kanye West is running on the Birthday Party ticket.  Can't make this up!!
1308495522223677440 2020-09-23 03:56:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot College debt is pocket change to them I'm sure. But they continue to stifle people from getting education and more education and have no debt-forgiveness when it comes to schooling and it keeps everyone in the country down. :(

1308109437312184320 2020-09-22 02:22:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @strangeharbors Gonna have to agree!
1308109389648203776 2020-09-22 02:22:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TAGMovieReviews Excellent!
1308109237269094400 2020-09-22 02:22:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> Titanic was simply 1912's Fyre Festival.

1308105993151115265 2020-09-22 02:09:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BernieSanders Yes, Bernie. That's a great idea. Prosecute Jeff Bezos for every Amazon worker that died due to unsafe conditions and inadequate protections during the pandemic.
1308105458293456896 2020-09-22 02:06:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @slowasucango @TicoRomao @RealJamesWoods @JimCameron Yes, but unless it hits the original iceberg, what's the point?
1308104789427806209 2020-09-22 02:04:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MovieBlogMerc Theaters are currently closed in Los Angeles too. :(
1308101946515976192 2020-09-22 01:53:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MovieBlogMerc U.S. theatrical release was Sept 18 I saw a screener right before the release. I believe it was released one week prior to the U.S. release date in Canada
1308100704314167297 2020-09-22 01:48:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> @GavinBooth @Variety @Variety_Film @RottenTomatoes True! Good attitude. Maybe one day they'll realize they were wrong.
1308099607491084289 2020-09-22 01:43:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @GavinBooth @Variety @Variety_Film @RottenTomatoes True, I guess. It'd be great to be in Variety for the exposure, but I thought I'd speak my mind. I OFTEN disagree with them!!
1308099449462218753 2020-09-22 01:43:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TAGMovieReviews Touché!
1308098901581291520 2020-09-22 01:40:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> I'M THINKING OF ENDING THINGS:  Jesse &amp; Jessie: used initials JB/JP in case of typing too fast and attributing a quote to the wrong Jess(i)e  ANTEBELLUM:  Had to write out J. Malone and/or J. Monaé, because  actresses Jena Malone and Janelle Monaé had the same initials.
1308098648870326272 2020-09-22 01:39:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> I often write the actors' names or initials for shorthand while writing notes, but I had to do something different for the following movies recently:

1308095590509682691 2020-09-22 01:27:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Variety_Film Oh wow! I really liked this film. You're on the wrong side of film history.
1308093531244785664 2020-09-22 01:19:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AquafabaMcGee Yes, definitely.
1308093116994342914 2020-09-22 01:17:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ciara_nicole777 @VPetalu3 It's the best choice you'll ever make!
1308092816757682176 2020-09-22 01:16:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BadJohnBrown You'd think!!!!!!!!
1308091850402590720 2020-09-22 01:12:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Tessicat Aww! Nice. In any case, will keep you posted on any future trips to London.
1308091713676742656 2020-09-22 01:12:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AquafabaMcGee I didn't think so either at the time! Doctors often don't know anything about nutrition anyway. But yes, a balanced diet is to be recommended and I believe after a month he was able to incorporate other things and had a daughter who was vegan, so she probably guided him.
1308091374873395200 2020-09-22 01:11:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sororityxnoise I'm going to have to agree. Plus she's one of my favorite singers.
1308090647820210177 2020-09-22 01:08:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> I probably won't say something if someone is walking by with out a mask or not social distancing in line, but I probably won't feel like going back to a business if precautions aren't being taken seriously enough. 🤷‍♀️
1308088746613432320 2020-09-22 01:00:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @liamhenneberry Oh man!! Looks so good.
1308087736188899329 2020-09-22 00:56:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sororityxnoise I went through my favorite horrors and there were people in my favorite horrors I admired or thought were really great, but Debbie Harry's character is crush-worthy.
1308083004728721408 2020-09-22 00:37:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Tessicat I was hoping to go to London in April (had the plane tix) and at some point, I may reschedule the trip. I'll keep you posted, but I don't expect the USA will recover anytime soon.
1308080544954028032 2020-09-22 00:27:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @edithdrod Can't be objective about this, but I started the Beyond Corona Film Festival @beyondcoronaff this year for films 4 minutes or less.
1308078105873903629 2020-09-22 00:18:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AquafabaMcGee It sounded really weird to me too, but I guess he suffered a heart attack and that's what the doctors recommended.
1308060277728923648 2020-09-21 23:07:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @donwinslow @mooshypie @TomPerez @Yahoo Oh no no, they're rolling over and planning to fail again! Can't you see by their selection that they don't care for what Americans want? I don't know if Joe Biden even has a pulse. He's a dead man walking.

1307883158927323136 2020-09-21 11:23:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> It basically makes no sense to me when filmmakers accomplish so much on a small level and then studios throw money at them. Their creativity dries up more often than not.

1307810195607678976 2020-09-21 06:33:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> I certainly hope so! And let's not forget about coconut, walnut, cashew, macadamia nut, and hemp milks! There are other alternatives too like soy, almond, and sesame milks.  https://t.co/XuyuAbK39l
1307797238794469376 2020-09-21 05:42:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @spyderdobro It really depends. Sometimes they can make 2-3 in a row and then come back with a good one.

I don't see how people can turn off their emotions at stuff like that or continue to put themselves first and not think about anyone else despite having resources. I have definitely had to keep some family members at a distance as well.

I tried to respect his beliefs and try to see where he was coming from, but he did not do the same for me. Therefore, that's not a friendship.
1307743436070481921 2020-09-21 02:08:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @eatentexp OMG! I can't imagine. 😭
1307743313517191168 2020-09-21 02:07:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CassandraRules Let me guess. You're a landowner.
1307742492385636352 2020-09-21 02:04:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @eatentexp Oh no!! But it sounds like my kind of movie.
1307741836065161216 2020-09-21 02:02:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> I really want to watch Blackbird, but I also really want to get to all my projects.  https://t.co/qYMJtjG4OU
1307740562653503488 2020-09-21 01:57:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Emily_Is_Moore I've heard the book was much clearer. I saw the film twice. It definitely is more unique than other films and I'd love to check it out again once I read the novel.
1307736605478629377 2020-09-21 01:41:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AdamNicksAuthor LOL, thanks!
1307735673365909504 2020-09-21 01:37:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AdamNicksAuthor Documentary, narrative, landscape, + I have a few motifs. I hope to make a couple short films around certain themes.

1307732247202553861 2020-09-21 01:23:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ChuckMonarch @ThatsJacqueline Certainly seems that way.
1307726381900423168 2020-09-21 01:00:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LesserWachowski Sounds perfect!!
1307725951896178688 2020-09-21 00:58:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ChuckMonarch @ThatsJacqueline And Republicans don't like her and she's useless to Democrats.
1307725490732425216 2020-09-21 00:57:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LesserWachowski Make a film, I can help you put it on IMDb if necessary, and I'd be happy to add you.

1307666330837868544 2020-09-20 21:02:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @senrobportman @realDonaldTrump Trump's other nominees were complete crap! Do the right thing for once...
1307526944087445505 2020-09-20 11:48:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @starlittbritt Well, that's just cute.
1307477850576973826 2020-09-20 08:33:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> In 2012, I filmed as much as I could when I was in Europe, thinking I wouldn't have funds to travel afterward. Thankfully I kept going back every other year or so. Now that I can't go back due to the pandemic, I have all this footage to try to make into films.
1307453044368371713 2020-09-20 06:54:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thehorrorkidd Looks cool! I'll have to try that out.

1307414782899662853 2020-09-20 04:22:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> Thanks for joining everyone!! This time there wasn't a lot of tweeting but that's okay! Sometimes it's hard to tweet and watch. See you next Saturday for The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh at noon PST. #BrotherWatchParty
1307413409579761664 2020-09-20 04:17:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> Wow, sweet! #BrotherWatchParty
1307408659475869696 2020-09-20 03:58:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @michaelmnola Not sure, but the air quality is way better than last week. I think it's still affecting my allergies, though.
1307402687948836865 2020-09-20 03:34:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> Thanks for tuning in everyone!! #BrotherWatchParty  Enjoying it so far?
1307397445052059649 2020-09-20 03:13:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SenTedCruz Shut up! You can't even wear a mask in an airport or on an airplane. Your gross negligence shows that you know NOTHING about what the American people need.
1307396197468893184 2020-09-20 03:08:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @_bronni Looks fine. It's the same way mine looks with the black edges.

I am not familiar with Scener but perhaps we could do that next time? I've done NetflixParty and sometimes it works better than other times. I'll pin a post and we can comment there.
1307392797062737920 2020-09-20 02:55:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> See everyone in 5 minutes!! at Noon!! For the BROTHER BEAR Watch Party   #BrotherWatchParty
1307386438737043457 2020-09-20 02:29:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ebonrook_film Sorry, David! We only have one more Disney+ watch party and then it's back to other streaming platforms.
1307384380550119425 2020-09-20 02:21:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @swallowit_ *SERIOUS* concessions! YES!
1307384097459724289 2020-09-20 02:20:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @urbanherbiv0re Plus I think PETA threw paint on anyone wearing fur coats and it helped to dissuade them and it fell out of fashion.

1307368260095016961 2020-09-20 01:17:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SenMcSallyAZ Nope.

1307327159988445187 2020-09-19 22:34:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VChallenge52 @TiaCordelia Are you the "boyfriend"?
1307326894052765696 2020-09-19 22:33:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TiaCordelia He's a POS plain and simple
1307326073160364040 2020-09-19 22:29:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheCinemaSpot Not interested! 😂
1307320107727638528 2020-09-19 22:06:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ems_b I felt the Northridge earthquake in 1994. That was bad but that doesn't erase how scary last night's quake was. You never know how bad it's going to be when it's happening.
1307319499226378240 2020-09-19 22:03:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @spaceprincess77 Oh wow, that's rough! Did you feel the 2nd earthquake around that time?
1307319186406780930 2020-09-19 22:02:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rosiecsilva Yes. 4.8 = felt it but it was practically over by the time I woke up
1307226504946790400 2020-09-19 15:54:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @spaceprincess77 I was up for like an hour then I tried getting some sleep. Ugh it's so hard though!!!
1307224023021969414 2020-09-19 15:44:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @spaceprincess77 Here I was hoping for some rest...
1307223929124085762 2020-09-19 15:44:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> I was not awake when the earthquake happened. If it had been "big" I absolutely would have forgotten my photos and hard drive if I needed to evacuate.
1307223725348061185 2020-09-19 15:43:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @spaceprincess77 So glad you're okay!!
1307223213257097216 2020-09-19 15:41:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @spaceprincess77 Yes and yes 😭

1307216650660229125 2020-09-19 15:15:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SaltTehFries I mean, I can see it. I would like to see more films like that
1307216327594057733 2020-09-19 15:13:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rak_strong Depends. Usually no. If I wanted to dedicate my life to them or vice versa we should have stayed together.
1307216169154146304 2020-09-19 15:13:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> Thursday someone left this comment for me and by Friday night we got an earthquake. 😭  https://t.co/PtBz8RQMYQ

1307213922907250688 2020-09-19 15:04:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @liluant Yeah okay. At first I was like scared but now I'm just overtired

1307208559537446915 2020-09-19 14:43:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @athrivingvegan It was punchy. Woke me up. I got up to check on things but it was over quickly. So glad it was only 4 point something!!!  https://t.co/4X8KufaR9p
1307207819242864641 2020-09-19 14:40:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> That earthquake was short but terrifying.
1307199129026617344 2020-09-19 14:05:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @spyderdobro No. I write for posterity because I'm not getting paid anyway. Might as well get CRED.
1307188893796589568 2020-09-19 13:24:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> Fatigued, so going to have to watch episode #5 tomorrow. Each film, episode, and short from Varda is such a gift!!
1307180311516643330 2020-09-19 12:50:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> @madfrieza It's more like an unhealthy addiction.
1307179578847162376 2020-09-19 12:47:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @madfrieza I watched the intro again for clarity and believe me, it's the last thing I wanted.
1307179192463757312 2020-09-19 12:46:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @madfrieza Yes, especially since the timeline is a little messy among many other problems with it.
1307178998980440064 2020-09-19 12:45:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @snailcooper I saw some real nastiness today from both sides.

1307108432974053376 2020-09-19 08:05:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Victoriakodai Just viewed some conservative who was saying absolutely nasty things. Ughhhhhh.

1307107820853178373 2020-09-19 08:02:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TrinityResists @senatemajldr I can't see Biden winning, but yes, McConnell should be forced to wait and hopefully Mitch will be ousted at least.
1307107340748025856 2020-09-19 08:00:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CelluloidWhisky @IngmarBoobman I found a record player/tape deck yesterday that was set out for the trash! Unfortunately, there was a record still in the player and the sun melted it to an unfortunate degree (and it was a Ray Orbison album too).
1307107103820181505 2020-09-19 07:59:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @IngmarBoobman Marry her!
1307106321091760134 2020-09-19 07:56:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Victoriakodai I know...very bad timing. They should delay her replacement until after the election if they want to act consistently, because that's what happened last time.

1306830841956372480 2020-09-18 13:42:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RBReich 2016 were grossly inaccurate. Let's not forget the CNN polls that predicted Hillary would win by excluding most demographics.

1306825934364794882 2020-09-18 13:22:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ccadelago He sounds like a loser. As a president he could do that. And if not why would anyone vote for him? We already have Trump and he's not mandating anything.
1306825359824834561 2020-09-18 13:20:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @NihachuEatsCats I'm sorry for being so sorry
1306825244347305984 2020-09-18 13:19:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sororityxnoise Nah just be yourself and literally ignore anyone who tells you otherwise. They are so not worth it and they don't know you. Only you know you. It's normal to seek community but go for the ppl that will build you up and not year you down. I learned the hard way.
1306823123002519552 2020-09-18 13:11:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sororityxnoise I think In every group of people Whether it's social, religious, political or whatever there are some people that want to feel superior or put down others. Hang in there and we are there to support you if you need it. I hate when people act in a toxic manner. 😰

1306766315525341184 2020-09-18 09:25:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @lesbians4tulsi It sounds insane but it actually helped. Feel free to Dm to vent or reach out. (2/2)
1306766144968122368 2020-09-18 09:25:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @lesbians4tulsi I had an aunt die that way and it was not worth it. I know sometimes people feel down. There are healthy ways to deal with it I used to be depressed. I cut out toxic ppl in my life. My nutritionist/cooking teacher also recommended lots of greens like kale and spinach per day(1/2)

1306660117065031680 2020-09-18 02:23:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> Oh heck no! That's why we need a national mandate. People should STAY AT HOME until this is over. And be required to wear masks in public. What is so hard about this?

1306653305016180738 2020-09-18 01:56:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @joelgolby It's supply and demand. If demand falls and the supply increases the prices are supposed to drop. If they have high payments they made a bad investment and you can go elsewhere or buy the property if the landlord goes into default.
1306644671532163072 2020-09-18 01:22:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ChristerEm Yes, restaurants are basically take out only. There are some outerlying areas that have dine-in but it's really not allowed.
1306644259940884480 2020-09-18 01:20:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @faveamanda For real.
1306643991941636096 2020-09-18 01:19:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ChristerEm In dining yes. Most businesses are not allowed to be open and hair salons can only be open if they have an outside space. The law differs from different cities and counties and states, though.
1306643616522092547 2020-09-18 01:18:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chefphoteamuh I used to take Lexapro but was never really comfortable with the medication or side effects. If I feel anxious or get a panic attack, I will use 3-5 drops of high grade hemp oil (from ChakraOrganics). For cramps and anxiety, Traditional Medicinals' Stress Ease tea works too.
1306641577121468416 2020-09-18 01:10:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ChristerEm Yes. Los Angeles was hit hard. Closed since March with no reopening day in sight. It's much worse over here.
1306638705789083648 2020-09-18 00:58:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> Or wasting gas. Los Angeles theaters are still closed.
1306638585144078337 2020-09-18 00:58:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ChristerEm No here in the USA COVID is a very real threat because people aren't being safe or taking precautions. Deaths haven't gone down here. Theaters are not open in Los Angeles so San Diego is about 2 hours away and Las Vegas is about 3.5 hours away.
1306637218329444354 2020-09-18 00:52:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BillyDStarchild @Sweetswoo1 Same deal. The Christmas after I went sober , my family tried to give me a bunch of wine. Now I'm two years alcohol-free. I'm sending you encouragement and good vibes!!

1306452292464340992 2020-09-17 12:37:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> Looks like Harley Quinn and Billie Eilish had a baby.
1306451621736448000 2020-09-17 12:35:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LostDiva Yeah unfortunately I ordered something from @IKEAUSA in July and @IKEAUSAHelp never got back to me. I was supposed to receive it in August. Anyway... good they support their workers but they are so backlogged with orders.
1306443345657430016 2020-09-17 12:02:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chronically1999 Me but veganizing everything in Reese Witherspoon's Southern cookbook. 😆
1306442247697608708 2020-09-17 11:57:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @katalin_pota @JoeBiden is out of the loop. He is alienating too many voters!!!!
1306417926157692930 2020-09-17 10:21:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @OtherFilmGuys Thanks!
1306417874714595328 2020-09-17 10:21:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @IngmarBoobman I've noticed seeds have gotten more expensive. Also it's not guaranteed that seeds will grow to fruition, however I recommend seeds or starters from nurseries. For seeds from organic fruits or veggies I just save them from the ones I eat. I have had about a 50% success rate

1306411556737921025 2020-09-17 09:56:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> Get your tix for the Beyond Corona Film Festival this year! It'll run from October 5-11, 2020! The selection will be announced soon.   https://t.co/K0eIg0as8Y

1306369891759316992 2020-09-17 07:10:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SilverMelinda Oh, that's so scary!! You need to be protected as well as the other customers inside the store.
1306355823942090752 2020-09-17 06:14:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @_morbidite Have you ever had to evacuate because of the hurricanes?
1306354991372746753 2020-09-17 06:11:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @_morbidite Cool. I've been wanting to go to Miami but it's going to have to wait. Between Coronavirus and the hurricanes I haven't found a good time to travel.
1306351399093977088 2020-09-17 05:56:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @_morbidite My family used to live near Tampa.
1306351314020884480 2020-09-17 05:56:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @_morbidite Dang! I think I just saw the contracts. 😅
1306346150706905088 2020-09-17 05:36:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> @_morbidite That was pretty extreme! I doubt the Grammys have anything to do with the contract he signed. Unless he thinks the music industry is in cahoots in every aspect and somehow he's suffering from all the millions of $$ he's made.
1306345890827829249 2020-09-17 05:35:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> @_morbidite I believe Vero Beach area.
1306337010919989248 2020-09-17 04:59:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @_morbidite I had family living there, but my best friend from high school still lives there. I just wish EVERYONE could be safe!!!!
1306336817663209473 2020-09-17 04:59:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @edithdrod @TheLauraMcQuay I talked to someone and I think this MAY be an option in some circumstances. Just make sure you have someone to drive you home in case it doesn't wear off right away.
1306336670434775040 2020-09-17 04:58:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @edithdrod I took someone to get an MRI recently. As long as you don't move you're good. I was trying to get them to act as if they'e taking a nap. That's what I would do and what I do during haircuts, etc.
1306329823174774784 2020-09-17 04:31:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BDGarp He'd go to jail, directly to jail, and not collect $200. If he forfeited the election, the Speaker would automatically become President. I don't know if he knows this.
1306295961434558464 2020-09-17 02:16:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SilverMelinda Florida seems to be different since they don't require masks in the state. My state (CA) does require it, but I can't keep track of all the state that don't. AZ? TX? It's scary because I know people who live in all these states.
1306295716050948096 2020-09-17 02:15:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Seven16 Man, that's okay!
1306291601799438336 2020-09-17 01:59:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Seven16 I even talked about it and I have him blocked. Word gets around FAST.
1306290958581993472 2020-09-17 01:56:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @filmnnylf Haven't read the whole thing, but I used to work in music publishing and this is far from the worst contract I ever read. $8 million advance? Wow, this poor man is really suffering.
1306289893669126144 2020-09-17 01:52:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @filmnnylf pissing on his...Grammy??? in the toilet???? come on.
1306289558305169409 2020-09-17 01:51:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ShannonOConnor0 Just binged on 4 seasons of Veronica Mars + the movie in something like 6-8 days! I have to agree that the pilot was compelling enough to stay for the whole thing.
1306289203966173185 2020-09-17 01:49:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> Had Kanye blocked but definitely checked in to see the drama this morning.
1306289063503118336 2020-09-17 01:49:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @3WKremer For real!!!
1306285695665725442 2020-09-17 01:35:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> Too bad the governor is also an idiot. These people are ignorant and deserve to be jailed.
1306281246591315969 2020-09-17 01:18:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kanyewest You were so sh*tty to Taylor!!!! Why would she help you when you're going through an "episode"?
1306281037488508928 2020-09-17 01:17:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> Did I read $8 million advance? 😲  Maybe Kanye needs a conservatorship, not Britney!
1306279382671974400 2020-09-17 01:10:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kanyewest This is a duplicate but thanks
1306271868408668160 2020-09-17 00:40:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ThiaBallerina Exactly. The ones that think they have it in the bag are pretty preposterous and haven't learned from 2016.
1306266879963459584 2020-09-17 00:21:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MovieNightMast @letterboxd Some people have liked it. The performances are mainly good, but the structure drove me insane.
1306204403108515840 2020-09-16 20:12:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @princessgleek @letterboxd It's pretty violent.

1306089164639580161 2020-09-16 12:34:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @distorption @letterboxd He was good, but since the story takes place across decades, another actor portrays him as a kid. That's another thing I didn't mention in the review. Across the decades, the other actors don't really age. It's something that really could have been done.
1306088310897405952 2020-09-16 12:31:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @davo_arid @letterboxd Yes, I refrained from saying it, but I really could not stand Simon Killer.
1306083891489374210 2020-09-16 12:14:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @distorption @letterboxd Bill Skarsgård was mainly in the beginning, because of his character. He was pretty good.
1306083289808039936 2020-09-16 12:11:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @distorption @letterboxd The character is the nastiest, rudest, meanest preacher ever.
1306082965076623360 2020-09-16 12:10:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> @distorption @letterboxd Yes, I hate the way all the women were treated. I'm sure the book was graphic, because the movie was too!

1306081813735993344 2020-09-16 12:05:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @katenfilm I would have preferred to read the book before watching. I have a feeling not everything was put into context, therefore, I hope to read the book before seeing it again (have seen it twice).

1306068940733382658 2020-09-16 11:14:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jaynarchy @michaeljknowles Wow! That's crazy. I guess things have changed.
1306066374859522048 2020-09-16 11:04:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheLastRefuge2 @Derky_Derk Sad!! But true.
1306065494806462466 2020-09-16 11:00:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jaynarchy @michaeljknowles I agree about east Nashville, but my parents used to live near Antioch and anyone who complained really liked to exaggerate.
1306065309984419840 2020-09-16 11:00:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @michaeljknowles It's changed since I've lived there, but I get the impression that anywhere is okay as long as it's not east Nashville. I used to live off Nolensville Rd. because it was cheaper. It's more working class but nothing too terrible happened when I lived there.
1306064297311657984 2020-09-16 10:56:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> I hope he's just being dramatic and doesn't have a terminal illness.  https://t.co/rxJNYx1fAM

1305979216941387776 2020-09-16 05:18:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> So everyone in Georgia needs to storm the jail and demand his release. It wasn't even his car. Walker was an Uber passenger.

1305904969329995776 2020-09-16 00:23:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ChangeLivingfor The processed foods are too much! I have also cooked a lot from scratch and try to focus on whole foods/plant-based: mainly fruit and vegetables. Homemade sauces are the best! They're so fresh and so good.
1305903753753632768 2020-09-16 00:18:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @acablart Most of all, ICE should keep their hands off people's genitalia.
1305903569523019778 2020-09-16 00:17:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ChangeLivingfor I respect anyone who makes an effort to improve their diet and lifestyle.
1305903429038911491 2020-09-16 00:16:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rachsyme @FemaleCritics I'm trying to switch to clothes that are organic and / or 100% cotton, so I will be having to buy some clothes and throw some old ones out, but it's a process.
1305903047399206913 2020-09-16 00:15:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> Yesterday, my best friend told me they had given up meat again and it made me so happy!!  https://t.co/opJba52tMS
1305902805119463424 2020-09-16 00:14:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @zustinvibes Yes! @gardein has great meat replacement products. I love @Lightlife 's fakin' bacon and their vegan sausage as well. Beyond Meat also has some authentic tasting products.
1305902476025978880 2020-09-16 00:13:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> When I first read about this opportunity, I was excited! Today I turn 39 and am ready to make my first feature once the pandemic is over! Looking forward to the future.
1305901808758317056 2020-09-16 00:10:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> Tapes brought down Nixon and tapes could bring down Trump.
1305875610326061057 2020-09-15 22:26:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie Aww thank you!  https://t.co/AuCmIbpe1k
1305875441618620417 2020-09-15 22:25:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie Yes
1305875388665442304 2020-09-15 22:25:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @paulkleinyo The weird part is his wife produces all of his films 😆
1305761157311950848 2020-09-15 14:51:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @gretagerwigflew Oh wow 🤯🥳
1305736871033466880 2020-09-15 13:15:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Twitlertwit @sal636 @allisongill Agreed. The "unity" they call for is alienating Progressives. They nominated the worst possible person for the job. It's very sad.
1305734232644268032 2020-09-15 13:04:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sal636 @Twitlertwit @allisongill That's a Dem for you. Saying lalala while plugging their ears. They're going to have a great surprise election night because they ignored the inevitable.
1305733240330674176 2020-09-15 13:00:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BadJohnBrown Good question!!!
1305732757679517696 2020-09-15 12:58:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @zombie_ducky_82 You have a destiny.
1305728867009667072 2020-09-15 12:43:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @__shakinah Sounds great!!
1305728563555917825 2020-09-15 12:42:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @lilymfar Except for one of his Batman films where he killed the girlfriend and not the wife. He really changed it up.
1305722883180646400 2020-09-15 12:19:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RAlovesfilm I remember watching Truffaut's Small Change as a kid. At the time it didn't feel weird reading subs so I wonder if I had previous experience with international films.
1305722316815360001 2020-09-15 12:17:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie Hi
1305722229682913280 2020-09-15 12:16:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Georgelucaschin Yeah drives me insane!!!
1305706907559059456 2020-09-15 11:16:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sweetlilhifi @gretagerwigflew 😭
1305702955635544064 2020-09-15 11:00:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JohnnyEAwesome A lot of things, but mainly in my college days about 20 years ago. I bought a couple of things from there recently, though.
1305702709010472960 2020-09-15 10:59:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fejimanz Sounds like a plan.
1305702427375542272 2020-09-15 10:58:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka I've seen Chernobyl. It's essential!
1305701979478319104 2020-09-15 10:56:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @gretagerwigflew Watching it once took all my strength. I lifted my Gaspar Noe ban to watch it and I regretted it.
1305701818610020352 2020-09-15 10:55:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka Good to know. I'm going to try out HBO Max at some point (hopefully soon).
1305701667799613440 2020-09-15 10:55:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fejimanz Yes, definitely stop using the sheets. I haven't used them for years, because they can be harmful. There are probably lots of articles online about it. I don't know how they are legal to be honest.
1305700616572862464 2020-09-15 10:51:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka I actually haven't seen Euphoria yet, but I recognize Hunter Schafer from around the web and she's one of the prettiest girls I've seen.
1305700193665314816 2020-09-15 10:49:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fejimanz Oh yes! Definitely. If you tell me the detergent you're using, I can probably tell you what ingredients you might be reacting to.   I would recommend Seventh Generation which does not use dyes or harmful chemicals. I personally use the eco-friendly detergent at Trader Joe's.
1305698600370933760 2020-09-15 10:42:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fejimanz There are different levels. I won't have an anaphylactic shock if I have tomatoes, but I will experience a great level of pain. I am sensitive if I eat too many bananas or avocados. Everything is different and you just have to gauge what you can eat based on how you feel after.

1305682944573333504 2020-09-15 09:40:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ThatsJacqueline Prayers and healing thoughts.
1305682530205458433 2020-09-15 09:39:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie Thanks! I have 5.5 hours until my bday in the USA because of the time zones, but it's feeling good to get bday wishes already!!!
1305624266667220992 2020-09-15 05:47:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fOrGiVeNcHy @JoeBiden Yuck. That's why this warmonger does not have my vote. Trump wants to kill Americans and Biden wants to kill people overseas. Am I so special and selfish that I'm willing to sacrifice other people's lives so Trump can stop killing Americans? @JoeBiden really has a LOUSY platform.
1305623647646744576 2020-09-15 05:45:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @GothamKnowledge @atrupar And he's not wearing his mask. He's willing to risk California burning and the people around him getting COVID, because he's a selfish POS.
1305623313410961408 2020-09-15 05:43:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Seven16 😲 I'm sorry
1305623151028527104 2020-09-15 05:43:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> My ★★★½ FULL review of I'm Thinking of Ending Things (2020) on @letterboxd:  https://t.co/yP7isy267G #charliekaufman #netflix @netflix #jessiebuckley #jesseplemons
1305607612705042432 2020-09-15 04:41:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @netf24046 I know. It will be there. I'm still putting my finishing touches on my I'M THINKING OF ENDING THINGS full review. That's why I need a day before I can get to/post the review for THE DEVIL ALL THE TIME.
1305604650591121408 2020-09-15 04:29:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @netf24046 LOL, okay.
1305603814397898752 2020-09-15 04:26:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> I am going to devote my life to Ryan Murphy.  @MrRPMurphy
1305601789580832768 2020-09-15 04:18:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> May I please get 2 friends to copy and repost? I am trying to demonstrate that someone is always listening.  ;  #SuicideAwareness  1-800-273-8255
1305601477247791105 2020-09-15 04:17:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RAlovesfilm @georgendebele22 I prefer a different order, but now that Sp*cey and Ans*l are assumedly canceled, I can understand if someone puts that movie at the bottom.
1305600332873916416 2020-09-15 04:12:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @netf24046 The performances weren't messed up as much as the story, but a lot of people did seem to like it. It felt very messy to me.
1305600084109742080 2020-09-15 04:11:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @adamncheek Adam, on Saturday, Charlie Kaufman revealed in a Zoom Q&amp;A that both main roles were cast differently at first. I heard about Brie Larson too, but was curious about who was the original actor.
1305599622711095297 2020-09-15 04:09:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @soy_milk_latte_ I hear you.
1305576105076649984 2020-09-15 02:36:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @netf24046 The actors were pretty good but I am not fond of the director. The information was revealed pretty sloppily at times, so it was a pain to follow what was happening.
1305575788163473408 2020-09-15 02:34:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> Does anyone have a link to an article that explains which actor was cast in I'M THINKING OF ENDING THINGS before Jesse Plemons? Thank you.
1305568184724934658 2020-09-15 02:04:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @netf24046 In this instance it means it's pretty horrible. I am probably holding off on my review for it until tomorrow because I wanted to write a full review for I'm Thinking of Ending Things.
1305555024475353088 2020-09-15 01:12:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @NBCNewYork There are so many documentaries and movies on how Pfizer is a lousy company that seeks to make money at the expense of the people. There is no information to report, because there is no vaccine. And what makes you think that Pfizer one of the worst companies will have it?
1305554409095536640 2020-09-15 01:10:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JustinGoss Some people like it. I personally did not.
1305507704048238592 2020-09-14 22:04:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Doubleh55 I was mainly there for the cast.

1305468572311846914 2020-09-14 19:28:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @wesjunkie Sounds good!
1305466537940103169 2020-09-14 19:20:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @boodell Not a huge fan of TV, but it was pretty entertaining overall. I was warned about season 4 and now I'm warning you. I didn't dislike it as much as other people did, but yeah.
1305362434136309760 2020-09-14 12:27:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SmritiKannan_AD Beautiful!
1305342892982951936 2020-09-14 11:09:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka @emmerpope Fewer places are accepting cash and more people are using credit cards, so the coins aren't in circulation as much. If the coins aren't at home, then the cashiers ask for exact change. For some customers/businesses this is hard.
1305342198322311168 2020-09-14 11:06:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka @emmerpope In the USA, we have a coin shortage.

1305308877647302657 2020-09-14 08:54:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jmjanks I liked it, though!
1305297799240507393 2020-09-14 08:10:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jmjanks I really liked that one, but it was a really long time ago!! I didn't think it was that overlooked.
1305292491847946241 2020-09-14 07:49:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DrLearnALot I recommend this video:  https://t.co/nqlvy7aotK
1305291755143667712 2020-09-14 07:46:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> Most underrated Logan Lerman movie?  For me, The Vanishing of Sidney Hall, no doubt.    https://t.co/1UBto3U3lp
1305286948051804160 2020-09-14 07:27:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SticksAndBr1cks I would recommend going straight to vegan. I did make the transition slowly, because I had no intention of going vegan, but was very glad when I did. Anything can be veganized so you won't be missing out on anything!
1305284344487899137 2020-09-14 07:16:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @boodell Season 4 wasn't as good either, but was still ok.
1305284284140253184 2020-09-14 07:16:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @boodell I sort of fell into watching this. I actually liked it. The first two seasons were pretty decent. The third season started sliding. The movie comes after season 3 and is on Hoopla (Hoopla Digital comes with a Los Angeles Public Library card) and just finished season 4 today.
1305283884737650689 2020-09-14 07:15:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Doubleh55 Man...... I think I may have cried. Yeah, I did.

1305236358869311488 2020-09-14 04:06:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @eugabrielp I think I watched the entire thing in like one week!
1305235229418778624 2020-09-14 04:01:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> I finished Veronica Mars (seasons 1-4+movie) so now I can get my life back.  https://t.co/yzx76VWFfY
1305230776636641280 2020-09-14 03:44:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CCortave24 @RAlovesfilm I remember the tone too.
1305229993258016769 2020-09-14 03:40:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JustinGoss Oh yes, definitely. I'm just kind of surprised about this, but I have seen it before, so I'll just move forward.
1305222437227823104 2020-09-14 03:10:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BuyMyScript This was about 4 years ago. I was called a conspiracy theorist. There are several other men who made settlements that no one wants to hear about.

1305182053286117376 2020-09-14 00:30:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @liamhenneberry I hate it when stuff like this happens! It happens and I can only hope their suffering if as minimal as possible.
1305181718408691714 2020-09-14 00:29:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> I don't mind someone like @/Mr_Milla unfollowing me (they are now blocked). I spoke out about Epstein before his final arrest and got the same kind of blowback from people who would rather defend a sexual predator than make themselves aware of how these men get away with it.  https://t.co/ktfWSlNwEe
1305180384150265856 2020-09-14 00:23:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Mr_Milla @veezy1690 This is the same type of resistance I got when I spoke about Jeffrey Epstein. He paid out settlements, he was convicted, and yetsome people stood up for him because he wasn't currently in prison. They begged for due process but he scammed the system and we now know he's a monster
1305179693868433408 2020-09-14 00:21:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RAlovesfilm Sally Field when I was in the 5th grade and now, Bette Davis
1305179412451569666 2020-09-14 00:19:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BMoviejawn Mmm! I love paprika on vegan bacon.
1305179281111134208 2020-09-14 00:19:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Mr_Milla @veezy1690 There was a settlement. Poor people go to jail. Rich people make settlements. There were not just allegations. We know he did it.
1305032905903669248 2020-09-13 14:37:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @OATBERT Now that I'm vegan there's nothing left to give up!
1305029303592050688 2020-09-13 14:23:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JakeLobin They don't all think they're risking their lives, because a lot of them think that wearing a mask is political and that the virus is a hoax. Scary world we live in.
1305029094376046592 2020-09-13 14:22:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thespacewetch Cool
1305028671065874438 2020-09-13 14:20:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thespacewetch Yeah, it seems like it might be a slow burn, but my feelings didn't change radically on a 2nd watch.
1305024199346413571 2020-09-13 14:03:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @agentofchaos22 Yeah better than average but not the best
1305020573794197506 2020-09-13 13:48:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @agentofchaos22 Well, it was both innovative and rambling dialogue-wise. It's not my favorite from Charlie Kaufman but I wanted to give it a fair shot.
1305018954671292418 2020-09-13 13:42:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> Okay, rewatched it. Too tired to write a review. Most of my "new" notes this time around involve feelings I had while watching it the first time around that I just didn't put down on paper.  https://t.co/oLU8RlEVVe
1305006197628481536 2020-09-13 12:51:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JustinGoss The problem is "The World to Come" is directed by a woman so I want to support it, but Aff*eck covered up his behavior with a settlement so I don't think he's really sorry or deserves to be given roles.
1305005903586811904 2020-09-13 12:50:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JustinGoss I can't support C*sey Aff*eck or J@m3s Fr2nc0. Several others. Kevin Sp@ac3y has been canceled so that makes it easy.
1305005517845139457 2020-09-13 12:48:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> There's this thing called "fakin' bacon" and hits the spot when I want "bacon"  https://t.co/2fV8WvTpLf
1305004196542861312 2020-09-13 12:43:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @christy4797 @heezyukx Let me know if you have any other questions. This story has taken up a huge part of my life.
1305000102583394305 2020-09-13 12:27:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @christy4797 @heezyukx Here's some more reading if you're interested:  I recommend Mia's book   https://t.co/woIhHcPK15  Moses Farrow’s blog  https://t.co/yLbMi7jLuw  Babi Christina Engelhardt article  https://t.co/KLoFmLsYxb
1304994142141857792 2020-09-13 12:03:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @vampireluvvr True. I think with Tommy and Mariah, he was a music executive and she was an up and coming singer.
1304993754235822080 2020-09-13 12:02:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @do_nothing_dem Ugh 😭
1304993402727981057 2020-09-13 12:00:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> @vampireluvvr As long as it's legal and one of the people isn't in a skewed position of power.
1304992478429241349 2020-09-13 11:57:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> @do_nothing_dem He doesn't care about California because he knows our 55 delegates are going elsewhere.
1304989277416112128 2020-09-13 11:44:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> Fair point
1304989164102774784 2020-09-13 11:43:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> Starting the campaign to get Robert Zemeckis to direct a film with vegan characters for real!
1304976913039933440 2020-09-13 10:55:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MovieMike80 Ah...
1304967775870357504 2020-09-13 10:18:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @soy_milk_latte_ I went vegan BECAUSE of my health!

1304954047456190465 2020-09-13 09:24:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @dantetripp It's easy when Isabelle Adjani exists.
1304951684758552577 2020-09-13 09:15:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @njlindenau1 Worth checking out. It's innovative.
1304949164300578816 2020-09-13 09:05:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @njlindenau1 I'm interested in seeing it but it wasn't the brilliant lifechanger I thought it'd be.
1304949046809829381 2020-09-13 09:04:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> @flixnut1 Ah, reverse! I don't have the technology to do that but that sounds interesting
1304943161320468480 2020-09-13 08:41:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jilevin Hopefully more than she did in the House.
1304942561455271936 2020-09-13 08:38:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Mikelennial @realDonaldTrump Glyphosate is a harmful chemical that harms us all. Let's seek to make the world a better place, not giving ppl cancer.
1304942247171911680 2020-09-13 08:37:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @NicfromO Joins Ted Cruz as a no-masker either on a plane or in an airport. Cruel &amp; unusual. Should be jailed.
1304941036821602304 2020-09-13 08:32:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thehorrorkidd I DID. Don't know when I'll review it because I'm racing against the clock to finish the whole entire series.
1304940836027654146 2020-09-13 08:31:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @veezy1690 He sexually assaulted two female producers on the set of I'm Still Here. There was a settlement. Sometimes it's talked about but they had no problem giving him an Oscar.
1304932500804792320 2020-09-13 07:58:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> I don't watch movies with abuser Casey Aff*eck, which is too bad, because I like the leads: Kirby and Waterston.
1304931796119740416 2020-09-13 07:55:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> Should I rewatch I'M THINKING OF ENDING THINGS?
1304913893832097798 2020-09-13 06:44:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Amuhy007 What Falls Away: A Memoir
1304911164841713664 2020-09-13 06:34:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rosiecsilva Red is great!!
1304909229984083969 2020-09-13 06:26:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Amuhy007 There are so many testimonies in regard to that case. I've also read Mia Farrow's book. The more information, the better.
1304908345745137664 2020-09-13 06:22:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @geemoneyg That's excellent!
1304908286924210176 2020-09-13 06:22:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @princessgleek I remember when PALO ALTO was released. He contacted underage teens on social media for "research". I guess that one and the Veronica Mars movie came out at around the same time. He must have thought he was invincible, because he had no problem informing on himself.
1304907071456833536 2020-09-13 06:17:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @princessgleek Jmaes Fr*nco 😭
1304906961159299072 2020-09-13 06:17:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @geemoneyg Every little bit helps. I went vegan gradually (because I didn't have becoming vegan as an end goal-it just happened). Dairy was probably the worst thing for me, so switching to oat milk is HUGE. I hope you've noticed a difference.
1304905802289876993 2020-09-13 06:12:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> Didn't realize a sexual predator who I have canceled is in this film... 😭
1304905460634460160 2020-09-13 06:11:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @geemoneyg Unintentionally...
1304896662498807808 2020-09-13 05:36:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Iearningalive Maybe one day you will understand. Eating cows is 1) abuse to the animals 2) bad for the environment and 3) bad for your health
1304896105411346433 2020-09-13 05:34:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @influencersitw We're in a wordlwide pandemic in 2020 and our phones can take pictures.
1304891897282924544 2020-09-13 05:17:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> Oh wow, just wow! Vegan alerts? I wonder what they'll think of next.
1304891775484481536 2020-09-13 05:16:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @grantstern No doubt he belongs in prison.
1304891712037289984 2020-09-13 05:16:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> What in the actual...
1304891426447085568 2020-09-13 05:15:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MWPalmer @brianschatz 😭 Sorry to hear
1304891350127501312 2020-09-13 05:15:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @brianschatz @tess_uh And smarter and safer.
1304884866736033792 2020-09-13 04:49:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> I love the placement of the theme song in the beginning.
1304884796783341568 2020-09-13 04:49:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnonyMiau I don't have time right now. I have a feeling after the movie and season 4, I'll be DONE, but I'll put it on my read list for later.
1304881676091228160 2020-09-13 04:36:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thehorrorkidd I guess it is, then!
1304881650073923585 2020-09-13 04:36:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Afsanehbaf I guess it is, then!

1304879545275670528 2020-09-13 04:28:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> @astrdmagnussen All good
1304878663461007360 2020-09-13 04:24:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @astrdmagnussen There's a link above to it but it's called MON ROI/MY KING
1304873623572733953 2020-09-13 04:04:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> I just need to marry someone French and make this dream a reality. The French are more sophisticated, have better taste, and stand up for what they believe in by throwing protests when their leaders screw up...
1304873202032599041 2020-09-13 04:03:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @yungdialectic Just be glad Trump is not your dictator
1304871791093923840 2020-09-13 03:57:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Doubleh55 Luc Besson is a pig and I have no respect for him.
1304868165785010178 2020-09-13 03:43:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnonyMiau Yes.
1304863123879280640 2020-09-13 03:23:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JustinGoss Making facts up about a predator is not going to help anyone's case.
1304858486640005120 2020-09-13 03:04:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> And if Mia and Woody were married, it would have been his STEP-DAUGHTER not DAUGHTER-IN-LAW! @PeakyBlynders this is way off
1304857866457591808 2020-09-13 03:02:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Amuhy007 If you've read Moses Farrow's interview that paints Mia Farrow as a monster who drove three of her adopted children to suicide, the plot thickens
1304853236440989696 2020-09-13 02:43:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @_eliaszx @jdr____llc @nelliekillian Thank you, Elias.
1304853143901990912 2020-09-13 02:43:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @stevekuhn23 @nelliekillian I saw that movie before I became vegan and started writing vegan alerts, however, I know what you are referencing, obviously.
1304853002130391041 2020-09-13 02:42:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @eastern_branch @nelliekillian 😂
1304852743106916353 2020-09-13 02:41:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Doubleh55 @nelliekillian Yes, it's my review.  https://t.co/4xSFPeBiWi  https://t.co/UGueA2KWrk
1304850432569700353 2020-09-13 02:32:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chronically1999 If you have enough just for a drizzle, it should be good. Too much would just get everywhere. Also, I used to use olive oil for everything, but it burns at lower heat. I would not bake it above 350 degrees for sure, but 325 would be better.
1304848862071279616 2020-09-13 02:26:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chronically1999 I always use olive oil. You won't need that much.
1304839401340465152 2020-09-13 01:48:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ArmyStrang 😂 They're too scared.
1304650767584772096 2020-09-12 13:19:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @starksruffalo First I've heard of it but that sounds like something guys would do. I mean if he's out there looking at profiles with his friends probably not worth your time.
1304650194290499585 2020-09-12 13:17:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @starksruffalo 😭
1304618501944958978 2020-09-12 11:11:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @blue_yarn @xRyderxX @stillgray @TulsiGabbard There are some bad parents out there and once they're 18 and legal, they can break free from them. If you think they need parental consent under 20 years old, then you are way too controlling.
1304608988613410820 2020-09-12 10:33:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ScreeningNotes @mdlfilming Aww, thanks to the both of you. :)
1304606786196893697 2020-09-12 10:24:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jason_pettus @letterboxd I like that one!
1304594753787441152 2020-09-12 09:36:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @michaelmnola 😆 The worst was House of Cards
1304594543807930368 2020-09-12 09:35:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @callmelexis LOL haven't tried The Office yet. It was also during my no TV phase
1304592533603807232 2020-09-12 09:27:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR @pacobella They need to hire no-budget filmmakers and then churn out content and make their money that way.
1304592358860750849 2020-09-12 09:27:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @callmelexis My trial of Hulu is expiring SOON (Sunday) and I'm trying to watch it as fast as I can!!!
1304591929586245632 2020-09-12 09:25:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @pacobella @AnothermillennR Right. They had things lined up before the pandemic, though.
1304591683330494469 2020-09-12 09:24:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @do_nothing_dem Yes! That's the worst part. In the evening, though, the air clears and the quality gets better. Nina was able to go out and romp around this evening.😺
1304590765700476928 2020-09-12 09:20:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR Exactly. It's like they're shooting themselves in the foot. In order to try to make more money, they're hemorrhaging future revenue.
1304590487828025344 2020-09-12 09:19:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR @pacobella True. Often, my friend and I were the only people in the theater.
1304590315236589568 2020-09-12 09:19:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @pacobella @AnothermillennR  https://t.co/unP1MSGtTE  As long as theaters and studios are splitting the proceeds 50/50, they have a chance.
1304587999250911238 2020-09-12 09:09:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @pacobella @AnothermillennR It's mybest guess. I hope I'm wrong, because I hate Amazon and Bezos, but they can afford it.
1304587882091307008 2020-09-12 09:09:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR Also, they had no problem with saying it about Birds of Prey.
1304586823700639744 2020-09-12 09:05:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @michaelmnola I didn't watch TV back then. Not really, anyway.
1304586730687791105 2020-09-12 09:04:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @pacobella @AnothermillennR My guess is that Amazon is going to buy up all the movie theaters. Bezos can afford it and can buy them all up for cheap when they're about to go under, unless the theaters receive govt. assistance.
1304586472146628609 2020-09-12 09:03:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR They didn't offer Tenet on VOD. Their loss is their shame.
1304584451536506881 2020-09-12 08:55:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> The animal testing episode on Veronica Mars (S3 E10) is making me really nervous.
1304582636837380096 2020-09-12 08:48:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JustinGoss Oh wow! I'm just finding this out now. Had no idea... won't be going to Ohio either. :(

1304577956283584516 2020-09-12 08:29:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AKIRABRAT I am so sorry! 😭 My best friend from high school is in Florida too and at risk and I fear for her safety.
1304561770607063047 2020-09-12 07:25:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DaveTheHerbi Definitely not sure what age. I remember when I was about 31, a lady who had a farm explained the process but I still ate meat so there was a bit of a disconnect and I couldn't see that it was wrong.
1304560830638256128 2020-09-12 07:21:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> The sun seemed to be orange + glowing today in the shape of a UFO.  https://t.co/HoGvIabeAN

1304503471538724865 2020-09-12 03:33:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @devan_mm For real. I was surprised when Tenet was released at all.
1304499551076720645 2020-09-12 03:18:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @devan_mm So annoying. I'm not even updating the release dates at this point.

1304495866586095618 2020-09-12 03:03:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @devan_mm For real. Why make plans when there's NO INFORMATION? So annoying.
1304495586112987136 2020-09-12 03:02:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MareVegan1111 Yes, I felt like reaching out because there are so many people that are worthy of giving second chances to. I seek to forgive, but I feel I would just be opening myself to toxicity and stress. My stress levels have gone down and there's no reason to make them go up again.

1304493770126229504 2020-09-12 02:55:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MareVegan1111 I was thinking about getting back in touch with a couple family members the other day, then I thought better. The reason why I cut them off is that I already gave them every chance in the world...
1304493557848317953 2020-09-12 02:54:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @alwayssbitchy Cousins aren't family? Asking for a friend. 😆
1304493310287904768 2020-09-12 02:53:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> Jeff Bezos should be the one "losing fans" with his horrible treatment of employees. We vote with our dollars. Think about it for a sec.
1304492343467241473 2020-09-12 02:49:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @liamhenneberry All good! Antibiotics are a good approach for knocking it out. I have heard of a couple of vegans curing it naturally so I thought I'd mention it just in case. I got a few bug bites at work last summer and I was paranoid I'd get a tick bite, so I put stevia in ALL my smoothies.
1304486878003916800 2020-09-12 02:28:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @GenatossioJake I forget how many times I saw Royal Tenenbaums in the theaters, but a ton. There was this one speaker blown out in the theater on my first watch so it made all the music slightly distorted and it was the BEST effect.
1304486668699799552 2020-09-12 02:27:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @liamhenneberry Stevia is supposed to naturally prevent lyme. Also look up natural cures for lyme. Apparently they exist...
1304486377594040320 2020-09-12 02:26:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR French Dispatch is in the theater or not.
1304486323181424640 2020-09-12 02:25:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR Yes, but it's kind of dumb that they're not adapting fast enough in these COVID times. Are we going to hold all big releases? I don't care about going to the theater and I just tweeted that I've seen all his features in the theater except for the first two. I don't care if

1304481158122463234 2020-09-12 02:05:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> It's higher now where I am, but the air quality actually gets better in the evening for a bit, which is great.
1304480999514894336 2020-09-12 02:04:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR Disney's handling of the Fox catalog is SHAMEFUL!

1304471038525276162 2020-09-12 01:25:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @liamhenneberry I joined reddit, tried to create a thread on Bernie Sanders, was told it was against the rules, and basically left right after.

1304466123975344134 2020-09-12 01:05:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> After an Eternal Sunshine rewatch last night (4th it 5th viewing since 2004?), I found it possible sometimes to think of Adam Sandler as Joel. However, Jim Carrey's reactions were perfect and his comedic timing really worked perfectly.
1304463654331375616 2020-09-12 00:55:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @lukerohandavid I should have put the initial "quality" in quotes but c'est la vie.

1304453145322352640 2020-09-12 00:14:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @clairekiah @goddessesxgods @aztechvegan I started having endo symptoms (my doctor thought I might have it) right as I was going vegan. It took 1-2 months (was also dealing with uterine fibroids) and afternoon surgery to remove the fibroids and continuing with the vegan diet, the symptoms went away.
1304452383032799233 2020-09-12 00:10:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @iyeloveslife @goddessesxgods I recommend organic Skullcap herb for periods. Traditional Medicinals Stress Ease tea is great for period pains and has organic skullcap herb.

1304301230156427264 2020-09-11 14:10:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @inherentcharlie That happened to me yesterday. I recommend a strong air filter. I happened to buy one 1-2 years ago and it's been a lifesaver.

1304296405230522370 2020-09-11 13:51:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sororityxnoise I was watching Eternal Sunshine and my mind snapped for a moment and I thought I was still watching I'm Thinking of Ending Things. But I don't think that one had potato people.
1304295318029123584 2020-09-11 13:46:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LairaGVieira @DaveTheHerbi So you have to love dogs but not be a vegan. That would really preclude lots of people.
1304294911370342402 2020-09-11 13:45:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @mswooord Ah, that would have worked very well, but I was DYING to watch I'm Thinking of Ending Things.

1304285346700513280 2020-09-11 13:07:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sororityxnoise Those cute little potato figures that Clementine made.
1304283673101918209 2020-09-11 13:00:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ScreeningNotes Yeah. 😂 years ago. Just saw that the wrong Pollock was trending though (I don't follow sports).
1304283294939242496 2020-09-11 12:59:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> 15 year olds too if you ever saw Claudia Conway on TikTok. Had to block her because it was hugely inappropriate for someone her age.

1304278869235494914 2020-09-11 12:41:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> Despite the fact that I'm Thinking of Ending Things was innovative, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was a great palate cleanser.

1304265999395377153 2020-09-11 11:50:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> That awkward feeling when you realize Michael Haneke watched ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND just one too many times.  https://t.co/Y5QPlCUg2s

1304249047910359040 2020-09-11 10:42:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> I was confused when I saw the potato people. I went back to Thinking mode for a second and thought wow, this film has potato people in it too! Then I realized I was watching Eternal Sunshine. Wow, I'm tired.
1304248826077872130 2020-09-11 10:42:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @_morbidite It looks like it'll need a minimum of 2 watches.

1304217007777222656 2020-09-11 08:35:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> #ThinkingWatchParty  Jake just said the pigs were eaten alive by maggots and the mom said everything on the table was from the farm. Cut to the ham being served. 😭
1304215023862992896 2020-09-11 08:27:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> Whoa, I'm going to have to turn up my brightness for this. #ThinkingWatchParty
1304214926370562049 2020-09-11 08:27:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SamanthaExists Ha ha yes. I was wondering that. Like maybe he feels her drifting off and picks up on the fact that she's not "there"
1304214596824174592 2020-09-11 08:26:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> #ThinkingWatchParty  Talking about dead pigs. Yuck. :( :(

1304213628715847683 2020-09-11 08:22:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> #ThinkingWatchParty  Jessie Buckley has said the name of the movie SEVERAL times already.
1304212271606849537 2020-09-11 08:16:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @NeonEilishghost @NATASSIXAM Maybe Trump should be in office for another 4 years to inspire Gerwig to do her best work yet! 🙄
1304211870253944833 2020-09-11 08:15:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SamanthaExists Yes 😂  And I thought *I* loved musicals.

1304211031435087872 2020-09-11 08:11:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> I'm still excited watching it. I wish I could calm down!!! Smelling the smoke from the fires is kind of heightening the event.
1304210523458695168 2020-09-11 08:09:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SamanthaExists Any time! I'm glad it worked out.
1304210449416638464 2020-09-11 08:09:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @easy_andy Whoa yeah. I love dialogue like that, but also it's overwhelming me at the same time. Hoping that I'll be able to break it down later.
1304210225507921920 2020-09-11 08:08:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @SamanthaExists Oh yes. I'm FEELING THAT.

1304185905993773056 2020-09-11 06:32:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BuyMyScript @andover_gary Icing on the cake
1304185761579769860 2020-09-11 06:31:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot 😂😁
1304185687629996032 2020-09-11 06:31:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @youngsupernova_ I only cut off Woody and Roman relatively recently too and I am ashamed for defending them for so long. I guess I would have preferred she apologized and moved on instead of asking what she was thinking!
1304181223451811840 2020-09-11 06:13:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> I almost went back to my Margot Robbie pfp but I mean, I miss Billie.
1304180571703189505 2020-09-11 06:10:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot Yeah, to call Trump a trainwreck is an understatement.
1304179127675576325 2020-09-11 06:05:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BuyMyScript @andover_gary Wow, the "meow" is a nice touch. What a stable genius! I can see how he passed his cognitive test.
1304178754499952640 2020-09-11 06:03:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot There's a time to stop fighting for just the Party, although sadly, the Democrats are doing the same thing with Biden. They didn't care about running a viable candidate or fighting for issues. They just want a Dem in the house.
1304177333188792321 2020-09-11 05:58:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> What was I doing replacing my Billie Eilish profile pic with Kate Winslet?   https://t.co/xJDjUyhNzJ
1304176973925634048 2020-09-11 05:56:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> Yes, the earrings were @givenchy
1304176708287832064 2020-09-11 05:55:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot It took 5 years for Nixon to resign. Trump is on year 4. Just counting the days, really.
1304176603073708032 2020-09-11 05:55:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot I don't think it would have convinced certain conservatives but it could have driven Trump to make a statement or be forced to resign. I really believe the end is near for him.
1304175594586779648 2020-09-11 05:51:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot the proverbial coffin.
1304175535367446528 2020-09-11 05:50:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot The only excuse I can make for him is that he had no idea how long the pandemic would last. If he waited until he finished his book, he is as sleazy as Michael Cohen. However, we need anything to bring down Trump at this point. We are surrounded by evidence-just need the nail in
1304175116721352704 2020-09-11 05:49:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JRehling It's his duty to resign. That's all he is required to do now. #ResignNowTrump
1304173743523000320 2020-09-11 05:43:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot Like a few months ago? I like to think he had a game plan. At least we have the info now.
1304140298105233408 2020-09-11 03:30:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @NATASSIXAM Not yet but soon.
1304140232602730498 2020-09-11 03:30:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @NATASSIXAM Pretty soon I'll end talking about stopping Trump and will switch to tweeting about stopping David Ehrlich.

1304138632282824704 2020-09-11 03:24:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> FWIW, I gave Greenberg a higher rating than both Little Women and Lady Bird (1 point).  https://t.co/gEJlEEnG7L
1304138208645537792 2020-09-11 03:22:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> Pretty sure movies about strong, empowered women have nothing to do with Trump, unless he's implying these films were inspired by the resistance.  https://t.co/iZivpfxH4y

1304136991966027776 2020-09-11 03:17:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @realDonaldTrump I eagerly await it! You're going to resign, right?  #ResignNowTrump
1304136635311779840 2020-09-11 03:16:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Georgelucaschin @SpeakerPelosi She's really a pro at going through the motions without accomplishing anything.

1304134715968950272 2020-09-11 03:08:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> If @SpeakerPelosi spent as much time helping the people as she did color coordinating her masks with her suits, we'd be in pretty good shape right now.  https://t.co/wmzfQnzth9
1304133246834233344 2020-09-11 03:02:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @realDonaldTrump People now have something to panic about, because you didn't take action. Congratulations! It was a bad call, and the sooner you resign due to your incompetence, the better.
1304132030913851392 2020-09-11 02:58:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @realDonaldTrump Agreed, but you are the villain here. You're blaming him for not calling you out sooner?

1304104707414130688 2020-09-11 01:09:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @gryffintea2 My grandfather was in bad shape at the beginning of the pandemic(and for the last several years). I was fully prepared to miss out on the funeral if there was one. But it looks like everybody is just carrying on as normal and it's so dangerous.
1304099522893606913 2020-09-11 00:48:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @gryffintea2 Funerals beget funerals.
1304093996164112384 2020-09-11 00:26:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> Today!! See everyone in just over 7 hours!! 5pm pst - right here on Twitter.
1303942732855914496 2020-09-10 14:25:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @suxelamai Based on things Gloria Swanson and Mariel Hemingway said, I became vegan when the moment was right for me after remembering what they said about it healing cysts and cancer. I had an unknown ailment which was later to be revealed as benign tumors.
1303942270807281664 2020-09-10 14:23:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @An_Aria_Blooms @Twitlertwit I mean, yes, it's happening. I'm in So Cal so I didn't see the orange skies in person, but we MUST do something!!!
1303936098482008065 2020-09-10 13:59:26 +0800 <AlliCinema> Oh wow, so the @latimes would rather people die!!!  https://t.co/HJVcZfawCf
1303935214930898945 2020-09-10 13:55:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> @latimes @hugomartin When the hell will you stop caring about the "economy" and start caring about the actual people??? If they die, they can't fuel the economy when this is all over. I guess you just care about the spread of COVID, you heartless RAG!!!!!!!!!!
1303932560485920768 2020-09-10 13:45:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> Just finding out that Veronica Mars Rob Thomas and Matchbox Twenty Rob Thomas are not the same people and now I can stop wondering.  https://t.co/jFWkhtLQJz
1303931953654112258 2020-09-10 13:42:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @staybayy Yeah, exactly.
1303930573166059521 2020-09-10 13:37:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @staybayy people get upset when Trump locks kids in cages, but Obama ... they don't bat an eye.
1303930248791113728 2020-09-10 13:36:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chaoticcoochie he freaking wishes

1303927192527667200 2020-09-10 13:24:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> I realize "ya basic" makes no sense because Charlie Kaufman isn't basic or anything, but I just like it when she says that on "The Good Place".
1303925165449834496 2020-09-10 13:15:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> I am going to be cheating on Veronica Mars with Charlie Kaufman tomorrow. Sorry in advance.  https://t.co/k8S9lvrMyG
1303923359239946240 2020-09-10 13:08:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @vanofvenus I just deleted a dating app the other day and I feel better.
1303922625714905093 2020-09-10 13:05:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Millerheighife Nasty incels.
1303922123954515970 2020-09-10 13:03:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @letterboxd She was pretty funny in I FEEL PRETTY 😂  https://t.co/OlWGF4WQ7Y
1303920530127495168 2020-09-10 12:57:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @robrousseau @jessehawken That is pretty civil compared to what could have been said!
1303920450527924225 2020-09-10 12:57:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cnute @RamonVillalobos @robrousseau @jessehawken Drumpf was the original surname for the Trumps.
1303918813935591424 2020-09-10 12:50:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> It's hard when I'm supposed to be Liv Ullmann AND Sven Nykvist too.
1303917033176756225 2020-09-10 12:43:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @justarsontingz @BonggJoonWhore 😂😂😂
1303916368446726144 2020-09-10 12:41:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AdamSandler Happy birthday!
1303915876618395648 2020-09-10 12:39:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> When I wake up tomorrow, I better hear that Trump has already tendered his resignation.
1303911942688444416 2020-09-10 12:23:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @shannonrwatts Billionaires own them. They're meant as a checks &amp; balances system but now they are just cowards who are worried about $$$.
1303911473819729920 2020-09-10 12:21:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @divinefringe 😂
1303909130625642499 2020-09-10 12:12:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> If you want something, speak it into existence.   This was Kristen Bell's dialogue on VERONICA MARS. Years later, she was chosen to play Anna in FROZEN (&amp; FROZEN II).  https://t.co/E6C4DhjUld

1303856669617610752 2020-09-10 08:43:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @hylyrbrtsn It really hasn't done much for me. I discovered some jobs that way, but nothing that has panned out. I added some people I know and used to work with. It's a tool when job searching and it's a comfort that it's there.
1303856219698810880 2020-09-10 08:42:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> Why the fuck are they so eager to get kids back to school before the numbers have actually dropped?  @MayorOfLA  https://t.co/GnCcL8yLdf
1303853148985896961 2020-09-10 08:29:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @espiegler It will be tough that's for sure. Rebecca is basically my favorite book and I wasn't even satisfied with Hitchcock's version so my expectations are relatively low.
1303850870812020736 2020-09-10 08:20:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR Maybe Cannibal Holocaust
1303850629186514945 2020-09-10 08:19:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @espiegler @armiehammer And it's on sale. Yes, I cracked up when I saw it.
1303850202491568128 2020-09-10 08:18:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> For the ladies that want to rock Armie Hammer's REBECCA look:   https://t.co/zKOlM2rxez #netflix  https://t.co/dTim3SRP0r
1303848370545373185 2020-09-10 08:10:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RBReich @4aPeoplesParty No Americans should be evicted by this crisis.
1303844765562146816 2020-09-10 07:56:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR I really was keen on his portrayal of Bush in Vice, though... but he IS a great actor.
1303844554999619584 2020-09-10 07:55:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews Thanks for the head's up. We will have fact checkers on standby.
1303841330427117568 2020-09-10 07:42:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @CCortave24 The screener is sent out on Monday. Pls message me your email.
1303835306064359424 2020-09-10 07:18:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR I haven't updated this list in awhile but they're all films I love.   https://t.co/V9f2Ciqnne
1303834733323845632 2020-09-10 07:16:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR Too many to mention!!!
1303822126122631168 2020-09-10 06:26:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @edithdrod 😂
1303821827974639617 2020-09-10 06:25:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @julia6118 @Geziandme @itsyaboyvp Did Christ say that some humans were illegal? Look into what the main guy said and love. You sound pretty hateful right now.
1303821326046486528 2020-09-10 06:23:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @edithdrod Plug it! What have you got to lose?
1303807810262556672 2020-09-10 05:29:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> Wouldn't it be great though, if Bob Woodward brought down Nixon AND Trump?
1303807583346520064 2020-09-10 05:28:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> Was it like a little trap that they expected Trump to fall into?
1303802407453732864 2020-09-10 05:08:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BethuneTheory Ugh. To think that men like this exist. 😒
1303801627854266368 2020-09-10 05:05:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @muirab5 @MNateShyamalan I mean, personally, I hated the film even before Zuckerberg turned into a full-fledged monster.
1303801311872180224 2020-09-10 05:03:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MNateShyamalan @HowSamThinks I mean the end democracy part came later. But it goes to show that Zuckerberg has no morals, standards, or integrity.
1303801038122569728 2020-09-10 05:02:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @FirenzeMike @GodandtheBear I mean, good point. Those who know the truth are trying to make a buck first. So annoying. People have DIED. 192,538 people to be exact.
1303800403448852480 2020-09-10 05:00:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump If he resigns tomorrow, give him the Prize to fake him out. I don't know. We just need real leadership instead of someone who lies. Woodward exposed him and now he is indefensible.

1303798612527177728 2020-09-10 04:53:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> @liamhenneberry Would be horrific!! 😭
1303798310008832000 2020-09-10 04:51:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> Did Christian Tybring-Gjedde made it a condition that Donald Trump resign in order for him to be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize?
1303797986497978368 2020-09-10 04:50:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @FLVINGLOTUS Hope you will feel back to normal soon!

1303797704745652226 2020-09-10 04:49:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevinveegan @rumbeggar Just basically, go to my Twitter:   https://t.co/HPKFkZsKHK  The pinned tweet will be the main one for #thinkingofendingthings #thinkingofendingthings  Just start the movie at exactly 5 PM PST and follow along with us. We will live tweet it. (1/2)
1303793741862322177 2020-09-10 04:33:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rumbeggar @kevinveegan Thank you, Dylan!! Kevin, feel free to watch it with us on Thurs. and Dylan if you want to see it again with us, feel free. Thurs 5 PM PST right here on Twitter. I'll pin a Watch Party tweet.
1303781459161837568 2020-09-10 03:44:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @KamalaHarris #ResignNowTrump  Why wait?
1303781360880951298 2020-09-10 03:44:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> #ResignNowTrump PASS IT ON.
1303771721208487936 2020-09-10 03:06:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevinveegan It sounds like it's completely possible that someone is contemplating it based on the title. I've been trying to avoid spoilers, but Kaufman is definitely depressive. I can definitely get back to you after I see the film. And maybe someone who's seen it can fill you in.
1303770850286469120 2020-09-10 03:02:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @liamhenneberry Oh man, me too. I am currently dealing with someone with Alzheimer's and they had a freakout last night, so I feel like it would be tough to watch this movie. But I love Hopkins + the others in this film.
1303767170141184001 2020-09-10 02:48:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> Let's do this! See you tomorrow at 5 PM PST!!!
1303750465574715392 2020-09-10 01:41:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @taky4 It's literally poison that paralyzes you.
1303750248792121344 2020-09-10 01:40:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @scifiagenda It's a little outdated. I don't want anyone to think I'm fooling myself into thinking I looked as young as I did in 1983.
1303746333996658688 2020-09-10 01:25:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Libertea2012 Kayleigh McEnany should know that in itself is a life.
1303738029731794944 2020-09-10 00:52:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot I looked pretty miserable at the time, but now I share the pic every chance I get!
1303737890552201221 2020-09-10 00:51:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> #TrumpKnew He likes playing the Coronavirus down, because he doesn't want to create a panic.
1303736529181798400 2020-09-10 00:46:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @50FirstTates THis makes me guilty for not buying extra salt at the store today. I think we have two of 'em. I always keep an extra just in case.

1303596168903974912 2020-09-09 15:28:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @reyshines @oddlystellar Disney had deadlines. They couldn't come up with something like that when they were so focused on the $$$$$$.
1303592962685689863 2020-09-09 15:15:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Roblovescinema LOL, great.

1303588894194069504 2020-09-09 14:59:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Tessicat Yes. I guess it's a case by case basis for me. I heard some things about it were racist. That's also the main reason I chose not to see The Gentlemen.
1303588434188009472 2020-09-09 14:57:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @hilltopgina @MattCressKeto Gina, but how did you survive without cholesterol? 😂
1303584844543217664 2020-09-09 14:43:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> So glad this film is coming to D+ in October; my life has been so incomplete without it.  https://t.co/LfHQFoTprC

1303569599284215810 2020-09-09 13:43:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BearroristJodi I am two years sober, but there were tons of rough days. Feel free to reach out if you are feeling weak. True story: my family was trying to force alcohol on me at Christmas and I almost succumbed, but I did a poll on Twitter and the "no drinking" option won. It saved me.
1303568805822562305 2020-09-09 13:39:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @bricevil I was gonna rant on how privileged he was but I held back, I held way back, but agreed.
1303566568467525633 2020-09-09 13:31:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevin_thecritic Reminds me how I was a judge on a Halloween costume contest and they tried to implement categories like this and it just ended up screwing with what should have been the results. Hopefully they'll take real issues into consideration. "Industry Access" just sounds incestuous, tho.

1303559769760784384 2020-09-09 13:04:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ydavey @CasparSalmon I would so see that. And Rebecca is one of my fav books.
1303559608703705093 2020-09-09 13:03:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> And for the director, someone skillful and renowned like P. T. Anderson

1303557262284263424 2020-09-09 12:54:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ferengimarx @NetflixFilm I agree but @Hulu is much worse. They only have like "9"classic films.
1303554640483549184 2020-09-09 12:43:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @GavinBooth @hulu LOL, well you get some Buffy/Veronica crossover with the Alyson Hannigan character.

1303554014747881473 2020-09-09 12:41:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @GavinBooth @hulu Cool. Good to know. It took me two days to watch Season One. I think I'm on the second day of season two, but I didn't start watching until halfway through the day and I have at least another day to go.
1303553738976587776 2020-09-09 12:40:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheTiesThatFray @duty2warn just like his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. They had to rope it off several times

1303549636116840449 2020-09-09 12:23:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> Okay it's back. After a stressful evening, it was just temporarily down and not accepting my password.

1303498767354589184 2020-09-09 09:01:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> This + giving Sondra Locke a fake deal + their handling of Tenet =  https://t.co/y6oMM7LZtm

1303481453838123009 2020-09-09 07:52:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka @Fender The alert was placed near the strings, but it doesn't appear like the material in the strings is dangerous (because that occurred to me as well). It seems like it's the Urethane for the neck finish
1303478622750007297 2020-09-09 07:41:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka @Fender Yeah, definitely. If it's just the neck finish, you'd think they could use something else.

1303470191741820928 2020-09-09 07:08:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> So they know how stupid he is and yet support him anyway?   https://t.co/AssIcVIVgM

1303469041416245253 2020-09-09 07:03:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Fender @billieeilish I am concerned about the harmful effects due to the Satin Urethane finish. I would love to get one, but am dissatisfied with the materials used to make it.  https://t.co/L55FHVgv0F
1303468505019211776 2020-09-09 07:01:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @starlittbritt I wonder if a self-assessment tool would help. I'll message you a link.
1303468253813956609 2020-09-09 07:00:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka @Fender I was concerned about their other products too. The neck has a Satin Urethane finish and the website I went to just said that it's cancer-causing and could cause birth defects. It would bother me to have that product in my house.
1303463672619040768 2020-09-09 06:42:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chrismowka @Fender It's really sad. I was prepared to buy one.

1303456348768595968 2020-09-09 06:13:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Alyssas_Writes Kind of hard to think of an actor that exudes the star power necessary for a role like  Maxim de Winter.
1303453927313113090 2020-09-09 06:03:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> Wow, that's great. Unfortunately, @LAPDChiefMoore has no shame and @MayorOfLA has not held him accountable.

Most Presidents plan on leaving if they're voted out. Why mess with democracy? I personally believe Trump will be escorted out if he doesn't leave. If he doesn't win the Presidency, he will no longer be protected.

1303172026954256384 2020-09-08 11:23:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @starlittbritt I agree that they have to step up their game.
1303171166677299201 2020-09-08 11:19:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @starlittbritt And my advice is free right now, so it's all good.
1303169320197877761 2020-09-08 11:12:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> @starlittbritt Well, until I'm certified, my advice is freeeeee.
1303168797298184193 2020-09-08 11:10:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @starlittbritt Yes, definitely! Eventually I want to get more into being a nutritionist/life coach to guide people into healthier habits.
1303168393801953280 2020-09-08 11:08:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnonyMiau 😭
1303162692551622657 2020-09-08 10:46:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @starlittbritt I also read that chlorpyrifos was a gas used by Nazis so needless to say I called my Senators etc. after reading that article.
1303162432320204800 2020-09-08 10:45:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @easy_andy While tracking down a couple of these reviews, I accidentally landed on some reviews that seemed to have major spoilers, so I may need a moment to recover from that.
1303162222617571328 2020-09-08 10:44:20 +0800 <AlliCinema>  https://t.co/XQUkHQwwD9
1303162168171311104 2020-09-08 10:44:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> The Russell Crowe throwing a phone at a hotel clerk incident is living rent-free in my mind
1303160768842539009 2020-09-08 10:38:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @easy_andy Oh no! Really? I also found a French review. I can read French, but it was short and didn't seem to spoil the movie.
1303160596141977600 2020-09-08 10:37:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @starlittbritt so I'm sure as a kid I didn't like strawberries because of the way they tasted and made me feel (my parents never bought organic). (2/2)
1303160465179119617 2020-09-08 10:37:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> @starlittbritt At one point,Northern California used Chlorpyrifos in their produce and it was making the fruit gatherers sick. I'm sure there are many pesticides. At one point, there was blood in my urine if I ate strawberries that were not organic (as an adult). I'm very sensitive (1/2)
1303159449020821504 2020-09-08 10:33:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> It was definitely another time. That's for sure.  https://t.co/HZbK2fejZB
1303158715458056193 2020-09-08 10:30:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> (you know? so the movie doesn't get spoiled)
1303158426554347520 2020-09-08 10:29:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> Veronica Mars singing Blondie is a mood and I'm here for it.  https://t.co/CTvfUAxPCB
1303157791054462977 2020-09-08 10:26:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @starlittbritt I didn't like them as a kid. I think I figured it out. If they're not organic, I have a bad reaction to them. If they ARE organic, I will devour them in 5 seconds.
1303147697843494912 2020-09-08 09:46:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fOrGiVeNcHy Wow ew no

1303108704124846080 2020-09-08 07:11:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DefNotLetterman To be fair, I just thought of it right now, but I mean, was it worth it? Was it WORTH it?
1303108256051507200 2020-09-08 07:09:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> So was it a boy or a girl?
1303095392200921089 2020-09-08 06:18:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jason_pettus @UtopiaRep If unforeseen circumstances arise, I will push it back to Friday. Will keep you in the loop.
1303082629781020672 2020-09-08 05:28:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @jason_pettus Yes I had to change it. Does Thursday at 5 PM PST work for you? I'm planning on scheduling a 20 minute break and then having Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind right after that for a double feature.

1303069482512916480 2020-09-08 04:35:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DawnKeKe I can see it.
1303067904833851392 2020-09-08 04:29:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @johneberlejr Ohhh wow
1303067560590471169 2020-09-08 04:28:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @EYElocksleep I mean LA and NY critics are important but they've finally been sidelined for once and people get bent out of shape! I'm fine with not seeing it in the theater until it's safe.
1303066891183779841 2020-09-08 04:25:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Aislinnwastaken Awesome!!
1303066660400590848 2020-09-08 04:24:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> Also I wasn't aware that San Diego theaters were open. 🤔

1302827176794832896 2020-09-07 12:32:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Doubleh55 I finally finished the first season which means I heard the theme song 22 times!!

1302804913454366720 2020-09-07 11:04:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot Thank you, Elliot. It's only going to get worse. We're at a breaking point right now and we have to stand up and speak up because no one else is going to do it for us. My elected officials aren't really doing all they could.  @SenKamalaHarris @SenFeinstein @JimmyGomezCA
1302792185792753664 2020-09-07 10:13:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> Can we ban fracking and switch to green energy?  Let's not pretend we don't know about cause and effect. @GavinNewsom @MayorOfLA
1302764524672442368 2020-09-07 08:24:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thetevinator I mean California hasn't banned fracking and we haven't committed to renewable resources, so I guess that's the only option left.
1302763678974881793 2020-09-07 08:20:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JustinGoss @Lightlife No, really, any meal can be veganized. Since going vegan, my options have only opened up. Here's the insta where I've posted what I eat:  https://t.co/iBZKoTNtrE
1302763271699623939 2020-09-07 08:19:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> Pray for Woodland Hills.
1302759099847774208 2020-09-07 08:02:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JustinGoss There probably is. I don't have vegan pizza a lot due to my tomato allergy. However, there is definitely vegan sausage that's pretty good. I like Lightlife's brand. @Lightlife
1302755248621023232 2020-09-07 07:47:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JustinGoss I don't know. They did have cauliflower crust at Trader Joe's, but there was a warning on it that it was vegan but it might contain milk. I  was severely lactose intolerant and reacted to it, so I either do a handmade crust or use a different vegan pizza crust brand.
1302733618423369728 2020-09-07 06:21:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ginny_sais_quoi Agreed
1302732184709521408 2020-09-07 06:15:31 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fejimanz I didn't notice. I was ready to pay the delivery fee and tip, but they tacked on those two charges along with a service fee. At the time there was no one to deliver the order anyway, so I just didn't go through with it.
1302719500148551681 2020-09-07 05:25:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JustinGoss 😅
1302719076934979584 2020-09-07 05:23:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> I've lost a few followers for getting political, but we've lost 189,619 Americans to COVID due to the President's inaction.

1302708058057928704 2020-09-07 04:39:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> I'm vegan and it's a pandemic, I will be making raw vegan cheesecake and eating at home.

1302707202805751808 2020-09-07 04:36:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @dantetripp It definitely can be.

1302673686374146048 2020-09-07 02:23:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> I mean, this is funny.
1302673342479044609 2020-09-07 02:21:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @francobavtista Ask me Thursday night. I'll be having a watch party then.
1302670293282861056 2020-09-07 02:09:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot I found the picture of Frances first thinking she looked like Florence and then found a picture of Florence where her hair matched Frances' the closest.
1302667130136006656 2020-09-07 01:57:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @nabeelonfilm I was almost added her as a third sister. I totally see it!

1302651320269119497 2020-09-07 00:54:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fOrGiVeNcHy It's hard for me to imagine dating a meat eater. Maybe I'd date a vegetarian, but yeah meat will clog their arteries and stink up your kitchen. It's all about what you're willing to put up with.
1302650972670287872 2020-09-07 00:52:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> Block James Woods before he blocks you. That is all.

1302644279467102209 2020-09-07 00:26:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @IngmarBoobman This is reminding me of the neighbor who let his dog poop in our yard and around all the trash cans too.  My guess is they figure the hair will wash/blow away, but yes, it's annoying. Or you could save some of the hair and hold their DNA hostage in case you need to frame them.
1302641172444114944 2020-09-07 00:13:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Furanciscus @Variety Currently, it's too dangerous with the COVID situation and it's not safe. If people make the decision for themselves, they could get COVID and pass it on to others. This selfish behavior is why things are not under control right now.

1302494948051230721 2020-09-06 14:32:49 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Tav_assoli @thebluemaverick They will be escorted out one way or another either in 2021 or 2025.
1302493839446306816 2020-09-06 14:28:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @slashernegro Gore does not equate with scary
1302492319703162881 2020-09-06 14:22:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @fOrGiVeNcHy Never say never!
1302482809647329280 2020-09-06 13:44:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> I guess I sound like a crazy vegan sometimes.  😅
1302453635004002304 2020-09-06 11:48:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @dudenamedjerry The 6 hour one!!
1302452706569641985 2020-09-06 11:44:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @dudenamedjerry If you watch Pride &amp; Prejudice and then wait, we will be having a Charlie Kaufman watch party Thursday evening.
1302424255900954625 2020-09-06 09:51:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ThiaBallerina @CrankyClown @DrDooleyMD Yes definitely.
1302423940472606720 2020-09-06 09:50:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ThiaBallerina @CrankyClown @DrDooleyMD I love garlic AND vivid dreams.
1302414311076163584 2020-09-06 09:12:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MyLittleRescues @veganshite I will volunteer to make this cooking show!! But there are so many good tutorials on YouTube.
1302414179190452224 2020-09-06 09:11:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @veganshite Anything can be veganized, but yes, it's annoying to see food that you'll never be able to consume.
1302409101654155264 2020-09-06 08:51:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @liamhenneberry Those are so cool!!
1302408893843165184 2020-09-06 08:50:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> Working on a schedule for the watch parties which I will be tweeting out soon.
1302405891312943104 2020-09-06 08:38:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DavidSagredo3 @Variety USA, but COVID cases in Europe are rising.
1302397019126788097 2020-09-06 08:03:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> bad = non-vegan😅
1302386436419678209 2020-09-06 07:21:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> Worst Senator (CA) @SenFeinstein accepting kickbacks while doing nothing for her constituents that are affected by the crises (Trump, COVID, etc.)
1302386066612125696 2020-09-06 07:20:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Manimeconquest I literally lived off popsicles when I was living in a place with no A/C.  😅
1302383086353571842 2020-09-06 07:08:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> @madfrieza Such corruption baffles me even though it is so widespread.
1302382663785787392 2020-09-06 07:06:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Doubleh55 OMG 😮
1302382002688028672 2020-09-06 07:04:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MoizTheRelaxer Exactly my plan!! 😂
1302381822878216192 2020-09-06 07:03:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LawrenceHughes Yes
1302381763151323136 2020-09-06 07:03:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @madfrieza Ugh. So horrible. There are so many US politicians and even citizens that make it worse for everyone and I am just in awe and not in a good way.
1302381571161255938 2020-09-06 07:02:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> And here I was worried about 109 degrees. 😅  https://t.co/eQxSJvndU6
1302381034294525953 2020-09-06 07:00:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @djhutch74 @paladinette 😂😂😂😂😂
1302380683227090945 2020-09-06 06:58:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @madfrieza I agree. And enablers too. When the initial 20 Democrats running for President against Trump were named, I figured that Biden was probably the worst out of all of them and he was the one that was "chosen".
1302380005796671488 2020-09-06 06:56:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> @madfrieza Yes. But don't worry. Biden apologized to Anita Hill 25 years later.
1302379801362051072 2020-09-06 06:55:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @madfrieza against Thomas that were willing to come forward. Biden ignored Hill's testimony and basically was responsible for admitting him to the Supreme Court. Anita Hill was villainized by the media. I recommend the documentary ANITA from Freida Lee Mock. (2/2)
1302379103371235328 2020-09-06 06:52:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @madfrieza Ah yes. We have a Supreme Court here, but you have to be confirmed. Clarence Thomas was vetted and Anita Hill raised concerns about him, because he sexually harassed her. Joe Biden humiliated Hill by making her recount what Thomas did, didn't interview any other survivors (1/2)
1302376555344142337 2020-09-06 06:42:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Variety Wondering how many people will get COVID because of the studio's greed.
1302375277134147585 2020-09-06 06:37:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> Let me know if any youngsters need context.
1302373217932247043 2020-09-06 06:29:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> Anita Hill's endorsement means more than Bernie's, Obama's, or really any other figure political or otherwise.
1302371629947695104 2020-09-06 06:22:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BuyMyScript 😭 That sweet dog. Retweeted.
1302366080862568448 2020-09-06 06:00:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DEITY_OF_CRINGE Forgiveness granted
1302364516949213189 2020-09-06 05:54:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kolbytoldme If we scheduled a I'm Thinking of Ending Things watch party Thursday evening, would anyone be interested in it being a double feature with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? #watchparty
1302347608124342272 2020-09-06 04:47:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> I'm going to frame my interaction with Alexandra Daddario.  https://t.co/SmIQ9du7fl
1302347281304223744 2020-09-06 04:46:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AADaddario 😉
1302345428977856513 2020-09-06 04:38:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cw_labbs @PoorColby @letterboxd 😭 Thank you for the feedback.
1302345141986836480 2020-09-06 04:37:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AADaddario LOL, girl. 14 day quarantine and temperature check first?
1302343268265385984 2020-09-06 04:30:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @PoorColby @letterboxd Are the dead pigs shown on screen? I will be doing a vegan review of this later this upcoming week, but if you told me now it would be helpful.
1302342479249723392 2020-09-06 04:26:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BernieSanders I love you Bernie, ha, but whatttt?  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

1302341489838571520 2020-09-06 04:23:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @IMDb I love the first one directed by Catherine Hardwicke ONLY.

1302315250784505856 2020-09-06 02:38:46 +0800 <AlliCinema> @erinmarie093 I tried that approach several times but it never worked for me.
1302312001134145536 2020-09-06 02:25:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> I guess Nina feels it's a lying on the breakfast table kind of day.  https://t.co/T95kqLI5vE
1302310454660722688 2020-09-06 02:19:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ibogost Procrastination
1302310383579922432 2020-09-06 02:19:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> The maximum amount I can get out of the ATM is HALF of what it used to be. 🤯
1302303384255344640 2020-09-06 01:51:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> Just messaged them that I was contacting my credit card company for fraud. Unfortunately, @IKEAUSA did not ship my order or respond to my messages.
1302286552706371590 2020-09-06 00:44:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Afsanehbaf I'm about the same age as Kristen Bell. Would have been great to see this AT THE TIME.
1302285984583659522 2020-09-06 00:42:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ianbrown You must not be a scientist. Not everyone wants to die, you know.
1302285451101757440 2020-09-06 00:40:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DaniellaCarlisi There are different strains of flu every year and sometimes the ingredients in the flu shot include animal products and heavy metals. I used to get one until one year my arm felt so bruised after the shot and I never used to get sick much anyway. Therefore I never get it anymore.
1302284456900714496 2020-09-06 00:36:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> Now watching: Veronica Mars for the first time. I didn't know this show was supposed to be this good.
1302280707910238209 2020-09-06 00:21:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> Virgo: I'm sorry for being perfect.
1302280669410680833 2020-09-06 00:21:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> @WeRuNYBhris_ Virgo: I'm sorry for being perfect.
1302280199472476161 2020-09-06 00:19:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BasharM81 @shannonHamIAM Tenet was also released in some dangerous states in the USA showing the studio's greed.😰
1302276190451822595 2020-09-06 00:03:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot Agreed
1302267705043554310 2020-09-05 23:29:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> The biggest problem about making a Mike Pence biopic would be trying to make him seem human.
1302267218168700928 2020-09-05 23:27:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> Hear me out: Brenda Wool and Phoebe Waller-Bridge playing sisters  https://t.co/3hzxSoFqUV
1302257995665960962 2020-09-05 22:51:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @dpatt0 For real! Luckily my internet was slow last night and I was able to close the browser before the pictures loaded.
1302257243178459142 2020-09-05 22:48:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @shannonHamIAM They were going to release it in cinemas. I remember seeing posters for it the last time I was at a cinema in March. Unfortunately, theaters are still closed in California and many other states.
1302115082168532999 2020-09-05 13:23:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @liamhenneberry That IS cool.  https://t.co/PtoAbVE1ak
1302100409654280192 2020-09-05 12:25:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot 😆
1302099520965099520 2020-09-05 12:21:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> @VonElliot They didn't think it through.
1302093239789350913 2020-09-05 11:56:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> Maybe I'll start programming next Saturday so everyone has time to plan.
1302079726769508352 2020-09-05 11:02:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> it could be an actor or singer or whoever
1302079639301496832 2020-09-05 11:02:32 +0800 <AlliCinema> Whatever happened to...?
1302073684455120896 2020-09-05 10:38:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LynnSharig8 We do need a leader to unite us and show us how to beat COVID, but yes, Trump is counterproductive to say the least.
1302073387078959104 2020-09-05 10:37:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @NepswirlDaBeard I used to think that the LAPD was reformed after the Rodney King beating and the ensuing riots.
1302073132279148547 2020-09-05 10:36:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> My ★★★★ review of Last Call (2019) on @letterboxd:  https://t.co/SzIsnFWwCV #splitscreen #moviereview

1302069250492825601 2020-09-05 10:21:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> My ★★★★ review of Sibyl (2019) on @letterboxd:  https://t.co/0YN6AJtoCh  Opens at Lincoln Center next week.
1302068262465748993 2020-09-05 10:17:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> I know it's last minute, but... would programming Saturday morning animated Disney+ films work for you (8:30 AM PST) for the month of September? And would it be okay to start tomorrow or would you prefer to wait until next week?
1302067459407527936 2020-09-05 10:14:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @mdnij34 We won't have the answer until he finally leaves office or kicks the bucket.

1302066128751964162 2020-09-05 10:08:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> To be honest  https://t.co/tU2O1ILWWM
1302063238348062720 2020-09-05 09:57:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> So freaking funny. I found a job I would like, but it was at the wrong company with the wrong salary.😰
1302062443259031553 2020-09-05 09:54:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @eleanorbh Sometimes those are the best thoughts.
1302058485434048512 2020-09-05 09:38:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ThatsJacqueline Not soon enough.
1302054150465662976 2020-09-05 09:21:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @lilithpunk_ So Biden won't do anything about global warming! Trump is still much worse.
1302037156601327616 2020-09-05 08:13:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rosiecsilva Okay good!
1302030234745581568 2020-09-05 07:46:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cautionspoilers It's easy to want to do a podcast but not have any time for one! I've been a guest on several lately. Let me know if you need a sounding board or what not.
1302027154645950464 2020-09-05 07:33:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Lulamaybelle Yes, exactly! 😌
1301991512390037504 2020-09-05 05:12:21 +0800 <AlliCinema> @GavinBooth Sounds like it
1301991450293366784 2020-09-05 05:12:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Lulamaybelle I know... they were desperately begging last week so I got an editor to write an assignment letter. 🤷‍♀️
1301989506850070528 2020-09-05 05:04:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Lulamaybelle It turns out I was not accepted as well.
1301988000583147520 2020-09-05 04:58:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Lulamaybelle 😭😭😭
1301987021901111297 2020-09-05 04:54:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @liamhenneberry A24!
1301986831706107905 2020-09-05 04:53:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @GoatCreature Ugh. I just might have to call my credit card company and report the order from @IKEAUSA was not sent    It's fraud at this point.
1301965674529525760 2020-09-05 03:29:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JustinGoss I ordered when it was too dangerous to go in the store and I figured if they delivered it, I'd wait 3 weeks. It's been double that time, though   😭
1301962481368141824 2020-09-05 03:16:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> Every couple of weeks, I'll follow up with my IKEA order. Here's hoping they respond THIS time.  Placed it in late July.  Was supposed to be delivered in mid-August.  Crickets... followed by crickets.
1301961583992561664 2020-09-05 03:13:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Victoriakodai My membership expires in November. 😆
1301960281606688768 2020-09-05 03:08:15 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Victoriakodai It doesn't look appealing to me. I'd give it a shot if it were included in my Disney+ subscription. If not, no way.

1301953667046625282 2020-09-05 02:41:58 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Doubleh55 @HoustonChron I mean that's hopeful, but unfortunately cases in Texas are high because not everyone wants to wear masks and they're not taking precautions and aren't required to.
1301953414184738821 2020-09-05 02:40:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @alissamarieek Wow, so beautiful!
1301952883223478273 2020-09-05 02:38:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @govkristinoem Enforce mask wearing so your residents won't be killed by COVID.
1301952682475663360 2020-09-05 02:38:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Doubleh55 @HoustonChron Social distancing is still key. If a crowd that big is expected, COVID could still spread.
1301952401872531456 2020-09-05 02:36:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @IngmarBoobman Both are good but "Claws" is very funny.

1301939917958733824 2020-09-05 01:47:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rosiecsilva It'll probably be 6 PM PST. Does that work?
1301939781392240641 2020-09-05 01:46:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rosiecsilva Awesome!!
1301939734671892481 2020-09-05 01:46:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MrReinvention23 @HoustonChron Last I heard hospitals in Houston were full. I had to unfollow someone on FB from Houston who was an anti-masker. Was so sad to see the mentality. But I have a good friend in San Antonio with a visor and mask...
1301937751864958977 2020-09-05 01:38:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> @HoustonChron wtf

1301937479436574721 2020-09-05 01:37:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rosiecsilva I'll be having a watch party on 9/10 if you decide to wait or rewatch.

1301921333589073920 2020-09-05 00:33:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @OBShoes Thank you.
1301757895730626561 2020-09-04 13:44:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @LisaSeaman8 @Julius_Kim Are we sure he passed that cognitive test? Also narcissism can be a signal in some mental illnesses or disorders.
1301757593413537792 2020-09-04 13:42:50 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Julius_Kim Both  https://t.co/GxEPpVF4cG

1301752904638894081 2020-09-04 13:24:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @hoxhacat The Sorkin talk is beyond horrible. No one talks like that and it's CRINGE.......
1301752775160676352 2020-09-04 13:23:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @DOUBT_COMES_IN 😆 I can't. Oh wow. That's great.
1301751174954016768 2020-09-04 13:17:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> Haven't even seen I'm Thinking of Ending Things (Kaufman) yet and already I'm scheduling the rewatch.
1301751025267736576 2020-09-04 13:16:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @richardgcnseys careful. skimming that sentence it sounded pretty scary. but yeah I'll see it in a week.
1301750751794851840 2020-09-04 13:15:39 +0800 <AlliCinema> @hoxhacat I mean, I hated social network as a Sorkin hating communist. Steve Jobs was less offensive because I think he at least tried going vegan and made that song bank for his daughter so...
1301749002170298369 2020-09-04 13:08:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @staticbluebat So mad at Elon Musk that my next car will be a Prius and not a Tesla.
1301748297825054720 2020-09-04 13:05:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JustinGoss They're there. Maybe I use them way more in reviews.
1301744975105851392 2020-09-04 12:52:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Bust_dunny @RobRobbEdwards agreed
1301744748244250629 2020-09-04 12:51:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RobRobbEdwards I think @DailyMailUK  meant sentient instead of sentiment, but it's a good thing.

1301722505846038529 2020-09-04 11:23:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Veg_Ezy_ This is the most vegan thing I've ever seen.
1301721189098741760 2020-09-04 11:18:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> I kind of want a haircut, but I'm still at the point where I don't want COVID more than I want a haircut.
1301720991752626178 2020-09-04 11:17:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevinveegan I am currently pretty ridiculous with semicolons.  https://t.co/hGxPWP588N

1301720419729174533 2020-09-04 11:15:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sweetlilhifi @IMDb Oh yeah! I loved the cast. Saw the videos of David O. Russell treating everyone so horribly way later, though.😭
1301719810544336901 2020-09-04 11:12:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @johnonfilm 😭
1301719634203144197 2020-09-04 11:12:00 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sweetlilhifi @IMDb I saw it with someone who was reviewing the film for the local paper and convinced him to raise his score from 3 to 3.5 (out of 4? out of 5?).
1301719146476875776 2020-09-04 11:10:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sweetlilhifi @IMDb LOL, thanks.
1301719095549648898 2020-09-04 11:09:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sweetlilhifi @IMDb I've wanted to rewatch it too.
1301719038448381952 2020-09-04 11:09:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RedwoodGirl The whole point is to social distance, but in order to make going to the movies worth it, you'd have to invite the whole neighborhood!
1301718798865580032 2020-09-04 11:08:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @sweetlilhifi @IMDb Here is my ranked list on MUBI  https://t.co/HMG8SvglOJ
1301718611245973504 2020-09-04 11:07:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @RedwoodGirl Some screenings in L.A., they wanted to charge $45-60 / car.
1301718483051274240 2020-09-04 11:07:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevinveegan That one was close to getting the axe. I opted for the dash, though.
1301716395848212481 2020-09-04 10:59:08 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ChardonnayDan hahaha I overuse semi-colons, though, so for me, I could never get rid of them.

1301714444687347712 2020-09-04 10:51:22 +0800 <AlliCinema> Obviously the dash
1301713115994677249 2020-09-04 10:46:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @danaviles Fair enough.
1301701684750557185 2020-09-04 10:00:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @OBShoes Please update the info on your stores online. I drove to your store today and it was closed.  https://t.co/zrXPC0sIAv
1301700470587576320 2020-09-04 09:55:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> But if we don't, who will? Shoutout to the mothers that teach their sons to respect women.

1301688971110412288 2020-09-04 09:10:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> It's over in Europe. They wore their masks, social distanced, and washed their hands. It's THAT simple, folks!!
1301688553429057537 2020-09-04 09:08:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @awards_watch Riley Keough as Madonna. Would love to see it.
1301687849016647682 2020-09-04 09:05:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> The person who comes up with the French sentences on Duolingo needs a hug very badly.  https://t.co/A3jcNFphJc
1301647668251299840 2020-09-04 06:26:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @karebear0517 Probably. If they enforced the customers wearing masks that's more important. If they treated their employees well, then fine.
1301627360593080320 2020-09-04 05:05:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tadler92 Ooh! Cool idea.

1301580999831089152 2020-09-04 02:01:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thehorrorkidd I watched that movie relatively recently! I love it.
1301573639188312064 2020-09-04 01:31:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @OATBERT Will do. I was planning on going to the dentist soon, but it's a matter of arranging it. I was trying to avoid the dentist during COVID.

1301517360877240324 2020-09-03 21:48:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @alissamarieek Target calls this rug "Montauk", but in Twin Peaks, the floors of the Black Lodge are designed like this.

1300959501256855559 2020-09-02 08:51:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> @pabzicles Yes I admire Kazan's work a great deal On the Waterfront (1954) Splendor in the Grass (1961)  Pinky (1949)
1300958693727506432 2020-09-02 08:48:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Manimeconquest I know 😭

1300957715070509056 2020-09-02 08:44:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @pabzicles Yeah I said I'd cut the game off but I still replied to some of them. Will reply soon when I'm on my desktop.
1300944360792498176 2020-09-02 07:51:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheMcKenziest Just finding this out now but it makes sense. I guess people in other countries are entitled to healthcare and housing and stuff like that.
1300942523775332352 2020-09-02 07:44:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AdamNicksAuthor LOL yes. And thanks.
1300939694125932544 2020-09-02 07:32:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cambregabriel19 We share the same "underrated" 🙌
1300938104321110017 2020-09-02 07:26:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cambregabriel19 David Fincher
1300937594830647296 2020-09-02 07:24:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @cambregabriel19 Yes, unfortunately I was supposed to see him at a Brokeback Q&amp;A but due to a snowstorm he couldn't make it Sense &amp; Sensibility Life of Pi (I really loved the book so the movie fell a little flat for me) Eat Drink Man Woman
1300936338007449601 2020-09-02 07:19:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chicagobubs People who aren't vegan themselves are often confused.
1300935993596411904 2020-09-02 07:18:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> @oldddgus 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
1300935785084981248 2020-09-02 07:17:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thzylvs YES - I've been to his grave  Le Beau mariage (The Good Marriage), Chloe in the Afternoon, and Pauline a la plage (Pauline at the Beach) My Night at Maud's A Tale of Winter and A Tale of Summer - which have received somewhat of a resurgence as of late, but still

1300933190048083968 2020-09-02 07:06:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Lulamaybelle Not sure that his shirt is ripped open enough in that photo.😆
1300932730104938496 2020-09-02 07:05:07 +0800 <AlliCinema> @pabzicles I got a bit backlogged but I can do Elia Kazan if you wish (I had the tab open then it disappeared)
1300932116641841154 2020-09-02 07:02:41 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Lyon1106 yes I saw him speak for a La La Land Q&amp;A and a Zoom chat where he was promoting The Eddy this year Whiplash hard to say, La La Land got more acclaim than I expected but it's good so I won't say it's overrated Guy &amp; Madeline on a Park Bench
1300927329837838336 2020-09-02 06:43:40 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AdamNicksAuthor Oh yeah after I hit send I wanted to include Phantom Lady on my underrateds. The Killers is decent: saw it as a double feature with The Killers remake.
1300927006754783232 2020-09-02 06:42:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> How long have we been the laughingstock of the universe?
1300926418180661248 2020-09-02 06:40:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @annnadoorbell I'm not sure I've seen more than a couple of his films, but I like Donnie Darko.
1300917317136596992 2020-09-02 06:03:52 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Lulamaybelle Oh no! :(
1300917174618390528 2020-09-02 06:03:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @_Cheshire__Kat_ I was named after an Elvis Costello song. 😥
1300916945848475648 2020-09-02 06:02:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Lulamaybelle 😨
1300916648358981634 2020-09-02 06:01:13 +0800 <AlliCinema> @filmobjective @xRetroGamerTomx That time period really concentrated on gore as opposed to psychological terror, especially in the last half of the decade. Other decades seem to have better options.
1300915421290270721 2020-09-02 05:56:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> Wow, I heard about this right away because I often check out ads for 1st &amp; 2nd AD work. People seemed to know who this guy is. Very scary for people who are trying to get back into filming right now. For this story to hit the mainstream media is a wakeup call. 😰
1300914398215639041 2020-09-02 05:52:17 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AdamNicksAuthor Yes but not ultra-hard because I still have a number of his films to see The Spiral Staircase (1946) The Crimson Pirate (1952) Cry of the City (1948), The Suspect (1944), &amp; The Dark Mirror (1946)
1300913717266137088 2020-09-02 05:49:34 +0800 <AlliCinema> @brooklynnygirl @proviewsusa @TodMoore3 @HillaryClinton And Obama strongly encouraged all the Dems who were running to drop out and endorse Biden.
1300912239193370624 2020-09-02 05:43:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Doubleh55 Too late! I saw it. And the fur coats too...
1300912053222174721 2020-09-02 05:42:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Doubleh55 Oh i vaguely remember that now. But yeah it's funny. 😂
1300910966842863616 2020-09-02 05:38:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Doubleh55 Thank you. LOL. I'll check it out.
1300910548788289536 2020-09-02 05:36:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Doubleh55 Not sure I have. I'll have to find that video online.
1300910047694741506 2020-09-02 05:34:59 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Doubleh55 It's the video that solidified for me how brilliant Dolan was as a director and made me add him to my fav directors list.
1300908474251898880 2020-09-02 05:28:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @chessunicorn @ThiaBallerina Yes

1300905673505398784 2020-09-02 05:17:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rosiecsilva It's going to be over one hundred on Sunday but it was getting colder this week for some reason. Before I went vegan my allergies acted up around this time but I know vegans with allergies still so it's not a cure-all but helps with the congestion.
1300903816284397568 2020-09-02 05:10:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rosiecsilva Well, hopefully you can keep your distance. COVID guidelines aren't online and hopefully you can get tested if you fear it might be COVID.
1300903534641045506 2020-09-02 05:09:06 +0800 <AlliCinema> @thomasrm21 @streeeeep I wonder about Paul Schrader. First Reformed takes place in 2017 and Ethan Hawke's character has a flip phone.
1300903356429299712 2020-09-02 05:08:24 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rosiecsilva It's been getting increasingly colder over the years but not as bad as the east coast or some other places.
1300903153638862848 2020-09-02 05:07:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rosiecsilva Yes. Flu season will be upon us soon. Weather changing always used to make my allergies flare up.
1300902118413328384 2020-09-02 05:03:29 +0800 <AlliCinema> @rosiecsilva Have faith as long as you can smell.
1300901986913513473 2020-09-02 05:02:57 +0800 <AlliCinema> @streeeeep I was watching most of the video in preparation for this tweet. I don't remember seeing it but it would've been out of date even 5 yrs ago

1300894354236612608 2020-09-02 04:32:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @crocfanpage Everyone is losing a year. And because people are selfish, we in the USA have had to extend our lockdown while Europe and really the rest of the world are getting back to normal.
1300892914826932225 2020-09-02 04:26:54 +0800 <AlliCinema> @BuyMyScript I mean relatively overrated but yes it does merit a lot of the enthusiasm it's generated
1300891774756429824 2020-09-02 04:22:23 +0800 <AlliCinema> @celluloideka yes saw her once speak for a Q&amp;A for one of her films Kevin You Were Never Really Here all her films are pretty acclaimed
1300891104540123136 2020-09-02 04:19:43 +0800 <AlliCinema> When Washington Monument was trending, I was fearing something had happened to the Lincoln Memorial à la Handmaid's Tale.  https://t.co/2zU6EOBMHp

1300888454503432193 2020-09-02 04:09:11 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ElaniKitten Been there. 😭😭😭
1300886821258145792 2020-09-02 04:02:42 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MovieNightMast Yes, will be interesting to see that one.I'm hoping to get a press pass to NYFF but we shall see.
1300886548284542976 2020-09-02 04:01:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ReviewsCrusader Oh yeah, I also saw him at a Q&amp;A for THe Invisible Man right before the lockdown so yes, it's always a pleasure and hope he does more films.
1300886408559824901 2020-09-02 04:01:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ReviewsCrusader He only has 2 films but I liked both so far and hope he works with Elisabeth Moss again. I saw him at a screening/Q&amp;A that got interrupted by a fire alarm, but when the movie stopped and couldn't restart right away, he held the Q&amp;A in the middle of the film until they resumed it.
1300885968241582080 2020-09-02 03:59:18 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevin_thecritic I love it!
1300885901971611648 2020-09-02 03:59:02 +0800 <AlliCinema> @MovieNightMast Tried to see her once but she was double booked then I finally saw her speak at a festival so yes Virgin Suicides The Beguiled she's relatively well known but I don't know. Lost in Translation I believe got an Oscar nom but still I feel not a lot of ppl talk about it much anymore
1300883424501063680 2020-09-02 03:49:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevin_thecritic My favorite character is Eli Wallach's. 😃
1300883226395684864 2020-09-02 03:48:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> Alpacas? Hold on, everybody. We're moving to Peru!!
1300883017867522048 2020-09-02 03:47:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @dantetripp Yes? 🤔
1300882759162896385 2020-09-02 03:46:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevin_thecritic All good! 😃
1300882632960483328 2020-09-02 03:46:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevin_thecritic Didn't mean to diss The Holiday. Sorry.  Relieved face  She seemed relatively nice. It was awhile ago. Her daughters were in the audience: teenagers or early twenties at the time.
1300882127903318018 2020-09-02 03:44:03 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Super8Ken Yes Les Rendez-vous d'Anna Jeanne Dielman Saute ma ville (short)
1300881915436650496 2020-09-02 03:43:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevin_thecritic Yes I stan and saw her speak at the WGA once Something's Gotta Give The Holiday The Intern
1300873818194419712 2020-09-02 03:11:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ThiefCGT Thanks. 😅
1300862205554876416 2020-09-02 02:24:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @GavinBooth Yes, saw him at least once at a Q&amp;A Boyhood don't want to get myself in trouble Bernie and Fast Food Nation
1300861501469843458 2020-09-02 02:22:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> @alissamarieek @realDonaldTrump That is the worst. Fracking is a huge threat and I feel strongly about it, because I'm in California and we're susceptible to earthquakes. Solar energy all the way!!!
1300860614164623360 2020-09-02 02:18:33 +0800 <AlliCinema> @NextBestPicture ...or The Following
1300857504235024385 2020-09-02 02:06:12 +0800 <AlliCinema> @non_fele saw him live accidentally but he was very intelligent The Last House on the Left pass his segment in Paris, je t'aime (2006)
1300856852649918470 2020-09-02 02:03:37 +0800 <AlliCinema> @Dan__Desmond Yes I stan hard. After missing seeing him live several times over the years, I finally got to see him around 3x during the 2019/2020 awards season. todo sobre mi madre n/a but I didn't have as much of an emotional connection to The Skin I Live In as I did to the others  Julieta
1300856143825178624 2020-09-02 02:00:48 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ThiefCGT No, he actually scares me with his personality even tho I recently found out he was an animal lover. lolta 2001 (gonna get hate for this I'm sure) The Killing

1300855087112155136 2020-09-02 01:56:36 +0800 <AlliCinema> @tsasa198 👍  I will also be trying to schedule some Saturday morning ones for Dsney+

1300854754902446087 2020-09-02 01:55:16 +0800 <AlliCinema> @francobavtista There can be Clementine and Joel action figures, lunch boxes and t-shirts, along with Clementine's potato dolls and Kaufman would be the richest man in the world. Also I reserve the right to change my answer once his new film comes out. (2/2)
1300854416510054400 2020-09-02 01:53:56 +0800 <AlliCinema> @francobavtista Yes, I stan hard. I've seen him at least 3x live. Synecdoche NY Being John Malkovich (I think it would have been better if they stuck to his original script) they're all underrated, but Eternal Sunshine should have made all the money in the world. (1/2)
1300853966641614853 2020-09-02 01:52:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @igotdefeverman I did wait two hours to see ANIMA in Imax and I spotted him with his wife one of their children in Sherman Oaks. Hard Eight Phantom Thread(pls don't hate) Hard Eight (don't usually put the same answer for fav &amp; underrated, but this time yet)
1300852569116348417 2020-09-02 01:46:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @nalahiri @bliggup Tenet is not worth dying for even if it were the best movie on the planet.
1300852439306784768 2020-09-02 01:46:04 +0800 <AlliCinema> @nalahiri @bliggup Canada is different from Los Angeles. We are at very high risk here. Nolan isn't offering it on-demand and people are forced to make a potentially life-threatening decision to see Tenet. People in Canada are more thoughtful. In the USA, we have people who won't even wear masks.
1300852113694572546 2020-09-02 01:44:47 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JustinGoss Oh, I did and I rated it highly.
1300846101872873473 2020-09-02 01:20:53 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheBMDavies She's great. Can't wait to see what she does next.
1300845914794278913 2020-09-02 01:20:09 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheTragicSoul I liked In the House quite a bit and Ozon gave us a gift with Swimning Pool when he gave us a film with both Rampling and Sagnier
1300845646090350593 2020-09-02 01:19:05 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JustinGoss yes, we were both at Cannes in 2019 but I don't think I ran into him Amores perros Revenant Babel
1300844914683510784 2020-09-02 01:16:10 +0800 <AlliCinema> @omegarazor Yes I have been dying to see him Scarface (1983)  all his films are underrated so it's hard to call anything overrated from him Sisters (1973)
1300844525749850112 2020-09-02 01:14:38 +0800 <AlliCinema> @bliggup I saw him speak for a screening of The Following (and saw his bro speak at a screening of The Prestige) Memento Tenet (lives are more important than money and Nolan is willing to sacrifice us for the almighty dollar and that makes me angry) Insomnia
1300844096580235264 2020-09-02 01:12:55 +0800 <AlliCinema> @JustinGoss @ginny_sais_quoi I almost named another film from him for the overrated but I think it would make more ppl angrier. Anyway if it makes you feel better, Res. Dogs felt very testosterone-fueled and wasn't as much for me as the others
1300843759647612928 2020-09-02 01:11:35 +0800 <AlliCinema> @iamnodarkknight Yes, believe they were there for the Down for the Mountain taping at The Ryman Auditorium A Serious Man n/a The Hudsucker Proxy
1300843299687653376 2020-09-02 01:09:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @TheTragicSoul -Yes, saw him live for Potiche -Hard to choose between Time to Leave, 5×2, Jeune et Jolie, L’Amant double  -hard to say -Une Nouvelle Amie
1300842289472831488 2020-09-02 01:05:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ginny_sais_quoi I have seen him live several times  Kill Bill Vol I Reservoir Dogs Jackie Brown
1300841969585852417 2020-09-02 01:04:28 +0800 <AlliCinema> @maryfaith_m the first appearance I saw from someone related to film was in 2004. Pat Hitchcock, his daughter was presenting Stage Fright and I was excited to see her Vertigo/Shadow of a Doubt Rear Window Young and Innocent
1300839209477971969 2020-09-02 00:53:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> I am going to have to cut this game short as I will not be able to respond to all of them.

1300838937242382337 2020-09-02 00:52:25 +0800 <AlliCinema> @princessgleek Yes, I was hoping to hear him speak before he died but unfortunately that didn't happen. I did pull a theatrical Altman triple feature once that involved going to 2 diff. theaters to make it happen  I have like 4 favs. One is: 3 Women Nashville A Perfect Couple (1979)

1300831213477797890 2020-09-02 00:21:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ginny_sais_quoi I'm gonna have to agree. Anyone can drink it if they wish but it's often watered down and sugary.

1300828193658609666 2020-09-02 00:09:44 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ginny_sais_quoi Ugh. I have practically give up on men. It's very sad that they act that way.
1300827883850457088 2020-09-02 00:08:30 +0800 <AlliCinema> I only make a note on the violence if 18 or more people were brutally slaughtered in a film. 17 isn't enough.
1300826964073132032 2020-09-02 00:04:51 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ginny_sais_quoi 😰

1300817523034611714 2020-09-01 23:27:20 +0800 <AlliCinema> @AnothermillennR Honestly, House of Cards. Unfortunately, K*vin Sp*cey was getting away with garbage and it caught up to him. Was a great series and that horrible man ruined it for everyone.

1300815738559627264 2020-09-01 23:20:14 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevin_thecritic Yeah, it's insane and selfish if they aren't providing other ways to see the film (hint, hint Nol*n not releasing Tenet on VOD).
1300795624166572032 2020-09-01 22:00:19 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ebonrook_film Feels like it, I know.
1300795297841307648 2020-09-01 21:59:01 +0800 <AlliCinema> @kevin_thecritic I don't feel comfortable, but California has a high number of cases. Also, the closest open theater to me right now is in Utah.
1300794476261040129 2020-09-01 21:55:45 +0800 <AlliCinema> @M2ssiah It's a love-hate relationship.
1300794401262714887 2020-09-01 21:55:27 +0800 <AlliCinema> @ebonrook_film Just since the Oscars. But yes, I'm sure it felt like a long time.😆
