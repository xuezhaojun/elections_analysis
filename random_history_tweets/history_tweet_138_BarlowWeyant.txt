1334449368179597312 2020-12-03 18:48:16 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> It will be so nice when this lying, orange POS doesn't pop up on your TV screen daily.  Soooo sick of this bastard
1334447832808509441 2020-12-03 18:42:10 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> Rather take the game loss than lose Dupree
1334447643146248193 2020-12-03 18:41:25 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @Starscream35 Only once.  The feeling of dread and that there was something overwhelmingly wrong was overpowering. My mind would just not accept it. I hope nothing that terrible ever happens again. It should not have been there.
1334292594327744525 2020-12-03 08:25:19 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> THAT is a good coach. THAT is how you play better
1334289780071419910 2020-12-03 08:14:08 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @fras99 Tore a bicep, but my mother threw rubbing alcohol on a scrotum injury when I was a child. I passed right the fuck out....assuming that really hurt
1334289360431280128 2020-12-03 08:12:28 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> Ben was right. They could have played a lot better and I am a Steelers fan from birth. Tomlin will make them learn from their mistakes
1334287087768625152 2020-12-03 08:03:26 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> 11 - 0....how about "look out" about that
1334267396744486913 2020-12-03 06:45:11 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> Defense is going to have to win this. AGAIN! C'mon Ben!!!

1332452108252098562 2020-11-28 06:31:53 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> If Joe Namath tries to sell me insurance ONE MORE TIME on tv, I am going to fuckin lose it.  ENOUGH!!!!
1332450997008994306 2020-11-28 06:27:28 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @jeffzrebiec Steelers sick? You are fcking the best team in the NFL because the opposing team has not been following protocol. How about the #RAVENSFORFEIT
1332450274393329664 2020-11-28 06:24:35 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> Since when do players get sick and games get re-scheduled and again.I know this is different but you are penalizing the Steelers because the Ravens don't have their shit together
1332449782187642880 2020-11-28 06:22:38 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> Tell me there is not a special broadcast of Morning Joe so he sells books!

1324735788471492608 2020-11-06 23:29:59 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> If you sell Trump paraphernalia this would be a good time for that "Going Out of Business Sale"

1324731059179839488 2020-11-06 23:11:11 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @TheRickWilson Thank you and your friends for making this possible!
1324146527321776128 2020-11-05 08:28:28 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> You gotta give Trump credit where credit is due...."GREATEST SHIT SHOW EVER"...like nothing before..no one has ever seen anything like it!!!
1324145885069062146 2020-11-05 08:25:55 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> And Melania said "fuck Christmas" last year..........yikes!!!
1324139822676643841 2020-11-05 08:01:49 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> In three months I am going to pretend that was all a bad dream and I don't care what anybody says
1324139002434326529 2020-11-05 07:58:34 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> Yeah, uh no...this orange nightmare is about to end
1324130653705822208 2020-11-05 07:25:23 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @annabkrr I am disappointed too, but that traitorous orange POS is gone

1323940383181647873 2020-11-04 18:49:19 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @AltNatSecAgency The Trump admin does not give a single fuck about the law. When was the last time one of them showed up when subpoened. This is the way democracy dies
1323936769524535297 2020-11-04 18:34:58 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> If only that was all he has done

1323679703375503362 2020-11-04 01:33:28 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @Sundae_Gurl There will still be a lot of old bigoted Republicans Senators to piss you off
1323585204099948545 2020-11-03 19:17:58 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> Why is this hypocrite constantly quoting scripture?!  STFU!!.No one believes you are a practicing Christian. How about find those kids parents
1322949759469035521 2020-11-02 01:12:56 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @jmontforttx @Austin_Police Has this ass been arrested yet?

1321759139543044099 2020-10-29 18:21:50 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> Yep, some are this dumb..Tragic really
1321745634018398208 2020-10-29 17:28:10 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @LouGarza86 Gave up with the injection thing (back). You get excited for a little bit because it helps but then it is gone. Sticking with narcotics
1321740162745946112 2020-10-29 17:06:26 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @Quizical123 We seem to be real bad at learning. We need to educate our population. This is both embarrassing and dangerous
1321739613002735616 2020-10-29 17:04:15 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @Quizical123 2021
1321731273686241281 2020-10-29 16:31:06 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @Leo_Puglisi6 NC, which will be close, can count up to 9 days after the election
1321502106323484672 2020-10-29 01:20:29 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> Who has more brain function?
1321453908540018688 2020-10-28 22:08:57 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> It looks like both the Trump train and bus end the same place. A one way trip to a dead end
1321452069690245127 2020-10-28 22:01:39 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @jreganwilliams @Lyndajo23904339 Don't know how you get up and go back to that. Thank You!!!

1320342890569175040 2020-10-25 20:34:10 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @DonaldJTrumpJr I believe you got your own legal issues, don't you Jr.?
1320312757586169857 2020-10-25 18:34:26 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @JamesMelville That fat fuck will be lucky if he doesn't have a hard attack walking 30 ft to his Range Rover. Disgusting POS

1318115403374170112 2020-10-19 17:02:56 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> That would be wonderful but that is not going to happen. He will never, ever, STFU and this is a personality cult. They will follow him to the end
1317923284760100864 2020-10-19 04:19:31 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @NotDevinsMom @ladyvictoria8 Yes, and he is the worst Senator we have had here since McCarthy. A total Trump stooge and major embarrassment for us

1317027107948630016 2020-10-16 16:58:26 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> I voted here in WI during the height of the pandemic. The Republican legislature forced in person voting then. I saw people much more at risk than me come out.  Vote anyway you can but VOTE!
1317026664308682758 2020-10-16 16:56:40 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @angelia_driver @giaolson6 @RepMarciaFudge @michaelianblack Thank you. Will do the same if I have to. We have had them try to keep us from voting here in WI and we won our primary for the WI Supreme Court.

1314125497287299072 2020-10-08 16:48:28 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> Biden is the designated driver that takes over because you have already bounced off the guard rails about 10 times..........and Trump is that guy that didn't want to give up the wheel
1313791347694993408 2020-10-07 18:40:41 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @Elsie_geselsie @ToriLynn_29 First naked person I have seen on Twitter. Do we have to do this here?
1313045060410372097 2020-10-05 17:15:12 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> The vast majority of those who attended the Amy Coathanger Barrett event, at what is being called the Ronna Garden, were without masks. Just an entire mob of idiots hoping their SCOTUS pick will take away American's health insurance. Well, not their socialized healtcare of course
1313041129718378498 2020-10-05 16:59:35 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> The beligerency and arrogance of Trump in the debate was only appealing to those who are like minded. Luckily, the majority of Americans are better than that. We need a leader who reflects our values
1313040323535306759 2020-10-05 16:56:22 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> The ignorance and arrogance of Trump and his enablers has been laid bare as one after another falls ill to CoVid. Stupidity has it's price
1312873186657284101 2020-10-05 05:52:14 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> @ResistThePres @VoteBluAmerica Assholes
1312488456006721538 2020-10-04 04:23:27 +0800 <BarlowWeyant> Arrogant, obstinate, and grossly reckless Attorney General Barr has elected not to quarantine despite direct exposure to COVID-19. He will be undeterred in his dirty work, no matter the cost.
