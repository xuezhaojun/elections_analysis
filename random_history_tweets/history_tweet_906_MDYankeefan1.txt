1342304581062172672 2020-12-25 11:02:05 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @JonathanTurley The fact that you can look at all that money dumped on a crackhead and pretend it had nothing to do with his father's position is embarrassing.  A Special Council is certainly warranted for both Hunter and Joe's brother. And probably Joe.

That's a far cry from determining that they are "bogus". Claims of "standing" and "this is the wrong venue", or my favorite, "should have been presented earlier" (as if evidence of fraud can be pre-presented).

If the proof is self evident, you're still fine with having a stolen  election awarded to a ChiCom grifter?  Why?  Why are you so hell bent on certifying this fraud?

Only in 5 cities in 5 swing states, with votes that magically appeared after all 5 cities inexplicably stopped counting votes at the same time and the resumed at the same time having discovered 100's of 1,000's of votes, all over 94% for Biden.

Nothing in the Constitution would then be beyond rewriting by various state courts or Attny Generals. WTF, dog catchers even.  This could be their infamy.  Their Dred Scott. Their relevance.

Because by Constituental law, only the state legislature can make election law.  Not the Attny Gen or the State Supreme Ct, each waiving provisions of state law.  Those decisions were unconstitutional &amp; illegal.

1326573920305242112 2020-11-12 01:14:03 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @zerocoolphoto @NVGOP Well, no. We're concerned there may be fraud, so we handed the information over to the Justice Dept for review.  All those condos owned by Californians who vote in both states , you know?  We kept it private specifically to protect those who had legitimate reasons, i.e. military.
1326559103351746562 2020-11-12 00:15:11 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @Doc_0 Interesting thread if you totally ignore the statistical impossibilities that have been exposed.  I refuse to believe that the majority of Americans voted for a dementia patient with ties to communist Chinese bribes,Ukrainian bribes, Russian bribes - just to teach Trump a lesson

1326370556380389379 2020-11-11 11:45:58 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> The first time was tragedy, the second time farce.  Fox has become a farce of what it used to be. Evidence right in front of you about massive fraud, but because you don't report on it, it doesn't exist.  Right.
1326293906372370432 2020-11-11 06:41:23 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @afneil Perhaps you should brush up on American election law. It isn't a matter of which network "calls" the vote, it's a matter of which states have certified the vote. And, as of now, neither candidate has the required 270 votes.
1326218729848451073 2020-11-11 01:42:39 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @RaheemKassam The"will" of the people is debatable, since so many of your people were dead.

He made it possible for a 3 or 4 year process to be condensed into months.  Your take is extremely ignorant, or an outright lie.
1326186406318907393 2020-11-10 23:34:13 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> Well Mikey, for the one millionth time,"FAKE NEWS"is the enemy of the people.  And, Mikey, no press member should ever call our Pres. an "agent of Russia" without a scintilla of evidence. And if they did,profusely apologize for lying through their teeth,and resign in disgrace.

It's a savage response, often misinterpreted by others as a dickhead response.  This is how the real world acts.  "Keeping Up Appearances" was a British sitcom, not American politics.

And have this type of ballot be the overwhelming majority of the "late"and"found" ballots.  To believe this, you require "the willing suspension of disbelief"..

He is a completely compromised man.  He is bought and paid for.
1324713158997643265 2020-11-06 22:00:03 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @Doc_0 So, we are left with the undeniable truth that the Left's, and the media's hatred for this populist interloper colored their supposed truthful reporting, so much that what was completely ignored was the NY Post revelations that Biden has been on the take for decades,
1324712189106802691 2020-11-06 21:56:12 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @Doc_0 Secondly, you refuse to acknowledge that the President followed **every bit** of advice from "the science" and the sainted Dr Fauci but one - shutting down travel from China. This proved to be correct as Fauci acknowledged.
1324710585066508290 2020-11-06 21:49:50 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @Doc_0 An "epochally" bad year by what can be argued as an act of war by communist China, spun by the opposition party and the national media as a failing by the President.  Remember - China shut down national travel to and from Wuhan, but allowed international travel to continue.

1324139888812457984 2020-11-05 08:02:05 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @GarySanchezRBW Why not give framed duplicates of one of the graft checks he got from Communist China?  Hell, make it a set - China, Ukraine, Romania and Russia.  Then framed photos of each of his 3 million dollar homes.  There you go.
1324087632775815174 2020-11-05 04:34:26 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @TweetVandal @Harlan @JoeBiden Yes, of course.  This dozens brought the number to 89%. Of course.
1324087064963489793 2020-11-05 04:32:11 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @DC_Draino Fraud.  Blatant fraud.
1324002760233259008 2020-11-04 22:57:11 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @EWErickson Yeah, sure Eric.  Why, that pile of over 130,000 Biden ballots just fell behind the counting table.  Yeah, that's it.  All Biden votes too! Go figure - what are the odds?
1324002051660066816 2020-11-04 22:54:22 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @Garrett_Archer There's a third option - have a Republican government.

They're finding out how many they need to "find" to flip the vote.  Their corruption is epic.
1323993664599822336 2020-11-04 22:21:02 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @kawaiithepie1 @GarySanchezRBW Postmarked by the 3rd would meet the traditional definition as acceptable.  What is being expanded is ballots with no postmark, and ballots with no signature.  And get off the "dismantling the post office" lie. That's been BS since it was brought up.

1322187653186527232 2020-10-30 22:44:36 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @LuisBobby3 For good reason.
1322186584641409024 2020-10-30 22:40:21 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @ec_laney Now, whether it's implemented...
1322184553625194503 2020-10-30 22:32:17 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @TimRunsHisMouth How will the Democrats know how many votes they need to manufacture?
1322183401584152577 2020-10-30 22:27:42 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @DrewHolden360 It's the numbers in the rally.  Trump polls rally goers. Consistently 20%+ "Never voted". Which means "Never polled". This would seem to translate to a large number of unaccounted for voters.  Rallies also poll 20%+ Democrats.
1322181604006109185 2020-10-30 22:20:33 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @ec_laney The system should show you had requested a mail in ballot. If you show up to vote, the ballot must be returned before you can vote.  If it was a mass mail state where request wasn't necessary, supposedly the system would record you voted and not count subsequent votes. Supposedly
1322173841267924992 2020-10-30 21:49:43 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @joelockhart The Appeals Court merely upheld the existing law.  You're upset because you now need to guess how many votes you'll need to manufacture, not know for certain.  P.S. - you can still go to the polls if you waited this long to find a post office.

1322156359857643520 2020-10-30 20:40:15 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @ScottAdamsSays No.  Remember, just over 52%of eligible voters voted in 2016. Trump Rallies consistently have 20%+ **never voted**, so, never polled.  Similar % Dem. attendees.  The "suprises" are still out there. They will solidify the decision of these people to vote Trump, and vote Red.
1321978257093386243 2020-10-30 08:52:32 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @ColemanCullen @RubinReport The vote is especially important, even in a blue state.  We need all the votes possible to avoid the BS about "he didn't get the largest number of votes". So vote even if you know it's fruitless in your state.  Electoral College for the win.  Vote total to shut up the leftists.

1320759526593875969 2020-10-27 00:09:44 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @lukelivingood The truth is blunt.  All successful black Americans would agree with this comment.
1320757595414663168 2020-10-27 00:02:03 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @GarySanchezRBW They didn't have the option of a great fielding catcher on the bench. &amp; an ace who demanded him. I personally think Sanchez obsessed too much about his D. He's too large to be a great catcher.  I like Smoltz' comments - he'd tolerate the passed balls for the HR's. Every day.
1320755520169529344 2020-10-26 23:53:49 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @GarySanchezRBW Wow.  I played ball over 20 years, been fortunate to be on several championship teams (nothing professional), and the rule in the playoffs was contribute or sit.  I don't think if you took a confidential poll of the team they'd side with you, unless he carried them all year.
1320752159475073024 2020-10-26 23:40:27 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @GarySanchezRBW Fair enough, but having played, at what point in the playoffs do you continue to put him in with no production? You know the rest of the team knows he's not producing.  I hate to point this out, but if he was a Gold Glove caliber catcher he would have started all games.
1320747340496572416 2020-10-26 23:21:18 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @GarySanchezRBW I'm not trying to aggravate, but how so?  I'm trying to understand analytics, which often seems opposite to what I learned. I was taught by Williams' "The Science of Hitting".

Not happening.  As much as you try to convince people.  Not happening.

I'm listening to his speech tonight and he just said he was going to make a play for New York. That would be completely unexpected for the Biden campaign.

In this case, the same party represents the Sen and the Presid. W/Garland, that wasn't the case.  According to the rules the Dems set, in the last year of the Presidency, opp control of Sen &amp; Ex., no confirmation. Same, confirm

It was Roberts that changed the law as written, as a fine for failure to participate in health care to a tax, because low and behold, congress can tax. It was never called a tax, it was a fine for failure to purchase care.
1307807294604955649 2020-09-21 06:22:11 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @SunnyDfan4eva @Tim_Gutwald @AngelsDude84 @RichLowry This is unconstitutional. The Gov can't force a citizen to purchase anything.  Roberts ignited the arguments, ignored the briefs, and declared it a tax when *no one* argued that.  Because that was bullshit.
1307806586593738752 2020-09-21 06:19:22 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @SunnyDfan4eva @Tim_Gutwald @AngelsDude84 @RichLowry It's amazing that the one topic I was discussing - the ACA - has morphed into "all the ones you disagree with". I'm talking about the ACA. The congress and the admin argued that failure to enroll would result in a fine, in effect forcing citizens to purchase a thing.

1307779756696403968 2020-09-21 04:32:46 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @Tim_Gutwald @AngelsDude84 @RichLowry Don't gag like most people forced into the ACA.  It was unconstitutional to begin with, and finally it's illegality caught up with it.  The government can't force you to purchase anything.

And he would have had to declare the monthly "Putin deposits" as income.  And how he earned it.  But he doesn't, so he didn't, so it's irrelevant.  Like your comparison.

Africans sold other Africans into slavery, then and today.  I refuse to accept any blame for the acts of 150 years ago.  Especially since it continues today and no woke person gives a shit.

Let's go back to Roman times.  Arabic slavery was epic, and in a nod to old times continues today, complete with sub Saharan Africans.  Can't forget the Chinese and their million Ugers.

The crucial balance of being voted out is subverted.

No waffling, no "off the record". The media is still furious about this.  Trump refuses to politically surrender like McCain and Romney did.

There are no named sources quoted on the record.  Except for several who were there and say that this story is utterly false, a brazen lie.  Your stock in trade.

1301101616012156928 2020-09-02 18:16:13 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @Newsweek @realDonaldTrump "Tucker Carlson plays tape of Chris Cuomo saying he was accused of sexual harassment ". Big difference.
1300984153027076096 2020-09-02 10:29:27 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @stillgray What the hell is a "Sanctuary safe white"?
1300981750600998914 2020-09-02 10:19:55 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @DysClaimer @deborahebloom The majority come from out of state. That makes it interstate crime. Federal territory.  The locals can be charged with "accessory" or "conspiracy" to commit Federal crimes.  They're toast.
1300945869785702405 2020-09-02 07:57:20 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @janicki_sean Reagan for me.  The complacency shaken off by Breitbart. I watch that 10 second "War!" video every day.   https://t.co/TvTcaEX6Lj
1300944722878509063 2020-09-02 07:52:46 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @NYGovCuomo You're liar.  You're a fraud.  Hydroxychloroquine is effective.  You murdered thousands of seniors.
1300914612053909504 2020-09-02 05:53:07 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @drdavidsamadi Simple push aways.  From the table.
1300913326654926849 2020-09-02 05:48:01 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @RealCandaceO @BDSixsmith - run this up the flagpole
1300913021255065600 2020-09-02 05:46:48 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @ScottAdamsSays Several videos as a matter of fact.
1300892737714237449 2020-09-02 04:26:12 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @ChuckCallesto We know how many registered voters are in each state.  As soon as Trump surpasses 50% +1, he wins the Electoral votes for that state.. If Republicans flood the polls on Nov 3rd, the mail ins won't matter.  Only 55% voted last time. We must get to the polls in force.  #Trump2020
1300887831053824001 2020-09-02 04:06:42 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @SimpleSided Wisdom.
1300858194386980865 2020-09-02 02:08:56 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @HillaryClinton Not as nuts as "losing" 30,000 emails.
1300857441165377539 2020-09-02 02:05:57 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @BDSixsmith Actually, you can probably request a mail in ballot from Chicago and they would gladly comply.  They'd even vote for you.  In fact, now that you've expressed your desire they'll take it from here. #ChicagoWay
1300856284149886976 2020-09-02 02:01:21 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @BDSixsmith B.S. Not rising to the bait.
1300829670250864642 2020-09-02 00:15:36 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @brithume @wjmcgurn No, they won't.  They'll explain on Nov 3.

1300822893077692418 2020-09-01 23:48:40 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @DLoesch A bridge too short.  With weak guard rails.
1300815010927706116 2020-09-01 23:17:21 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @CHIZMAGA Law enforcement around all polling places.
1300814605053296641 2020-09-01 23:15:44 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @ScottAdamsSays Or, as Hillary would say, provide "a willing suspension of disbelief"..
1300812936995377152 2020-09-01 23:09:06 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @NPR Actually, NPR , there are *multiple* videos that show this exact thing. He was acting in self defense.  You have devolved into terror apology.  You are disgraceful.
1300811352152440833 2020-09-01 23:02:48 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @LuisBobby3 @davidchapman141 @CottoGottfried @Man77Nc B.S. What's the breakdown - Dem/Rep/Ind?
1300806248263233538 2020-09-01 22:42:32 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @BecketAdams @drawandstrike "Update: I am a dolt."

1300748356482936832 2020-09-01 18:52:29 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @greg_price11 And they have no heart, and no brains.
1300747720169328640 2020-09-01 18:49:57 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> Refuting the false claims he himself had made several times.
1300713926703886336 2020-09-01 16:35:40 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @igorbobic Because all evidence points to just that fact.

1300646652341088256 2020-09-01 12:08:21 +0800 <MDYankeefan1> @CatesDuane @lans_2ray - this is the thread of the 17 yr old that shot those 2 antifa in self defense.  Videos are just unreal.
