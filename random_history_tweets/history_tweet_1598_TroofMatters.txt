1325546630779723785 2020-11-09 05:11:58 +0800 <TroofMatters> @pnjaban Education reform to prevent the Marxist Indoctrination of kids in schools and colleges should be enacted and the GOP should reach out to this demographic using the concepts of freedom and liberty and fundamentals of the Constitution to point out how and why America is great  2/
1325545809920847877 2020-11-09 05:08:43 +0800 <TroofMatters> @pnjaban The GOP has a good list of candidates but not the voter base to get them elected convincingly  We should start courting libertarians more Many of these could've been won even after all the fraud if some of the libertarians that voted for Jo Jorgensen voted instead for Trump  1/

1312118674690502656 2020-10-03 03:54:04 +0800 <TroofMatters> @Tanya_RBLee @RonnyJackson4TX Right now he does have mild symptoms yes! Hope both Melania and him recover  However, I was replying to Ronny's original tweet which said he was asymptomatic at the time
1312066152345071618 2020-10-03 00:25:22 +0800 <TroofMatters> @Ziggyfan_1 @RonnyJackson4TX I agree that it might be the autocorrect feature but as a doctor getting these words right is important
1311953203077021697 2020-10-02 16:56:33 +0800 <TroofMatters> @RonnyJackson4TX Glad to hear that! Hope they get well soon  Just a note: It's "asymptomatic" and "comorbidities"

Trump said, "Sure, I'm willing to do that"  Then he says "Stand back and Stand by" in response to Wallace's original question

1308541343782842368 2020-09-23 06:59:02 +0800 <TroofMatters> @plasticeyejesus @PaulKatz9 @Walsmit @JoyAnnReid Agreed  The judicial system should interpret the law made by the legislature objectively   But obviously this is not arithmetic to say 1+1 = 2 and as much as you try to prevent it, interpretation of laws is different between different people no matter their religious beliefs
1308539404470943745 2020-09-23 06:51:20 +0800 <TroofMatters> @hailsat72743157 @PaulKatz9 @Walsmit @JoyAnnReid I agree  Calling someone commie is not an argument
1308510979614035968 2020-09-23 04:58:23 +0800 <TroofMatters> @PaulKatz9 @Walsmit @JoyAnnReid Yeah what it means is politicians shouldn't be calling supreme court nominees "radical" because of their religious beliefs
