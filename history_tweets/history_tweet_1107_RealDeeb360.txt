BS they got through the gates and fucked off and left the kids, good, they would have been sold to sex traffickers
1318831265475330051 2020-10-21 16:27:31 +0800 <RealDeeb360> @thehill BS, anybody who claims god spoke to them is a liar, and Satan is their daddy... god doesn‚Äôt speak to you, he reveals the truth to you, he doesnt have a voice@and he doesn‚Äôt speak to people.

Occam‚Äôs razor would suggest it‚Äôs a big bid to sway voters, nobody thinks the economy is in jeopardy, unless joe locks you down again then the economy will never recover

You‚Äôve got to be simple to think they doing it to ‚Äòsave‚Äô the economy, it‚Äôs to save their own asses and payout less
1318580426282131457 2020-10-20 23:50:46 +0800 <RealDeeb360> @GWorthylake @SpeakerPelosi Do note, that Wall Street (you know all the corporations of the world) have been raising money for Biden.... now if trump has been lining their pockets against the will of the American people, why do they endorse joe? And give him millions to win? Hmmm
1318579847589990405 2020-10-20 23:48:28 +0800 <RealDeeb360> @InoueKuniko @SpeakerPelosi Guessing nobody‚Äôs threatening to evict you.

1317760326872539138 2020-10-18 17:31:59 +0800 <RealDeeb360> @CNNPolitics How about the FBI just investigate if the contents is real? It doesn‚Äôt matter who whipped it up, and obviously it‚Äôs a dig at the Biden campaign because joe is directly involved and running for president

As this evidence would have supported trumps claim, if not confirmed his claim... the FBI can‚Äôt attempt to impeach him when they are sat on the evidence that obliterates their prosecution
1317382900569034753 2020-10-17 16:32:13 +0800 <RealDeeb360> @CNNPolitics Judging by their recent corruption, we will see questions like - ‚Äúmr president, last you were hesitant to denounce white supremacy, will you in fact denounce it now?‚Äù And ‚Äúsir Joseph Biden, I know you don‚Äôt want to answer hard questions so he‚Äôs a yo-yo to play with‚Äù
