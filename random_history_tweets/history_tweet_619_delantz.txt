1327473174133370880 2020-11-14 12:47:22 +0800 <delantz> @rak_strong He will not be president. He will have nothing to do with this.
1327472939524972545 2020-11-14 12:46:26 +0800 <delantz> @QueenDandelion2 @ReportsDaNews Me too. These are such hard times. Continue to reach out. We can get through this one step at a time.
1327462354150326272 2020-11-14 12:04:22 +0800 <delantz> @chipfranklin @joncoopertweets Don't tease me.... Are you sure?

1327450044472037376 2020-11-14 11:15:28 +0800 <delantz> @NewYorkStateAG He won't be president. Who cares?
1327449723234447361 2020-11-14 11:14:11 +0800 <delantz> @Lori_Resists You have to ask? JMJ, Where have you been the 4 effing years?

1327407809156169728 2020-11-14 08:27:38 +0800 <delantz> @robreiner As well he should.
1327407510278455296 2020-11-14 08:26:27 +0800 <delantz> @MuellerSheWrote Yep! Except he won't be president and so he won't be doing anything related to the vaccine.
1327407122607267842 2020-11-14 08:24:54 +0800 <delantz> @drdave1999 Yep!
1327397597628178437 2020-11-14 07:47:03 +0800 <delantz> @MarthaMcSally Pretty amazing thing for a dishonorable person to say
1327397114154872832 2020-11-14 07:45:08 +0800 <delantz> @itsJeffTiedrich Yes... That has been well-established
1327396769806786566 2020-11-14 07:43:46 +0800 <delantz> @NicolasEdny YES! THANK YOU. We obviously cannot depend on we white people to save the GD country!
1327396408509427712 2020-11-14 07:42:20 +0800 <delantz> If you don't like it, WEAR A GODDAMN MASK! Get your back-assed cronies to do the same.
1327389146894069761 2020-11-14 07:13:28 +0800 <delantz> Who is "we" loser?  https://t.co/VEIs6sXbRN

1327377784134504448 2020-11-14 06:28:19 +0800 <delantz> @joncoopertweets This is just heartbreaking. Not! Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out!

1327074209105731584 2020-11-13 10:22:01 +0800 <delantz> @joncoopertweets She has no compassion, integrity or grace. She is in alignment with Trump. She is a Birther white supremist. As her jacket said on her trip to the border, "I really don't care, do you?

1326183367440699392 2020-11-10 23:22:08 +0800 <delantz> @blackwomenviews Who gives a damn. I'm sure the Biden's don't. It is probably a huge relief
1326182384471961602 2020-11-10 23:18:14 +0800 <delantz> Yeah, that is happening.
1326013073568591872 2020-11-10 12:05:27 +0800 <delantz> @KamalaHarris Thank you for saving our asses, again.

1326006351516950528 2020-11-10 11:38:44 +0800 <delantz> Pfizer has nothing to do with Warp Speed. Pfizer took no money from the government.
1326003271341727744 2020-11-10 11:26:30 +0800 <delantz> @LizForTX8 I think they are complicit and culpable in the present shitshow.

1325945783183527937 2020-11-10 07:38:04 +0800 <delantz> @JoyAnnReid Exactly
1325945702208319490 2020-11-10 07:37:44 +0800 <delantz> @joncoopertweets Only question was, how much did it cost them for that lie?

1325851525797740544 2020-11-10 01:23:31 +0800 <delantz> @blackwomenviews YES! And I'm doing a happy dance.
1325847596909252608 2020-11-10 01:07:54 +0800 <delantz> @freddyatton Good God man! All the male journalists in the media and you are putting this on one women? There is a word for this that begins with M and Trump was one of those too.
1325710075843936256 2020-11-09 16:01:27 +0800 <delantz> @Manny_Funes Works for me.
1325603108630589441 2020-11-09 08:56:24 +0800 <delantz> @TotalSeasons @kimhurdman @realDonaldTrump Maybe he will get enough to pay off his $431,000,000 debt.
1325602081680486403 2020-11-09 08:52:19 +0800 <delantz> @AshaRangappa_ Aawww. Too bad. They supported a white supremist, self admitted sexual assaulter, misogynist, xenophobe. What is there to like? Maybe it is just soon?
1325600528831709184 2020-11-09 08:46:09 +0800 <delantz> I would love to hear that.

1325590975264141313 2020-11-09 08:08:11 +0800 <delantz> We don't either.

1325585463147556864 2020-11-09 07:46:17 +0800 <delantz> One could hardly call this a competition Buttercup.

1325534812354981888 2020-11-09 04:25:01 +0800 <delantz> @McFaul Nobody cares.
1325534666879741952 2020-11-09 04:24:26 +0800 <delantz> @mitchellreports Too little too late. If he had endorsed them before the election that would be worthy of a tweet. He called...who cares. No big deal.
1325533199083008000 2020-11-09 04:18:36 +0800 <delantz> @NaveedAJamali @ProjectLincoln Indeed!
1325529410133356544 2020-11-09 04:03:33 +0800 <delantz> @CNN You weren't successful in getting Trump re-elected. Drop his lying surrogates. And BTW, EFF you.
1325529020063051776 2020-11-09 04:02:00 +0800 <delantz> @ReportsDaNews It only matters if he endorsed him before the election. No big deal here.

1325471309564764160 2020-11-09 00:12:40 +0800 <delantz> @ReportsDaNews @realDonaldTrump I wonder what Republicans are golfing with him today?

1325469411461922822 2020-11-09 00:05:08 +0800 <delantz> Chief Liar for The Liar-In-Chief. One of the best if them all. Sorry for the shade on the other Chief Liars, Sean Spicer, Anthony Scarramucci, Sarah Sanders. @SarahSanders9 @Scaramucci @seanspicer
1325467872492019712 2020-11-08 23:59:01 +0800 <delantz> If you want the truth, start by telling it. Nothing you have said about Trump is true. Your false statements attest to your delusional state. I am more inclined to think that you are, indeed, just like him a Liar.
1325295138889846790 2020-11-08 12:32:38 +0800 <delantz> @michaelharriot It's official then.

1324493109644832769 2020-11-06 07:25:39 +0800 <delantz> @ybarrap Trump's campaign manager. Almost the majority of voters wanted Trump and his criminal cronies to remain in power. Dear world, please pray for America. Even if Trump loses in the not sure we will overcome the power of evil.

1324487940072853504 2020-11-06 07:05:07 +0800 <delantz> @jelani9 Yes it is disgusting and terrifying. At least we can't deny, any more, that 40%+ Americans hard straight up racists. The rest of white people are trying to understand, at long last, what is privilege, systemic racism, and unconscious bias. The alternative gives no hope.

1324421150873546753 2020-11-06 02:39:43 +0800 <delantz> @donwinslow Unfortunately, almost half of us are deplorable racists like Trump. That is the point. Time to face reality. Our vision of ourselves is massively distorted.
1324420242211155970 2020-11-06 02:36:06 +0800 <delantz> @GeigerNews Is it even possible? I think there is a genetic flaw in 40% of the population. I am not seeing hope. I'm disgusted.

1324172623958269952 2020-11-05 10:12:10 +0800 <delantz> @waltshaub Positively and absolutely. Almost half of the electorate are straight up racists. These people are NOT voting against their own self interest. They are voting according to their bias.
1324171067661824000 2020-11-05 10:05:59 +0800 <delantz> @Sigmundine2 Not all white women voted for him. None of my family or friends voted GOP. It is inexplicable to me. Thank God for black women and other women of color have saved our asses.
1324168019556265985 2020-11-05 09:53:52 +0800 <delantz> @a_fly_guy_no Sadly, they won't let Americans in at the moment... Since April. The border is closed.
1324166993323282434 2020-11-05 09:49:47 +0800 <delantz> @jelani9 No shit!
1324165980386332672 2020-11-05 09:45:46 +0800 <delantz> @jemelehill Exactly!
1324163896710623233 2020-11-05 09:37:29 +0800 <delantz> @ElieNYC Hear! Hear!
1324162629837860865 2020-11-05 09:32:27 +0800 <delantz> @waltshaub Too late. He stripped it of all decency.
1324162340250529792 2020-11-05 09:31:18 +0800 <delantz> @drdave1999 That is the question. There at 66 million indecent people that have voted for against decency.
1324161879174868993 2020-11-05 09:29:28 +0800 <delantz> @StevenBeschloss So, so very disturbing. I read an interview of a Democrat that voted for Trump in 2016 and said he was voting again for Trump because he like what Trump has done. No words.
1323730270827147264 2020-11-04 04:54:24 +0800 <delantz> @ElieNYC You are so polite!?
1323719296401338369 2020-11-04 04:10:48 +0800 <delantz> @thehill Remember, she is the present Chief Liar for The Liar-In-Chief.
1323718817948684288 2020-11-04 04:08:54 +0800 <delantz> @a_fly_guy_no @AnandWrites Thank you, Lars. Unfortunately, about 40% of Americans are racists bullies. Sadly, that is what the election of Trump has taught us. That is the devasting truth with which we must live.
1323717248826011648 2020-11-04 04:02:40 +0800 <delantz> @drdave1999 Yes, exactly that.
1323717031242260481 2020-11-04 04:01:48 +0800 <delantz> @ElieNYC ‚ù§Ô∏è
1323712658323877888 2020-11-04 03:44:25 +0800 <delantz> @waltshaub Really?
1323698929775489024 2020-11-04 02:49:52 +0800 <delantz> Just reasd a Democrat interviewed post voting 5oday in PA. He said he was voting for Trump again, as in 2016, because he likes what Trump has done. Maybe everyone shouldn't have a right vote. We need a test for critical thinking. And a lot more education on systemic racism.
1323697913663377409 2020-11-04 02:45:50 +0800 <delantz> @RabbiJill That it is.
1323695354638815234 2020-11-04 02:35:40 +0800 <delantz> @RabbiJill Thank you for the clarification. I'm very short on Yiddish.
1323682452783521797 2020-11-04 01:44:24 +0800 <delantz> @RabbiJill For those of us that don't know Yiddish: To be a¬†shanda¬†for the goyim is to confirm the most hurtful stereotypes,thereby doing damage twice: a Jew who dishonors Jews by doing something bad that confirms the worst fears of others about Jews in general
1323672545174806529 2020-11-04 01:05:02 +0800 <delantz> @ElieNYC Yeah!
1323671717437337601 2020-11-04 01:01:44 +0800 <delantz> @Sigmundine2 When has logic been a consideration with Trump? Why don't we see him as he is? Naked and afraid. Now that is logical.
1323658297795252224 2020-11-04 00:08:25 +0800 <delantz> @Tazerface16 @tromboneguywpg AMEN!
1323655436571086850 2020-11-03 23:57:03 +0800 <delantz> @tribelaw And you all thought he was stupid.
1323654823640662016 2020-11-03 23:54:36 +0800 <delantz> Well, maybe he is not as stupid as I thought. Imagine that, everyone gets a vote in the Democrat's America. It's the Republicans that only want their supporters to vote.
1323653675990970368 2020-11-03 23:50:03 +0800 <delantz> Thank you.

1323456124826210307 2020-11-03 10:45:03 +0800 <delantz> How conveniently timed. As in it is about bloody time. Dr Birx as been too little too late from the get. I hope Biden fires her.

1314185892433592322 2020-10-08 20:48:27 +0800 <delantz> The question is how many will he expose before he does.

The American people were not intelligibly enlighted by the last debate. It was excruciating to watch and exposed so many to the virus. All debates during the pandemic should be virtual.

1314115019282345984 2020-10-08 16:06:50 +0800 <delantz> Yes, the religious piety, he has that over Trump. Trump just lies with impunity. I think Pence is creepier and evil.

1314109659448393729 2020-10-08 15:45:32 +0800 <delantz> No more in person debates. Remote only.
1314104322066530304 2020-10-08 15:24:19 +0800 <delantz> She was obsequious to Pence and did it keep him to the rules. He lied and she never called him on anything letting keep talking and not giving Kamala equal time. We expect this shit from men, when women do it is pretty maddening.
1314103210299121664 2020-10-08 15:19:54 +0800 <delantz> The entire townhall should be remote.

Trump, through his criminal negligence, who is responsible for 1000s of needless deaths because he did not implement a national plan and in force the Defense Act to manufacture all the PPE, supplies, and Travlcing &amp; Tracking.
1314071911106703360 2020-10-08 13:15:32 +0800 <delantz> Pence asked the question. She shouldn't have even tried to answer it. WTH is McConnell doing these last 4 years and what did he do in 2016 with Garland nomination. Seriously Andrea, what do you mean? Next you are going to go at Hilliary Clinton. Get some rest.

1314070262384521217 2020-10-08 13:08:59 +0800 <delantz> @JillWineBanks And @SusanPage is responsible. She was obsequious to Pence.
1314069861287387137 2020-10-08 13:07:23 +0800 <delantz> @neal_katyal @KamalaHarris Certainly not a success for Susan Page. She obsequious with smarmy Pence. She did not hold him to the rules. He drowned on after his time and interrupted. Misogyny from men is tough to take. Really hard coming from another women. Kamala carried the weight of history abley.
1314067886386769922 2020-10-08 12:59:32 +0800 <delantz> She totally failed. She was not even in her treatment of the candidates. She obsequious with smarmy Pence. Made my skin crawl. @SusanPage @KamalaHarris

1314029151385346053 2020-10-08 10:25:37 +0800 <delantz> Exactly! Why is she risking her health with I person debate to start. Democrats need to grow some and insist on remote debates. And WTH, Susan Page? Can't they find a Democrat to moderate one debate. And no misogynist, make or female. Nothing we can do about Pence on that score.
1314028075995205635 2020-10-08 10:21:21 +0800 <delantz> @MalcolmNance Or he has COVID-19.

You cut Kamala off and she stopped. He even harassed her. Really difficult to see misogyny perpetuated by a women. Turn in your women card.
1314025794016960512 2020-10-08 10:12:17 +0800 <delantz> @FriendEden100 JMJ! He is responsible, due to his negligence for 1000s of needless deaths and you are worried about him setting an example on mask wearing. People can wear masks if the want to live or not. He is killing people because he did not initiate a national pandemic response &amp; PPE
1314024686389321728 2020-10-08 10:07:53 +0800 <delantz> Big mistake, Ari. He lied like a rug continuously and you did not call him on it. If is a quandary why hosts have Trump surrogates on their shows. Since few hosts call them on their lies it is so very upsetting for your usual viewers. Do not think people don't notice, they do.

1301773336846852101 2020-09-04 14:45:23 +0800 <delantz> @itsJeffTiedrich Our kind
1301772870012395521 2020-09-04 14:43:32 +0800 <delantz> Those words were felonious. Barr does not have "immunity" so why hasn't he been arrested?

1301765477979451392 2020-09-04 14:14:10 +0800 <delantz> That will never do.
1301764389930897409 2020-09-04 14:09:50 +0800 <delantz> He is culpable and complicit.
1301760349872422912 2020-09-04 13:53:47 +0800 <delantz> @kimhurdman @davidfrum Racists or morons, mostly both.
1301757321660436483 2020-09-04 13:41:45 +0800 <delantz> He's on tape.
1301756794105032704 2020-09-04 13:39:39 +0800 <delantz> The Chief Liar for The Liar-In-Chief. Just like Sean Spicer, Scarramucci, &amp; the current one. They are complicit &amp;  culpable. Scarramucci has the nerve to have resurfaced on Twitter &amp; @msnbc @JoyAnnReid like his shit doesn't stink. For 10 days yelled louder &amp; faster then the rest.

1301659428282748929 2020-09-04 07:12:46 +0800 <delantz> So did Bill Barr. Why hasn't he been arrested?
1301658676751527936 2020-09-04 07:09:46 +0800 <delantz> The media seems to be have forgotten this and only mention shot of paintball shooters. Oops.  https://t.co/ErCdhphyAA

1301540885503516672 2020-09-03 23:21:43 +0800 <delantz> Trump he will de fund Medicare and Social Security and people over 65 yrs need to hear that loud and clear.
1301439372932210688 2020-09-03 16:38:20 +0800 <delantz> Washington State has voted by mail for 20 years. This is all BS.
1301438008529281024 2020-09-03 16:32:55 +0800 <delantz> Trump voters in jail for voter fraud? Don't tease the me.
1301437382693023745 2020-09-03 16:30:26 +0800 <delantz> And eliminating Social Security Medicare, and Medicare. Wake up America. Instead going on and on about soup cans the media cover this. @maddow @JoyAnnReid @Lawrence @TheBeatWithAri

1301371121992740864 2020-09-03 12:07:08 +0800 <delantz> @BarbMcQuade He is political hack that committed a felony today urging Trump voters to commit voter fraud by urging them to vote twice, a felony.

1301368285607337984 2020-09-03 11:55:52 +0800 <delantz> He also broke the law when suggested Trump supporter to commit a felony by voting twice. Indict and arrest him. That will keep him busy well passed the election.
1301335319862636544 2020-09-03 09:44:52 +0800 <delantz> Great if all Trump voters go to jail and are felons.
1301333788513849344 2020-09-03 09:38:47 +0800 <delantz> And bears don't necessarily shit in the woods.
1301333075087880193 2020-09-03 09:35:57 +0800 <delantz> Bill Barr committed that felony as well. Arrest him.
1301332738985738240 2020-09-03 09:34:37 +0800 <delantz> Bill Barr suggested the people should vote twice, once by mail and once in person. That is a felony and he can be indicted. He has committed a felony. Who has cajones to do their job.
1301332161908232197 2020-09-03 09:32:19 +0800 <delantz> @maddow @JoyAnnReid @msnbc I hope all the Trump voters vote twice. They will all go to jail for the felony.
1301328394148147200 2020-09-03 09:17:21 +0800 <delantz> Encouraging voter fraud. They will do anything to re-elect Trump
1301328009605992448 2020-09-03 09:15:49 +0800 <delantz> Stunningly beautiful.
1301327234171465728 2020-09-03 09:12:44 +0800 <delantz> When the US courts finishes with Trump I hope the World Court will take over

1301139022157238272 2020-09-02 20:44:51 +0800 <delantz> Why should he? You didn't save yourself from the humiliation of being the Chief Liar for the Liar-In-Chief? You have no shame.
