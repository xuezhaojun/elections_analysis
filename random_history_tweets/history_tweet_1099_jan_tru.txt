Or, does the virus get confused when you chase after people who are not wearing one — and then rant and rave like a complete idiot in your bad outfit in winter?

1332770524376698880 2020-11-29 03:37:09 +0800 <jan_tru> @Hoosiers1986 IMHO, as an ex-Catholic, now a Jew — not throwing shade. After Pope Benedict it all kinda went down hill. Therefore, I would say; tune into your higher self (your conscience) and accept this imposter Pope for what he is and what he’s NOT. That’s where you’ll find the answer.

It makes them feel good to follow orders from superiors — be hateful, violent &amp; live in constant fear. They’re contented then &amp; only then. Oh, also when they FRAUDULENTLY elect a #PlagiaristPervert

1328544017450106880 2020-11-17 11:42:31 +0800 <jan_tru> @ThomasSowell @Brought_UpRight I personally, could get no further than his voting record — on abortion, as a junior senator in IL. That speaks volumes about a young man’s character — the lengths they will go &amp; depravity they’ll succumb to, for power.   Sadly, however, he’s not the first — he won’t be the last.
1328510364439330816 2020-11-17 09:28:48 +0800 <jan_tru> @IlhanMN We realize lying &amp; deceiving the whole country is okay w/you — but lying to yourself now is too?   That’s really sad...  You’re as big of a FRAUD as #CorruptJoe &amp; your entire party of #DesperadoDems.   Being part of the #OverachieverCheaters club, does in NO WAY make you legit.

1328393436760662017 2020-11-17 01:44:10 +0800 <jan_tru> Exactly! The Left’s credibility is completely INCONSEQUENTIAL.   #WeThePeople have enough intelligence to make our own choices — &amp; maturity to accept responsibility for whatever comes.   As a high risk senior, I’d rather see my children &amp; country survive. I will NOT live in fear!
1328185657622102017 2020-11-16 11:58:31 +0800 <jan_tru> @realTrumpForce Didn’t listen — NOT even ONCE when he was President, and have absolutely ZERO interest to listen to him now . . . #BOforPrison #OverachieverCheaters #VoterFraud
1328184417831903237 2020-11-16 11:53:36 +0800 <jan_tru> In a nutshell; how little confidence did #DesperadoDemocrats really have in @JoeBiden, that when they decided to “OVER-CHEAT” they:  1. risked their parties dignity &amp; future?  2. Put their darling, “Standard Bearer” BO to shame?  3. Accepted — that some will be heading to prison?  https://t.co/D4JgjXfH3R

It’s all about fake science and unleashing a virus to steal an election. Shutdowns don’t save lives you idiot, it destroys; purpose, livelihood &amp; will.

HE’S the cornered cat and they all need @realDonaldTrump out before he exposes every last one of them! I’d suggest you all start utilizing other news sources “besides” CNN.

Got news for @cindymccain, the people who voted for @realDonaldTrump in 2016, shortly after her husbands transitioning, haven’t changed their minds.
1326390928752463876 2020-11-11 13:06:55 +0800 <jan_tru> @catturd2 Personally, I think his show was important. However, he did seem somewhat subdued or perhaps, “simmering.” I haven’t watched Fox on a regular basis for years (2016) but I do watch @TuckerCarlson on IG. After the election I cx’d the FoxNation app, and went w/@newsmax instead.

The dwindling handful of you left @FoxNews, not under the control of the leftists, are getting harder and harder to define. #NoTrustLeft
1324874845683806208 2020-11-07 08:42:32 +0800 <jan_tru> I believe, even honest Dems may be completely disgusted. Nothing feels worse, than to take a prize you didn’t win fair &amp; square. It sits not just on your conscience, but your soul forever. Well . . . perhaps w/the exception of ole #PlagiarizingJoe, he only feels bad when caught.

1323911112274960384 2020-11-04 16:53:00 +0800 <jan_tru> @AOC Omg, I’ve heard it all. Do us all a favor &amp; just STFU you self-important little ass.   Learn when to speak &amp; when to be silent.   He’s won, and your diatribe here, will come back to bite you in the ass.   Keep in mind too; he, unlike you, actually EARNS every vote — honestly!

1323888631333810176 2020-11-04 15:23:41 +0800 <jan_tru> @dougducey Governor, where were the voting machines to insert your ballots (Coconino County)?  Is this the new norm, because it felt real sketchy to slide a ballot through a slot in a green metal box, sitting on a chair.   Not secure at all . . .   Something seriously STINKS!
1323845769904844800 2020-11-04 12:33:22 +0800 <jan_tru> They need to really check and then double check Arizona. Something didn’t feel right. There were no voting machines to insert your ballots. Only a green metal box with a slot to slide them in. Seemed very shady to me, and I’d never previously delivered my ballot like this before.
1323805722459607043 2020-11-04 09:54:14 +0800 <jan_tru> @catturd2 @newsmax is doing a GREAT job! Except for the occasional stream loss. #TrumpPenceLandslide2020

1323111134954618881 2020-11-02 11:54:11 +0800 <jan_tru> @conservmillen Nurture, IMO, was never meant to be an ideology. It’s a word wholly unique unto itself. As in; caring, raising, cultivating, cherishing, loving.   Human or animal we can see the, nurturing phenomena.   “Nature” on the other hand, can have many connotations — for good &amp; for evil.
1323103322937593856 2020-11-02 11:23:08 +0800 <jan_tru> @NormFThomas @ericcervini Funny, I always feel the same — minus the desire to “eliminate en masse” your party. Which pardon me, I affectionately call the; #DumbedDownDems ☺️ However, I must say, it’s quite frightening to know there are possibly more out there, as sinister &amp; slimy as you &amp; #CorruptJoe!
1323096713817587713 2020-11-02 10:56:53 +0800 <jan_tru> Democrats, the party of peace &amp; acceptance . . . 🙄
1323095049572294656 2020-11-02 10:50:16 +0800 <jan_tru> @RNCResearch I just love her southern accent all rehearsed and ready to completely patronize the voters of Fayetteville. Amazing isn’t it — for a little, “Black” girl born in Oakland CA, who spent most of her time in San Francisco? 🙄 #DemocratsThePartyOfPhonys
1323089678333960192 2020-11-02 10:28:55 +0800 <jan_tru> @BamaCardsPack May her memory be for a blessing . . . 🤗💚
1323045277570265088 2020-11-02 07:32:29 +0800 <jan_tru> Watch!
1323008426130042881 2020-11-02 05:06:03 +0800 <jan_tru> So very BEAUTIFUL! Makes me think of my ancestors. To stop and honor them. To remember their work ethic &amp; many sacrifices. Mostly master carpenters &amp; beautiful homemakers who loved &amp; cherished their children. But all of us, working together, we’ve accomplished miraculous things!
1323004459732004864 2020-11-02 04:50:18 +0800 <jan_tru> At the end of the day; after the politicians have shouted their thoughts &amp; spilled their spiel — there’s only ONE, truly CONSEQUENTIAL reason for you to vote @realDonaldTrump.  And that reason is... LIFE!  Our HUMANITY, our continued EXISTENCE, depends upon it! #ProtectTheUnborn  https://t.co/DlxtlGnt5P
1322952674271064064 2020-11-02 01:24:31 +0800 <jan_tru> @JoeBiden You do realize any votes cast for you, after all we know —  1). That you sold your country out to “Chi-Nah,”  2.) Enriched your family, including your mentally ill son;  that they will only be: “SAVE FACE” votes? NO ONE w/a conscience, unless SICK as you Joe, could do otherwise.
1322796020242132992 2020-11-01 15:02:02 +0800 <jan_tru> @JackPosobiec Whoa, now that could be a YUGE game changer . . .  🤔
1322611354797105152 2020-11-01 02:48:14 +0800 <jan_tru> She just looks for things to sensationalize. And of course, this is far more important than the content of the debates themselves. 🙄 Obviously, @WhoopiGoldberg would prefer you judge Tucker &amp; Fox unfairly, rather than look too closely at #CorruptJoeBiden’s piss poor performance.
1322084487396683777 2020-10-30 15:54:39 +0800 <jan_tru> @intheMatrixxx @TerisaRivera3 Looks like his dentures popped out, they were mortified — and cut the feed. Let’s face it, the guys held together with superglue! 😳 #CorruptBidenFamily #Bobulinksi  https://t.co/3wDkH8IzsO
1322010435118231552 2020-10-30 11:00:24 +0800 <jan_tru> @pghowie3 @jstines3 Very concerning that she said she knows her son, and yet, she also says, “he did nothing wrong.” Does she consider what he’s done to be right? If so, she’s seriously got her head screwed on backwards — and it’s not a wonder Hunter’s so lost... #BidenFamilyCorruption #Bobulinski
1322007897820209152 2020-10-30 10:50:19 +0800 <jan_tru> @KamalaHarris This is what you should encourage the #BigGuy to do. It’s not funny anymore Ms. Cackle, this is the future of our country &amp; we deserve — and I’m including democrats, better than you &amp; #CorruptJoe! Do something right for the first time in your rotten life. #Karma_Kamala_Is_4Real!
1321979073837457408 2020-10-30 08:55:47 +0800 <jan_tru> @gaye_gallops Twitter is censoring this post now. It disappeared as soon as I played it and is blank afterwards . . . #BidenCorruption #Bobulinski #PervertJoeHasGot2Go
1321960259158638592 2020-10-30 07:41:01 +0800 <jan_tru> @DrBiden Don’t worry I intend to. But it won’t be for your sick, perverted husband.   Clearly you have no shame. If you did, you’d spend time in meditation — enlightening yourself to see that your efforts would be better spent attempting to heal your family, instead of profiting from it.
1321944246367125504 2020-10-30 06:37:23 +0800 <jan_tru> @QueueAmom @Xmllsos7X Wow, she’s one sick puppy! She needs to be off the air, she’s went @KeithOlbermann on us . . . #Certifiable #AsylumIsCallingHerName
1321943317542703105 2020-10-30 06:33:42 +0800 <jan_tru> Wow, he can’t even talk straight on the norm, and now he’s really having difficulty. This is LIE DETECTOR material right there. Looked like, scaredy @Jack at the hearings yesterday — blink, blinkity, blink, blink 🤥 . . .  https://t.co/hspfEZ1DQt
1321939659438530560 2020-10-30 06:19:09 +0800 <jan_tru> @Bill_Weimer_ @DrBiden @KamalaHarris Ewww, she’s disgusting! They’re all despicable! #Bobulinski #KamalaLovesRiots #BidenCrimeFamiily
1321916301099495424 2020-10-30 04:46:20 +0800 <jan_tru> @HTodd01 @Italia191 It may’ve been a way for her to make restitution for being such a pivotal voice in the Pro-Choice movement.   She was too smart not to take BO’s “hint.” His, “audacity”probably pissed her off.   So, perhaps she thought... let the chips fall where they may!  I say, #GoodJobRBG! 😉
1321872047102849024 2020-10-30 01:50:29 +0800 <jan_tru> @FoxNews And that’s suppose to matter — why? 🙄
1321870918306549761 2020-10-30 01:46:00 +0800 <jan_tru> This is exactly what the #DementedDems don’t want you to see.   Their plan, their narrative, after they unleashed this virus, coordinated w/“CHINA,” when the fake impeachment failed, MUST stay ACTIVE at any cost — TRUTH BE DAMNED, until Nov 4th!   Don’t believe? #YouAreASheeple!
1321835843393187841 2020-10-29 23:26:38 +0800 <jan_tru> @thebradfordfile Let’s cut “scaredy @Jack” some slack.   It’s just too heavy of a burden for him to bear...  Carrying the; weight, expectations and responsibility of being fair &amp; honest — on top of those BIG wide shoulders, scares him literally almost speechless.   #ItWillBeOKJack 😢 #Bobulinski
1321830844063834112 2020-10-29 23:06:46 +0800 <jan_tru> I think the homeless guy may be one of my long lost relatives — possibly from a past lifetime. That vacant, clueless look, seems familiar somehow . . . 🤔
1321690025826807808 2020-10-29 13:47:12 +0800 <jan_tru> @KamalaHarris You PO💩! Your party brought this virus to us, a gift from CHINA during the fake impeachment, to distract &amp; win an election.   You orchestrated the: riots, incitement, mask nazis, the economies fall — and now, predictably you’re blaming @realDonaldTrump  But, exposure awaits you!
1321597689092468736 2020-10-29 07:40:17 +0800 <jan_tru> Remarkable!
1321542761246384128 2020-10-29 04:02:02 +0800 <jan_tru> Wow, sooooo very true . . .
1321413948327931906 2020-10-28 19:30:10 +0800 <jan_tru> Word!
1321408958456688640 2020-10-28 19:10:20 +0800 <jan_tru> Yes, where are you, AG Barr @TheJusticeDept?!?
1321293518959185922 2020-10-28 11:31:38 +0800 <jan_tru> @dbongino Exactly. . . 👇🏻
1321290926715752456 2020-10-28 11:21:19 +0800 <jan_tru> @JoeBiden Have the decency in your disgraceful 11th hour, and CONCEDE &amp; WITHDRAW from this race!!   You’re making fools out of the American People! Haven’t you done enough?  #Bobulinski #ConcedeCorruptJoe
1321287218250567681 2020-10-28 11:06:35 +0800 <jan_tru> If you vote for @JoeBiden, instead of repeatedly asking on every social media outlet you subscribe, for him to have the decency to #ConcedeJoe; and I’m talking every: Republican, Democrat &amp; Independent — then, “YOU CANNOT, LOVE THIS COUNTRY!” This is #TREASON plain &amp; simple!
1321238792104112128 2020-10-28 07:54:10 +0800 <jan_tru> See this👇🏻!!!
1321235741972676609 2020-10-28 07:42:02 +0800 <jan_tru> Heartbreaking . . .
1321118366161989633 2020-10-27 23:55:38 +0800 <jan_tru> @BrandonStraka Are the #DumbedDownDemocrats so far in denial they don’t realize #CorruptJoe’s desperate wife is literally carrying the campaign? They can’t trust him to speak coherently longer than 2 minutes. The sign just indicates — that everything’s falling apart! #AbolishTheDemocraticParty
1320924425840062466 2020-10-27 11:04:59 +0800 <jan_tru> @IlhanMN I wonder, if you’ll be able to do that from prison? 🤔
1320916993764016129 2020-10-27 10:35:27 +0800 <jan_tru> A nightmare scenario . . .
1320914095739002881 2020-10-27 10:23:56 +0800 <jan_tru> @ACTBrigitte She actually has an IQ that registers? Sadly, she doesn’t have an ounce of common sense either — it’s downright pathetic . . . #PoorDimwitMazie
1320856516803477510 2020-10-27 06:35:08 +0800 <jan_tru> @benjaminokeefe If we needed proof that #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder you’ve just provided it in spades.   Perhaps there will be civil war. If so, you can thank the leftists for it ALL!  #1-you couldn’t accept OUR choice for #POTUS, as we did w/44.   Simple. You’re spoiled rotten brats! #Tantrums

1320778521652776960 2020-10-27 01:25:13 +0800 <jan_tru> I don’t care either! In fact, I LOVE IT! No more, “Slicksters” staring in the camera, spouting their phony BS — we’re wayyy over that now. #TrumpKeepsItREAL! #TrumpPence2020LANDSLIDE
1320775666351046657 2020-10-27 01:13:52 +0800 <jan_tru> @TimeforTruth16 We’re sick to our stomach to look at your putrid face every few weeks @HillaryClinton, whenever you decide to crawl out from under your rock.   And, you don’t fool us — those bags under your eyes are telltale signs of your last drunk . . . #GoDrinkYourSorrowsAway #Killary4Prison  https://t.co/08yBtm3mLO
1320753930951741444 2020-10-26 23:47:30 +0800 <jan_tru> @HillaryClinton Anyone, who would listen to a word coming from your mouth, needs their head examined.   YOUR corrupt party planned &amp; facilitated the release of this VIRUS, w/the help of, “CHINA” on an unsuspecting public!   FU and your phony, righteous indignation. Go crawl back under your rock!  https://t.co/fS3Ssfk9k5

1320596148281720832 2020-10-26 13:20:31 +0800 <jan_tru> @TrumpWarRoom @kelcrw4 Do they get anymore unlikable than this cackling phony? Between the two; @JoeBiden &amp; @KamalaHarris, it’s simply the most cringeworthy pairing in the history of politics. I mean, seriously gross . . .  https://t.co/DKbS7X8Mir
1320591589467537408 2020-10-26 13:02:24 +0800 <jan_tru> @Chris_1791 @FoxNews That’s fine. Thrilled I followed my instincts &amp; never contributed a dime to her campaign. Furthermore, I believe @SenatorCollins constituents, will be, “fair &amp; consistent” w/her as well. She forgets she works for the people of Maine. It’s #NotAboutHer, it’s about what they want.
1320542787687727106 2020-10-26 09:48:29 +0800 <jan_tru> Beautiful!
1320516404316041216 2020-10-26 08:03:39 +0800 <jan_tru> @MomJar1 They told: #CorruptJoe, #BO44 #PellosiThePillager, #KrazyKamala #ItsAMythNadler, #ChucklesSchumer #PencilNeckSchiff and the list goes on and on! They knew, exactly, as they’re now accusing our @POTUS, wayyy ahead! It’s another FAILED plan &amp; hoax just like — #RussiaRussiaRussia...
1320472835278606336 2020-10-26 05:10:31 +0800 <jan_tru> Perhaps . . . he’s conceding! 🤔 #AboutTime #Throw_In_The_Towel_BigGuy!

But, does CHINA see a big @realDonaldTrump WIN, so they’re doing some serious CYA stuff right now?   Perhaps playing the victim card?  Perhaps letting #CrookedJoe know they’ll be calling in their notes?   #WhatGoesAround
1320397617956745216 2020-10-26 00:11:38 +0800 <jan_tru> @C0nservativeGal @realDonaldTrump Couldn’t imagine doing it any other way. And, I’m going to observe everything they do with the ballots, as I live in a very liberal city. I’ve ZERO trust left! #TrumpPence2020LANDSLIDE
1320393991326556160 2020-10-25 23:57:13 +0800 <jan_tru> Biggest BULLSHIT Cover-Up yet! #DOJ_WeeniesPersonified! Quit passing the buck!

The FBI, CIA &amp; the DOJ sold us out — assisted &amp; turned their backs when they tried to remove OUR @POTUS. We won’t soon forget! #Our_Memories_Are_Long . . .
1320191005459509248 2020-10-25 10:30:38 +0800 <jan_tru> I’m sure someone with an IQ on the radar is very difficult for you to handle #CorruptJoe . . . #PitifulDumbLyingPervertedJoe #DumbedDownJoe
1320172665307422720 2020-10-25 09:17:45 +0800 <jan_tru> @HeyTammyBruce @trustrestored They feel so entitled, because of their two-bit status with all the other #LeftistIgnoramuses, that they believe 💯 that they can w/absolutely no repercussions.   This is real RACISM — and it’s putrid to watch.
1320169703214477313 2020-10-25 09:05:59 +0800 <jan_tru> @ShawnG927 @pinkk9lover @YourBot_2020 @smalltownandrew @ZyroFoxtrot @VFL2013 @RoseDC11 @buzzman888 @ROCKONOHIO @Harleyluv @TrumpTalk1 That was about the phoniest statement I’ve ever heard. Straight out of the #DesperateDementedDemocratic 11th hour playbook. Every election cycle they bring out what they believe are their, “Big Guns.” Which are just these flaky Hollywood weirdos we couldn’t give a shit about. 🙄
1320168311456329729 2020-10-25 09:00:27 +0800 <jan_tru> Prayers for her and peace for you . . . 🙏❤️ ✌🏻

Do some research besides watching CNN. He was a private citizen &amp; businessman before becoming @POTUS. It’s okay for him to do that. #CorruptJoe was a sitting VP and NOT OKAY. Learn the difference!
1320140294226997248 2020-10-25 07:09:07 +0800 <jan_tru> @RideWithC4T @realTT2020 @SenCandelaria @jared_udall @HillaryClinton Amazing, “33” seems to be the magic number from all over the country. I stopped believing, knew it was all political, right before the 2nd shutdown &amp; extension. The #DementedDems had a well laid plan, and I have no doubt now, they unleashed the virus on an unsuspecting public.

1320130813099266048 2020-10-25 06:31:27 +0800 <jan_tru> Boy, it’s really true, a clock is right at least once a day — and #CorruptJoe, amazingly enough, is finally telling “a” truth!
1320127792822972416 2020-10-25 06:19:27 +0800 <jan_tru> @liquidlaugh I’m sure they themselves &amp; their families have been threatened. Prob had to make choices.

And all for some old, perverted #CorruptJoe who’s not even worth your effort or loyalty. It’s really sad and I’m 💯 serious! You’re all going to look like fools Nov 4th. #DumbedDownDems  https://t.co/umHGCPS0GY
1319688352954605569 2020-10-24 01:13:16 +0800 <jan_tru> Oh well, c’mon #CorruptJoe, the jig is up — time to throw in the towel!
1319686081692889089 2020-10-24 01:04:15 +0800 <jan_tru> I Believe!!!
1319650044606214147 2020-10-23 22:41:03 +0800 <jan_tru> Scary times to think this, “Big Guy” is the best the #DumbedDownDemocrats have to offer — P.I.T.I.F.U.L #CrookedJoe
1319490166268911616 2020-10-23 12:05:45 +0800 <jan_tru> @RealJamesWoods You know, it’s kinda like the old saying, “The bigger they are, the harder they fall.” And that, #BigGuy — fell really hard tonight. #ThrowInTheTowelJoe #Embarrassed4You
1319486858984747008 2020-10-23 11:52:36 +0800 <jan_tru> @BernardKerik Yep!
1319486470223097856 2020-10-23 11:51:04 +0800 <jan_tru> @sherrylynne60 Text my daughter during and said the exact same thing. He was so rehearsed it was unnatural. But, even still, it didn’t help the, “#BigGuy” not even one little bit.
1319483356808032258 2020-10-23 11:38:41 +0800 <jan_tru> Poor @JoeBiden barely held himself in tact. The frozen moments &amp; stumbling’s, were uncomfortable to watch. And what’s w/that bionic right eye? I can’t stand anything about his politics/corruption, but this is getting sadistic now. The #DementedDems need to . . . #PullThePlug
1319480874002333696 2020-10-23 11:28:49 +0800 <jan_tru> For real!
1319472794048970754 2020-10-23 10:56:43 +0800 <jan_tru> @ACTBrigitte Definitely! I actually enjoyed it. But #JoeBriben needs to let it go now. He barely held it together.
1319471813454295040 2020-10-23 10:52:49 +0800 <jan_tru> IMO, this moderator, despite her left leanings we’ve heard so much about, did not let that rule the night. She did the best job of the 3 debates. I actually enjoyed it &amp; had a few laughs.   But Joe, oh @JoeBiden, it’s time to throw in the towel &amp; spare yourself the humiliation.
1319418828963524611 2020-10-23 07:22:17 +0800 <jan_tru> @donnabrazile How many Republican moderators has #JoeBriben had to face Donna? You sound like an ignoramus — on top of a partisan hack! #Get_Out_Of_Denial #AbolishTheDemocraticParty #TrumpPence2020LANDSLIDE

But, if they did manage, and I’m still here &amp; not actively planning escape — I would definitely support impeachment.   Although, if he gets in, they’ll steal everything else too, so what good would impeachment do?
1318636134738522112 2020-10-21 03:32:08 +0800 <jan_tru> @washingtonpost Social media will keep on keeping on, w/the illegal censoring, until they run out the clock. The hearings will most likely be postponed repeatedly until after the election. They’re counting on the fact that nobody will give a crap, one way or another — by then. #BigTechWeenies

You should be ashamed to even sensationalize this. That’s NOT your job! Hunter is certainly more newsworthy than @realDonaldTrump’s taxes, you all so hastily report. 🙄

1318165596966584321 2020-10-19 20:22:23 +0800 <jan_tru> @WanderlustGalli Little girl; my oldest daughter is, what I refer to, on a regular base, a “#DementedDem.” Yet, I adore everything about her w/the EXCEPTION of her politics. You’d best buck up, or you’re going to be in a world of hurt, if you believe you can go through life w/everyone in sync.

1318157026288037889 2020-10-19 19:48:19 +0800 <jan_tru> @JoeBiden The sum of your usual earthshaking enlightenment to the country.  But, right now?   I’ve known you were pathetic, yet never realized, until this tweet, how intellectually challenged your followers are.   Seems they can only comprehend 3/4 word sentences from you at a time. 🤔

1317647979222740993 2020-10-18 10:05:33 +0800 <jan_tru> Radical mask enforcement, is the precursor — the “grooming process” &amp; indoctrination for the #LunaticLeftists ultimate goals.

1317554576912912384 2020-10-18 03:54:24 +0800 <jan_tru> I don’t feel sorry for Republicans — we’re tough. I feel sorry for Democrats.   Those who have lost; their minds, principals, morals &amp; their balls.   To even consider casting a vote for @JoeBiden, w/all we now know, is — LUNACY!   But, if they’re that deep in denial? #ShameOnThem

1317506911797866498 2020-10-18 00:45:00 +0800 <jan_tru> It’s all clear, even for the non-political — for the everyday John &amp; Jane.   Folks w/just average intelligence fully comprehend WHY @JoeBiden HAD to run for President. Why #DementedDems nominated him no matter how feeble.  Cover evidence of TREASON &amp; PACIFY CHINA — #PayBackTime!

But, I fully agree on castration for: rapists, pedophiles — for deviants of any kind. They don’t deserve the privilege or rewards of having a child. Abortion has become birth control for imbecilic behaviors. #Sick

1317228801118515200 2020-10-17 06:19:53 +0800 <jan_tru> @RealJamesWoods He’d say anything for a vote! Even exploit an 8 yr-old child. But he’s accustomed to exploiting &amp; molesting children, is he not? However, I won’t blame it completely on #JoeBriben. Mom’s as dumb as a rock, for asking his demented opinion, about the life &amp; wellbeing of her child.
1317227156339118080 2020-10-17 06:13:21 +0800 <jan_tru> @ACTBrigitte Hunter! #WeenieWeiner’s father wasn’t the former VP, who is now running for President. This is a complete TRAVESTY!!

I’m darn sick of their authoritarian bullshit! When are we calling foul play &amp; taking our freedoms back?   We don’t need to answer to their idiocy and @realDonaldTrump needs to say so — NOW!
1317220655293636608 2020-10-17 05:47:31 +0800 <jan_tru> @JoeBiden Listen #JoeBriben, I went 2 years w/out insurance &amp; w/o seeing a doctor. I have an “incurable” chronic, debilitating disease.   Why? Because I couldn’t afford the O’care premiums — twice as high as my previous plan.   You don’t know ZIP about this subject, so why don’t you STFU?!

If we keep down this road, we’ll be playing right into the #DementedDemocrats hands. Mask police not enough?

1316287820885975040 2020-10-14 16:00:46 +0800 <jan_tru> @stillgray If there were anything #JoeBriben doesn’t need, it’s another mask inhibiting the oxygen flow to his brain.   We’ve all witnessed, for decades, that he’s unable to think or “speak” clearly without a mask.    So, ones a big problem — two is def double jeopardy . . .

1316175002031411202 2020-10-14 08:32:28 +0800 <jan_tru> @willchamberlain Some of the most educated people I’ve know in my 66 years of life, were dumber than rocks in reality. Not an ounce of common sense and ZERO practical skills. @maziehirono is the personification of all 3!

1316142334245969922 2020-10-14 06:22:39 +0800 <jan_tru> @JoeBiden You, just said that 56% of the ppl SHOULDN’T vote for you. I think you’re very bad at math.   Even if this number were accurate, (sure it’s much higher than that for @realDonaldTrump) it would still leave you out!  Now, study this simple equation . . .   1 + 1 = 2  Terms
1316131958838030336 2020-10-14 05:41:26 +0800 <jan_tru> @liquidlaugh I think Waters knows she’s dumb. She simply has the chutzpah to plow through regardless of how stupid she looks.   @maziehirono is literally the epitome of an ignoramus — w/a twist. Twist is; she believes she’s brilliant &amp; cunning. It’s unfortunate. She’s an embarrassment to HI.

But, an incentive to work hard, to be successful, is not a bad lesson to teach your children. Every single one of them, along w/ @realDonaldTrump are working SUPER hard for this country! Keep in mind, he takes ZERO $’s in salary. Try... #Gratitude
1315902822605488132 2020-10-13 14:30:55 +0800 <jan_tru> @Lrihendry This is exactly what validates, for me, the kind of man our #POTUS is. You can’t fake the love, admiration &amp; respect, clearly evident in every one of his children’s faces. No matter what he did as a prvt citizen — he definitely did something RIGHT w/his kids! #TrumpPence2020

Yet, you hold no such honor for the sanctity/wishes, perhaps dreams of a full-term baby’s life. You think that life is perfectly OK to silence. #SickSick

1315864791504699392 2020-10-13 11:59:48 +0800 <jan_tru> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden You mean the majority of the 10’s of people at your rallies?   Or maybe it’s the majority who support #JoeBriben, the one running for Senate?   Or maybe the majority of peeps who showed up in whatever state he thought he was in today?   You’re both pathetic! #IAmEmbarrassed4U
1315830644300111872 2020-10-13 09:44:07 +0800 <jan_tru> @paulsperry_ I think, the documents that came out last week are making a YUGE dif.

I’ve never felt so ashamed of our country and our representatives, who WORK FOR— #WeThePeople! A disgusting display of outright, blatant, in your face, racism! I seriously can’t fathom how the #DementedDems have even one constituent left, especially after Kavanaugh.

I’m sure it’s the least of her concerns on the other side.

1315740015771566081 2020-10-13 03:43:59 +0800 <jan_tru> @BerryAlex14 @realDonaldTrump Might want to research what Trump was really doing about that sick perv. I’ve heard several interesting theories.
1315739549742456832 2020-10-13 03:42:08 +0800 <jan_tru> @BerryAlex14 @realDonaldTrump No, I’ll apologize. I’m sorry I misjudged you. I get so many of these from trolls etc, but that’s not an excuse. Still, we’ll have to agree to disagree on Trump’s relationship w/his daughter. I see it through different eyes. 🤷🏼‍♀️
1315738675351674880 2020-10-13 03:38:40 +0800 <jan_tru> @BerryAlex14 @realDonaldTrump Taken out of context, you can make anything sound gross. He was bragging about his daughter. I tried to explain, as a victim; IF, there were anything abnormal, not a typical Father/Daughter situation, you would NEVER see that look of genuine love &amp; TRUST on Ivanka’s face.
1315735331040157696 2020-10-13 03:25:22 +0800 <jan_tru> @BerryAlex14 @realDonaldTrump You better look at my profile, Berry. The very LAST thing I’d do is defend a pedophile. But, if you want to find something more sinister, typical of the left, (why not #DegenerateBill’s photo w/Epstein) you will. We all know what @realDonaldTrump “REALLY” thought of that pervert.
1315713774158929920 2020-10-13 01:59:43 +0800 <jan_tru> Funny, how the #RacistDemocrats &amp; #FakeNews REFUSE to acknowledge, not only  #JoeBriben’s adoration of his mentor, Sen.

1314000793310126080 2020-10-08 08:32:56 +0800 <jan_tru> @dbongino @liquidlaugh My husband has 2 enlarged abdominal lymph nodes right now. They suspect lymphoma. So many delays scheduling biopsy due to Covid/short-staffed, but hopefully soon! All the best to you, your wife/children, who I know, like me, hold you close in their ❤️ &amp; in the highest of energy.
1313993821072453632 2020-10-08 08:05:14 +0800 <jan_tru> @RealJamesWoods My husband — gentlest man I know, was stationed in Germany during the Vietnam war. However, because of #HanoiJane’s activism, when he &amp; fellow troops arrived home, they were bombarded by protesters who spit, cursed &amp; called them, “Baby Killers.” He holds a grudge to this day.

I’m certain both have been exposed numerous times and I doubt either were diabolical enough to plan it. Nine Republicans have tested positive since — NO Democrat’s. So really, what’s that tell you? 🤔

His physician is a female from the Dept. of Veteran’s. He has had the finest of care under @realDonaldTrump! Better than he’s had in decades — especially under BO.   “Block” me or I will you, as your insincere cohort, Joyce has.

And, exactly why I had the opinion, instinctively, from the beginning.   You’re one sick puppy. Sad that any patient would need suffer under your care.   “Mostly just here because it’ll be the fastest way to learn of trumps demise.”

Btw, my husband, a Vet, has: CHF, A-Fib (had cardiac ablation) Hypertension &amp; most recent; enlarged abdominal lymph nodes.   Doubt seriously it’s in his head. His physician gladly provided a prescription for no mask.

Worked w/some of the finest docs in country. I’m not impressed w/your title, education or profession.   Many of these physicians were brilliant, but had the common sense of a rock — manners &amp; morals of a reprobate. #GetOverYourself

As I’ve repeatedly pointed out, you think everything “you” say must be fact! Listen, the studies I had, I couldn’t find!   Twitter removes &amp; suppresses many post regarding: masks, HCQ, preventatives!

I’m all done now, time to move on. But definitely keep your mask on.   You might even consider it while in your own home, driving in your car — even sleeping! That is, if you don’t or haven’t already.  All the best!

They scrub: hands, arms, wear gloves, gowns to prevent transmission of bacteria/germs to the patient. Never heard a doc say, put mask on to safeguard patient.

Nevertheless, you’re saying the same thing. I understand liberals believe everything in life hinges on a “study” but do consider practical/life experience too.
1312421979002077187 2020-10-03 23:59:18 +0800 <jan_tru> @poycer No, I need you to tell me because you’re an expert I guess. However, didn’t know the difference between an Optometrist (nothing wrong w/that profession) and an Ophthalmologist? Plenty of data out there — “studies” to disprove the, “mask myth.” But not if you’re drunk on Kool Aid.

Strange, I’m having difficulty coming up w/ the others. 🤔 However, when I find, I’ll post. My point is; certainly wear the mask if you REALLY think it saves you. If you’re happy I’m happy for you. You’re safe &amp; snug as a bug in a rug, from all my germs — right?
1312193491540217856 2020-10-03 08:51:22 +0800 <jan_tru> @WayneDupreeShow @DeAnna4Congress So they say. #PelosiThePillager plays fast &amp; loose w/hers as we’ve witnessed. Studies show masks are making people sicker, my husband being one, and who has a prescription that excuses him from being forced to wear.

1307592338848448513 2020-09-20 16:08:02 +0800 <jan_tru> @JoeBiden Pathetic.

Couldn’t even manage a small donation for your re-election. Mostly due to your very inconsistent handling of Russia/Obamagate. You &amp; the rest of the #WishyWashyWeenies need to do more of this, to win back trust...
1307429886206771200 2020-09-20 05:22:30 +0800 <jan_tru> Word!
1307425262217252864 2020-09-20 05:04:07 +0800 <jan_tru> @SenatorCollins I see your pleas for donations all the time &amp; for some reason, w/you, I hesitate. Now I know why! We don’t need #WishyWashyWeenies in the Senate, straddling the fence. We need strong leaders ready to uphold the Constitution &amp; the Word of Law. Funny, BO had no trouble doing that.
1307421507384086528 2020-09-20 04:49:12 +0800 <jan_tru> @Hoosiers1986 @realDonaldTrump If so, @realDonaldTrump should treat the rioters just as he would invading terrorists from another country. Would we tolerate that? I don’t think so. He shouldn’t give an inch to ANY seditious behavior. Nip it in the bud before it ever has a chance to escalate to a civil war.

1302800335375724544 2020-09-07 10:46:19 +0800 <jan_tru> Is this a man we want running our country? He’s a PERVERT in every sense of the word. We all saw this— now👂🏻! Don’t be in denial like this girls mother, who heard it — watch her, it’s SICKENING! This is as BAD as it gets . . . Please RT #BidenTalkingFILTH2A13yrold #Viral

1302695460302249984 2020-09-07 03:49:35 +0800 <jan_tru> @TrinaAltadonna @JVER1 Just one thing &amp; I agree w/99.9% of what you said. You disparage all, “Pole Dancers,” in this context &amp; that’s wrong. My daughter PD’s for exercise and almost went pro. Nothing loose about her. PD should be recognized as a respected sport/dance. Takes training &amp; strength.
1302689395074449408 2020-09-07 03:25:29 +0800 <jan_tru> @BrandonStraka Something is really WRONG with this picture! Do SOMETHING better @DallasPD @SenTedCruz — antifa &amp; BLM #BullysLunaticsManiacs are walking out of jail free as birds! This is DISGUSTING! #BidenRiots

1302469366991040512 2020-09-06 12:51:10 +0800 <jan_tru> @MATTMANGAMES1 @JoeBiden Very clear, no mistaking. He’s so SICK &amp; REPULSIVE I could hurl 🤢. Thanks for sharing. If there were anything left that really needed to be brought to the country’s attention, about this sleazebag, this would be it! I’m going to post it every day. I’m livid they’ve buried it!
1302466045207146499 2020-09-06 12:37:58 +0800 <jan_tru> @MATTMANGAMES1 @JoeBiden She was listening, I saw that, but she still fell short of protecting her daughter. At the minimum, they should be telling the truth now. This PERV has NO business running for POTUS. All you can think is they were paid a tidy sum to keep quiet — just like all the rest!
1302459261948108802 2020-09-06 12:11:01 +0800 <jan_tru> @MATTMANGAMES1 @JoeBiden Oh jeez, that’s SICKENING! Saw, but never heard it before. I think the mother did too &amp; turned away purposely. She should be ashamed! I would’ve decked him w/the whole world watching. The little girls face gives it away as well. This should go #Viral #BidenTalkingFilth2A13yrOld
1302454809119748096 2020-09-06 11:53:19 +0800 <jan_tru> @JoeBiden Joe, you can’t be ready, “day one” when you rarely come out of your basement. Truth is, if you believed in this pandemic &amp; I DON’T think you do, you’d be the last person who should be exposed. No shame — we all get old. #ThrowInTheTowelJoe  #BidenRiots #KamalaLovesRiotsToo  https://t.co/1OaJAMV7No

1302150733756731392 2020-09-05 15:45:02 +0800 <jan_tru> @Italia191 @JoanneTarpon07 When you can’t form a coherent thought &amp; speak it — it’s time to throw in the towel. But he can’t accomplish that feat, because he’s too far gone to know how/where to pitch it. You’re right, it’s elder abuse. Worse than that, it’s an insult to the American people’s intelligence.
1302147812520468481 2020-09-05 15:33:25 +0800 <jan_tru> @bxbygxrltxy @Gabriel4Justice The “police officer” statement was unfortunate. Especially right now &amp; lowers your credibility. Make certain before stating something so inflammatory, because it’s detrimental to Sophie’s welfare. Who recorded this? Were the police called? That mf CPS worker needs to be arrested!
1302138104996745218 2020-09-05 14:54:51 +0800 <jan_tru> @TheBabylonBee @sulkyracer This is how you get right down to  their level. That’s all they understand. A total lot of ignoramuses &amp; dishonest weasels. When I first heard the report today my shocker meter didn’t even register — it’s desensitized from stupidity. But thanks for the laugh, we all needed it.
1302129196559286272 2020-09-05 14:19:27 +0800 <jan_tru> @Jali_Cat @ReneeCarrollAZ No one cares who you have sex w/as long as it’s not w/ANY CHILD under 18 years — LGBTQ included! It’s the LAW for GOOD reason! Try to bend it and you’re a SEX OFFENDER! Get over yourself &amp; deal w/it! Couldn’t care less if you think it’s unfair. Lots of things in life are unfair!
1301978112922537984 2020-09-05 04:19:06 +0800 <jan_tru> @RealJamesWoods Prob so, especially when all the number of cases are as FAKE as you . . . P.s. Looks like he’s had a stroke — #FauciTheGrandstander #OustFauciTheFraud #FraudulentFauciKeepsOnGiving

1301595678796255232 2020-09-04 02:59:26 +0800 <jan_tru> @CriesFoul @DLoesch @SpeakerPelosi Yes, that pretty much sums up my “illogical” thinking. As has been proven repeatedly since @realDonaldTrump took office, he has enemies from within, holdovers from the BO admin, who were/are out to get/undermine him. Why do you think there’s lots of talk about abolishing the CDC?
1301580908315590657 2020-09-04 02:00:45 +0800 <jan_tru> @sherebee @EmeraldRobinson @amicah1 Listen, don’t lecture me about my “intuitive gifts” while enlightening repeatedly, “this is who Trump is” or similar judgements. Like you know him personally &amp; have greater insight? In addition, I read the article and told you it sounded contrived “🎻” (another insight). So, 🤷🏼‍♀️
1301364828422860800 2020-09-03 11:42:07 +0800 <jan_tru> @sherebee @EmeraldRobinson @amicah1 Sir/m’am, I’m very comfortable w/my intuitive gifts. If YOU had to go that far back to find a neg article on the POTUS, can’t you see how that’s a bit pathetic? Sorry, article sounds contrived/dramatic a, “🎻.” Btw, the FACT is — BO’s responsible for the division in this country.
1301343352504242177 2020-09-03 10:16:47 +0800 <jan_tru> @sherebee @EmeraldRobinson @amicah1 There’s one thing I sense about this POTUS — this man, and I consider myself very intuitive; is he’s kind at his core. There’s far more evidence of that, if you care to look. Most likely there’s a solid explanation for the eviction. But, I’m certain, nothing will convince you.
1301308467957833728 2020-09-03 07:58:10 +0800 <jan_tru> @sherebee @EmeraldRobinson @amicah1 So sad for you — but keep digging. I’m sure that piece took real effort to find. When you’re finished, go look at #PelosiThePillager’s district and the absolute despair that surrounds her. The pathetic conditions that she’s done ZERO to fix after literal decades in office.  https://t.co/5qV1dK0uvC

I wonder how many, “trims, tucks &amp; injections” she’s had during as well, because she’s starting to look like a pinched mask. Of course, the fact she slurs &amp; stutters is more likely due to her alcohol consumption . . . 🤷🏼‍♀️ #BidenRiots
