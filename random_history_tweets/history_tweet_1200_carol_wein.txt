1338963201833267202 2020-12-16 05:44:38 +0800 <carol_wein> Bye don 👋
1338685280895823872 2020-12-15 11:20:17 +0800 <carol_wein> Barr needs to be prosecuted for every crime he committed.  And disbarred!
1338683061383389189 2020-12-15 11:11:28 +0800 <carol_wein> One would hope Biden would not do that.  One would hope Biden would choose someone who understands the constitution and will uphold it.  Bar should be disbarred and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
1338634126644146177 2020-12-15 07:57:01 +0800 <carol_wein> Who cares?
1338633192979517440 2020-12-15 07:53:18 +0800 <carol_wein> Don’t forget disbarred!
1338630315993157632 2020-12-15 07:41:52 +0800 <carol_wein> He’s gone!  Who cares?
1338623997945274373 2020-12-15 07:16:46 +0800 <carol_wein> He lost!  He lost for real.  January 20 he will be trespassing in the White House.  He is a LOSER!
1338597532885245954 2020-12-15 05:31:36 +0800 <carol_wein> Lock this guy up for crimes against humanity &amp; insurrection and rebellion against the USA
1338561056994717709 2020-12-15 03:06:39 +0800 <carol_wein> My hope is trump will be broke &amp; in jail &amp; unable to be the head of anything!
1338544964180058112 2020-12-15 02:02:43 +0800 <carol_wein> Miller should be condemned then committed.
1338534193513590785 2020-12-15 01:19:55 +0800 <carol_wein> Remember all roads lead to Russia for the puppet trump!
1338526518281183234 2020-12-15 00:49:25 +0800 <carol_wein> They all must be held accountable or the laws mean nothing!
1338312796749041664 2020-12-14 10:40:10 +0800 <carol_wein> I agree completely!
1338306161867677703 2020-12-14 10:13:48 +0800 <carol_wein> Political ambitions for Pompeo?  I think that ship has sailed and sunk!
1338292556552146944 2020-12-14 09:19:44 +0800 <carol_wein> This is correct 100%!
1338287860462608386 2020-12-14 09:01:04 +0800 <carol_wein> She is more dangerous than her father.  No trump family member should ever be allowed to hold public office of any kind ever!
1338272785999818759 2020-12-14 08:01:10 +0800 <carol_wein> My only wish is, he will go to jail.  He will be finger printed and mug shot- without make up.  He will have to post bail and wear an ankle bracelet!  That is my Xmas wish!
1338266794323275783 2020-12-14 07:37:22 +0800 <carol_wein> 100% correct
1338248977431588867 2020-12-14 06:26:34 +0800 <carol_wein> Insurrection and rebellion also giving aid &amp; comfort to the enemies.  And treason!
1337873693565984772 2020-12-13 05:35:19 +0800 <carol_wein> Kick them out of Congress!
1337873370491330560 2020-12-13 05:34:02 +0800 <carol_wein> I don’t care about HIS feelings at all .  I can not wait for the day he becomes completely irrelevant!  And there is no NEWS about him at all!  I’m sick of him and done with him!
1337872665080717313 2020-12-13 05:31:14 +0800 <carol_wein> He also should be charged with sedition and treated like a traitor.
1337854196213813252 2020-12-13 04:17:51 +0800 <carol_wein> How about Congress doing something about it?!
1337853926843047943 2020-12-13 04:16:46 +0800 <carol_wein> @Heidi_Cuda @thedailybeast He should be treater like the traitor he is.  He should be held in contempt. This must happen according to the Constitution.  If we believe in the constitution it is important to uphold what &amp; how it dictates a traitor is treated.
1337803668205293569 2020-12-13 00:57:04 +0800 <carol_wein> I agree 100%.  This felonious crime can’t be ignored.  Madam Speaker Your oath - Protect &amp; uphold the constitution of the USA
1337624879831666690 2020-12-12 13:06:37 +0800 <carol_wein> Of course he throws a tantrum. He is a baby still in diapers!  Let him pout let him cry, and ignore him.  He is not relative and more!  Thank you all who made it possible!
1337621018043617280 2020-12-12 12:51:17 +0800 <carol_wein> @Comment34152537 @__Arthur_Dent__ @kylegriffin1 I Agree 100%
1337620545517608961 2020-12-12 12:49:24 +0800 <carol_wein> They should not be sworn it.  If the already hold office they should be removed.  I agree 100%

1337616690788659201 2020-12-12 12:34:05 +0800 <carol_wein> Amendment 14 section 3.  They engaged in insurrection and rebellion against the USA.  They are not allowed to hold any office in federal or state gov.  If they hold an office they shall be removed.

1337612875481968641 2020-12-12 12:18:55 +0800 <carol_wein> @lawindsor @funder @SpeakerPelosi Amendment 14 section 3.  All 126 people who signed engaged in insurrection &amp; rebellion against the USA. They are not allowed to hold any office in the federal, state or judicial branch of the government!  They should not be sworn in.  If they are already in office, remove them!
1337606704423460864 2020-12-12 11:54:24 +0800 <carol_wein> What about the 14th amendment section 3?  No person shall serve as member of congress,senate, judicial or state legislature if they have engaged in insurrection, or rebellion or given aid or comfort to the enemies. The 126 persons who signed on to trumps’ lawsuit shall not serve.
1337551711859335168 2020-12-12 08:15:53 +0800 <carol_wein> Each of them should be prosecuted for sedition.
1337529668203909123 2020-12-12 06:48:17 +0800 <carol_wein> 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣

1318998747548962819 2020-10-22 03:33:01 +0800 <carol_wein> No it won’t return to normal.  There is no normal anymore.  trump took normal away.  He has to loose and maybe in 5-10 years from now there will be a new normal.  COVID-19 problem needs to be solved first.

The town hall on NBC -not going to watch it, no way! But the sound bits, replayed will be interesting.  trump sounds crazy at his rallies.  Completely unhinged!

1308521453847969794 2020-09-23 05:40:00 +0800 <carol_wein> @kylegriffin1 Because he is a coward.  He does not have any idea how to be a leader.  He is a bully.  Everything he touches dies. Never having to deal with consciences of his actions. Does not accept responsibility for anything.  He is a vial coward.
1308501895053561856 2020-09-23 04:22:17 +0800 <carol_wein> @DaleRaczynski @svdate There is something that keeps him up at night...the very real fear of having his taxes made public and then going to prison because of what they reveal.  He only cares about himself and that is what keeps him up!  Everyday that reality comes closer and it is driving him crazy‼️👍

It will take years to fix everything Trump has effected.  The republicans will fight tooth &amp; nail from being completely silent for the past 4 years, they will scream &amp; shout at each correction

Republican’s only win when they rig the system!  Moscow Mitch  is rigging the courts so the pending cases outcomes is to their liking.  He has been doing it for years!  He needs to GO!
1302383479288729601 2020-09-06 07:09:53 +0800 <carol_wein> @amt17 @Hickenlooper @TheDemCoalition It’s not bills they are working on!  It is appointing LIFETIME Judges in the courts which is actually worse! The judges have impact on how to interrupt the laws! So imagine a judge interpretation of the law being really off &amp; wrong. It could take years to get rid of them😢
1302370054877704196 2020-09-06 06:16:32 +0800 <carol_wein> @augustf @jbendery That is a simple way to stop the appointment of the unqualified judges from being Confirmed but then everyone would be screaming “why aren’t the democratic helping?  It’s a no win🙁
1302368969584713729 2020-09-06 06:12:13 +0800 <carol_wein> @BadHorseOC @jbendery It will never happen!  But, I really love that idea!  Impeachment trials until November! 🙏 DEFINITELY!

I worry how their appointments with effect the long term out come of these trials.  The cases must be so solid that none of them have a single crack to crawl thru! 🙏
