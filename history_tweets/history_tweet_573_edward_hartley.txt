1342912624003063813 2020-12-27 03:18:14 +0800 <edward_hartley> @AfrikaanKaren This is very true ‚ù§ but the main difference is the institutions that rule over us are not on our side at the moment &amp; maybe have become infiltrated beyond any hope. I've become very pragmatic over the dire situation we're in &amp; must try to have more faith like you, thank u.
1342905337146441728 2020-12-27 02:49:17 +0800 <edward_hartley> @AfrikaanKaren I try to keep the faith but as was gleefully pointed out to me by a Ghanaian recently, the home office here is ran by Asians &amp; Africans, also politicians are becoming predominantly same, he went on to say we deserve it for colonialism. The future generations will never forgive us
1342898993249083394 2020-12-27 02:24:04 +0800 <edward_hartley> @AfrikaanKaren I think the same applies throughout western civilisation, unfortunately too many are either complicit in what's happening or too comfortable to care, the way its going in the last 70 years it all seems inevitable that the good times are gone &amp; won't be coming back any time soon.
1342860003217125376 2020-12-26 23:49:08 +0800 <edward_hartley> @AndreaAlbion @EternalEnglish No I can't see any value from them other than ceremonial &amp; tourism, I understand the history though &amp; was brought up to back them but politically they're totally defunct and have no real impact in ordinary British lives. It isn't a case of not liking them, more disillusioned.
1342827522405363719 2020-12-26 21:40:04 +0800 <edward_hartley> @AndreaAlbion @EternalEnglish I just think the royal family sold out a long time ago &amp; forfeited any political influence in exchange for their own survival &amp; that makes it impossible for the Queen to speak her mind on any subject of importance to the British people. She could trigger a revolution but won't.
1342824479647559680 2020-12-26 21:27:59 +0800 <edward_hartley> @AndreaAlbion @EternalEnglish Agreed, if the Queen was to speak out against the great reset it would be the defining moment of her reign,  &amp; could make the difference pushing this issue into the mainstream for the good of whats left of our civilisation &amp; before its too late I hope she does.
1342818220504449030 2020-12-26 21:03:06 +0800 <edward_hartley> @EternalEnglish @AndreaAlbion If only she had said this! Maybe Queen Victoria would've but no monarch since has had any real say in current affairs.

So what's your experience in the research of DNA? And if you want to go back to the creation of man then Britain is no longer an island at that point, so your argument is nonsensical.

1335891465566892032 2020-12-07 18:18:39 +0800 <edward_hartley> @Cantor_Omen @ambridge2020 Normally within ten generations, although you could use your haplogroup to go back further, you can definitely be of mixed race, but if you have no British ancestry then you cannot claim to be British, and quite frankly why would you. This used to be universally common sense ffs.
1335890533382762499 2020-12-07 18:14:57 +0800 <edward_hartley> @Cantor_Omen @ambridge2020 Lol he knows himself that he is not British, no amount of lies or foolery or word play can change facts. Ask yourself why the term Asian community is used here, it wouldn't exist if living here automatically made you British. Face facts and stop confusing politics with genetics.

You can't make it up for convenience.
1335882266103468033 2020-12-07 17:42:06 +0800 <edward_hartley> @Cantor_Omen @LBC @MaajidNawaz I'm not saying he can't live here but he definitely cannot mutate into being British by living here, and that is a fact. The same goes if my children were born and raised in Pakistan, they would be British because of parentage,ancestry not Pakistani because of address. Fact.

Why focus on skin colour? He isn't British and never will be, yes he might live &amp; work here and hold a passport but his soul &amp; fibres are not and never will be British. He is a Pakistani obviously.

You say it isn't hard but you're making it up to suit your own agenda. He is isn't British. Full stop.

1324845503826329601 2020-11-07 06:45:57 +0800 <edward_hartley> @Joycie_m @Winston03457509 @darrengrimes_ If that is all you care money then we're better off turning Buckingham palace into a hotel and really cashing in, we haven't had a royal family for a century just some expensive faux royal family used for ceremonies who to most Brits are just pointless
1324844321728876553 2020-11-07 06:41:15 +0800 <edward_hartley> @prettyred52 @RealJamesWoods Agreed, don't get me wrong it is a great idea or was, but I think its had its day here, underfunded and has been on the decline for too long now, just like everything else really though, progression in our services has been bypassed but we still foot the bill
1324837536993345537 2020-11-07 06:14:17 +0800 <edward_hartley> @prettyred52 @RealJamesWoods Haha apologies! I've paid a small fortune in national insurance and can't get a doctor's appointment, it's a sore point for me!!
