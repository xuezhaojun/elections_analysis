1341827018355163137 2020-12-24 03:24:25 +0800 <davincidiva> @laurenboebert @primfreak @POTUS Gotta pass it to know what's in it! Them's da rules.
1341826067049422848 2020-12-24 03:20:38 +0800 <davincidiva> Insult to injury: first shutting down outdoor dining, then allowing the restaurants' self-funded outdoor areas to be used as de facto homeless shelters, while not even compensating the owners for their expense, and leaving them no way to earn a living.
1341817353558880256 2020-12-24 02:46:01 +0800 <davincidiva> @drefanzor This is hilarious
1341817205311164417 2020-12-24 02:45:26 +0800 <davincidiva> Gee, who could see this coming?
1341816182899273728 2020-12-24 02:41:22 +0800 <davincidiva> Not only are most Americans too literal to get sarcasm at all, the censorship on most humor has blunted what sense of it we did have. #useitorloseit
1341815203822936065 2020-12-24 02:37:28 +0800 <davincidiva> @davejorgenson The people who censored speech so much they forgot what a joke is don't know one when they see one.
1341772590503743488 2020-12-23 23:48:09 +0800 <davincidiva> @randrewwhite Nope, your sense of humor is broken.
1341771582868320256 2020-12-23 23:44:08 +0800 <davincidiva> @AlexofBrown What if something is a joke, that you don‚Äôt *understand* is a joke? But it‚Äôs not your fault; comedy has been largely outlawed in this country, so you‚Äôre probably just out of practice.

1341651853973458945 2020-12-23 15:48:23 +0800 <davincidiva> @deemyers Hi DeeDee, congrats on the new role, and I hope you will listen to others who only want to return to the roles they had before #AB5 took their livelihoods away &amp; sent their work to #freelancers in other states. If we don‚Äôt #RepealAB5 I will have to leave CA as have so many others

Like it was hers by right, but she oh so generously stepped aside... instead of being another #AB5 casualty.
1341593242945482752 2020-12-23 11:55:29 +0800 <davincidiva> @SaltmeadowGroup @ThruDaLenz @LorenaSGonzalez Yes well at least for today we can be happy that incompetence and cruelty was not rewarded.

1341546074977157121 2020-12-23 08:48:03 +0800 <davincidiva> First smart thing @GavinNewsom has done in a while, NOT to reward Job Killer Lorena with a position she is patently unqualified for, professionally, politically, temperamentally, and morally. Let her rot in #AD80 until we #repealAB5 and finally undo some of the damage she‚Äôs done.

1341219619923640325 2020-12-22 11:10:50 +0800 <davincidiva> @KevinKileyCA I think as soon as we get our paperbacks we should take them to the nearest open restaurant and take a photo of us dining out while reading your book!

It was part of a pattern of behavior by not only Newsom but many of his peers to make rules for others that they never had any intention of following themselves.

1340463066215981056 2020-12-20 09:04:34 +0800 <davincidiva> @joelcomm I saw this earlier. So sad. Why is in-person mental health care not considered essential, ESPECIALLY now?!
1340459297650577408 2020-12-20 08:49:35 +0800 <davincidiva> Hi @EricaJSandberg please stop by! Here is a #sanfrancisco #restaurant owner being creative with social media, livestreaming his fundraiser and auction to save his new restaurant -- that he "opened" the day before the lockdown!  https://t.co/f9JgKvvg3g

1340416340310458368 2020-12-20 05:58:53 +0800 <davincidiva> @ThoughtasWeak @KevinKileyCA reason(s): &gt;400 laws by EO, abuse of emergency powers (a case Newsom lost in court); imposition of onerous rules he himself doesn‚Äôt follow(French Laundry, Plumpjack Winery); corruption in awarding (w/o approval) $3B to a Chinese co for faulty PPE, plenty more where that came from
1340415301494603776 2020-12-20 05:54:46 +0800 <davincidiva> @ThoughtasWeak @KevinKileyCA You‚Äôre funny. We have over 800k signatures already and we have until March to get the 1.5M needed to get it voted on. I‚Äôm forwarding the link to ppl every day asking for it. Multiple reports in the press last week say Newsom is worried. But you‚Äôre not, so I guess he is safe! LOL
1340401867554050048 2020-12-20 05:01:23 +0800 <davincidiva> @Discord_Child Although, reading this piece, I would have to wait 10 years after leaving to come into my millions for California not to be able to come after me and tax me no matter where in the world I lived. These people are batshit crazy
1340401169949097984 2020-12-20 04:58:37 +0800 <davincidiva> @ThoughtasWeak @KevinKileyCA No one I know from any political party wants him to remain in office. Recall is the least they want to happen to him.
1340400630720970752 2020-12-20 04:56:28 +0800 <davincidiva> @KevinKileyCA There is no more effective advocate for #RecallGavinNewsom than @GavinNewsom himself. Every action he takes and every word out of his mouth spur more people to want to get rid of him. No wonder he had to hire an ‚Äúethics advisor‚Äù. Too late! #hypocrite #tyrant #narcissism

1340239792584368130 2020-12-19 18:17:21 +0800 <davincidiva> @katlopez66 @SupFletcher There is no science demonstrating that outdoor dining &gt; 6‚Äô apart is as risky as the numerous other activities that are allowed such as shopping alongside hundreds of strangers at Target.  That‚Äôs the point.
1340156832229179392 2020-12-19 12:47:42 +0800 <davincidiva> @SupFletcher Can't wait to patronize every restaurant I can find this weekend that defies this order. The only risk to my health is the 5 pounds I'll gain.
1340154653254684672 2020-12-19 12:39:02 +0800 <davincidiva> @BillFOXLA @FOXLA Too late. His character is clear.
1340154121576300544 2020-12-19 12:36:56 +0800 <davincidiva> @GavinNewsom How about those you are making homeless with #AB5? Got some more rooms for them? #RepealAB5 or #RecallGavinNewsom  https://t.co/Umr0JpiBFC
1340153876582813703 2020-12-19 12:35:57 +0800 <davincidiva> This is what people think of #AB5 &amp; those responsible for it, notably @LorenaAD80 &amp; @GavinNewsom. It's one of the factors fueling the growing wildfire that is the #RecallGavinNewsom movement. Every day California ICs go without the ability to earn, we are reminded. #RepealAB5  https://t.co/J7OMkraa1V

We have nothing against unions for those who want to join them. We object to having our chosen way of life outlawed by those "protecting" us.
1339701023812698112 2020-12-18 06:36:29 +0800 <davincidiva> She's the poor man's AOC so I guess she thinks if she hounds innovative companies &amp; thousands of high-paying jobs out of the state she can achieve similar celebrity status.

1338522391484321793 2020-12-15 00:33:01 +0800 <davincidiva> Should we book the French Laundry now for the celebration when the #RecallGavinNewsom effort succeeds?
1338521738481520644 2020-12-15 00:30:25 +0800 <davincidiva> It‚Äôs no secret. @LorenaAD80 wants to kill your right to work as you choose.

1338247107719831552 2020-12-14 06:19:08 +0800 <davincidiva> @marwilliamson This is terrible,  but I don‚Äôt recall seeing the same outrage when similar scenes played out all summer, even against the elderly, where the attackers were supposedly ‚Äúanti fascist‚Äù. If we don‚Äôt tolerate pedestrians being attacked on the street, it should apply across the board.
1338242311243718657 2020-12-14 06:00:04 +0800 <davincidiva> @KevinKileyCA This from someone who has been ruling by 1 man fiat against the rules for months, as evidenced by your victory in court. Also to be noted, the genesis of the current recall effort preceded COVID, so it‚Äôs not about people not wanting to be team players against the virus- just him

1337542124158369795 2020-12-12 07:37:47 +0800 <davincidiva> Really @AssemblyDems just #RepealAB5 already. You now know without a shadow of a doubt that the CA electorate is against it, not just those directly affected. How can you justify supporting #AB5 after the passage of #Prop22? I don't care how much unions paid you. Do your real job
1337541404646502400 2020-12-12 07:34:55 +0800 <davincidiva> Thank you @KevinKileyCA. Millions not in your district or even normally in the same party are grateful for your steadfast support of #freelancers &amp; the right to work as we choose. CA voters soundly rejected #AB5 when we passed #Prop22, the 1 time our voices were heard  #RepealAB5
1337540693124763650 2020-12-12 07:32:06 +0800 <davincidiva> @KevinKileyCA #AB5 the First should have its number retired in infamy. OR call it #AB52020 and combine the two least favorite numbers

1337184837644369926 2020-12-11 07:58:03 +0800 <davincidiva> @coalition_ca Amen
1337183773029351425 2020-12-11 07:53:49 +0800 <davincidiva> Just think! He‚Äôll have time for a boozy lunch at The French Laundry every day once he‚Äôs out of office. #RecallGavinNewsom

1337180079281983489 2020-12-11 07:39:09 +0800 <davincidiva> This would end CA #freelancers 2020 nightmare, and set a great example for #PROAct that the ABC test is archaic, unworkable and treats independent business owners like children. God bless @KevinKileyCA

This is about a woman who holds public office explicitly calling for violence in a videos where thousands of people will see it. And apparently it's a pattern. She should be removed, as should anyone who does this.
1336902415191302145 2020-12-10 13:15:48 +0800 <davincidiva> @burt_grossman @josheidelson @LorenaSGonzalez Just for perspective -- for those of us  in CA who #freelance, COVID was actually a lot less of a problem than #AB5. That was just the cherry on top of a year we saw our livelihoods outlawed.

If we can't #RepealAB5 i'll leave the state as so many others have done. We also need to make sure #PROAct does not pass or it will be the end of #freelance work everywhere in the US.

1336894546437754881 2020-12-10 12:44:32 +0800 <davincidiva> @detroitnews She didn‚Äôt just question Giuliani, she intentionally doxed a witness and even made her give put her maiden name in public for no other reason than to make her a target of her ‚Äúsoldiers‚Äù. She is a terrorist.
1336893451082715136 2020-12-10 12:40:11 +0800 <davincidiva> @LittleBlueDrop_ @senatormelendez @billpostmus Your whataboutisms are not convincing. The woman holds public office &amp; is explicitly inciting terrorism.  She doxed a witness in a recent hearings intentionally to terrorize her. Not remotely comparable to the random thug who has no position of influence. PS They are wrong too.
1336889630717689857 2020-12-10 12:25:00 +0800 <davincidiva> She‚Äôs actually proud of this.

1336889312374185987 2020-12-10 12:23:44 +0800 <davincidiva> This is what @LorenaAD80 thinks of your life &amp; the expertise &amp; career you‚Äôve built. She dismisses it with a wave of her hand. ‚ÄúYeah, it was a little arbitrary.‚Äù Now @GavinNewsom wants to put her in charge of business?  That‚Äôs like appointing Jack the Ripper head of surgery.
1336866628529577985 2020-12-10 10:53:36 +0800 <davincidiva> It was never fringe. Now it‚Äôs a no brainer.

But as an elected official she should hold herself to a higher standard than a random thug. She should not be telling HER supporters to find people from the other party and ‚Äúmake them pay‚Äù.  Calling them ‚Äúsoldiers‚Äù?! Seriously
1336809486418288640 2020-12-10 07:06:32 +0800 <davincidiva> @rat4prez @ZiWukong @JennyChachan Everyone with a brain is leaving, and the business climate with laws like #AB5 make it ever more hostile to start a business here.

1336801067317645314 2020-12-10 06:33:05 +0800 <davincidiva> @evandpeng @LorenaSGonzalez "This sort of concern for others is certainly par for the course for Gonzalez." She singlehandedly put millions of #freelancers out of work they loved w/ her #AB5 law, a gift to her union backers, then mocked us for "not having real jobs". You either don't know her or were paid.

She is the most hated woman in California &amp; helped flip CA seats red. Promote her at your peril.

1336768908431294465 2020-12-10 04:25:18 +0800 <davincidiva> Hey @ACLU here is a recent post on the so-called "personal" account of @LorenaAD80, a public official running for SOS. She has blocked dozens of citizens from this account. Do you think content like this should be inaccessible to the public? Can you find the time to address this?

She throws in an occasional kissy-face post with her lapdog or an adorably inept parenting moment to justify calling it personal, but most of her political discourse takes place on this account.
1336767768901820418 2020-12-10 04:20:46 +0800 <davincidiva> @Ash_Kalra @GarmentWorkerLA Only independent contractors and #smallbusiness owners are disregarded in @LorenaAD80's idea of a fair California. The biggest "wage theft" in history is when #AB5 outlawed millions of people minding their own business and working as they chose. #RepealAB5
1336766910835265537 2020-12-10 04:17:22 +0800 <davincidiva> @KUSINews What really sucks is the time, effort and money these business owner put into COMPLYING with the rules can never be recovered. Insult, meet injury

1336765377867497472 2020-12-10 04:11:16 +0800 <davincidiva> Apparently @ACLU says it's "too busy" to address this. Guess some people's #1A rights are more important than others'. Never mind that this person blocked all her main detractors just before going public with her run for statewide office. #nothingtoseehere

1336753230332579847 2020-12-10 03:23:00 +0800 <davincidiva> @LeeChatfield Thank you. I was very upset when I saw her video, not just BC of what she said but the vitriol with which she said it. It would have been unacceptable for even a private citizen to incite violence but a public official?! Shows terrible judgment on top of blatant bias and hatred.
1336752522229207040 2020-12-10 03:20:11 +0800 <davincidiva> @78tiger @LorenaAD80 @Democratic Yeah I think all businesses have received the message: California is no place for you.

1336708705396477953 2020-12-10 00:26:04 +0800 <davincidiva> @katlopez66 @GavinNewsom Doesn‚Äôt make it ok for his business to be open and making money while he is putting other restaurants out of business.
1336708470435794947 2020-12-10 00:25:08 +0800 <davincidiva> @katlopez66 @GavinNewsom So I guess he shouldn‚Äôt earn any money from its being open then?
1336524705885429760 2020-12-09 12:14:55 +0800 <davincidiva> Care to comment @GavinNewsom ? Seems your Plumpjack Winery is OPEN for outdoor dining, and taking reservations NOW! Let's go!  (707) 945-1220. #Hypocrisy is on the menu with a nice Chianti.
1336523024560836610 2020-12-09 12:08:15 +0800 <davincidiva> They really are as the cliche goes "on the wrong side of history." People want MORE choice in all aspects of life today, not less. I thought we were supposed to be a society that lets everyone be who they want to be, without bias. That should include those who choose to be ICs.

Retuned on a different airline, cheek by jowl with other passengers, every seat filled, some folks near me coughing. What a difference!

1336455939314995200 2020-12-09 07:41:40 +0800 <davincidiva> Of course they did, because they assumed their own rules couldn't possibly apply to them. I guess I have to run for office if I ever want to eat out again.  #Hypocrisy
1336455648440020992 2020-12-09 07:40:31 +0800 <davincidiva> "Arbitrary" is how California governs. Not a thought for the lives they destroy with senseless, unjust rules and laws like #AB5 that pick winners and losers.

1336434078577352707 2020-12-09 06:14:48 +0800 <davincidiva> @gregquinn @LorenaAD80 Exactly. I guess because big bad Uber had so much money they were able to buy their way onto the ballot. Much like the unions buy the entire #caleg supermajority lock, stock and barrel.  Hilarious when they cry "no fair" as soon as others play by their "rules".
1336433492180291586 2020-12-09 06:12:28 +0800 <davincidiva> @MannyMota7 @rpyers It's only racist if a non-Latina/o person says it. She herself panders to them shamelessly claiming a common racial heritage, despite being only half Latina and not speaking a word of Spanish.
1336432706146639872 2020-12-09 06:09:21 +0800 <davincidiva> @megmccool00 @LorenaAD80 Oh I'm sure she thinks they were misled by "deceptive" advertising, when anyone who has even taken an uber could tell you their drivers did NOT want to be employees, and everyone knows gig work is by definition independent and as-needed, NOT A JOB.
1336423294514262016 2020-12-09 05:31:57 +0800 <davincidiva> "The way (#Prop22) was passed was anti-democratic." NO Veena, the way #AB5 was passed was anti-democratic, with ZERO input from the public. It would NEVER have passed had we been allowed to vote on it. But that would not have suited @LorenaAD80  #RepealAB5  https://t.co/IOaKo0tKGQ

No one cares what she says, least of all a man who builds historic, amazing  things that change the world for the better. She's a gnat on his windshield. #AB5 probably didn't affect his company too much, much as she would have liked it to.

1336418116922822656 2020-12-09 05:11:23 +0800 <davincidiva> More presumptuous, retrograde drivel from @veenadubal. She bemoans the dismantling of "New Deal" labor rules from 75 years ago, and "the new contigent workforce".

1336408413677342724 2020-12-09 04:32:49 +0800 <davincidiva> So interesting to get this today as @CAgovernor announced $80M of our tax dollars 4 billboards (when no one will see them if we are locked down AND the govt can fearmonger all citizens individually via text) AND #scotus is meeting on the election.

1336407432768094208 2020-12-09 04:28:55 +0800 <davincidiva> @J_GallagherAD3 Because it does not support his case.

1336402022686359553 2020-12-09 04:07:26 +0800 <davincidiva> @KevinKileyCA He should put the billboards along the imaginary route of the non existent high speed rail.

Zero integrity,  and raises doubts about the legitimacy of the safety measures if he wasn‚Äôt afraid himself in this situation. No masks, no distance, total strangers, indoors literally hours after he banned others from the same activity.

I live in California where since 1/1/20 the union bought &amp; paid for #AB5 law has stripped independent contractors in over 300 fields of their livelihoods in the name of ‚ÄúProtecting‚Äù workers. We have nothing against unions. They have refused our right to exist.

He wouldn't let Bill Clinton campaign for him; even after the Monica scandal Clinton was much more liked and popular than Gore, and I believe he resented that. He wanted to prove he could do it on his own. Too much ego. Otherwise it wouldn't have been close

1335790212174106624 2020-12-07 11:36:19 +0800 <davincidiva> @ChefGruel We were going to make the pilgrimage from San Diego  but ran out of time. So glad you had a good weekend!
1335789446197735425 2020-12-07 11:33:16 +0800 <davincidiva> Yes @LorenaAD80 forgets that some of us need "protection" not from unfair labor practices but bad bosses. The best and surest way is to be your own boss. For someone who complains about sexual harassment, she's OK forcing other women into situations they've taken pains to avoid.

1335393895379685377 2020-12-06 09:21:29 +0800 <davincidiva> So stupid. It‚Äôs the BEST time to be #freelance and have the whole world as your marketplace instead of one precarious job... unless you live in California under union control courtesy of @LorenaAD80 @LorenaSGonzalez @GavinNewsom and #AB5, then you are SOL
1335391761552658434 2020-12-06 09:13:00 +0800 <davincidiva> This is true @jack this dishonest politician should not be able to block anyone on Twitter on ANY account, certainly not on @LorenaSGonzalez where most of her political discourse takes place.
1335391189806149632 2020-12-06 09:10:44 +0800 <davincidiva> @StyleCouncil2 @ThruDaLenz @LorenaAD80 @LorenaSGonzalez @Rendon63rd Yea I know but even VD knows It ceases to be ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù when she engages in policy discussions there. If it was ALL kissy-face posts with her stolen spouse and mentions of her adorably slipshod parenting it‚Äôd be more nauseating, but that‚Äôs what personal looks like.

Your @LorenaSGonzalez is NOT ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù. Maybe you should start following the most basic of laws before you run for SOS.

So she is violating our 1st Amendment rights before even taking office?! I knew she was ambitious but wow. @Rendon63rd shame on you. #RepealAB5

1334344172954742786 2020-12-03 11:50:16 +0800 <davincidiva> Union brass voices were the only ones that got heard in the #AB5 discussion. Guess that‚Äôs BC they were the ones who paid for it
1334342056911622145 2020-12-03 11:41:51 +0800 <davincidiva> @KamalaHarris BULLSHIT: you supported #AB5 and now #PROAct which STRIP individuals of their right to work as independent contractors.

1333892137029570561 2020-12-02 05:54:02 +0800 <davincidiva> @Ildiko_Santana She thinks she gets around it by having 2 accounts, and doesn‚Äôt block on the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù one... meanwhile most of her activity is on her ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù account including discussions on policy. Sprinkling in the occasional nauseating display of her faux happy family life doesn‚Äôt fix it

Like a little girl who thinks she‚Äôs invisible if she closes her eyes.

1331624090617069569 2020-11-25 23:41:38 +0800 <davincidiva> To be clear, no one has anything against union MEMBERS. The leadership is where the issue is. They are the ones who want to destroy independent contracting with laws like #AB5 and #PROAct, and even their own members do not agree. Most newspapers people want to live and let live.
1331447548930711552 2020-11-25 12:00:07 +0800 <davincidiva> @wolfblitzer @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Um I think he was referring to Biden‚Äôs policies, regulations and taxes that have not yet been implemented &amp; with any luck never will be. The 30k Dow belongs to the current admin. You can‚Äôt give both Obama AND Biden credit for the market increase since 2016. Nice try though.

1331334691358576641 2020-11-25 04:31:40 +0800 <davincidiva> @Marc_Topaz No starting point. Just me musing about the various takes I'm seeing about current events.

1331333958236160000 2020-11-25 04:28:45 +0800 <davincidiva> @78tiger So hard to know now, with COVID. When will staying in a stranger's home seem like a good idea again? I say this as someone who used to rent out an apartment to tourists.
1331333451308404737 2020-11-25 04:26:44 +0800 <davincidiva> A reminder that pretty much everything we now accept as true was once only a theory.   Not all theories are conspiracies.   Not all conspiracies are theories.   Interesting to see how the story plays out. I only wish it were a Netflix series and not real life.
1331330980158738433 2020-11-25 04:16:55 +0800 <davincidiva> @CottoGottfried I think there is a general concept of equity/fairness that seems good to most people. It's in the execution where it all goes wrong.

Luckily it‚Äôs an Italian restaurant and they‚Äôll be able to somehow reimagine most of it. He‚Äôs going back to just being takeout and grocery. He‚Äôs having a go fund me event on the 28th to stay in business

1330770715121831941 2020-11-23 15:10:37 +0800 <davincidiva> @AndiHK How cruel is this the eve of Thanksgiving after these restaurants stocked up for the day hoping to finally do some business. Why is even outdoor banned? This is intentional harm.

Isn‚Äôt he duty-bound to keep faith with those who elected him?
1330608105554550784 2020-11-23 04:24:28 +0800 <davincidiva> @AndiHK This is it. My one and only organization project, a crime of opportunity or a MacGyver-ism depending on ones POV
1330603744396857345 2020-11-23 04:07:08 +0800 <davincidiva> So we recently had a mouse problem and had to clean out our pantry. When we put it back together i covered the shelves with contact paper...and I went a little overboard with the scraps. These are repurposed trail mix containers. You can tell a cartoonist lettered the labels.  https://t.co/qXwqTOaSgk
1330600759285612545 2020-11-23 03:55:17 +0800 <davincidiva> HOORAY!!! Thanksgiving is saved. It's just not the same without @TheNatlDogShow while puttering in the kitchen.

1330595472709353473 2020-11-23 03:34:16 +0800 <davincidiva> @KamalaHarris Not true.
1330595309458649089 2020-11-23 03:33:37 +0800 <davincidiva> But @LorenaAD80 thinks it's an awesome idea, even when more ppl are being fired from their "good jobs"! W2 is the opposite of job security. It's always been that way; COVID revealed it. The same boss who says "we're family" so you'll work the weekend can fire you the next day.
1330592577746210817 2020-11-23 03:22:46 +0800 <davincidiva> @JMAN23_SD @jenvanlaar I thought that was a joke. It's REAL?!? Well if true, it's dumb. People can just buy 2 turkeys.

Pro Tip: The occasional display of PDA doesn't count if you also engage in policy debate there.
1330590220564131845 2020-11-23 03:13:24 +0800 <davincidiva> @jenvanlaar AAACK ! That means i'm late

1330316008700174337 2020-11-22 09:03:47 +0800 <davincidiva> @iamchristenv She calls it her ‚Äúpersonal account‚Äù but she does most of her engaging on it , including on matters of policy. She gets away with blocking people here but she can‚Äôt on the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù account she barely uses.

Horrifying to think it was intentional but there it is.
1330111915071328257 2020-11-21 19:32:47 +0800 <davincidiva> @ContentKitchn Well at least that‚Äôs something! Still it shows how different life is now when families can‚Äôt get together to celebrate birthdays or holidays.

1329606637439516672 2020-11-20 10:04:59 +0800 <davincidiva> @JackPosobiec Oh well. More room on the DVR going forward.
1329606312259305474 2020-11-20 10:03:42 +0800 <davincidiva> @Crystaaal_J @danthegreater @livinlifeafloat @JeremyBWhite @GavinNewsom It‚Äôs different because I can see for myself that going outside is dangerous when people are burning looting and beating ppl with skateboards. They have not made a credible case that there is any utility in following their orders now.
1329599561610919936 2020-11-20 09:36:52 +0800 <davincidiva> @Crystaaal_J @danthegreater @livinlifeafloat @JeremyBWhite @GavinNewsom Not sure of the reasons. If it was because of the violence it‚Äôs a while different thing than to say we are going to use COVID as a pretext to tell you to stay in your house even though there is zero logical effect
1329586509540777985 2020-11-20 08:45:01 +0800 <davincidiva> @venturemike1 I need to raise prices and streamline deliverables for sure!

1329558917332959233 2020-11-20 06:55:22 +0800 <davincidiva> @neogaia I'm not rich or bourgeois, I'm just a freelancer who has lived in a number of places. I don't own homes there, though even if I did it would still make me a lot less wealthy than our governor who is the one who is able to "do whatever he wants and damn everyone else."

That placeholder did better than legit candidates in many other races.
1329529839439646720 2020-11-20 04:59:49 +0800 <davincidiva> @RubinReport Don't forget #AB5 the union-written-bought-and-paid-for law that outlawed most #freelance work. It went into effect on Jan 1 with ZERO input from voters. Unions bribed our lawmakers to pass legislation making W2 (unionizable) jobs the only choice to earn a living in CA #RepealAB5
1329513231358955520 2020-11-20 03:53:50 +0800 <davincidiva> @gemko I agree it's horrifying . But if even a fraction of what's alleged is true, the "lasting damage" was already done before Trump even thought of running. Today is about facing it, come what may. If your husband was cheating on you for years &amp; you didn't know it, would you want to?
1329511769912446976 2020-11-20 03:48:01 +0800 <davincidiva> @BrandonStraka I was just wondering this myself. Looks like maybe someone messed up on the algorithm then as well. Otherwise, what "shit" were they supposed to "fix"?  https://t.co/YvNOBWxms8

1329477576247578625 2020-11-20 01:32:09 +0800 <davincidiva> @RyanAFournier @lukethedoggie It also shouldn't get to decide if you get to work as an independent contractor or not. #NOPROAct #RepealAB5 #RepealAB2257

1329476321613815808 2020-11-20 01:27:10 +0800 <davincidiva> @susanvalot I used to tease my dad who also was an independent contractor bc he was stressed out when he didn't have enough work and even more so when he had too much. I told him he'd never have "just enough" work and he'd left himself no way to be happy. Now I look in the mirror and see him
1329475212941819904 2020-11-20 01:22:45 +0800 <davincidiva> @WSJ @JChengWSJ Mating signals, maybe.
1329474523809210370 2020-11-20 01:20:01 +0800 <davincidiva> @JakeSherman @GOPLeader @GavinNewsom I noticed that not only were people not wearing masks, they didn't even have Aunt Nancy's custom outfit-matching-neckwear-that-becomes-a-mask (which I must admit I've admired).There was no ATTEMPT at the bare minimum of compliance. But we get ticketed for walking alone on a beach
1329473775063113728 2020-11-20 01:17:03 +0800 <davincidiva> I thought "privilege" was something we were all supposed to "check".   @GavinNewsom appears intent on flaunting it instead.   What gives?

1329117490379513856 2020-11-19 01:41:18 +0800 <davincidiva> @thekimkavin How does @RBReich not see how tone-deaf this is for our times when MORE people choose to #freelance? Laws like #AB5 &amp; #PROAct are regressive, not progressive. People want more individuality not less. Something's wrong when we recognize 78 genders but only 1 way to work.
1329115393265332225 2020-11-19 01:32:58 +0800 <davincidiva> This looks interesting! The holidays are gong to need to be creative this year.

So... I guess we'll just agree to disagree. I'm not partisan, or at least I wasn't. I don't know Jesse.
1329113405521686530 2020-11-19 01:25:04 +0800 <davincidiva> @lanira4assembly But succeeded in its REAL goal of destroying most Independent Contractors so W2 employment and unionization would be the only option. Thank goodness for #prop22
1329111356398702592 2020-11-19 01:16:55 +0800 <davincidiva> @thekimkavin @JoeBiden We bought @Upwork stock in March. It's up nearly 500%. People need #freelance work more than ever. #PROAct stifles #Entrepreneurship and self-sufficiency and kills dreams. #NOPROAct #IRSnotABC #RepealAB5
1329110771612016640 2020-11-19 01:14:36 +0800 <davincidiva> @danangell11 @JesseKellyDC No I think people believe politicians are exploiting the lockdown; their own behavior does not demonstrate the concern they say we all need to show. It only adds to people's suspicions. @GavinNewsom himself has changed &gt; 400 laws since the never-ending state of emergency began.
1329108002528378881 2020-11-19 01:03:36 +0800 <davincidiva> @EricaJSandberg I‚Äôm almost 59. Never thought much about politics and always thought my elected officials had our best interests at heart. #AB5 changed all that this year. I now believe California politicians in power now are union agents, nothing more.
1329107176019816448 2020-11-19 01:00:19 +0800 <davincidiva> @danangell11 @JesseKellyDC They are not behaving like people who believe they could catch it themselves from mixing maskless in close proximity with strangers.

Listen to the stories of people whose entire livelihoods were ROBBED from them by #AB5, even before COVID, forcing many to leave the state or make plans to do so. But of course acknowledging what a massive #FAIL that law is would not please your bosses.

1328849977137795072 2020-11-18 07:58:18 +0800 <davincidiva> @ParagonEarth @RollerRover @margaritareyes Well now #AB2257 rolled back the worst of the restrictions on #freelance journalists but it took 8 months and many writers and others lost their relationships to providers in other states. And the language still leaves too much risk of being accused of misclassification.

That was part of the sting operation to entrap those independent contractors into naming their clients (‚ÄúWho did you work for?‚Äù) so EDD could go after them with fines. $21M for enforcement only goes so far...so ICs were lured into being stooges.

1328781169563865088 2020-11-18 03:24:53 +0800 <davincidiva> Ridiculous. Californians voted for freedom &amp; choice, in solidarity with the vast majority of drivers and with 100% of #freelancers who never got to vote on #AB5 that destroyed their lives just to benefit unions. We treated #Prop22 as the referendum we should have had. #RepealAB5

We all have better things to do. Before #AB5 we had no idea who you were. We didn't come after you until you came after us. #RepealAB5, your union pals have already lost their gigworker plum.

1328167943499247616 2020-11-16 10:48:08 +0800 <davincidiva> Yes @latimes this is the reason #prop22 passed, NOT that voters were somehow blinded by the brilliant persuasion of the TV commercials or junk mail received. We all know #freelancers and drivers or have been one or both ourselves. No one wants to remove the #freedom to #freelance
1328161066501566464 2020-11-16 10:20:48 +0800 <davincidiva> Yes. Under #PROAct, employers MUST give union organizers the personal info of employees, including HOME ADDRESS, WITHOUT the employee‚Äôs consent! They are basically forced to dox their workers. What could possibly go wrong? #NOProAct #RepealAB5 #unions OUT of my personal business!

With her #AB5 overreach and her callous arrogance, she singlehandedly mobilized 2-4M #freelancers to work like hell for FREE to make sure it passed. Next let's #RepealAB5 altogether

1327646219175297025 2020-11-15 00:14:59 +0800 <davincidiva> @JaniceDean It's not just #hypocrisy: They don't even believe their own bullshit. Would YOU go to a dinner where you thought you might get COVID? Me neither. When they can dine with a dozen people they barely know but you can't have Thanksgiving w/your own family, something doesn't add up.
1327643629410607104 2020-11-15 00:04:42 +0800 <davincidiva> @grannybot2 @thekimkavin She was running against a total unknown placeholder candidate who did no campaigning with near-zero support from his party. She runs on being a Latina in a border district full of immigrants. And he STILL got almost 30% of the vote. What does that tell you?

But wait, i thought she was a "brawler"? Only if she wins I guess. So "bully" is more accurate. #spoiled #hypocrite
1327639573300531201 2020-11-14 23:48:35 +0800 <davincidiva> @LorenaSGonzalez As usual, the lazy gender argument. If she were a POC you'd use that too. The GOP elected a record number of women this year, more than Democrats. Their opposition of Warren is not due to her gender. Even she would probably want more credit on substance than that. Get a new line.

1325250469195730946 2020-11-08 09:35:08 +0800 <davincidiva> @milesparker @jeffposter3 @marwilliamson I went to good college 40 years ago when it was cheaper but still proportionally very high for my middle class parents. They earned just enough not to qualify for aid. They sacrificed a lot to afford my education. Not sure how they'd feel if others got a non-scholarship free ride

The assemblyman who has been leading the charge just won a big legal case against Newsom so he has momentum, LG has lost some of her influence with the passage of 22 and the defeat of 16

1325230790871900160 2020-11-08 08:16:56 +0800 <davincidiva> @KevinKileyCA I never would have had any faith that such a rapprochement was possible, and now even less so with a Biden/Harris White House and a possibly blue Senate. Why #RepealAB5 if #PROAct is around the corner? Pray for the Senate to stay red, or what happens in California won't matter.

I doubt it because she only officially represents one district that just re-elected her by a 70-30 margin v her opponent. But he was an unknown who didn‚Äôt campaign at all &amp; had zero budget (while unions fund her in the millions) so it was a significant protest vote

How much was ‚Äúenough money‚Äù to buy enough Assembly members to vote for your idiotic #AB5 in the first place? You‚Äôre the last person to talk about funding having undue influence on legislation.

Lorena wouldn‚Äôt even allow it to be heard, even threw our petition on the floor. She played for all the marbles &amp; lost. Now she can explain  to her union pals

Everything else stays as is...the way most drivers wanted it (at least the ones who drove part time )
1324353456191074304 2020-11-05 22:10:43 +0800 <davincidiva> @AppFraud @JasonAten Nope. If #Prop22  had (failed Lorena would be doing a victory dance saying it was proof her ‚Äúlife‚Äôs work‚Äù was oh so valid.  We‚Äôd be stuck with #AB5 forever. Now it has been invalidated for so many, #RepealAB5 has a fighting chance. PS anyone making $0.:30 should do something else

The latter IS, as you say, a ‚Äúvery bad law.‚Äù While we celebrate that @Uber, @Lyft et al are exempt, the rest of us #freelancers are still in a fight to #RepealAB5 for the rest of us.

Please look at the completely AVOIDABLE disaster that #AB5 has been in California and make the #PROAct something that supports ALL workers including those who choose self-employment.

Now AB5 looks even more indefensible. Sadly though, all the craven assemblypeople who were bribed to support it have kept their seats.
1324133253977165824 2020-11-05 07:35:43 +0800 <davincidiva> @walterkirn YES! but it will be a hollow victory if Biden (or Harris )signs the #PROAct if/when either of them becomes President. We need to fight to keep it from passing or defang it when it comes to the 59M people who choose to be independent contractors.

1324089938736893952 2020-11-05 04:43:36 +0800 <davincidiva> Exactly. Not only #freelancers voted for #YESonProp22 but the public who couldn't see why (and rightly so) ppl who have chosen to work for themselves should have to be employees. W2 jobs exist for those who want them. Taking choices away is not reasonable or fair. Now #RepealAB5
1324012542230843392 2020-11-04 23:36:03 +0800 <davincidiva> @brownd No. #AB5 was not on the ballot directly.

1323869446377594880 2020-11-04 14:07:26 +0800 <davincidiva> @LorenaSGonzalez Funny that all the people you pissed off with #AB5 text banked thousands of voters, gave media interviews, voted yes and told everyone they knew ‚Äî all for zero dollars. It wasn‚Äôt only money that caused this. But of course you won‚Äôt accept that.
1323868219040440321 2020-11-04 14:02:34 +0800 <davincidiva> @Hellburger99 Or what?
1323865193286299648 2020-11-04 13:50:32 +0800 <davincidiva> @Hellburger99 No. Uber did it for their business. Unions did #AB5 for theirs. They are both acting in their own self interest. The difference is, drivers DONT want to be W2 union members and they DO want the autonomy and tax advantages of independent contractor status.
1323861245540278272 2020-11-04 13:34:51 +0800 <davincidiva> @Hellburger99 They are in business not social work. So are unions, who spent proportionally at least as much (percentage-wise of their budget not in pure dollar terms) to buy hundreds of thousands of new dues-paying members. They are the ones behind #AB5 which #prop22 was created to combat.

1323857203074277377 2020-11-04 13:18:47 +0800 <davincidiva> @Hellburger99 Prop 22 gives benefits like 125% guaranteed minimum wage &amp; more. Most drivers only do it as a side hustle and don‚Äôt need sick days, OT etc. Those who drive F/T hours get more benefits. The only losers are unions who won‚Äôt get new members and dues now. That‚Äôs what this was about.

If that‚Äôs true let them wait until they are of age to make medical decisions, and express themselves as any gender they want in the meantime. Maybe never even bother to transition.
1323357417720086529 2020-11-03 04:12:49 +0800 <davincidiva> @FrankPatriot_ @Blondepatti1 I think it‚Äôs ok to let kids to express themselves in any way short of medical intervention. Makeup, dresses, new name, new pronouns, fine. If it‚Äôs more than a phase they can transition later. Blocking puberty or putting a child under the knife is abuse.

AB5 was about unions deciding for ppl who are NOT their members if we get to work. #YESon22

When lawmakers overreach, the people have to correct it. #YesOnProp22
1323025161063342080 2020-11-02 06:12:33 +0800 <davincidiva> @LorenaSGonzalez Omg as if unions don‚Äôt do EXACTLY THAT. And the #PROAct would even do away with secret ballots at meetings. You are the queen of #Gaslighting AND #projection as well!  #YesOnProp22

Gloria co-authored the union-instigated #AB5 which has been a disaster for small businesses and independent contractors in CA, and he has doubled down to enforce it in SD if elected

1322990188637741056 2020-11-02 03:53:35 +0800 <davincidiva> The #NoOnProp15 crowd jeer when we say if you want a W2 job get one. "During a PANDEMIC?!" Well, good news: Linkedin has a daily list of who's hiring now. Yes NOW. VOTE #YESonProp22 bc drivers do NOT want to be W2.

1322935319436554240 2020-11-02 00:15:33 +0800 <davincidiva> @LorenaSGonzalez Even if Uber complied with #AB5, this man would have received a few paid sick days, which would not have created a different ending to this story. #Prop22 offers new guarantees &amp; protections for drivers while protecting what's most important to THEM, their autonomy. #YESonProp22
1322934519800848384 2020-11-02 00:12:23 +0800 <davincidiva> @LorenaSGonzalez Shameless exploitation of a tragedy to forward your agenda. Uber did not kill this man. #AB5 HAS killed the careers of &gt;2M Californians, some of whom post about killing THEMSELVES because you destroyed their means of making a living &amp; even their reason for living. #YESonProp22
1322931439923388416 2020-11-02 00:00:08 +0800 <davincidiva> @AGHamilton29 Thank you. You got that right! NO ONE wants to be subject to #AB5,  and no one should be.

And these union members have more compassion &amp; solidarity with drivers who want to be IC than the Teamster Princess #YESonProp22

We can either stay mired in the  1930s or come up with new roles to fit the new paradigms. Drivers have some characteristics of contractors, some of employees, some of franchise owners, some of reps
1322344108011089920 2020-10-31 09:06:17 +0800 <davincidiva> @FredTopel @heygirl_143 @LorenaSGonzalez #AB5 sucks. It only helps union coffers &amp; punishes small business. Neither unions nor our government cares about the ppl they claim to "protect". All they want is more money and control and they are in an unholy alliance to seize it. #YESonProp22 for autonomy for all #freelancers

Sometimes supplemental is partially paid by a job as a perk but many ppl pay for it themselves, some don't buy it at all. Of course taxes and social charges are high. But i think today with telehealth costs could be less.
1322340959720411137 2020-10-31 08:53:47 +0800 <davincidiva> @heygirl_143 @Gailrgordon @LorenaSGonzalez I don't believe healthcare should be tied to employment. As far as universal I'm not convinced that gov't-run is the best way but yes if a workable and quality solution could be found. In France where I lived for many years they have universal basic, people pay for supplemental
1322333936299634689 2020-10-31 08:25:52 +0800 <davincidiva> @heygirl_143 @Gailrgordon @LorenaSGonzalez Tell me one job that gives full benefits and lets you show up whenever the mood strikes you, clock out at will, take breaks whenever you want as long as you want, and vacation w/o putting in for it. This is fantasy. W2 jobs don't only come with perks but also responsibilities.

I can't speak to that, only that ppl I know do, &amp; when I drove I averaged about $25-30. But then I only drove when I made money, found something else to do when it was slow. Why do something that doesn't pay?
1322301739131809792 2020-10-31 06:17:56 +0800 <davincidiva> @Forbes Well, she HAS called herself in a way that rhymes with "Pamela" on multiple occasions even though everyone insists it's "COMMA-lah". I don't know what the big deal is.

When I drove I was not taken advantage of. I don't think they'll "punish" drivers if #prop22 fails, but they will probably limit # of drivers &amp; set required hours, bc new model

They can't show up for work on a whim, take vacations w/o permission, or stay home w/a sick kid or parent. As far as paying pennies, some drivers I know earn $30-$50/hr #YESonProp22

1322258314068045824 2020-10-31 03:25:23 +0800 <davincidiva> If #NoOnProp22 passes, uber and other gig companies leave CA and @GavinNewsom gets the blame, so he will need to negotiate on #AB5. If #YESonProp22 passes, they are exempt &amp; #AB5 loses its main reason for being. Either way, this misbegotten, odious law is in trouble #RepealAB5
1322254043784179712 2020-10-31 03:08:24 +0800 <davincidiva> @LorenaSGonzalez P.S. We're not buying your transparent attempt to set up big business as the villain in this story. Everyone deserves an exemption from your terrible law, and everyone knows it.   #RepealAB5 #YESonProp22

Before they came along she had no breaks or lunch hour, had to come in early to grade papers with no OT, etc. Of course this was 1968. As someone told me recently, today's are NOT "Norma Rae's union"
1322251811915407366 2020-10-31 02:59:32 +0800 <davincidiva> @LorenaSGonzalez @Uber @lyft Welcome to California, where a woman who receives 6 figures for controlling every aspect of your life + millions from unions whose laws she passes, can lecture you with a straight face about how HORRIBLE it is that businesses make money. P.S. No one is forced to live in their car
1322251033138012161 2020-10-31 02:56:27 +0800 <davincidiva> @LorenaSGonzalez I'm STILL shocked daily that lawmakers see fit to deny adults their agency to work as they see fit, pretending to care about "workers" who are AGAINST their policies, while carrying water for interests who fund them and only want to control and profit off ALL labor. #YESonProp22
1322208125307420677 2020-10-31 00:05:57 +0800 <davincidiva> This is why #AB5 and #PROAct are wrong. If you want a union job, get a union job. Leave #Freelancers alone #YESonProp22

It's hard to believe we've had to spend this whole year fighting not just COVID, but our own lawmakers who say they want to "protect" us. They are protecting us right out of business &amp; I'm convinced that was the plan

Tell your friends in California to #RepealAB5 so #freelancers can get back to work. But you don't really care if people become homeless.

1321997196099612672 2020-10-30 10:07:47 +0800 <davincidiva> @LorenaSGonzalez Disgusting is being more loyal to the Teamsters &amp; Big Labor interests who bankroll you, than to the actual human beings whose lives your crappy laws affect. I'll take big business over your phony concern for workers any day. At least we know they're in it for profit #YESonProp22

She has zero compassion except crocodile tears for cameras and social media. She can't write a bill to save her life that doesn't require a bazilion exemptions. What she does have is ambition.

1321922629817659393 2020-10-30 05:11:29 +0800 <davincidiva> @EddieStephens83 @bryanculbertson @LorenaSGonzalez I agree in general &amp; if buying a car is the person's own idea, then fine. But for uber et al to have programs in place when they know the likely result is failure?The only way I can get behind it is if most succeed. If most fail, they should abort the program. Just my 2 cents.
1321921187342020608 2020-10-30 05:05:45 +0800 <davincidiva> @bryanculbertson @EddieStephens83 @LorenaSGonzalez It's "cool" for rideshare cos to tout the oppty (that's just advertising as Eddie says) but NOT if they trick ppl into buying cars they can't afford. Plus it's not the original concept that was SMART &amp; sustainable:leveraging unused vehicles/time. They are out of integrity here

I agree with you on this. However, #NoOnProp22 won't solve it &amp; I don't believe ppl who are NOT at risk should be punished &amp; lose their gig or the flexibility they signed up for. #YESonProp22

But from where I stand, they just didn't want to be subject to #AB5 -- like pretty much everyone else in California. AB5 is about turning EVERYONE not just gig drivers into W2 employees for unions' benefit

We should NOT take that away. #YESonProp22

The whole concept WAS to leverage unused resources you already have - a car and some free time, to give people a ride who need one, NOT to put more vehicles on the road and mire people in debt.

Or get that job and sell the car if they no longer need it? Families in debt make these choices all the time. They are only "trapped" if they insist on driving.

1321895743435628544 2020-10-30 03:24:39 +0800 <davincidiva> @yourbackseat It IS about me because Lorena Gonzalez was greedy and instead of making #AB5 apply ONLY to gig companies, saw the opportunity to remake all labor in her donors' image and outlaw nearly all 1099 work. the fixes are window dressing, most companies still won't touch CA #freelancers
1321895202609491968 2020-10-30 03:22:30 +0800 <davincidiva> @yourbackseat This is what CA #freelancers think of Lorena's "cleanup" bills. Even those who got some relief (she lifted the 35 submission cap for journos, photog and cartoonists even SHE admitted was "arbitrary")lost 9 months of work and most never got their gigs back. #YESonProp22 #RepealAB5  https://t.co/UfI3CjXFrl
1321894343511142401 2020-10-30 03:19:05 +0800 <davincidiva> @yourbackseat I'm NOT against unions. I'm against unions deciding for ME - who is NOT their member - whether or not I can be self-employed. My sister is a WGA member and my mom a longtime and proud member of the UFT in NYC. I never thought twice about unions until they outlawed my life w #AB5
1321893713367367680 2020-10-30 03:16:35 +0800 <davincidiva> @yourbackseat New York has seen the dumpster fire of #AB5 here in California and wisely pumped the brakes on #S6699A as NJ did on #S863 thanks to the tireless efforts of great #freelance writers like @thekimkavin   https://t.co/km05ZMShGp
1321892915455561728 2020-10-30 03:13:25 +0800 <davincidiva> @yourbackseat Like I don't know ALL about AB2257 &amp; how it still picks winner &amp; losers. FYI I have never worked for "below minimum wage" in my life. I object to "protections" for low wage workers used as an excuse by unions to outlaw ALL 1099 work. That's what #AB5 #S6699A(NY) and #PROact are.
1321891925427802113 2020-10-30 03:09:29 +0800 <davincidiva> @asthegirlturns This made me laugh, frankly

1321891032540213248 2020-10-30 03:05:56 +0800 <davincidiva> @yourbackseat You must not get much work as a writer/director/poet if you have not been affected by #AB5. This law makes it very hard to #freelance in film, theater, music, writing and other creative fields, or to hire a #freelancer.
1321890429252497413 2020-10-30 03:03:32 +0800 <davincidiva> @yourbackseat I live in San Diego, genius. Just like work, people have choices in where they live and don't stay stuck in one place. I've lived in California for 15 years and #AB5 has negatively impacted my life, the lives of all my friends in the arts and other #freelancers. #YESonProp22
1321887017085497345 2020-10-30 02:49:59 +0800 <davincidiva> @supitsshekinah Of course not. I agree this was the only possible outcome given the resources they had. But it seems crazy that better solutions aren't available (thinking of a Star Trek-like phaser set to "stun" - don't mean to kid about it but many things that used to be fiction are now real)
1321886501395865601 2020-10-30 02:47:56 +0800 <davincidiva> @MannyMota7 @MWPexplains @meow2008 @thekimkavin @TheDaleyAbides I agree that for jobs like McDonald's where people used to make the argument that it was just a "starter job" people SHOULD get a living wage and protections - they are working under the control and direction of the company, on their premises, for set hours. Gig work is not this.
1321885996355514368 2020-10-30 02:45:55 +0800 <davincidiva> @supitsshekinah Agree but in this case the man was mentally ill, and in this day and age there should be readily available technology to stop a person w/o killing them.  I know tasers are used for this but were not in this instance. I'm sure the cops would have preferred a different outcome.
1321883282741497856 2020-10-30 02:35:08 +0800 <davincidiva> @LorenaSGonzalez @MLB_PLAYERS Ah the utopia of the "good union job". What century is this? Are we doomed to be stuck forever with a model that's &gt;100 years old? people today want CHOICES. If you want a union job, get one. No reason all work must be the same. The "work is work" argument is idiocy. #YESonProp22

However, failing unions need warm bodies &amp; dues money to stay alive. So they created #AB5 to monopolize all labor and outlaw independent contracting/self-employment. #YESonProp22 #MyLaborMyChoice

The whole rideshare concept is people giving each other rides in their spare time, using the cars they ALREADY own. This is a GOOD idea. Putting more cars on the road and encouraging people to go into debt is not.

NO one wants companies to get away with mistreating ppl or not paying them what they deserve.

How do you know the retention rate is because the job is "terrible" ? How about the rentetion is what it is because the job is TRANSIENT? I drove when I needed to, quit when I didn't. That's what side work is for. People quit bc they find something better

As for greed, take a look at your union buddies who shoved AB5 down  our throats just so they could generate more dues-paying members to line their pockets and those of Lorena

We KNOW #prop22 doesn't address other #freelancers. WE. DON'T. CARE. We want EVERYONE exempt from #AB5. We know that #YESonProp22 will help #RepealAB5 bc it will have even less reason for being. And yes -- we want our oppressors to lose.

Now we know the role unions played and the reasons they played it: all those juicy drivers to shore up their failing membership, plus outlaw 1099. #Prop22 guts #AB5.
1320879145128083456 2020-10-27 08:05:03 +0800 <davincidiva> @bryanculbertson @LorenaSGonzalez Anything that chips away at #AB5 is a win for ALL #freelancers. Most drivers want #prop22 passed and NO ONE asked them if they wanted "protection" of #AB5 (they do NOT) VOTE  #YesOnProp22  If it pisses off Lorena then that's just a bonus.

Our gov't and their union donors really want to make it impossible to be an independent contractor in California. Here is another opinion in favor of #YesOnProp22  https://t.co/56D9R9axoG
1320845368062480386 2020-10-27 05:50:50 +0800 <davincidiva> Vote YES on #Prop22 because everyone deserves the choice to be an independent contractor. #AB5 took that away from virtually everyone in California. #YESonProp22 restores it to gig workers, who overwhelmingly prefer it. If you want a W2 job, by all means get one. Live &amp; let live

It solved a big problem when my business was slow and my husband's business also and we support my mother in law with cancer. Driving covered bills at a crucial time. When things turned around I quit, but grateful I had the opportunity

I am a fierce opponent of #AB5 that killed the livelihoods of millions of happy #freelancers starting Jan 1,  in which we had zero say.  I have been fighting it unpaid for 10 months. #YESonProp22 only affects gig workers but is a blow to #AB5 &amp; will help #RepealAB5

If they are making less than min wage they should stop driving and do something better with their time Or ask someone who is succeeding (they do exist) for advice, because they are doing it wrong.

People call it a "job" but they just mean they don't want to lose their ability to drive when they want. Doing what you want when you want is not a job. But it is great sidework for the right person.

As a passenger i'd be happy to pay few $ more so the drivers could be paid better. right now I just give good tips.

It's great as a side gig for people who like to drive at their convenience and can do it at profitable times: retirees, teachers, writers, college students and #freelancers like me who have downtime
1320837095678619648 2020-10-27 05:17:58 +0800 <davincidiva> Vote YES on #prop22 not bc of who paid to get it on the ballot, but because 80% of drivers -- the people actually affected -- WANT it to pass &amp; keep their freedom. Only union interests are #NoOnProp22 , because they need everyone to be W2 so they can be unionized. #YESonProp22  https://t.co/OJFOgdCGGC

They are voting with their custom. All businesses are allowed to iterate &amp; improve, even borrowing from the competition. I don't care who was 1st. Point is, competition makes any product better; monopoly makes it worse.

1319853569558728705 2020-10-24 12:09:47 +0800 <davincidiva> @TheSoulCab @LorenaSGonzalez @mclanea Curb was not introduced to the public until after Uber/Lyft came on the scene. I‚Äôm convinced it never would have been developed if not for competition from rideshare. I‚Äôm not regurgitating anything, I‚Äôm a New Yorker and these are my impressions. No one gives me talking points.

Now there is an app called Curb for NYC cabs that make them as convenient as Uber/Lyft. Uber made taxis better That‚Äôs what progress and competition do in a free market.

1319743252816293888 2020-10-24 04:51:25 +0800 <davincidiva> This is too true. A year ago I was üíØ unaware of any of this.

1319654085088268288 2020-10-23 22:57:06 +0800 <davincidiva> @margotroosevelt @jclarachan Sadly, to get one's views heard these days one has to get creative. So much media real estate has already been bought and paid for. If you want a free press we should enforce diversity of thought in news organizations. Otherwise all teams just pay for their own uniforms.
1319653203680489472 2020-10-23 22:53:36 +0800 <davincidiva> @thekimkavin @LorenaSGonzalez Exactly, I just tweeted this. My mother taught me to pee before I left the house and plan where I could go during the day when I was FIVE. That's the mental age @LorenaSGonzalez thinks drivers and voters are. We are not children, our work is not lollipops. #YESonProp22 #NOProAct
1319652305029922816 2020-10-23 22:50:02 +0800 <davincidiva> @AgainstAb5 @KevinKileyCA I'll settle for working in their comms dept. :-)
1319652111706066944 2020-10-23 22:49:16 +0800 <davincidiva> It's simple:   #YESon22 means drivers keep the #freedom they signed up for + improvements incl. 125% min wage. 4/5 of drivers WANT this outcome.  #NOonProp22 means @uber &amp; @lyft leave CA &amp; ALL drivers lose work. IF they stay, drivers get meaningless benefits in swap for freedom
1319649308891725825 2020-10-23 22:38:07 +0800 <davincidiva> @AgainstAb5 Thanks but I'd shoot myself if I had to actually sit through the sessions I've been watching on livestream. I'm grateful for those who serve like @KevinKileyCA . On the other hand, attitudes like mine allow grifters like Lorena to exploit &amp; sell their power to the highest bidder.
1319648109291474945 2020-10-23 22:33:21 +0800 <davincidiva> @LorenaSGonzalez People just walking around NYC have a similar app. Adults who choose and plan to be away from home or office for a period of time know how to take care of their own bodily functions. Apparently @LorenaSGonzalez thinks they need their mama to help them pee. This app is great.

1319484760473792512 2020-10-23 11:44:16 +0800 <davincidiva> Why are unions at the table to discuss whether people who are not and never will be their members can work?

I still have a bank account in France because I lived and worked there for 12 years. It's convenient when I work with clients there. Sorry it's a nothingburger.
1319118351138836481 2020-10-22 11:28:17 +0800 <davincidiva> Anything regarding labor law to which @LorenaSGonzalez @LorenaAD80 says "Yes please" I say "No thank you." Only less politely. I don't think I'm alone, am I?  #RepealAB5 #YESonProp22 #MyLaborMyChoice #NOPROAct  https://t.co/vzjjlhsL7d

At the same time - if unions were not so intransigent, both those driver could have what they want,  different tiers that leaves the choice or whether to be W2 to the driver
1319009948043407360 2020-10-22 04:17:32 +0800 <davincidiva> Very impressed with @KevinKileyCA ! I hope he is not too smart for the judge. The comments on the FB live seem to indicate otherwise.

Not ONE was for #AB5 IF they even knew about it. They were never consulted if they wanted to be W2. Did you forget @LorenaSGonzalez @LorenaAD80? #YesOnProp22
1318902801293053955 2020-10-21 21:11:46 +0800 <davincidiva> "Listening to what drivers want" - what a concept! You should try it someday @LorenaSGonzalez @LorenaAD80 and throw in the rest of us #freelancers for good measure. If you had, there never would have been #AB5. But we know the voices you listen to and it's NOT WTP #YesOnProp22
1318901821524508673 2020-10-21 21:07:52 +0800 <davincidiva> @LorenaSGonzalez @dkhos Convenient you cite the ONLY CA newspaper that is against #Prop22. Both you and they are disingenuous. For example, there is NO OVERTIME when you choose your own hours. OT is when the boss MAKES you work extra hours. Everyone knows this, jjust one reason why #YesOnProp22 passes.

Just bc @uber paid for #Prop22 and wants it to pass, doesn't mean it isn't what the VAST majority of drivers ALSO want, not to mention ALL #freelancers in CA affected by #AB5. #YESonProp22 #FreedomforFreelancers #RepealAB4 #MyLaborMyChoice

1315315481579065344 2020-10-11 23:37:02 +0800 <davincidiva> @deadeyebrakeman What do you think of the rest of #AB5 though? Do you think other #freelancers &amp; #smallbusinessowner  should not be able to work as an independent contractor or hire one? Because that's what that law has done since Jan 1 in California. ( context: #Prop22 exempts gig cos from AB5)
1315313945733988353 2020-10-11 23:30:56 +0800 <davincidiva> OMG this may require a trip to Indianapolis!  https://t.co/7TDS3v4YR7

There was never ANY debate in which the people had a say in AB5. There may have been some random lawsuits but certainly no ‚Äúday in court‚Äù. That‚Äôs why we are still fighting and we are #YesonProp22

Prop 22 was created to EXEMPT some companies and contractors from AB5. Everyone should be exempt from AB5, BECAUSE it‚Äôs a shit law. I hope that clears it up for you. #YESonProp22

Any benefit to them is incidental.

This should be fixed for sure if it is indeed a big problem.  Like the ‚Äúmostly peaceful protests‚Äù a mostly sober driver pool can do a lot of damage and is not good enough. But it has nothing to do with #YesOnProp22 so I‚Äôll punt

We are in no way affiliated with @Uber or any gig co. We are voting yes for our own reasons.

We can neither work nor hire independent contractors as the rest of of the US can. I am fixing my own websites &amp; doing my own admin BC I don‚Äôt have enough work for a person to be on payroll and can‚Äôt hire virtual assistants w/AB5

Meanwhile Uber operating as it is saves thousands of DUIs a year. If I were  MADD I wouldn‚Äôt be looking to change it or drive it out of California
1314920463739482113 2020-10-10 21:27:23 +0800 <davincidiva> The #AB5 casualties continue to pile up. Now a 17-year youth soccer league serving underprivileged kids dies BC @LorenaAD80 doesn‚Äôt know it takes more than coaches to run it.

1314422833544523777 2020-10-09 12:29:58 +0800 <davincidiva> @asthegirlturns @WordyPearls All the Hollywood types are pushing no, conjuring tragic stories of people ‚Äúforce to drive insane hours and live in their cars. This may happen, I suppose, and it pulls on the heartstrings, but no Uber driver I know wants to be W2. The ones on here have an agenda. #YESonProp22
1314421429895532551 2020-10-09 12:24:24 +0800 <davincidiva> @slack2thefuture Prop 22 is not a ‚Äúworse‚Äù law than #AB5. It exempts gig companies  from AB5 ‚Äî and EVERYONE should be exempt from AB5. It‚Äôs a crap law that needs to be repealed and go back to the drawing board for truly misclassified people only. That may include some but not all gig workers.
1314420358515023874 2020-10-09 12:20:08 +0800 <davincidiva> @monkeyes @slack2thefuture @ViralstyleLLC It‚Äôs a great cartoon! No wonder they stole it.
1314418741589893120 2020-10-09 12:13:43 +0800 <davincidiva> @slack2thefuture Next time you take an Uber ask the driver what THEY think of #AB5 and prop 22. You may be surprised. I have not met one who wants to be made W2. There may be sad stories of people for whom it doesn‚Äôt work but they are the minority. AB5 is a union creation for unions not workers
1314415674161152001 2020-10-09 12:01:32 +0800 <davincidiva> @slack2thefuture Oh and also these are not ‚Äúother people‚Äù. I was a driver myself and many people I know still are. They also do other things like writing and caring for elderly parents. None of us want to be employees of Uber.
1314415253996793857 2020-10-09 11:59:51 +0800 <davincidiva> @slack2thefuture Prop 22 exempts people from #AB5. Gig workers WANT to remain independent by a 4:1 margin. And btw my business has not suffered nearly as much as others. I‚Äôm fighting for them and for everyone who wants to retain their right to choose to be an independent contractor. #YesOnProp22
1314407384152858624 2020-10-09 11:28:35 +0800 <davincidiva> @slack2thefuture @Henderson_Joe I understand. But #freelancers have suffered # under #AB5 all year and its author has only mocked us. She is bought ($2M+)by the labor unions behind AB5. If 22 fails she will tout that as confirmation of AB5 and we will be stuck with it forever. We vote #YESonProp22 to #RepealAB5
1314393533122400257 2020-10-09 10:33:33 +0800 <davincidiva> @pilotspeaker Now you tell me
1314393250489266176 2020-10-09 10:32:25 +0800 <davincidiva> @slack2thefuture @Henderson_Joe Now you know what it‚Äôs like to live under a supermajority in the CA legislature. That‚Äôs the only reason #AB5 was passed in the first place, outlawing the livelihoods of millions of 1099 #freelancers just minding their own business.
1314384705802792960 2020-10-09 09:58:28 +0800 <davincidiva> @megmccool00 @BrettGWeise @stepshep @wuzhappn1 It‚Äôs 19k now! And agree with the rest of your statement.
1314384359269396480 2020-10-09 09:57:05 +0800 <davincidiva> @BrettGWeise @stepshep For our purposes (#freelancers and #smallbusiness unfairly impacted by #AB5) it‚Äôs as close to a referendum as we are going to get. That‚Äôs why we are all voting #YesOnProp22. Too bad Uber had to pay for it and might benefit from it, but it is what it is. #RepealAB5
1314381146570907648 2020-10-09 09:44:20 +0800 <davincidiva> @Grp_Stat_Tutor @born_summer62 @KevinKileyCA Go ahead but I can tell by your tweets that you don‚Äôt quite understand the issue or the dynamics here. If gig workers are subject to #AB5 then we ALL are, forever. Lorena wins.
1314354191649841152 2020-10-09 07:57:13 +0800 <davincidiva> @Grp_Stat_Tutor @born_summer62 @KevinKileyCA Dude. #AB5 cannot have a ballot measure until 2022 because statewide ballot measures are only every 2 years. People can‚Äôt wait that long. We need #YesOnProp22 to make #AB5 so ridiculous that #RepealAB5 is the only option, in Assembly not on a vote
1314353625993367552 2020-10-09 07:54:58 +0800 <davincidiva> @Grp_Stat_Tutor @KevinKileyCA Prop 22 EXEMPTS gig companies from #AB5. That means that the law that was supposedly designed for them would NOT apply to them. The only people left would be the collateral damage. It sucks but we have to pass #YesOnProp22 to have any chance to #RepealAB5 next year.
1314352848231002113 2020-10-09 07:51:53 +0800 <davincidiva> @TerriEClary @KevinKileyCA Most #freelancers I know are voting #YesOnProp22 . We believe this will gut #AB5 and make it easier to justify #RepealAB5 especially if the Democrats loose the supermajority. If 22 fails #AB5 is here to stay, and I will leave the state.
1314352086620925957 2020-10-09 07:48:51 +0800 <davincidiva> @Cynnamine @KevinKileyCA Bs. Gig Drivers work when they want. Uber isn‚Äôt a sweatshop factory. If they drive 40h a week consistently then MAYBE make new rules for those drivers only. Instead #AB5 put ALL CA independent contractors out of work, BC unions. That‚Äôs why #freelancers will vote #YesOnProp22

For example festivals, nonprofits &amp; tours are SOL. The law has 75+ exemptions &amp; still sucks. Needs to go

It lifts the 35- submission cap that even Lorena admitted was ‚Äúarbitrary‚Äù but many have lost clients forever in the interim &amp; the poison pill language makes outlets afraid to work w CA #freelancers

You want to be mad at someone, be mad at Lorena Gonzalez. it's her stupid #AB5 that caused this whole debacle. If she'd targeted ONLY gig companies, we wouldn't be here now. She went too far when she outlawed virtually all 1099 work.

The whole law should be repealed. Since it was allegedly targeted at gig companies, it should have applied ONLY to them. But Lorena Gonzalez &amp; co went too far. Prop 22 will gut #AB5. They must start over.

1313326604970467328 2020-10-06 11:53:57 +0800 <davincidiva> @omaryak @dtr300 @pinkydmd @Avogato13 @MMFlint @BrookingsInst @EconomicPolicy @freelancersu The REAL and CURRENT cruelty is to the #freelancers who have had 100% of their income stripped by #AB5 since Jan 1. I won't apologize or accept punishment for being skilled. Also 80% of drivers prefer to remain IC and #YESonProp22 gives them a better deal than they have now.
1313326082133696512 2020-10-06 11:51:53 +0800 <davincidiva> @LorenaSGonzalez Thanks for the handy voting guide. Planning to vote #YesonProp22 #YESonProp20 and no on everything else. So is everyone else I know and everyone I'll talk to this month.

We have NO ISSUE with our clients, and if we do we leave. P.S. @freelancersu is bogus.

1313315336565878785 2020-10-06 11:09:11 +0800 <davincidiva> @LorenaSGonzalez @Sports_A_Holic You ghoul, only COVID caused them to appeal and only at your encouragement. You needed a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic to justify your overreaching #AB5. Meanwhile you prevented millions from working AT ALL so some people you intentionally confused could MAYBE receive some benefits
1313293942113198080 2020-10-06 09:44:10 +0800 <davincidiva> @SacBirdie @KevinKileyCA Lots of people asking if it's a parody account but no.

1313287443886432256 2020-10-06 09:18:20 +0800 <davincidiva> Hey @KevinKileyCA have your seen the latest?! Unreal.
1313285448257605632 2020-10-06 09:10:25 +0800 <davincidiva> @WendyLNDF So sorry! What a shock. It is sad you didn't have longer together.
1313284661750099969 2020-10-06 09:07:17 +0800 <davincidiva> @Gunn4DG @ThatVeganBitch So I'm going to take a leaf from Veena's book and block them.  Arguing with a shill is a waste of time.
1313284321671696386 2020-10-06 09:05:56 +0800 <davincidiva> @Gunn4DG @ThatVeganBitch Also, they accuse us of being supported by Uber and Lyft when it's obvious we are here for our own reasons irrespective of them. That's the kind of accusation that someone who was REALLY being paid would make.
1313283660230008832 2020-10-06 09:03:18 +0800 <davincidiva> @Gunn4DG @ThatVeganBitch I don't believe this person is being genuine, Their story doesn't add up. Their agenda is too neatly aligned with the Veena talking points. And most of all, they refuse to acknowledge that one person's experience doesn't mean we outlaw a way of life. #fake #RepealAB5 #YESonProp22

However there is the old saying, "The enemy of my enemy is my friend." Lorena didn't need to make so many enemies. She could've gone after gig companies only &amp; left the rest of us alone. Instead she &amp; unions chose to be greedy. Payback time.

NO, getting people the truth, which we certainly didn't get from our government. 80% of drivers want to remain IC. 100% of #freelancers hate #AB5 and were never consulted if we wanted Lorena's "help" or "protection." #YESonProp22

I trusted my elected officials not to ruin my life without giving me a voice. #AB5 changed that. Uber paid for #YESonProp22? So what? Works for me!

Not everyone is made to be an IC. Your experience is certainly valid for you, but it does not invalidate the experience of anyone else, nor justify taking away their choice. #YESonProp22 #RepealAB5 #MyLaborMyChoice
1312918199709495296 2020-10-05 08:51:06 +0800 <davincidiva> @morrisnelson @Gunn4DG @MonicaInterpre1 @LorenaSGonzalez What she was referring to was "they shouldn't f*ing have to" work more than one gig. What she missed or didn't want to acknowledge is that many don't "have to" have more than 1 gig or client, we WANT to. It's called  creativity, enterprise, hustle - none of which she understands.

I heard of a recent $2M influx. Of course I could be off by a few dollars. And before anyone compares the amount to that invested in #YESonProp22 it's apples &amp; oranges. Over $2M to 1 private individual is a fortune.  https://t.co/Cvf6MuIfN8

1312902134032027648 2020-10-05 07:47:15 +0800 <davincidiva> They're only about that because YOU MADE THEM be about that. I say they're about wage orders in ONE industry, full stop. And your #AB5 is "about" #uniongreed, #CAleg overreach, #Corruption and influence peddling. Just so we're all perfectly clear. #RepealAB5 #YESonProp22
1312894982034919424 2020-10-05 07:18:50 +0800 <davincidiva> @LorenaSGonzalez His Holiness seems like a good guy, some even say infallible. Yet you cancel him out. I'm sure he didn't call for the extermination of millions of #freelance careers in order to achieve the aim of protecting gig workers, as you did. #AB5isEvil  #YESonProp22 to #RepealAB5
1312893368632963072 2020-10-05 07:12:26 +0800 <davincidiva> @SacBirdie @KevinKileyCA win-win!
1312887440864993282 2020-10-05 06:48:52 +0800 <davincidiva> @No_Blue_Mondays Because then the STATE can take care of you -- just as @LorenaSGonzalez planned
1312886987641163776 2020-10-05 06:47:04 +0800 <davincidiva> @KevinKileyCA Insanity -- all because he CAN. Hope your suit is successful. Michigan gives me hope. If not that (preferable as it would set precedent for future CA tyrants) then the recall effort.
1312724853007372292 2020-10-04 20:02:48 +0800 <davincidiva> This. We should ALL have had a chance to vote on #AB5, a law that ruined so many lives totally, while ‚Äúhelping ‚Äú some only in theory. #YESonProp22 is as close as we get to having a voice.
1312720606421368840 2020-10-04 19:45:56 +0800 <davincidiva> Proud of your handiwork @LorenaSGonzalez @LorenaAD80 ? Another formerly happy working person you ‚Äúprotected‚Äù right out of our state.
1312717481354518528 2020-10-04 19:33:31 +0800 <davincidiva> That‚Äôs funny, it reminds me of the importance of NOT being an employee. Spoken like a woman who really believes someone else should be in control of your life. I‚Äôm only RTing her nonsense BC she blocked comments #RepealAB5 #YesOnProp22 #VoteThemAllOut2020
1312623902305124352 2020-10-04 13:21:40 +0800 <davincidiva> @LorenaSGonzalez To us, ‚Äúthey‚Äù is YOU. #RepealAB5 #YesOnProp22
1312622642810109952 2020-10-04 13:16:40 +0800 <davincidiva> @R_Good_Fellow @LorenaSGonzalez Yup
1312504995267239936 2020-10-04 05:29:10 +0800 <davincidiva> And this is why every California #freelancer will vote #YESonProp22 whether they are a gig worker or not. #AB5 has effectively killed 1099 work in our state. @LorenaSGonzalez knows this; in fact it was her intention, bc it was what her union backers planned all along. #RepealAB5
1312504242708475905 2020-10-04 05:26:11 +0800 <davincidiva> @LorenaSGonzalez @kaaawababy And risk being accused of having "replaced an employee?" Most every media outlet has fired staffers in 2020. If they bring on a #freelancer now, easy for EDD to say they took someone's job and fine them. Your poison pill language still screws writers &amp; media alike, &amp; you know it.
1312502928041631744 2020-10-04 05:20:57 +0800 <davincidiva> @Klynnw23 @LorenaSGonzalez @LorenaAD80 Yeah i think this question answers itself. #RepealAB5 VOTE #YESonProp22 #VoteThemAllOut2020
1312226754950356994 2020-10-03 11:03:33 +0800 <davincidiva> @quietlifedesign @Marc_Topaz @coalition_ca @darakerr Yes I am one of them. @darakerr you realize it‚Äôs possible for some people to be paid during a campaign &amp; others to vote similarly, for their own reasons? Paying for support certainly seems to have worked for the unions. But of course, they expect to have a monopoly on everything.
1312225725886287874 2020-10-03 10:59:27 +0800 <davincidiva> @KevinKileyCA I thought of you when I saw that!

1311478083325554688 2020-10-01 09:28:35 +0800 <davincidiva> @aborunda @Vogel4Assembly This is BS. Their ‚Äúworkers‚Äù prefer to remain independent contractors by a margin of 4:1 . #AB5 is nothing but a union power &amp; money grab. Unions paid to elect their agent Lorena Gonzalez &amp; they want what they paid for. They‚Äôve been outbid. #sorrynotsorry #YESonProp22 #RepealAB5
1311476968538300416 2020-10-01 09:24:10 +0800 <davincidiva> @aborunda @Vogel4Assembly The point is people want and deserve choice. #AB5 takes that away from legit independent contractors who neither want nor need unions or benefits like OT or min wage. #RepealAB5
1311471674856939520 2020-10-01 09:03:07 +0800 <davincidiva> @ssmith_calabor @Uber @lyft Having the choice to be ones own boss is fundamental to a democratic society too. #AB5 was a blunt instrument that did not allow these 2 ideas to co-exist, thereby ruining lifelong careers. All BC unions refused to live and let live. That‚Äôs why #YESOnProp22 will pass. Do-over!

1311411117810311168 2020-10-01 05:02:29 +0800 <davincidiva> So glad to see Dr. Weber @AsmShirleyWeber grow a heart &amp; a conscience, but she is more than a day late and a dollar short.

1311373901235023874 2020-10-01 02:34:36 +0800 <davincidiva> So while @LorenaAD80 grandstands by tweeting "F*ck @elonmusk " and poking @uber, they'll all survive.

You're the one who doesn't know what you're talking about.

So #AB5 stops me working, or if I somehow manage to get W2 gigs I didn't want, it gets me paid LESS, I can't negotiate my own rates, I pay for nonexistent benefits and I no longer can deduct my supplies from my taxes

Unless heaven forbid #PROAct passes, work once performed by CA residents will continue to go to #freelancers in other states, as it is doing now. Writers, etc.

It ENDED livelihoods Jan 1 well b4 #COVID. Then when EVERYONE was working from home, only Californians were not allowed to freelance on sites like upwork and Rev.

No one even asked drivers if they wanted #AB5 before it was shoved down their throats to "protect them."
1308535532733882368 2020-09-23 06:35:57 +0800 <davincidiva> @DJeff_79 @LorenaSGonzalez Intelligence is not a prerequisite for a career in government, as we have daily proof.
1308535016423485443 2020-09-23 06:33:53 +0800 <davincidiva> @JeremyBWhite @RebeccaARainey Yes we in California were the unfortunate guinea pigs. If our suffering under #AB5 can at least be a cautionary tale to save the rest of the US from the ABC test, at least it will not have been for nothing. #RepealAB5 #YESonProp22 #NOPROAct #MyLaborMyChoice

In the minds of these politicians who have never worked in the private sector, employers "should just give" everyone who works for them the cake &amp; let them eat it too. They are mistaking private enterprise for the gov't with its bottomless piggy bank and entitlements

I suspect unions may lose some interest when their main prize is off the table &amp; some politicians won't be able to keep defending it
1308486609709330433 2020-09-23 03:21:32 +0800 <davincidiva> @thekimkavin @Thelmavrh Maybe while everyone is losing their mind over #SCOTUSnominee this can get established and save other states and possibly the whole country (except my godforsaken adopted state)

1308484766065258496 2020-09-23 03:14:13 +0800 <davincidiva> Yes, @LorenaSGonzalez that's the whole point, WE DON'T WANT our flexibility "in the hands of the employer" - we want it in OURS.

However, you do have rights and accommodations should be made to allow workers more choices not less. Drivers should be able to opt for an employee model. But unions want it ALL

1306764787733262336 2020-09-18 09:19:38 +0800 <davincidiva> @afreaknamedali @wuzhappn1 @megmccool00 @StevePuterski @LorenaSGonzalez Anyone CAN be W2. But if you are, don't expect your boss to let you work whenever you want. Also, even W2 workers don't get healthcare unless they work enough hours &amp; if you're W2 the boss determines your hours, usually just few enough not to qualify. Ask any McDonald's worker.

People who filled out forms complaining about #AB5 noticed the forms themselves had "AFL-CIO" printed on them 6. Many of us #freelancers fighting #AB5 have been called "scabs" &amp; "bootlickers" by union-allied people 7. LG makes no secret of her true allegiance (It's not to us)  https://t.co/tSlSAzYAqA

Then they (&amp; Veena Dubal allegedly) wrote #AB5 so LG could "author"&amp; pass it 3. unions have been at the table for ALL exemption discussions 4. Even during COVID not one Democrat supported suspension
1306760695392862211 2020-09-18 09:03:22 +0800 <davincidiva> This is one reason why #AB5 hurts so much - those of us who have been aged out of our industries were able to earn a healthy living #freelance until it took that away. What's left? Are 50+ y.o. educated professionals now supposed to work $15/hr W2 jobs at Home Depot? #RepealAB5
1306724321818062850 2020-09-18 06:38:50 +0800 <davincidiva> @afreaknamedali @Briana_Sharp @LorenaSGonzalez @wuzhappn1 @megmccool00 @StevePuterski That's a workaround but it looks realyl unprofessional. People want to bring me onto THEIR project with THEIR client. It's just a short term arrangement, I'm not their employee just sub on this. If client pays each sub directly it's a clerical nightmare and looks bad for her.
1306654340782800896 2020-09-18 02:00:45 +0800 <davincidiva> @afreaknamedali @megmccool00 @StevePuterski @LorenaSGonzalez I used to think like you but now I'm convinced the consequences WERE intended. Unions who pay them  simply refuse to live and let live. As long as independent contractors (who can't be unionized) exist, they're not happy. If #AB5 can be revised enough to allow freedom I'd buy it

Taskrabbit is awesome, and I know both users and workers who love it. It really facilitates people helping each other and designing their work around their lives.

1306443439215489025 2020-09-17 12:02:43 +0800 <davincidiva> @ssmith_calabor I'm sure they'd prefer to keep their money. Prop 22 wouldn't be necessary if our "democratically" ELECTED lawmakers did their jobs instead of the bidding of the special interests who pay them to shoveTHEIR laws down our throats.

1306376131902238721 2020-09-17 07:35:15 +0800 <davincidiva> Happy birthday, and thanks for all the presents @LorenaSGonzalez

A couple are screenwriters, half a dozen retirees including schoolteachers and building contractors, some college students, others. Most make (or made before COVID) a few hundred dollars a week but it wasn't their sole income.
1306371015090421760 2020-09-17 07:14:55 +0800 <davincidiva> @Klynnw23 @politicninja @unionista27 Mostly because the majority of them have OTHER JOBS or retirement/pensions and only drive for extra cash in their spare time. Being an employee would limit their earning potential and their freedom in when and how much to drive - the very reasons the joined in the first place.
1306339951571660800 2020-09-17 05:11:29 +0800 <davincidiva> @GigWorkersRise @megmccool00 It seems to me that number was arrived at because of the supermajority. It would force there to be bipartisan support for any change even allowing for the imbalance. Ironically, the supermajority will be gone or at least much less on Nov. 4. You can thank Lorena Gonzales for that
1306338720618954752 2020-09-17 05:06:36 +0800 <davincidiva> @asthegirlturns The only reason we need that now is to protect ourselves NOT against big bad corporate employers but our own government. #RepealAB5 #YESonProp22 #NOPROAct

It's not only the money being spent on the ballot measure, It's not even UNPAID grassroots people like us. It's that EVERYONE in CA knows someone who drives, and NOT ONE of them wants to be an employee. They ALL hate #AB5.

Not even a FAQ page. For something where getting it wrong could mean a 25k fine. And they wonder why no one will touch CA ppl with a 10 foot pole. #RepealAB5 #YesOnProp22

1306018451383705600 2020-09-16 07:53:58 +0800 <davincidiva> @RaychelTania @NYGovCuomo Turns out the hospitals didn't want the elderly because medicaid doesn't pay as much as other insurance. They wanted to save those beds for the more profitable patients, and told Cuomo so. So back to the nursing homes they went.

This happens every year or nearly. Nothing is done, but sure let's tax people more, spend it on a bullet train to nowhere, and when the fires come, use it to advance a political agenda
1306017281399545858 2020-09-16 07:49:19 +0800 <davincidiva> @JPatrice4080 @GavinNewsom @KamalaHarris I call out bullshit when I see it. Our governor has changed 400 laws by himself while leaving ppl to starve under #AB5. He's exploited COVID &amp; the fires to claim unprecedented powers for which he is being sued. Now he smirks in a smoldering forest claiming "Climate change, 100%".
1306011406727294979 2020-09-16 07:25:58 +0800 <davincidiva> @JPatrice4080 @GavinNewsom @KamalaHarris I didn't start anything. "Huh?" suggest you disagree, or you question my intelligence or my motives.

1306009980458369024 2020-09-16 07:20:18 +0800 <davincidiva> @JPatrice4080 @GavinNewsom @KamalaHarris So I guess the 62 people who liked my comment got it... sorry you didn't.
1306009784504725505 2020-09-16 07:19:31 +0800 <davincidiva> @WhoopteedooCA @GavinNewsom @KamalaHarris Climate change may contribute, but he's making it out to be the entire cause, ignoring the decades of fuel left to rot on the forest floor. And on HIS watch, after Paradise and parts of Napa burned to the ground, *nothing* changed(except the climate apparently)
1306005969420398594 2020-09-16 07:04:22 +0800 <davincidiva> This is unacceptable &amp; I'm sorry @LorenaSGonzalez has received these horrific DMs. However, I don't believe they are the reason she closed her public comments. That happened because she's tired of dealing with the legit blowback her policies have caused. #RepealAB5 #YESonProp22
1306004443029094400 2020-09-16 06:58:18 +0800 <davincidiva> @Emilio__CA @Avogato13 Nor I. Unions can be great. My mom was a schoolteacher in NYC for decades. Her union helped a lot. What I mind is unions making policy like #AB5 for us who are NOT their members. I‚Äôve had a labor lawyer calling me a ‚Äúscab‚Äù on this platform for daring to want to work for myself!
1306000136703627265 2020-09-16 06:41:11 +0800 <davincidiva> @Emilio__CA @Avogato13 Very clever. Independent Contractors can't be unionized; employees can. Unions can't get their hands on all those warm IC bodies unless/until they are employees. That's why they WROTE #AB5,  why they paid to get LG elected, why they've been at EVERY meeting on exemptions. But OK.
1305999319237971968 2020-09-16 06:37:56 +0800 <davincidiva> @Emilio__CA @Avogato13 I am legitimately concerned about my chosen livelihood being made illegal because the unions paying Lorena Gonzalez wanted it that way. #ThatIsAll #RepealAB5 #YESonProp22 #MyLaborMyChoice #NOPROAct

Now multiply that by ALL the @AssemblyDems who are taking big money from big labor. We are literally being governed by unelected donors #YESonProp22
1305986354841440256 2020-09-16 05:46:25 +0800 <davincidiva> @Emilio__CA It's not "limited &amp; regulated" enough, b/c the amounts are relative. Millions spent on an ad campaign is a drop in the ocean, maybe you swing a few votes. But if you put $1.4M in my POCKET, as unions did with @LorenaSGonzalez, you can bet I work for YOU, not those who elected me.  https://t.co/0D1GGaVPkT
1305985238997151744 2020-09-16 05:41:59 +0800 <davincidiva> @Emilio__CA They didn't have to spend a dime to convince me. Nor  anyone I know. We all know people who drive: retirees, high school math teachers, aspiring screenwriters, chatty grandparents who need to supplement social security. Not one of them wants to be Uber's employee. #YESonProp22

1305981863622709248 2020-09-16 05:28:34 +0800 <davincidiva> @Emilio__CA So what you‚Äôre saying is both buy influence, the only difference is the price tag. I actually have more of a problem with money being given DIRECTLY to lawmakers as a convincer to act against their constituents interests, regardless of the amount.

We want #YESonProp22 so that at least gig workers can be free to be independent contractors, on the way to #RepealAB5

Your being a driver is just a distraction. BTW I was one too and could be again if I put @lyft back on my dashboard, and I say #YESonProp22 So we cancel each other out.

Of course same-sex contact shouldn't be treated differently, but 14 is too young &amp; 10 years too wide a gap no matter the individuals. The elder is a predator and should be treated as such.

This man did not "prey" on me purposely, but someone could have. It was illegal my state; he could have been charged with statutory rape. I wouldn't have wanted that. But unless we go case by case there have to be laws.

It seemed romantic at the time. It's true he thought I was 18 bc i was graduating HS &amp; I assumed he was younger bc he looked it. In retrospect, it was 100% inappropriate once he knew my age.

Unions give Lorena Gonzalez $1.4M so she'll pass #AB5 (which they wrote)forcing everyone into W2 employment, which means they can be unionized, so they get more dues. Also the state gets payroll tax, no biz deductions &amp; withholding.

It's already in effect because it was an urgency, reflecting the fact that people impacted have been unable to work since Jan 1. As for #YESProp22 I expect it to pass. It has passionate grassroots support in addition to the $$ behind it

1304927645751099393 2020-09-13 07:39:29 +0800 <davincidiva> @Briana_Sharp @WSJ Lorena also sneakily substituted "people" for "workers" so that even those who are incorporated are caught in the net.
1304927346579836928 2020-09-13 07:38:18 +0800 <davincidiva> @JPatrice4080 It was signed; good news for those it helps &amp; @cafwu who fought so hard for it. Too bad most of the same exemptions were proposed BEFORE #AB5 became law &amp; were not even allowed a hearing. Writers &amp; others have suffered needlessly for 9 months &amp; many have lost clients forever.

Drive your own car in your spare time for a few extra bucks. It worked for me. I never expected it to replace a career. 80% of drivers give or take still see it that way. The others are trying to make a F/T living out of a P/T gig

1304892776882995200 2020-09-13 05:20:56 +0800 <davincidiva> @CaliConsNews @TheJoyWriter First, get rid of supermajority on Nov 3.

Hey @GavinNewsom how about you redirect the $1.2B towards better forest management &amp; fire resources? I've been packed to evacuate for almost a week and communication has been dismal.
1304547991127093249 2020-09-12 06:30:53 +0800 <davincidiva> @CaliforniaLabor It's called a contract. Any company that hires a contractor uses one. If the contractor doesn't like the terms, they shouldn't sign it. Fixed it for you!
1304547329685495808 2020-09-12 06:28:15 +0800 <davincidiva> @ABC Exploitation of a tragedy &amp; "hot" social issue to deflect from YOUR poor governance @GavinNewsom  #ClimateChange is a powder keg. It would help if you'd stop tossing in the matches with your poor fire prevention + your focus on destroying livelihoods instead of protecting lives.

Unions said no because all they want is warm bodies to make into dues paying members and for that they need W2 employees. #YESonProp22 is along the lines of what you propose and is what the vast majority of drivers want.

It's #AB5 that is putting millions out of work they love and forcing them to consider minimum wage soul-killing jobs that make no use of their gifts and talents. #RepealAB5 #NOPROAct #YESonProp22

Even her "fix-it" bill #AB2257 throws crumbs to some  )while leaving others out in the cold. @freelancersu WTF?

1303294452430024704 2020-09-08 19:29:46 +0800 <davincidiva> @benwikler @KevinMKruse You are referring to #PROAct which outlaws most 1099 #freelance work, forces employers to hand over personal info of employees to unions w/o the employees‚Äô consent &amp; does away w/secret ballots at union meetings. Read between the lines of these ‚Äúcommitments‚Äù. #NOPROAct #RepealAB5
1303191847393619969 2020-09-08 12:42:03 +0800 <davincidiva> @JoeBiden What is wrong with you??? Are you TRYING to lose this election? You are making it impossible for anyone who wants to be self employed to support you. #NOPROACt #RepealAB5
1303191260123947013 2020-09-08 12:39:43 +0800 <davincidiva> @dtr300 Oh no!! I hope it will work out. The most important thing is your health
1303190851330301953 2020-09-08 12:38:05 +0800 <davincidiva> Us ‚Äúfolks‚Äù got a forced education from you this year with #AB5 and we were educating the rest of the country to oppose the #PROAct and anyone who supports it. #RepealAB5 #NOPROAct #YesOnProp22

I don‚Äôt cancel for how ppl vote. I don‚Äôt know you &amp; it‚Äôs not a loss if you drop me. Everything is relative. You believe Trump is the greatest evil&amp; you are not alone. I see other evils like lost freedoms as more basic &amp; lasting. We have a crappy choice

1303183483162865664 2020-09-08 12:08:49 +0800 <davincidiva> @JPatrice4080 @JoeBiden How do you not see self-determination in terms of ones livelihood as a fundamental right? Unions want to take that away @LorenaSGonzalez &amp; @JoeBiden are willing accomplices. Though she knows exactly what she‚Äôs doing. I‚Äôm not so sure about him. His idea of unions is the 1970s.
1303182741479936001 2020-09-08 12:05:52 +0800 <davincidiva> @JPatrice4080 @JoeBiden No I don‚Äôt. It will be just like what happened in California. People tried to change it before it went through the House and passed. Unions own these politicians 100%. The few Democrats who objected and voted no have already been defunded by Richard Trumka just as he threatened.
1303181961452642304 2020-09-08 12:02:46 +0800 <davincidiva> @smr2343 @doug_flaig @JoeBiden He speaks for millions of hardworking California #freelancers who have been unable to work since Jan 1 because of #AB5 which is our state‚Äôs #PROAct. We were the guinea pigs for this legislation. The guinea pigs died. NO #PROAct! #RepealAB5 ! #YesOnProp22
1303180969893965824 2020-09-08 11:58:49 +0800 <davincidiva> @JoeBiden And just like that, @JoeBiden loses the votes of 2-4 million Californians as well as those fighting #AB5- like laws in BY, NJ, IL, MA and elsewhere. Who‚Äôs giving you advice Joe?
1303144128377622528 2020-09-08 09:32:26 +0800 <davincidiva> @BillyHam2020 @quietlifedesign @JoeBiden No I believe that labor unions are necessary and good when they advocate for their Members as intended. My mom taught In NYC for decades. Her union was essential. But this was a long time ago. Sadly the objectives have changed. Now they want to monopolize ALL labor #RepealAB5
1303142665832210432 2020-09-08 09:26:37 +0800 <davincidiva> @kath2cats I‚Äôm not going to compete with you for the Holocaust expertise medal. How crass can you get.
1303142224591425536 2020-09-08 09:24:52 +0800 <davincidiva> @kath2cats So you should know better. And yes I am as it happens.
1303141724491923456 2020-09-08 09:22:52 +0800 <davincidiva> @RaymondEdwardF @kerr_vernon @JoeBiden His plan is #PROAct, which is the national version of California‚Äôs #AB5 that stripped millions of independent contractors of work they loved. No thanks
1303140732165709824 2020-09-08 09:18:56 +0800 <davincidiva> @JoeBiden That‚Äôs fine. Let‚Äôs leave it there. They‚Äôve served their purpose, now they exist to fill their coffers and buy politicians. #AB5 and the #PROAct are prime examples. (Someone please tell @JoeBiden it‚Äôs not the 1970s)
1303139556254916609 2020-09-08 09:14:16 +0800 <davincidiva> @kath2cats @JimmySportToons @jenvanlaar @asthegirlturns @TaraDBennett @chrismattmann @GigiLevangie @susanvalot @LorenaAD80 Pretty much everyone on the world equates the term ‚Äúconcentration camp‚Äù with Nazi death camps, even if technically the latter is a subset. You must be a ton of fun at a cocktail party.

Thankfully @LorenaSGonzalez saw the PR &amp; political error of injuring  #storytellers like writers&amp; artists so he‚Äôs getting it back #RepealAB5
1303136474473197568 2020-09-08 09:02:01 +0800 <davincidiva> @Local80Thom But apparently you can‚Äôt. You‚Äôve proven yourself unworthy of my time. #Bye

We must defeat the #PROAct or California‚Äôs cancer will metastasize across the US. It‚Äôs already passed the House along predictable lines. At least change the test for who is and independent contractor to #IRSnotABC as @thekimkavin suggests
1303134047137226752 2020-09-08 08:52:22 +0800 <davincidiva> @ssmith_calabor The reason 2/3 approve of unions (&amp; I‚Äôd like to to see proof) is the unions of the 1960s are remembered with fondness for good reason. The unions of today exist to fill their own coffers, buy politicians, and control the labor of EVERYONE, rather than representing their members.
1303133465370484736 2020-09-08 08:50:03 +0800 <davincidiva> @ssmith_calabor We also need to ensure that all people who choose to be self-employed and NOT join a union are allowed to earn a living w/o union interference. #RepealAB5 #YESonProp22 #NOProAct
1303133035064299520 2020-09-08 08:48:21 +0800 <davincidiva> I love being manspained and unionsplained at the same time. Sigh. #RepealAB5 #YESonProp22 #MyLaborMyChoice #NOProACt
1303132038233337856 2020-09-08 08:44:23 +0800 <davincidiva> @Local80Thom No YOU‚ÄôRE wrong again. Or lying. This has been my life since January. I know what I‚Äôm talking about. You clearly do not, or have another agenda, or both. #RepealAB5 #YESonProp22
1303131537861259264 2020-09-08 08:42:24 +0800 <davincidiva> @Local80Thom NOR the government ‚Äî which in California amounts to The Same thing. #RepealAB5 #YESonProp22 #mylaborMyChoice Stop #UnionGreed
1303131159333756930 2020-09-08 08:40:54 +0800 <davincidiva> @Local80Thom No you‚Äôre right. PEOPLE should determine their own status. If it‚Äôs not corporations making that choice, neither should it be unions.
1303130809616875520 2020-09-08 08:39:30 +0800 <davincidiva> @Local80Thom Nope. Wrong. Though that didn‚Äôt stop @LorenaSGonzalez and her friends from luring ICs desperate bc #AB5 stole their work + COVID on top from ENCOURAGING them to apply ‚Äî only so they‚Äôd unintentionally rat out their clients so the EDD could fine them. Fixed it for you #RepealAB5
1303130029044330496 2020-09-08 08:36:24 +0800 <davincidiva> @Local80Thom Same tired talking points used by every pro #AB5 shill. It did not ‚Äúcodify‚Äù Dynamex except to massively expand it then make it law. The ruling was about wage orders &amp; did NOT apply to all independent contractors. That was @LorenaAD80 ‚Äòs doing at the bidding of her union moneybags
1303129185234251776 2020-09-08 08:33:03 +0800 <davincidiva> @Local80Thom And the answer is **I** determine who and what I am. You‚Äôre right it does matter and self determination is the right of every sovereign individual. That is why we will #RepealAB5 starting with #YESonProp22
1303128644630405120 2020-09-08 08:30:54 +0800 <davincidiva> @Local80Thom What are you talking about? We pay higher taxes than anyone.
1303111503319429120 2020-09-08 07:22:47 +0800 <davincidiva> @Local80Thom Bullshit. I‚Äôve never asked the state for anything except to get out of my f*ing way. #freelancers and ICs are the opposite of freeloaders.  People who make a habit of looking for handouts thank that‚Äôs how everyone thinks. #RepealAB5

Millions of CA BLUE voters will never support you and @JoeBiden BC of the #PROAct. All your tweet tells me is you too are owned by special interests.
1302734723282690050 2020-09-07 06:25:36 +0800 <davincidiva> Yes, if the entire republican caucus was banished to zoom  for having one member with COVID, why couldn‚Äôt anyone with health reasons have zoomed in??

Ppl of all parties, colors, genders &amp; ages AGREE

All the union people whining to me now "You're safe now w/ #AB2257 you can stop moaning...WHY would you support #YESonProp22?!? It doesn't even help YOU!" Because it's NOT about ME and never was. I've been largely #AB5 exempt from the start &amp; have options. 1/

They are ALL voting #YesOnProp22 and they aren‚Äôt being paid to do so, or tell everyone they know to do the same and why.

So @LorenaSGonzalez @LorenaAD80 if you're aggrieved and wondering why #freelancers aren't falling over themselves to THANK YOU for "all your hard work" FINALLY giving them SOME of the relief that could have been in #AB5 before it became law... now you know. #RepealAB5

All the best, Daryl" I wrote back &amp; told Daryl about AB2257, but how many  outlets won't even CONSIDER CA artists now,will never hear of 2257 or want to take a chance if they DO hear of it? #AB5 damage is done./end

What could be more basic? Oh and by the way, I'm only talking about local elections. I know a lot of people who are voting blue nationally and red locally to send a message.
1301374158857629696 2020-09-03 12:19:12 +0800 <davincidiva> @HEYJBMC @hiltzikm @latimes I can't reply directly because I'm blocked by this person I've never even heard of. I guess I must be talented and young! Awesome! Harassers oh-so-self-righteously taking the part of "victimized Veena" seems to be going around. Will there ever be a vaccine for #hypocrisy?
1301370257265668096 2020-09-03 12:03:42 +0800 <davincidiva> @JPatrice4080 @jenvanlaar Oh and P.S. I am NOT alone. See you in November!
1301370016567144448 2020-09-03 12:02:44 +0800 <davincidiva> @JPatrice4080 @jenvanlaar It's not just my issue. I'll survive. It's the 2M+ #freelancers in California whose livelihoods were stolen from them to line union coffers that I fight for. That picture is big enough for me. Your suggestion is rejected. Good night!
1301368739078705152 2020-09-03 11:57:40 +0800 <davincidiva> @JPatrice4080 @jenvanlaar Nope. This one issue is the hill I die on. And it's no sacrifice to #VoteThemAllOut2020 and vote #YESonProp22 -- it will be a pleasure.

I worked in a mostly male office. My boss said this to me regarding an obnoxious client we all hated but who liked me. It was a joke. it was in poor taste, and we ALL thought it was hilarious.

I'm surprised CNET doesn't hold her to a higher standard. I've given up expecting journalists or politicians to do that themselves.
1301346898620555264 2020-09-03 10:30:53 +0800 <davincidiva> @CharlotteGarden @veenadubal This piece quotes me &amp; others who support #YESonProp22 implying we are being paid. This is false. We are #freelancers hurt by #AB5, an oppressive union-driven law based on Ms Dubal's scholarship. We've been complaining about it since Jan, when Dubal blocked us all w/o engaging.
1301345182273601536 2020-09-03 10:24:03 +0800 <davincidiva> @latimes @hiltzikm Ms Dubal's "scholarship" is the basis for #AB5, called the most destructive piece of legislation in CA history. It stripped the livelihoods of over 1M #freelancers unrelated to Uber et. al. When we complained, Dubal blocked us back in Jan. Our support for #YESonProp22 is UNPAID.

The writer of this misleading piece has written countless other hit pieces against app companies which shows clear bias.

She leaves a smoldering husk in her wake as people try to rebuild from the rubble.

1300874695152074752 2020-09-02 03:14:31 +0800 <davincidiva> @BuzzBirth I think that ship has sailed. There's a reason why renting a U-Haul outbound from CA now costs 5x what it does inbound.

1300870384611328000 2020-09-02 02:57:23 +0800 <davincidiva> @BreatheNewWinds @LorenaSGonzalez @LorenaAD80 What I meant was, those who voted for her didn't realize they were voting to end their own ability to work as they chose. They thought -- reasonably -- that worker protections would apply to to employees and those IN unions, NOT to those who neither wanted nor needed them
1300868359475441664 2020-09-02 02:49:20 +0800 <davincidiva> @BreatheNewWinds @LorenaSGonzalez @LorenaAD80 I appreciate your willingness to have a real conversation about this and I apologize if I was snarky before. It's just been really frustrating having this shoved down our throats, and the author has been dismissive and insulting to those she has injured throughout.
1300867809312821248 2020-09-02 02:47:09 +0800 <davincidiva> @BuzzBirth I know, cheap shot. I couldn't resist.
1300867552587907073 2020-09-02 02:46:08 +0800 <davincidiva> @BreatheNewWinds @LorenaSGonzalez @LorenaAD80 Also it's public record how much every assembly member and senator receives from labor. All the #AB5 yes votes receive 6 figures+. Another smoking gun is #PROact, the national version of AB5. Richard Trumka threatened any Democrat who voted against it;those who did were defunded.
1300866704948383744 2020-09-02 02:42:46 +0800 <davincidiva> @BreatheNewWinds @LorenaSGonzalez @LorenaAD80 I don't say that the unions themselves are corrupt. I'm saying the politicians like @LorenaAD80 @LorenaSGonzalez  who represent their interests at the expense of the people are. She says she was elected to stand up for workers -- but I'm pretty sure no one ever envisioned this.
1300866292073725953 2020-09-02 02:41:07 +0800 <davincidiva> @BreatheNewWinds @LorenaSGonzalez @LorenaAD80 You're right, it's mostly circumstantial evidence . But the motivations behind the imposition of #AB5 on ALL ICs in CA (whether they want it or not) including refusal to suspend it during COVID so ppl could #workfromhome are suspect. And I've had some run-ins here w/union types.  https://t.co/rCh8TvPtYC
1300864829310156801 2020-09-02 02:35:18 +0800 <davincidiva> @BreatheNewWinds @LorenaSGonzalez Every #freelancer I know would have been all FOR #AB5 has it applied ONLY to gig workers and low-wage workers who are actually exploited and WANT the protection. Most are #creatives and lean liberal. But the law imposes unwanted and unneeded restrictions on EVERYONE.
1300864177343401984 2020-09-02 02:32:43 +0800 <davincidiva> @BreatheNewWinds @LorenaSGonzalez I agree with you but I have 2 challenges:   1. It's NOT the majority. ALL polls and studies show that at LEAST 75% of gig workers want to remain independent contractors (some say up to 90%)  2. I don't accept that anyone should have to lose their livelihood so others get benefits
1300863191212199936 2020-09-02 02:28:48 +0800 <davincidiva> @BreatheNewWinds @LorenaSGonzalez @LorenaAD80 If you like your union, that's great. But is it paying politicians to STOP anyone else from working and stripping them of their entire livelihoods Because that's what #AB5 is doing. #RepealAB5
1300862745332518912 2020-09-02 02:27:02 +0800 <davincidiva> @BreatheNewWinds @LorenaSGonzalez @LorenaAD80 I have no problem with unions when they live and let live. My mom was a NYC public schoolteacher for decades and her union was awesome. When they represent their members they are great. When they try to restrict non-members from running their lives and businesses, not so much.
1300862111728320512 2020-09-02 02:24:30 +0800 <davincidiva> @BreatheNewWinds @LorenaSGonzalez Those clients didn't want to hire #freelancers W2 nor did we want to be employed. We don't NEED overtime, sick days etc. We make our own schedules, decide our own rates, pay our own health insurance. I agree some workers need and deserve more protections. #AB5 is 1 size fits all
1300861585347411968 2020-09-02 02:22:25 +0800 <davincidiva> @BreatheNewWinds @LorenaSGonzalez Here are some more personal anecdotes, in their own words, since that matters to you. It doesn't to @LorenaSGonzalez; she threw a letter signed by 7700 ppl on the floor of the assembly just last week after cursing out the assembly member who brought it.   https://t.co/cmql1N8iVX
1300860933019901952 2020-09-02 02:19:49 +0800 <davincidiva> @BreatheNewWinds @LorenaSGonzalez If you REALLY care about the impact on real people's lives, I invite you to join Freelancers Against AB5 on Facebook; the group has &gt;18k members: writers, translators, photographers, musicians, wedding planners, tutors, sign language interpreters, editors. Many lost ALL income.
1300860418236100610 2020-09-02 02:17:47 +0800 <davincidiva> @BreatheNewWinds @LorenaSGonzalez It already has. I have lost a lot of clients &amp; income this year because of #AB5, even though I am in a supposedly "exempt" profession. Many clients won't even consider CA-based #freelancers now. Many of of my friends heard from their clients last Christmas their work was over.
1300858944714280965 2020-09-02 02:11:55 +0800 <davincidiva> @BreatheNewWinds @LorenaSGonzalez MAYBE "the people" in #CA80 wanted this; they're the only people who elected her. But even they could not have foreseen the hubris and overreach of a law like #AB5. And #freelancers in the rest of the state are suffering for it.
1300858387148673025 2020-09-02 02:09:42 +0800 <davincidiva> @BreatheNewWinds @LorenaSGonzalez WTF are you talking about? It's no "theory", it's common knowledge @LorenaSGonzalez @LorenaAD80 is in office to carry union water. She  makes no secret of it. Do you even live in CA? Everyone here is aware of this, no "Q" required. Talk about #gaslighting.  https://t.co/pWtkuCbJrf
1300857466683490304 2020-09-02 02:06:03 +0800 <davincidiva> @BreatheNewWinds @LorenaSGonzalez She doesn't "work with" her peers. The supermajority votes in lockstep, she coerces those who don't and shuts down all minority views, not even allowing debate. #AB5 should never have been imposed on the populace without debate ir ideally a ballot measure. #RepealAB5 #YESonProp22

So if you work for yourself (as a photographer for example( you're ok with an avowed Teamster taking marching orders from AFL-CIO stripping away your right to be an Independent Contractor, so all your clients replace you with out-of-staters? That's #AB5.
1300855270629752832 2020-09-02 01:57:19 +0800 <davincidiva> @BreatheNewWinds @LorenaSGonzalez When she doesn't pressure legislators to vote her way (she also heads appropriations) she actually PAYS them off.
