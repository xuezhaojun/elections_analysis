1338373497865838592 2020-12-14 14:41:22 +0800 <dc_roark> @KickoStocks @H0U3 "pigs get fed, and hogs get slaughtered."   I'm hoping I am not the hog when it comes to this stock.
1338372369006669824 2020-12-14 14:36:53 +0800 <dc_roark> @KickoStocks @H0U3 I really got aggressive as it chased up to 2.76 on Friday. So overall I am only up 26.50% since my first buy on the 8th.
1338371627776692225 2020-12-14 14:33:56 +0800 <dc_roark> @KickoStocks @H0U3 Nope, added several more times and even chased it up on Friday...getting nipped as it dropped .40 to close. So no profit taking, all buying so far. Scary, but healthy &amp; wise, to understand the technicals and not all on the news necessarily.
1338367540284837889 2020-12-14 14:17:41 +0800 <dc_roark> @KickoStocks @H0U3 What sucks is that I started accumulating shares on this stock since .69 thinking that with the patents and vaccine approvals the SP would soar. I appreciate your insight about this one.
1338357700980338691 2020-12-14 13:38:36 +0800 <dc_roark> @SuperDuperInvst New follower...cheers!
1338349607559041024 2020-12-14 13:06:26 +0800 <dc_roark> @KickoStocks @H0U3 LOL...understood.  You are the one of the few I have seen signal a retraction.  Just interesting to get all views.  Cheers.
1338349108004868096 2020-12-14 13:04:27 +0800 <dc_roark> @KickoStocks @H0U3 So you're expecting a retracement below 1.40 tomorrow or at least in fairly soon...then what?
1338348475088592897 2020-12-14 13:01:56 +0800 <dc_roark> @KickoStocks @H0U3 Not here to argue with you, just first person bearish on this stock, maybe on the short term but bullish mid-long term?
1338348174319214592 2020-12-14 13:00:44 +0800 <dc_roark> @KickoStocks @H0U3 Interesting. There was close to .40 drop from Friday high when closed.  .40 drop is kind of dip to me...not enough for you, right?

FOX will soon take the lead on calling PA for Biden and then the GOPe can use that as cover to keep watching Trump hang.
1324470295365849090 2020-11-06 05:55:00 +0800 <dc_roark> @Cernovich This DC finally purging the outsider. The establishment (GOP, DEM, Administrative State, etc...) could not allow Trump 4 more years. FOX had to be the one to lead on this as it was planned.
1324469804296785921 2020-11-06 05:53:03 +0800 <dc_roark> @Scottrollison1 @Cernovich The GOP was part of it too.  Wouldn't be surprised is there was a compromise that Biden takes POTUS but GOP keeps Senate.
1324469481318612993 2020-11-06 05:51:46 +0800 <dc_roark> @Cernovich This will give the GOPe cover to continue watching Trump hang.

I will fight with every once of my life that you NEVER make it to any elected office.
1324444986360954885 2020-11-06 04:14:26 +0800 <dc_roark> @NikkiHaley @JohnCornyn We are all watching you Nikki.  If you think you will be able to sit on your hands and let them hang Trump to clear a path for you in 2024, you are horrifically mistaken. The GOPe is slitting its collective throat by not supporting Trump.  You are being warned.
1324439540971511812 2020-11-06 03:52:48 +0800 <dc_roark> @SenTedCruz We are all watching this happen and watching you not standing up for Trump. You see 2024 but continued silence will disqualify you once and for all.
1324439247470923776 2020-11-06 03:51:38 +0800 <dc_roark> @SenTedCruz GOP was able to keep the Senate and that was the ultimate goal for the party. Now you, and the others, will sit on your hands as voter fraud takes out the POTUS. We all know this was planned from the GOP, Big Tech, and Democrats...purge Trump to restore "regular" order.
1324432042663284737 2020-11-06 03:23:00 +0800 <dc_roark> Where is @GOP????

1324431266524110849 2020-11-06 03:19:55 +0800 <dc_roark> This fight is more than just Trump, this is a fight now to address voter fraud. If we stand by and let this happen then there is no more legitimacy in the electoral process.
1324430780043591680 2020-11-06 03:17:59 +0800 <dc_roark> @DanCrenshawTX @AmyMek This is the time we ALL need to see the GOP back our POTUS. This is the ultimate battle that has been planned by the Democrats for 4 years...get your troops out there to fight for us and our POTUS
1324429222568513536 2020-11-06 03:11:48 +0800 <dc_roark> The Media will be calling the Biden win very soon...don't fall for it. It is part of the plan for this coup and we must fight against it.
1324427214453166081 2020-11-06 03:03:49 +0800 <dc_roark> @Cernovich GOP Establishment will be sitting back hoping Trump loses.  Remember that people.

You want to remain in DC so desperately and you need Trump gone so you all can go back to your corners pretending to represent something and re-establish your vision of the GOP.

1323085675508437000 2020-11-02 10:13:01 +0800 <dc_roark> @JoeBiden The repeal of the Trump tax cuts will increase taxes for everyone but especially the middle class. Besides, you cannot fund a 100 trillion dollar Green New Deal by just taxing the wealthy, you will come for us. Believe me, I'm in IL, I know how it works.

1321188482790903810 2020-10-28 04:34:15 +0800 <dc_roark> @BuzzFeedNews Antifa terrorist murders someone, point blank, downtown Denver last week and it all remains an idea.  America is finished with the lies and censorship of the "media", "journalists", and Big Tech.
1321186932395810823 2020-10-28 04:28:05 +0800 <dc_roark> @FiveRights @AmunetCyra After Trump wins re-election he needs to start replacing many in his administration, most certainly Wray, from outside of DC and won't remain in DC once finished. If he keeps picking from the swamp, they will keep it the swamp as they always look to the future.
1321154846427369473 2020-10-28 02:20:35 +0800 <dc_roark> @liobserver @kevincorke So will the FBI and DOJ
1321154315227193344 2020-10-28 02:18:29 +0800 <dc_roark> @Rothbard1776 @kevincorke This is a quick glimpse into the true essence of how the DC elite make a living. The DOJ, FBI and DC overall serve to protect this lifestyle. Nothing will ever happen to Hunter, Joe, or anyone that is on the opposite side of Trump to be sure.

This is an inside peak as to the true essence of how the DC elite make their living. FBI, DOJ, and other federal apparatuses serve to protect them.

Russia has an economy the size of Italy, is a minor player on the chess board and the CCP leveraged its assets in DC (media and so many other parties) to keep the public distracted on Putin and Russia ever since Hillary lost that night 4 years ago.

1309048940998819842 2020-09-24 16:36:03 +0800 <dc_roark> @ByPatForde The police had a warrant, signed by a judge, to arrest someone. Corroborated by an independent witness they knocked on door and identified themselves as police. They entered and were fired upon with one hit, they returned fire. I hope you deal in the realm of the truth Forde.

It appears they'll need to COVID Joe so Harris will step in and debate Trump and ultimately take over the race for the White House for POTUS

1305904722948358146 2020-09-16 00:22:03 +0800 <dc_roark> @nbamockgm @ByBerkowitz @UWBadgers No doubt you should pay reparations immediately to all POC in Mad Town.  Also, to be truly woke, if you have children then you must give them away as indentured servants to a black family for at least 5 years to pay back any white privilege you may have left over from reparations

1300832579252375553 2020-09-02 00:27:09 +0800 <dc_roark> @CBSNews If they came to the game with a brick in one hand and a torch in another claiming to protest white privilege, would that make it all better, CBS "News"?
1300831550465101829 2020-09-02 00:23:04 +0800 <dc_roark> @nk_prof @zeynep @chrislhayes H3N2 virus still continues to circulate worldwide as a seasonal influenza A virus. That is the 1968 virus that killed 100K Americans and over 1M world-wide...influenza A is the virus that lead to the death of my aunt earlier this year...close to 50 years and still killing people.

1300830106974261249 2020-09-02 00:17:20 +0800 <dc_roark> @WesPegden @NateSilver538 Wes, you would be amazed (but not surprised with your intelligence) how many people have come in contact with the virus and would have tested positive going all the way back to late last year when it was spread out from Wuhan airport.

1300798854938451969 2020-09-01 22:13:09 +0800 <dc_roark> @richardPlusPlus @justin_hart I assume the First Step Act in 2018 never happened in your mind, is that correct?

1300796982584397824 2020-09-01 22:05:42 +0800 <dc_roark> @MrAndyNgo @tedwheeler Portland seems like a nice place to visit

1300774346714222592 2020-09-01 20:35:46 +0800 <dc_roark> @MSNBC @JoyAnnReid Why is this homophobic pig still employed?
1300772408492728320 2020-09-01 20:28:04 +0800 <dc_roark> @juliaioffe Now do CCP, Russian.
1300772096725921793 2020-09-01 20:26:49 +0800 <dc_roark> @CBSNews Yes, yes he did and it is easy to see when you actually take the time to watch the video as he being attacked (one of them had a pistol in his hand and still remains uncharged)
1300771694286643200 2020-09-01 20:25:13 +0800 <dc_roark> @richardPlusPlus @justin_hart You appear to be a young man, currently in the ATX, probably has or is going to UT-Austin. I went to Baylor myself. If you haven't already, look into the negative impact that bill had for the black man in the U.S.  ...Joe cannot get off the hook for that dreadful act.
1300770734562856960 2020-09-01 20:21:24 +0800 <dc_roark> @richardPlusPlus @justin_hart When I read your profile, and what appears to be your concern for the African American, how could you in good conscious vote for a man that authored the Senate version of the 94' crime bill? Do you understand what that bill did to destroy the lives of millions?
1300769937972252673 2020-09-01 20:18:15 +0800 <dc_roark> @richardPlusPlus @justin_hart Why didn't Joe talk about Trump being responsible for the rioting and looting and killing that is happening in the streets all summer during the DNC convention, or any time before now for that matter? Why only now?
1300767725313196035 2020-09-01 20:09:27 +0800 <dc_roark> @richardPlusPlus @justin_hart I'd take Trump over a 50 year DC politician every time.
1300759947974717446 2020-09-01 19:38:33 +0800 <dc_roark> @Kingwoman @justin_hart Which Joe Biden is telling the truth? Doesn't that bother you that he says what he did yesterday and then these statements in the past?
1300759676351635456 2020-09-01 19:37:28 +0800 <dc_roark> @richardPlusPlus @justin_hart Then Joe Biden should have the integrity to say what he means and mean what he says...he is 50 year politician, he is liar and cannot be trusted. You get that part, right?
1300758580228956161 2020-09-01 19:33:07 +0800 <dc_roark> @redheadb3 @McFaul @RichardGrenell @seanhannity McFaul is not my concern or focus, it is on you and I asked if you could further explain the charge you made upon Rick.

1300618683593773058 2020-09-01 10:17:13 +0800 <dc_roark> @JoyAnnReid Have legal experts, and the FBI, assessed and made judgement on your homophobic tweets?

1300605294016372736 2020-09-01 09:24:00 +0800 <dc_roark> @JoeBiden Self defense Joe...Why didn't you call out BLM and Antifa terrorist groups?
