1342915037594144768 2020-12-27 03:27:49 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôve shown your ‚Äúabsolute proof‚Äù to 86 judges in 59 cases.   They‚Äôve ALL been tossed out for lack of merit.   Affidavits from liars and criminals are not ‚Äúproof‚Äù.   Doctored videos are not ‚Äúproof‚Äù.   The ballots weren‚Äôt all counted by midnight when you ‚Äúclaim‚Äù you‚Äôd ‚Äúwon‚Äù.

And I‚Äôll bet the Russians interfered AGAIN.   That is why you‚Äôre acting like a maniac.   You LOST.   By a LANDSLIDE.   Be a big boy and accept it.  https://t.co/kY5uzzPBHw
1342912165422854144 2020-12-27 03:16:24 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre saying mail in ballots are ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù?   Your gullible supporters followed your poor advice abs DIDN‚ÄôT mail in vote.   Dems DID.   They counted them LAST.   No ‚Äúballot dumps or fraud‚Äù   They JUST COUNTED all the VOTES.   So claiming you were ‚Äúwinning‚Äù at midnight‚Äù is A LIE.

You think investigations that produce FACTS that the 2016 election was interfered by Russia to help Trump win. 17 agencies confirm it.   But it‚Äôs fake news to you.   You say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt believe the media‚Äù.   Where do YOU get your news from then?
1342577283702263808 2020-12-26 05:05:42 +0800 <ericaj58> @ilookamazingman Because it‚Äôs true. Russia interfered in the election. Collusion was found but not enough to bring charges.  https://t.co/SuYgukH7bd

1342570740839682049 2020-12-26 04:39:43 +0800 <ericaj58> @BreitbartNews So she spent 8000 on her boots and coat abs you think that‚Äôs appropriate when people are STARVING, out is WORK, and @realDonaldTrump is STILL phucking around with the Covid Relief bill?   Besides that, he‚Äôs the most hated man in America. Why should she be? She SUPPORTS him.

1342535040320765952 2020-12-26 02:17:51 +0800 <ericaj58> @DeanBrowningPA @realDonaldTrump So glad you got that out of his tweet.   Not that he‚Äôs ignoring the 3000 that are dying EVERY DAY.   Not that he‚Äôs thrown a wrench into the relief bill for STARVING Americans.   Not that he‚Äôs GOLFING AGAIN.   Pretty sad when you think ‚Äúowning the libs‚Äù is an accomplishment.
1342534286914641920 2020-12-26 02:14:51 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump May this be the only tweet from you until the 27th.   I know it‚Äôs wishful thinking abs highly unlikely it will happen but it would be what the American people deserve from you. SILENCE.
1342533870269259777 2020-12-26 02:13:12 +0800 <ericaj58> @BannedRama @itsJeffTiedrich The thing is though Trump calls himself a ‚ÄúChristian ‚Äú and spews religious crap. Biden is quiet about his Christianity. That‚Äôs the way it should be.

Because surely to GOD if the Dems cheated they sure as HELL would have made SURE @senatemajldr and @LindseyGrahamSC didn‚Äôt win.   JFC. The stupidity is astounding.

You KNEW how each state would count votes.   You KNEW but wanted to see who won.   Now that Biden has won by a LANDSLIDE y‚Äôall are screaming NO FAIR!

But your take on this is predictable as you had NO PROBLEM sweeping the crimes @realDonaldTrump committed that lead to his impeachment under the carpet.   56 cases tossed out of court is PROOF there‚Äôs no ‚Äúthere there‚Äù.   Vile.

It‚Äôs kinda like when YOU replaced Obama you wanted credit for the strong economy and low unemployment and growing job numbers.  JFC you‚Äôre a crybaby.
1337466805225365505 2020-12-12 02:38:29 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump If they follow the constitution and show ‚Äúgreat courage and wisdom‚Äù you will lose FOR the LAST TIME.

1337465241303564288 2020-12-12 02:32:17 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump Then do your PHUCKING JOB and tackle the virus instead of whining about the FAIR ELECTION that YOU LOST.   YOU are KILLING AMERICANS.

But the good news is maybe they‚Äôll stop with the BS law suits.

How does that work?   Does it not make you wonder that he‚Äôs attacked EVERYONE and now only likes @OANN and @newsmax , two EXTREME RIGHT WING SITES?   Come on. You‚Äôve gotta be smarter than that!
1334925849519255554 2020-12-05 02:21:38 +0800 <ericaj58> @a2zbassman @LMig3 @DonaldJTrumpJr Too funny.   You‚Äôre a ‚ÄúChristian ‚Äú?   A fake one then!
1334925649752989696 2020-12-05 02:20:51 +0800 <ericaj58> @a2zbassman @LMig3 @DonaldJTrumpJr This is pathetic.   You refuse to believe the FACTS but you want us to believe your conspiracy theory pushing media sites.   If you‚Äôre going to accuse the media of being ‚Äúfake news‚Äù do NOT expect us to believe what you consider credible.   Because 100% of the time it ISN‚ÄôT.
1334925056086921216 2020-12-05 02:18:29 +0800 <ericaj58> @a2zbassman @LMig3 @DonaldJTrumpJr You know WHY they don‚Äôt trust them?   Because TRUMP TOLD YOU NOT TO.   That was his GOAL from the BEGINNING.   He KNEW they told the truth so he discredited them so you wouldn‚Äôt believe them. He admitted it to Leslie Stahl.   And you BOUGHT it.   Look who‚Äôs brainwashed now!

Y‚Äôall scream that MSM is ‚Äúfake news‚Äù but you want us to believe your conspiracy theories spewed by the EPITOME of fake news?   Give me a phucking break.   Show me the video from a CREDIBLE source or STFU.
1334922101078118407 2020-12-05 02:06:45 +0800 <ericaj58> @DonaldJTrumpJr If the Dems cheated to win the election why did McConnell and Graham still win?  Don‚Äôt you think they would have rigged Kentucky and South Carolina?
1334921635514576897 2020-12-05 02:04:54 +0800 <ericaj58> @DellaGuylas @DonaldJTrumpJr You answered your own question.

Y‚Äôall accuse @CNN of not being credible but you want us to believe @BreitbartNews or any of the other garbage you watch?   You attack CNN is because Trump TOLD you to.   He‚Äôs a pathological liar.

1334557132226609152 2020-12-04 01:56:29 +0800 <ericaj58> @jimsciutto @tankart150 And @realDonaldTrump is too busy whining about the election to do anything about it.

1334530714461589506 2020-12-04 00:11:31 +0800 <ericaj58> The obvious (and less obvious) problems with Trump's epic rant  https://t.co/pTMUKPfprR via @msnbc @realDonaldTrump   Glad to see you think spewing your conspiracy theories is more important than saving the lives of Americans.

1334204935672528896 2020-12-03 02:36:59 +0800 <ericaj58> @kylegriffin1 Because @DonaldJTrumpJr , @EricTrump and Ivanka are as corrupt as their dad.   If he gives them a pardon it will be hilarious.   @realDonaldTrump would be admitting they committed crimes.
1334204194727706624 2020-12-03 02:34:02 +0800 <ericaj58> @essenviews Because they did this.  https://t.co/7Taat1a7dB

1333899886543081472 2020-12-02 06:24:50 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump How much did you pay him to testify? And did it come out of the 170 million you‚Äôve scammed from your idiot supporters?

1333898550783086593 2020-12-02 06:19:31 +0800 <ericaj58> @kaitlancollins But their court cases have been ‚Äú with knowledge and investigation ‚Äú? All they‚Äôve got is ‚Äúaffidavits ‚Äù from truck drivers and disgruntled poll watchers who got ‚Äúglared at‚Äù.

1333850600065273856 2020-12-02 03:08:59 +0800 <ericaj58> @kaitlancollins So threatening someone you disagree with by suggesting they should be shot is ‚ÄúOK‚Äù as long as it was meant to be sarcastic?   OMFG.   The idiot needs to be disbarred immediately.
1333827040898809856 2020-12-02 01:35:22 +0800 <ericaj58> Trump finds yet another Republican governor worthy of his rage  https://t.co/eN8nYvfc0q via @msnbc @realDonaldTrump   When the POSPOTUS expects governors to be loyal to HIM instead of the PEOPLE of AMERICA you have a BIG PROBLEM.

1333814175542362112 2020-12-02 00:44:15 +0800 <ericaj58> @HeidiMallory @2ndTierFan @FoxNews Why would it be though? Is he planning on being corrupt like Trump? Hiring his family and friends to do jobs in the WH instead of experts? Will hefire people who don‚Äôt support him? Will he lie pathologically? Will he name call his enemies?   Trump brought it on himself.
1333812802721513473 2020-12-02 00:38:47 +0800 <ericaj58> @catturd2 @realDonaldTrump I hope you didn‚Äôt give him any money! That‚Äôs the only reason he‚Äôs still whining about the election that he LOST by a LANDSLIDE.   So that idiots like you donate to his ‚Äúpay off my debts‚Äù fund.   Such a bunch of losers y‚Äôall are.
1333811740161675266 2020-12-02 00:34:34 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump @OANN ?   How sad and pathetic it is that the PRESIDENT of the UNITES STATES is retweeting an extreme right wing conspiracy theory pushing site.

1324885702845165568 2020-11-07 09:25:41 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs the way it works.   They count DAY OF votes first.   Then they count early votes.   Then they count MAIL in VOTES.

I don‚Äôt care how they do it. Throw some cheeseburgers at Diet Coke at him to keep him happy.   If he tries to declare himself a winner too soon there will be absolute mayhem.

Americans have a right to have the POTUS be the one they VOTED for. Not the one who CHEATED to win or who Russia PLANTED as they did in 2016.   He breaks every rule in the book.

But they shouldn‚Äôt have their vote not count if it‚Äôs mailed in time.   Kinda like mailing a bill payment. If it‚Äôs postmarked by the due date, it‚Äôs still ‚Äúon time‚Äù.
1322324955023908864 2020-10-31 07:50:11 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump Did you just wink at someone in the audience?   230,000 dead and Trump is winking.

1322323768878931969 2020-10-31 07:45:28 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump It should end when ALL VOTES ARE COUNTED.   INCLUDING the ones POST MARKED NOVEMBER 3rd.   I can just see this completely backfiring on you. Biden will be winning at midnight on on November 3rd and you‚Äôll be screaming ‚Äúbut not all the votes are in‚Äù! Rigged election!

1319436482218655744 2020-10-23 08:32:25 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump Can you give more examples of you ‚Äúputting Americans first‚Äù?
1319435324695588864 2020-10-23 08:27:49 +0800 <ericaj58> Intel director issues high-drama, low-clarity warning on Iran, Russia election operations  https://t.co/HGzgAzOU2E via @msnbc @realDonaldTrump   Another Trump appointed sycophant prepared to lie to protect you.   It just never stops. The corruption is mind boggling.
1319383031656771585 2020-10-23 05:00:02 +0800 <ericaj58> @FoxNews Now let‚Äôs talk about the Republicans ignoring the Mueller report.   And also let‚Äôs discuss the impeachment trial where they had ALREADY decided to acquit @realDonaldTrump before it was over.   So don‚Äôt tell us that you‚Äôre not good with a scandal not being treated seriously.

1319366590303854592 2020-10-23 03:54:42 +0800 <ericaj58> @oviosu @jaketapper I did too. It was pathetic. He lied every single time she asked a question.
1319365989323010048 2020-10-23 03:52:19 +0800 <ericaj58> @ColonelDax1 @jaketapper That one cracks me up.   Think of all the kids that wouldn‚Äôt have been born if the mother didn‚Äôt get a pregnancy test!   Or all the cancer that would be have happened if the patient didn‚Äôt get tested!
1319365117868322816 2020-10-23 03:48:51 +0800 <ericaj58> @oviosu @jaketapper He started rambling. She needed to keep him on topic. Have you watched his rallies? He‚Äôs incapable of sticking to one topic. She had a timeline that she wanted to stick to, and he kept on going off topic. She was just doing her job. And she was polite.
1319363718409408512 2020-10-23 03:43:17 +0800 <ericaj58> @EricRecla @JRehling @IngrahamAngle Because they‚Äôre attacking his son. What has that got to do with being POTUS?   I can just imagine if Biden attacked Trump about Jr, or barbidoll Ivanka, or Eric?   He‚Äôd lose it.
1319363197464244224 2020-10-23 03:41:13 +0800 <ericaj58> @IngrahamAngle What did she do? How did she treat him?   She was calm and asked questions that he SHOULD be able to answer.   The fact that he thought they were ‚Äútough‚Äù tells us all how unfit he is.   He‚Äôs been POTUS for 4 years.  Worst economy, jobs, unemployment ALL ON HIM.
1319355076289335296 2020-10-23 03:08:57 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump Shouldn‚Äôt you be focussed on prepping for the debate tonight so you don‚Äôt get crushed AGAIN by Biden?   You‚Äôre asking for another four years.   PROVE you DESERVE it with FACTS.   No more LIES.

1319352248900620291 2020-10-23 02:57:43 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump You answered ALL her questions with LIES.   She CALLED you in them.   That‚Äôs not ‚Äúrude, biased, or hateful‚Äù.   It‚Äôs called GOOD REPORTING.   You‚Äôre so used to @seanhannity asking you lame questions and then sitting there like a bobble head and never challenging you on your LIES.
1319351623584337920 2020-10-23 02:55:14 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôve released some of the video and NOWHERE do we see Stahl being ‚Äúrude, biased, or hateful‚Äù.   If you HONESTLY thought you would get softball questions like @FoxNews asks you why did you even agree to the interview?   You should KNOW AMERICANS DESERVE THE TRUTH for ONCE!
1319332526792478720 2020-10-23 01:39:21 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump No rudeness.   No bias‚Äôs   No hatred.   She was CALM, and asked for FACTS.   You have her LIES.   One after the other.   And guess what? YOU WERE RUDE.   YOUR HATRED for STRONG WOMEN was very obvious.
1319331833880793088 2020-10-23 01:36:35 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump Watched some of this interview.   The first think out of your mouth was ‚Äúbe fair‚Äù.   Then you said something about Biden getting nicer questions.   She told you the questions would be tough.   THEY ShOULD BE.   You are asking for another FOUR YEARS.   Oh, and you lied.   A LOT.
1319316366537551872 2020-10-23 00:35:08 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump @nypost So NOW MSM is ok because you think they‚Äôre helping you?   JFC.   You‚Äôre insane.

1319302951047843840 2020-10-22 23:41:49 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump You ask for it.

You have no idea how to be accountable for your actions!   A failure in every way imaginable.

Give you false stats ( like the chart when Chris Wallace interviewed you) so you don‚Äôt freak out?   God they must be exhausted.
1319301470601183233 2020-10-22 23:35:56 +0800 <ericaj58> @HalfwayPost @realDonaldTrump Ya sure.   The US is still waiting for a health care plan after 10 years of promises from the Republicans.   The wall?  Nope!   More empty promises from the liar in chief.

It was up to him to be a LEADER and do more than waste 7 weeks and slap a ‚Äútravel restriction‚Äù on China AFTER the virus was in the country.
1316817162980347904 2020-10-16 03:04:11 +0800 <ericaj58> @SenTedCruz This will be another failed investigation no doubt.   It‚Äôs how the Republicans roll.

You get shown all the proof of Trumps crimes and scream ‚Äúfake news‚Äù.?

And let‚Äôs not forget idiots like his supporters that go to his hate rallies without social distancing or masks that are then going out and spreading the virus.   I can‚Äôt believe you don‚Äôt get it.

Imagine having to tell the POTUS to please stop talking and let Biden speak?   #TrumpMeltdown

Trump can‚Äôt even keep peace in the US.   And he had very little to do with the peace deal signed.   And he‚Äôs responsible for the 205,000 deaths in the US due to his incompetence.

The problem is Trump TOLD you that MSM is ‚Äúfake news‚Äù so you wouldn‚Äôt believe what they say. That was his plan ALL along.   So who‚Äôs the fool? You.   For believing a pathological liar.   Sucker.
1308428333458235392 2020-09-22 23:29:58 +0800 <ericaj58> @tagthis34 Trump ADMITTED on TAPE that he KNEW how catastrophic the virus was, and then told the American people the opposite. Then, catering to his poorly educated supporters, claimed he didn‚Äôt want people to panic.   But he pushes the panic button on everything else.   You are delusional.

The impeachment was a sham on the party of the Republicans.   Four different news outlets corroborate the disparaging comments you made about vets.   You are ON TAPE admitting EVERYTHING in the book.   You‚Äôre DONE.
1303870387315339265 2020-09-10 09:38:19 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump You held rallies KNOWING how contagious the virus is.   You KNEW it impacts younger people.   You DON‚ÄôT CARE how many people DIE as long as you have a chance at re-election.   I think that chance just vanished.

Other Presidents after they leave the WH wrote books and do speaking engagements.   Another ‚Äúpoorly educated‚Äù Repugnant who can‚Äôt google.    The facts are there.
1301211025799286786 2020-09-03 01:30:58 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump JFC who even BELIEVES your BS anymore?   A few FACTS:   You aren‚Äôt a ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù.   Biden doesn‚Äôt want to get rid of 2A.   Biden HELPED build the economy YOU‚ÄôRE taking CREDIT for.   You‚Äôve KILLED 190,000 Americans with your INCOMPETENCE.   These riots are on YOUR WATCH.
1301193214183895042 2020-09-03 00:20:11 +0800 <ericaj58> @realDonaldTrump Nope.   Too funny though. If the poll shows you winning you boast like crazy.   If it doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs a lie or ‚Äúfake news‚Äù.   Even my 5 year old granddaughter knows better than that!  https://t.co/ppvrQFvain

You drag your leg, slur your words, can‚Äôt walk down a ramp or hold a glass with one hand.   And why the addition of a sidewalk at the rose garden?
