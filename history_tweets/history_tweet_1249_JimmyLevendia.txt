1344052924788445184 2020-12-30 06:49:23 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> We used to mock one another as ‚Äúretarded‚Äù in high school. This was considered _de rigeur_ in that subculture. Mind you, stupid gross rap wasn‚Äôt popular then...so different things are expected today in high school subcultures. But you already know this, and are being a hypocrite.

1343774744328466433 2020-12-29 12:23:59 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @PalimpsestMan Hollywood and Noo Yawk (broadly considered) wouldn‚Äôt exercise the influence they do if they weren‚Äôt able to tap into the cultural milieu of Middle America...and the Heartland maintains its primacy as the source of dreams and myths, as well as food and resources, for the country.
1343773831706640384 2020-12-29 12:20:22 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @PalimpsestMan I see where you‚Äôre coming from...but you can see where this might come across as a little gaslighting, no? None of the two parts is as foreign to the other as they like to think; it‚Äôs the narcissism of small differences that obscures the underlying continuities...
1343773323667378179 2020-12-29 12:18:21 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @PalimpsestMan Both also exercised over time a disproportionate influence on the rest of their respective continental federations...

We only realized looking back on it with adult eyes...and are so happy that we saw it only when grown up.
1343074441933312003 2020-12-27 14:01:14 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Because it‚Äôs the easiest way for such people to trade in authenticity, the coin of our realm.
1343072744859168768 2020-12-27 13:54:30 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @TzarAngelo Which is why the power base for fascism, as was for communism, the petit-bourgeois and those adjacent to it. Fascists saw aristocrats as Thatcher saw the monarchy. Hierarchy was necessary in a rightly ordered society, of course...but they are still NQOCD. Not Quite Our Class Dear
1343071009201659905 2020-12-27 13:47:36 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @dirtfarmdeluxe That‚Äôs what makes it great
1343069955605061632 2020-12-27 13:43:25 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Mrs_Perepela @TheDonColacho Davila was a proper aristocrat; fascism, like communism, is an ideology naturally at home among the petit-bourgeoisie. You would laugh if you knew how many Greek immigrant shopkeepers who‚Äôd immigrated to Toronto were explicit communists:)

1343060821644091392 2020-12-27 13:07:07 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Mrs_Perepela I‚Äôve found that explicitly ‚Äúwoke‚Äù academics really are the most tiresomely parochial and provincial people. They‚Äôve no right at all to mock anyone else as insular and ‚Äúsmall town‚Äù.
1343058101818314753 2020-12-27 12:56:18 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Mrs_Perepela I can imagine the demands to confirm have gotten far more intolerable since my time.

1343051001138450432 2020-12-27 12:28:06 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @PolishNational1 @WMiddleton1837 You mean that old social forms and attitudes were preserved by Stalinism in stasis for the time since WWII, right?
1343050653011214337 2020-12-27 12:26:43 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> It‚Äôs a shocking experience when you realize later in life that those older men were trying to express, in Demotic Greek and broken English, the concept of Nietzschean ressentiment.

1343047133507817472 2020-12-27 12:12:43 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> We used to laugh at the old school Greek uncles when they advised against mixed marriages. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù they said: ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing wrong with black people.

Imagine German tech, scholarship &amp; management, combined with Soviet resources and China‚Äôs population and pragmatism (also probably the mathematicians &amp; physicists of Poland &amp; Hungary)...
1343037902545162241 2020-12-27 11:36:03 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @WMiddleton1837 The Chinese are more pragmatic about this Communism thing than the Soviets were.

1343023937136025600 2020-12-27 10:40:33 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @FyodorGaribaldi I don‚Äôt even like the British secret service that much; I‚Äôm fully aware of the nastiness they‚Äôre capable of. But this man was a self-righteous traitor, that sold his fellow agents into pain and death, to service his ego. I hope there‚Äôs a Hell, just for his sake.

1342978420297359361 2020-12-27 07:39:41 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @StationInner I‚Äôm honest enough to know this is where much of my visceral hatred of these types comes from: I would be considered very Non-U by their standards. No way in hell I would get away with even a fraction of their shenanigans.
1342976518084046856 2020-12-27 07:32:07 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @StationInner It would‚Äôve been a well-deserved award. I‚Äôm not a triumphalist; the end of the Cold War gave rise to a surveillance state and covert imperialism in the West that the Soviets would‚Äôve envied...but the destruction of their hopes needed to happen. Death to bourgeois idealism.

Enoch Powell once said that, even if Britain had a Communist government, he would still serve it because it was his country. What a difference from George Blake‚Äôs sordid moral opportunism.
1342946645575688193 2020-12-27 05:33:25 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Yes I really hate elite hangers on who dress up their treason as utopian idealism. These sort of people never fully get what they deserve.

1342944705626124293 2020-12-27 05:25:43 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> At least he got to see the Soviet collapse, the rise of a nationalist regime in Russia using Tsarist imagery which ended up paying his pension, and the ultimate meaninglessness of his spectacular betrayal of his country.

1341243714660921344 2020-12-22 12:46:35 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @RBollocksworth We are...but on good terms. For us:) Too late now; if that happened not only would the Electoral College skew permanently Democrat, but our people would run Hollywood and Washington even more than they already do....
1341242820263342080 2020-12-22 12:43:02 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> This develops, in a higher proportion of the population than usual, that slightly skewed perception that allows a defamiliarization of the everyday. Something that can lead to comedy, critique or occasionally insight
1341241985810780160 2020-12-22 12:39:43 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> From the 1950s to the 1980s, the part of Canada Toronto‚Äôs in had access to more broadcast TV channels, on a regular basis, than anywhere else in the world. We were saturated in American media, its images and tropes...but also in an old not-yet-dead tradition of anti-Americanism.
1341240062470729733 2020-12-22 12:32:04 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> And honestly, it explains not only much of Canadian comedy but the whole ability of Canadians to culture-hack the US for fun and profit over the years...
1341238746960842752 2020-12-22 12:26:50 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @themudtark2000 Their true aim is to cripple that sort of competition; which threatens their established status. It‚Äôs a feature, not a bug.
1341237627421405184 2020-12-22 12:22:24 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> There are multiple delicious meta levels of irony in this old quote, especially considering the state of SNL now...but one can still take it at face value.

1340865577351606274 2020-12-21 11:44:00 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> The wooden spoon, the _koutala_, was the Rod of Correction.
1340861635850854400 2020-12-21 11:28:20 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @NemoOdysseus Dalton should‚Äôve come after Brosnan, who would‚Äôve served as a transitional figure. I had actually heard Brosnan‚Äôs name bandied about as a possible Bond for some years before it was announced, on the strength of his role in Remington Steele:)

1340853091273478146 2020-12-21 10:54:23 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> It‚Äôs both pathetic and insulting when an actual Boomer tries to gaslight you over their particular partisan preferences.

1340826659004542976 2020-12-21 09:09:21 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @718Tv Has to be the dumbest commercial to come down the pipe, in a crowded field.
1340826045403058178 2020-12-21 09:06:55 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @NemoOdysseus Goldeneye, yeah. The funny thing is that Brosnan‚Äôs affect was similar to that of Daniel Craig‚Äôs when he came along: Bond showing glimpses of the ruthlessness that made him a skilled assassin
1340825230869225472 2020-12-21 09:03:41 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @DerekTurner1964 Wonderful! Leigh Hunt was Byron‚Äôs publisher, was he not?
1340824843516866561 2020-12-21 09:02:08 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @constans @WattDewIknow Yeah. Apparently the American chestnut tree produced in mass quantities back in the day.
1340802205184643072 2020-12-21 07:32:11 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Because he was my first Bond, I really didn‚Äôt see that then. Moore‚Äôs style _was_ James Bond. Then came exposure to Connery‚Äôs Bond...but it was Pierce Brosnan that really shook up my view of the character. He was the anti-Moore.

1340736598514741249 2020-12-21 03:11:29 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @yoopermomma It is very interesting. Also compulsively readable; he was such a clear and transparent English prose stylist that it‚Äôs no effort at all to read; the narrative just pulls you along.
1340736170083364865 2020-12-21 03:09:47 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @DebarringtonH We do. And we Canadians undergo forced ‚Äútriage through other means‚Äù by the excessive wait times for necessary procedures we endure. Made far worse under COVID now. I‚Äôm glad we have it, but there are always trade offs.
1340735534440853509 2020-12-21 03:07:15 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @DebarringtonH But I literally remember when positions were reversed early this very year.

1340732184769015808 2020-12-21 02:53:57 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> I learned this the hard way. You fall into the delusion that buying them means an automatic assimilation of their contents.
1340730861801656328 2020-12-21 02:48:41 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @yoopermomma Shiva Naipaul‚Äôs North of South, written in the 80s close to the events, taught me about this.
1340729504310976520 2020-12-21 02:43:18 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> To Whom It May Concern: This is to notify you that I will be remaining socially isolated during this Christmas.

1340724451793580032 2020-12-21 02:23:13 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> People who believe this should have to give up their personal vote to a black person. It‚Äôs the right thing to do.
1340723734735433728 2020-12-21 02:20:22 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @in_ardua_tendit And if the Wehrmacht did come...if the Greeks can say ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù, so can the Italians. If you must fight, fight to defend your own country.  https://t.co/xcW2bhYPK7
1340723157985087488 2020-12-21 02:18:04 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @in_ardua_tendit Probably might not‚Äôve been involved in Southern Europe at all without the Italian alliance; Hitler saw it before the war as a strategic distraction from the drang nach Osten.

1340721019422687234 2020-12-21 02:09:35 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Musso picked the wrong side. He had public opinion from Shaw to Churchill on his side early on; there was no reason he couldn‚Äôt have died in his bed in the Palazzo Venezia during the 1970s.

1340718497106685952 2020-12-21 01:59:33 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @718Tv It would be harder, except for superficial elements. The fact that the Great American Cultural Revolution happened then would raise too many questions. After all The Joker was set during the 70s, really. Captured the social breakdown and general hysteria...and it triggered them.
1340710676759793665 2020-12-21 01:28:29 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @lilchiva @718Tv Inflation put the final knife in the country‚Äôs back.
1340710532832215040 2020-12-21 01:27:54 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @lilchiva @718Tv Just so. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of ruin in a nation‚Äù...and it too a long time to cripple Argentina, it was so rich. Until the early 60s it had a higher per capita GDP than Austria, Italy, Japan and Spain.
1340708752606031873 2020-12-21 01:20:50 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @lilchiva True enough. I can‚Äôt help thinking 1980s Toronto had a better quality of life and affordability.

It‚Äôs not those hoary old feasts that are the great imminent threat to those travelling the Christian Way.
1340481365826002951 2020-12-20 10:17:17 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @cale905 Exactly so. If you like your work, you‚Äôre lucky. If you don‚Äôt, try to find self-respect in  the sacrifice made. Either way, as you said it‚Äôs _work_.

1340136479260102657 2020-12-19 11:26:49 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @ramspacek In the end, they‚Äôll all disdain the industrial worker, farmer, general labourer in favour of nice clean ‚Äúbrain work‚Äù. Cutting themselves off from the material realities of human relations with the concrete world, locking themselves into bourgeois idealism &amp; calling it being woke.
1340134713395212288 2020-12-19 11:19:48 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Why do I bother, though? Using dialectical materialism to critique these people would be like using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut. It‚Äôs all daddy issues and utopian dreams with them, nothing more.
1340134272468959235 2020-12-19 11:18:03 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Imagine thinking that is no need for human beings to mix their labour with natural resources in order to grow food, build shelters, make the necessities &amp; luxuries of human civilization. Imagine thinking shit all really happens by magic. These are the ‚Äúsocialists‚Äù Marx jeered at.

1339733056844935169 2020-12-18 08:43:46 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @NICOTINEFRIEND You have to through the southern Ontarians something for political reasons; Sarnia‚Äôs the best of a bad choice. I mean, where else can you build a line to? WINDSOR?!

1339731982629089282 2020-12-18 08:39:30 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> You may ask why the Yellow Line, instead of going round the north shore of Lake Athabaska and connecting Uranium City, goes by the south shore through the sand dunes. I say: nuclear reactors come and go; but scenic routes are forever!
1339730644587450368 2020-12-18 08:34:11 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @cherryboyron I can‚Äôt help confirming to stereotype and trying to get through it ASAP.
1339730293918478337 2020-12-18 08:32:47 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @CjgbVictoria If so the terminus/interchange should be at Don Mills station. The Sheppard Line stub would finally be useful!  https://t.co/TVLeQKyecl

1339728505127497729 2020-12-18 08:25:41 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @CjgbVictoria It depends on if Toronto city council actually makes a wholehearted transit decision and sticks to it. So no.
1339724313927307268 2020-12-18 08:09:01 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> I see international connections with the US, with France (through St Pierre)...but why not with Denmark through Greenland? It would be a mere bagatelle to extend the Teal Line from Iqaluit across the Labrador Sea. The vast and populous metropolis of Nuuk is RIGHT THERE.
1339721848523730947 2020-12-18 07:59:14 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @LvxMeaDvx That might be hard to swing due to political considerations; they‚Äôll accuse us of pandering to the Americans while cutting out any of our booming overcrowded cities

1339715523605630978 2020-12-18 07:34:06 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Some people might balk at the Port Roberts station, it being American territory. I say ‚Äúis not generosity Canadian? Should we not extend a hand of friendship and connection to a smaller city close to us, and not just the metropolis of Bismarck and the transit hub of Eastcourt!‚Äù

1339708202003423236 2020-12-18 07:05:00 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> I am lost in admiration; especially at the map showing even projected fantasy lines in southern Ontario and the St Lawrence valley.

1339632170218913792 2020-12-18 02:02:53 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @ramspacek True. Unfortunately, it takes a certain level of mental development to grasp the idea of culture in the first place. For people who think ‚Äúculture‚Äù is a concrete thing that can be ‚Äústolen‚Äù like a pair of Nikes, or that not being well schooled in the esoterica of cosmetics means&gt;

1334979495439294465 2020-12-05 05:54:49 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> To see Modernism (in its widest sense) as just another historical period, is a liberation. That destroys its eschatological power and the subsequent calendar worship (‚Äú...because it‚Äôs the Current Year!‚Äù). A path out of the Society of Spectacle.

1334925576029794307 2020-12-05 02:20:33 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Bill_Owen Maybe. It was, at its best, a fun common experience: laughing and crying in common, in the dark. But home digital video streaming and high ticket prices was already killing it. Our culture is not in a phase where collective feeling is appreciated. This has its drawbacks.
1334921622294310917 2020-12-05 02:04:51 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @HenselLosch @AndrewDalek I myself consider the tearing down of the desert pillars silly (it‚Äôs likely a marketing campaign), and that of the Buddhas an atrocity. This is however because I, personally, do not see either as an existential threat. That which I, or anyone else does, will be going down.

Their Revolution has, through schism and conspiracy, has become part of the Establishment. It no longer has the fire of youth to drive it. All they have is fear of losing their privileges.

1334906241538281473 2020-12-05 01:03:43 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Peter Hitchens has long said that Britain and other countries of the West are trapped in a stalemate, a frozen civil war between the old order and new. Either side, victorious, would clamp down and enforce a social order. For some now though, societal damage serves as a strategy.

1334900016192884737 2020-12-05 00:38:59 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Indeed. Thing is, our elites are so sapless, weak and senile that they can‚Äôt put these megalomaniacal dreams fully in place; our conspiracy theorists give them too much credit. They can only cause increasing chaos &amp; damage. There is nothing worse than a half-assed revolution.

1333624338885603334 2020-12-01 12:09:54 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @relicn0cer That happens a lot; particularly with critics having actual musical taste. The objections are obvious and glaring...but over time, you notice something interesting there.
1333623656514195456 2020-12-01 12:07:11 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @relicn0cer Being a Rush fan, I have fully made my peace with love of nerd bands.
1333622757159018498 2020-12-01 12:03:37 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @DodgerSidehill Everyone has their preferences. But to reject the whole traditional AmLit canon in toto because reasons, seems to indicate a deeper problem.
1333622060334125056 2020-12-01 12:00:51 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Ditzy Becky and her friends can now present their usual wilful shallow ignorance as virtue, and thus grab the opportunity with both hands.
1333620928278835200 2020-12-01 11:56:21 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @micahglasser It is. One has to actually enjoy reading to appreciate it.

1333619061658411008 2020-12-01 11:48:56 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @CjgbVictoria Zizek makes it explicit, plays up the shallow buffoon entranced by shiny surfaces. ironically, he is certainly actually well read: his American fans take his petites jeux as gospel.
1333618407116312578 2020-12-01 11:46:20 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @LvxMeaDvx Artificial scarcity‚Äôs the thing; in this case rationed through subculture gatekeeping.
1333616542215507971 2020-12-01 11:38:55 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> It‚Äôs funny that she objects to The Scarlet Letter; she and her fellow wowsers would find more kinship with the censorious Puritan villagers in the story than they‚Äôd probably like.
1333615652171636737 2020-12-01 11:35:23 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Critical theory gives the subliterate permission not to have to read classic lit because of pious objections rather than because the words are too hard.

Even the simplest map can give you information...but if you‚Äôre taking a long complicated trip, as we all often must do, simple maps are useless. 1400 years ago, the first Muslims rejected theology.

Somebody‚Äôs gonna have to do it to apply it to the complexities of daily life. That‚Äôs why Torah gives rise to Talmud, Koran to Hadith.
1333591614766407680 2020-12-01 09:59:52 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @saltaf01 @Le_Gaul @DerAchsenZeit To a great extent that‚Äôs not a useful dichotomy. No matter how many iconoclastic simplifying movements among the Abrahamic religions arise, from Islam to the various Protestant strains, they slowly rebuild a theology approaching the complexity of the version they dumped...
1333581476575780864 2020-12-01 09:19:35 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @saltaf01 @Le_Gaul @DerAchsenZeit Yeah Christianity cutting down on polygamy also tended to pair off that pool of unattached young men that spelled trouble in most societies

Islam is very much stripped down into a more ‚Äúportable‚Äù form of theology. No Trinitarian disputes ti confuse simple unlettered men, also channels religious fanaticism into fewer and thus more action oriented focus. Emphasis on equality powerful too
1333558482977615872 2020-12-01 07:48:13 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @WattDewIknow ‚ÄúFolks‚Äù, definitely here. People in the North &amp; West don‚Äôt consider that the South is the cultural cradle of the black diaspora into their cities; I think Thomas Sowell wrote about that.

1327388978396401668 2020-11-14 07:12:48 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @saltaf01 I was listening to a Tim Harford podcast about the ‚Äúhidden deaths‚Äù of the Fukushima evacuations.

Of course in an analog age we had nothing but time: enough for TV, radio, magazines and books, a little schoolwork...and lots of folklore. Rather thankful for that now.
1327312147014041600 2020-11-14 02:07:30 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> When I later in life read Jan Harold Brundvan‚Äôs compilations of urban legends I was amazed at how many I recognized from back then, and in their ‚ÄúCanadian variations‚Äù too: esp the one with a girlfriend hiding in the car, being coaxed out by the police (‚Äúdon‚Äôt turn around, Miss!‚Äù)

1327309636270174210 2020-11-14 01:57:32 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> True, one can get used to anything: in the old rowhouse I grew up in, mice regularly scuttling in the wall against which my bed‚Äôs headboard leaned was no biggie. Come to think of it, they were pretty loud &amp; heavy to be just mice... Anyway, monsters in the basement were scarier.

1324766731269623808 2020-11-07 01:32:56 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @BraveNewIdeas @Outis169 @DirtyErnieDeux You wanted ancient Greek wisdom; I have been passing it onto you:)
1324766555540983808 2020-11-07 01:32:14 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @BraveNewIdeas @Outis169 @DirtyErnieDeux Well, they knew about steam engines and that sort of thing...but used them as toys, or for temple magic tricks. But why would they need cars, when there were perfectly serviceable horses? As for machinery...well, that‚Äôs what slaves were for after all!
1324765136431816712 2020-11-07 01:26:36 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @BraveNewIdeas @Outis169 @DirtyErnieDeux The ancient world was not a nice place:)
1324765059881619458 2020-11-07 01:26:17 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @BraveNewIdeas @Outis169 @DirtyErnieDeux The rites were determined by the ancestors in the Golden Age, who were far stronger, wiser, taller and better than us in every way. They handed them down to us, that the gods may be appeased properly and be less likely to make us suffer just for lulz:)
1324763499193655296 2020-11-07 01:20:05 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @BraveNewIdeas @DirtyErnieDeux @Outis169 Pretty much, yeah:) You will be pushed around by her anyway, no matter how rich and powerful and in control you think you are. That‚Äôs kind of what the story of Croesus is all about in the first place, in fact. So...you didn‚Äôt read it to the end, huh?:)
1324762182958145538 2020-11-07 01:14:51 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @BraveNewIdeas @DirtyErnieDeux @Outis169 I do advise against trying to pressure the gods, or game them for advantage. They are old hands at messing with mortals who try that right back, and worse:) There‚Äôs a reason ‚Äúhubris‚Äù, ‚Äúoverweening pride‚Äù, was seen as a major sin by ancient Greeks, leading to personal destruction.

1324398440323915780 2020-11-06 01:09:28 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @constans In Canada, the population of a ‚Äúriding‚Äù (federal district) is set at around 111,166 for right now. But the tiny province of Prince Edward Island, pop. 156,947, guaranteed 4 seats by the constitution:)

1324392900738895877 2020-11-06 00:47:28 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> My province of Ontario has a population of 14,734,014. 124 seats in its legislature; and that only increased up from 107 seats in 2018. ‚ÄúNew Hampshire: Live Free Or Die‚Äù.

1323806902560673793 2020-11-04 09:58:55 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @saltaf01 Anyway Texas is still in play. If it goes Democrat (crazy but maybe), he‚Äôs lost it.
1323806120532729857 2020-11-04 09:55:48 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @saltaf01 Look at it this way: even the rank and file GOP loves Latino immigration now:) We see a bit of it here, right? Remember when I said the silver lining for liberals in Doug Ford winning meant that New Canadians are fully invested in all political parties. Integration worked:)

1323804180448948225 2020-11-04 09:48:06 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Latinos are natural reactionaries

1323801374631600133 2020-11-04 09:36:57 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @linnaeu5 Or maybe that their own petty tribal conflict with the white American tribe next door doesn‚Äôt have the cosmic significance they thought it did.
1323800104344629248 2020-11-04 09:31:54 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @linnaeu5 Her people are in the middle of the slow process of realizing tribes are a thing.

1323789545138196480 2020-11-04 08:49:57 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @woddersz Been many times now that, having broached a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù conversational opening I‚Äôve found people already at full redpilled stage. They just don‚Äôt make a big deal of it; just wait and see.
1323789066966573058 2020-11-04 08:48:03 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @woddersz I‚Äôm still thinking that‚Äôs there underneath it all; as the present elite decays and weakens, that nature becomes more evident. Most people, aside from mouthing the platitudes at the usual suspects, tend to be pretty based, to coin a phrase.

1323786460676444167 2020-11-04 08:37:41 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @deploradude It‚Äôs not. I found it useful to get back to the basics and say it was part of the deal to get all the states as part of the USA, so they would still have a say in things. ‚ÄúOh, they were like different countries before? Got it.‚Äù
1323785512226836482 2020-11-04 08:33:55 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Trying to explain the Electoral College to someone who doesn‚Äôt know about it is hard, have to admit.

1323780671219900416 2020-11-04 08:14:41 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @PalimpsestMan We have regionalism on a scale that the US hasn‚Äôt seen since before the Civil War, as well as an entire blood-and-soil nation (Quebec) in the mix. It‚Äôs a wonder _Canada_ is even as functional as it is:)
1323779778676228098 2020-11-04 08:11:08 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @XxemoviolencexX They also built a first world country in the Western Hemisphere‚Äôs equivalent of Siberia. Then they ended up not having to live under an ersatz Hanoverian monarchy with the serial numbers filed off, which recreated in America everything they revolted against in the first place.
1323778974745563137 2020-11-04 08:07:56 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Paros13 I agree! I just wish more Canadians showed even half as much interest in their own country as they they show in US affairs:)
1323778737457057792 2020-11-04 08:07:00 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @DIorioNathaniel I‚Äôd agree with that. An awful lot of people though jump in with both feet, to the extent of forgetting that this is a different country with its own interests.
1323778408812261377 2020-11-04 08:05:41 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @DirtyErnieDeux I love Canada too, for the same reasons:) I just wish my fellow citizens weren‚Äôt so insecure about their own country; it‚Äôs a damn shame.
1323776941636419584 2020-11-04 07:59:52 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> As a Canadian I‚Äôve always found Canadian smugness annoying, and being endlessly obsessed with US partisan politics as a way of making our own mediocre politics look good  by comparison as extremely cringeworthy.

It will be the fact that most Old Liberals think most New Liberals are actually liberal; treating as part of their in-group those who would happily use, then discard them.

1322744314494070789 2020-11-01 11:36:34 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @linnaeu5 I first heard it watching Amadeus:) I searched out a recording (the Deutsche Grammophon version it happened to be, I‚Äôll never forget). A shattering experience. The only other that came close in Western music for me was Allegri's Miserere...and _that_ put a lump in my throat.

And that was seen as more mainstream then; Nazism with its racial mysticism was the outlier in that tendency. There were a number of prominent Italian Jews among the Fascisti then.

1319283699687383042 2020-10-22 22:25:19 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Scribulatora True. I‚Äôd say all parties have been captured by a political class more similar to each other than they are to their respective followers. Current events often determined by factional conflict among this class, and the rest of us dimly starting to figure this out.

1319279094287069186 2020-10-22 22:07:01 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @FlycatcherSilky German idealistic philosophy, overcomplicating Sallustius‚Äô ‚Äúa myth is an event that never happened, but is always true‚Äù, needed one of its own great epitomes to beat some sense back into it with a thick solid book:)
1319276704288837640 2020-10-22 21:57:31 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Look, everybody has blinders, like it or not. I‚Äôm of the belief that everybody _needs_ blinders, just to function in life. But smart people being smugly unaware they have blinders at all, just because they‚Äôre hidden under ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù &amp; ‚Äústudies show‚Äù is a real Socratic fail.
1319275694421991426 2020-10-22 21:53:31 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @TaurineDealer Yup.
1319275583142985731 2020-10-22 21:53:04 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Deep religio-philosophical tweets: small group of regular enthusiasts comments. Retweeting commentary on commentary on Spanish egirl being cute online: half Twitter joins into the discussion on my TL. Truly, the thirst is hilariously real.
1319274829627813891 2020-10-22 21:50:04 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @CjgbVictoria Most of their misconceptions come about from taking their own particular, culturally determined set of blinders and assuming them to be direct experience of unmediated reality.
1319274329020887042 2020-10-22 21:48:05 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @TaurineDealer Mere execution is the enlightened way of going about it. Her deserts before the 18th century would be burning alive on a pure.

1319254129450061825 2020-10-22 20:27:49 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> The Orthodox Paschal Troparion, sung at the Easter liturgy, speaks of the risen Christ trampling Death to death underfoot; the imagery alludes to the Hellenistic kings of antiquity (often titled ‚ÄúSaviour‚Äù), ritualistically portrayed with foot on a defeated enemy‚Äôs neck.
1319252873251852288 2020-10-22 20:22:50 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> The early Christians saw themselves as fighting a fierce war against powerful enemies in high places, the ‚Äúpowers of the air‚Äù, the old gods...using the only weapons available to such people as themselves.
1319249723405045764 2020-10-22 20:10:19 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> I like Modernist Right. But in this case, even Pagans, never mind Christians, would understand. The Spartan Mother: ‚Äúcome back with your shield...or on it‚Äù. Or Odin Allfather, hanging himself from the world-tree Yggdrasil as a sacrifice ‚Äúof himself to himself‚Äù.

1319100107548200962 2020-10-22 10:15:47 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Sigdrifr @CjgbVictoria I worry that this basic sentiment might be increasingly generationally limited to the tougher Boomers and Generation X; those more recent tend to be more ideological herd animals.

1317966668879044608 2020-10-19 07:11:55 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @FrantizekPaul Words cannot express my own massive relief when I get in my car and can take the mask off. I look at other people and I gotta wonder.
1317966275772076034 2020-10-19 07:10:21 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> When it‚Äôs destroying a church cross, it‚Äôs mental illness. When it‚Äôs leaving a bacon butty outside a mosque, it‚Äôs a criminal conviction resulting in being murdered in jail. Thank you Bongland, very cool.

1317962238607712256 2020-10-19 06:54:18 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @cale905 They‚Äôre fed up. I honestly get it. I‚Äôm surprised more people haven‚Äôt gone utterly squirrelly. I put the blame more on the feckless bigwigs mismicromanaging everyone else‚Äôs lives for lack of leadership.

1317947641276358658 2020-10-19 05:56:18 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Thesokorus It was far, far more about safety than shooting; this was the test to get licensed. The real shooting comes after the Mounties get the test results, do the background checks and issue the actual licenses.
1317946538379849731 2020-10-19 05:51:55 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Thesokorus The Magnum was great; skewed my preference towards the double action
1317944865506926592 2020-10-19 05:45:16 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Thesokorus For restricted firearms did Beretta semi-automatic, Colt .45 single-action revolver, and for the double action revolver...‚Äùthe most powerful handgun in the world‚Äù:) 98% on the written test, 97% on the range.
1317943123889115138 2020-10-19 05:38:21 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> To be fair, how it‚Äôs going was kind of how it started in the first place ‚Äúab urbe condita‚Äù.

1317933295892652038 2020-10-19 04:59:18 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @FrantizekPaul It was. But the Line going up apparently required that to be ruined.

1317621451093139458 2020-10-18 08:20:08 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Why can‚Äôt your community control their fanatics? Doesn‚Äôt look like they want to, judging from you. Why should civilized people be guilted into adapting to deranged savages?
1317618244056920064 2020-10-18 08:07:24 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @ManolaD281 Completely. It‚Äôs like listening to Alex Jones with a Greek accent:)
1317617278695968770 2020-10-18 08:03:34 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Thesokorus I‚Äôm quite sure. The instructor made sure to train us on the full range of long guns, I can see him doing the same with handguns.
1317616193331748864 2020-10-18 07:59:15 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @BaruchPletner @AliceTeller It‚Äôs true

1317615505788817409 2020-10-18 07:56:31 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Also, I tell you what, frens: my group was equally numbers of male and female, middle class Gen-X Greeks all born here...and I have not heard more ‚Äúbased &amp; redpilled‚Äù conversation on frogtwitter:) Every one of us a right-wing wack job. My people!:)
1317613123931615232 2020-10-18 07:47:03 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Anyway, tomorrow the restricted firearms course; ie. handguns. The bunch of Gen-X local Greeks I took the course with already joking about holding the guns sideways gangsta style üòÇ
1317612387273445376 2020-10-18 07:44:07 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @BaruchPletner Baby steps:) just focussing on getting the licenses now, and signing up to practice with rented guns at the gun club for now.

1317611297802956807 2020-10-18 07:39:48 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @venusianfriend It was a combination of stress from being back in a classroom after decades, and enjoyment. I had fun.
1317611006873554944 2020-10-18 07:38:38 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @constans Separate restricted firearms licence for those
1317610812064845824 2020-10-18 07:37:52 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @BaruchPletner Yes indeed
1317610676098039817 2020-10-18 07:37:19 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Pump and lever action are fun (thankfully wasn‚Äôt bitten in the thumb, apparently a common occurrence), bolt action is interesting...but the simple, sweet, solid double-barrelled 12 gauge Winchester...ah:)
1317609787652251649 2020-10-18 07:33:48 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Done! Uncle Jimmy aced both the classroom and range tests: fellow students wondered how I got 100% on the written:) Would‚Äôve gotten the same on the range, if not for getting a bit confused at first by the semi-automatic action...goddam overcomplicated piece of shit lol
1317609193818460160 2020-10-18 07:31:26 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @constans Yes it‚Äôs required here. Test results are sent to the Mounties, who do the background checks and issue the license.
1317608973261045760 2020-10-18 07:30:33 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @FyodorGaribaldi Bolt-action Enfields are nice, but remembering to remove and check the magazine after cease-fire happens a lot when one is a newbie:)
1317524756783128580 2020-10-18 01:55:55 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Non-restricted firearms course today: lever &amp; bolt and pump action, oh my! (Semi-automatic too...)
1317523866604965889 2020-10-18 01:52:22 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> This has now spread enough beyond my Twitter circle to start getting the ‚Äúackshually‚Äù responses
1317320838761283584 2020-10-17 12:25:37 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @lilbabykeffiyeh @Progrockfarmer This entire story is the gift that keeps on giving
1317317556475207681 2020-10-17 12:12:34 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @CDEdgy Possibly objecting to Ginger and Maryanne as eye candy? Or making fun of the Japanese submariner who didn‚Äôt know WWII was over? Why ask why, the very premise of a content warning on Gilligan‚Äôs Island is rank stupidity.
1317310299331006465 2020-10-17 11:43:44 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @ModernCortes Last I heard they said he wasn‚Äôt a parent, but who knows?

1317307360675848192 2020-10-17 11:32:03 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @ModernCortes He wasn‚Äôt even connected with the class in any way. How the fuck did this crazed human chimp hear about anything there unless some little freak of a student tattled on the teacher?
1317305115255164929 2020-10-17 11:23:08 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @ModernCortes That‚Äôs right he‚Äôs originally ‚Äúfrom Moscow‚Äù:) just from that I figured Chechen
1317304912741584896 2020-10-17 11:22:20 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @DirtyErnieDeux Looks that way. The effect of the last decade on me was to kill off what loyalties I had to the larger society beyond the vestigial. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs not a more general phenomenon: look how many of these sound off here. For each one with Twitter Tourette‚Äôs, 4 dozen quiet guys
1317303341949591552 2020-10-17 11:16:05 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @DirtyErnieDeux Indeed. Now what?
1317302016130109441 2020-10-17 11:10:49 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Sir_Geechie Isn‚Äôt it funny that it was more the alt-light crowd she hung round like Gavin et al that tended to be swine?
1317301670674653184 2020-10-17 11:09:27 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @DirtyErnieDeux If a human being has any shred of self respect left, he can‚Äôt really be anywhere else but the right at this point.
1317299278394654721 2020-10-17 10:59:56 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @DirtyErnieDeux It‚Äôs a pity _they‚Äôre_ not the ones getting their heads chopped off, getting run down, getting shot. Only the rest of us, earnest dupes and cynics alike.
1317298380469620738 2020-10-17 10:56:22 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @DirtyErnieDeux The traitors won, is the lesson that I draw.
1317298134851198977 2020-10-17 10:55:24 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Right wingers are such awful people, yet they‚Äôre the ones who keep being right about this sort of thing. Funny that.  We will go down every slippery slope. Every single one.
1317297126985109504 2020-10-17 10:51:23 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Believe it. People who would do this live down all our streets. But then, our betters tell us that it‚Äôs part and parcel of living in a modern world city. Oh well.

1317188977024262144 2020-10-17 03:41:38 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @AliceTeller Probably they‚Äôre less concerned about the details of the thing and more concerned that the possibility of (horrors) actual conspiracy in government and establishment seems to be moving out of the province of fiction for many.

1314391299697577986 2020-10-09 10:24:40 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @dirtfarmdeluxe Lol you didn‚Äôt; it was a long time ago. I just had to give background to show how correct you were in that small business is very much a calling.
1314390875238215681 2020-10-09 10:22:59 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @StationInner Laurier and Sir John A were the best of men.

1314390035920281602 2020-10-09 10:19:39 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @dirtfarmdeluxe ...all this in the face of 4 Tim Hortons placed in the area around our shop to mop up the business. When she had to throw in the towel the Timmies franchisee visited her, not to gloat but to express his awe:) And this was a woman who was offered the fast track to a department &gt;
1314389267142111232 2020-10-09 10:16:36 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @dirtfarmdeluxe My mom was so devoted to the ideal of being her own boss that she fought to keep the family donut shop alive beyond all reasonable rational calculation. Like ‚Äúthird mortgage on the house‚Äù, ‚Äúfinding delivery customers all over GTA‚Äù, ‚Äústretching every penny till it broke‚Äù efforts..
1314388278410444802 2020-10-09 10:12:40 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @StationInner Very tactful way of putting it!  https://t.co/U6o5Z8a7sX

1314385000884768768 2020-10-09 09:59:38 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @StationInner Ha! Probably not Montcalm‚Äôs Revenge; more like Robespierre‚Äôs:) This happened in English Canada partially as a reaction to a full on secularizing cultural revolution in Quebec, the Quiet Revolution:  https://t.co/SR9TxVasRE The Qu√©b√©cois belatedly followed their French cousins:)
1314383826819387394 2020-10-09 09:54:59 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @PhilGarber5 That‚Äôs because you are both intelligent and not a Liberal:)

1314382775324160001 2020-10-09 09:50:48 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @StationInner Exactly
1314382646479384583 2020-10-09 09:50:17 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @StationInner ...everything from replacing the symbols of the old British Loyalism to multiculturalism to entrenching a constitutional Charter of Rights and Freedoms to trump parliaments‚Äô legislative supremacy by judicial means.
1314382162364424194 2020-10-09 09:48:22 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @StationInner It‚Äôs been a long development here. Since the 60s (even before), the Canadian Liberals adopted American progressive liberalism as their ‚Äúnationalism‚Äù; our present prime minister‚Äôs father was the great impresario of this great ideological and constitutional change...
1314378163976392705 2020-10-09 09:32:28 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> So very, very good.

1314369518613999616 2020-10-09 08:58:07 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @PhilGarber5 Not quite; the Canadian perspective is now a narrowly nationalist mirror image of the Americans one, both very incomplete for just those reasons. This got attention because it was _not_ the present Canadian perspective.
1314369061833375749 2020-10-09 08:56:18 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @richard5832 I‚Äôm sure. Not at all a good look though.
1314368509904904194 2020-10-09 08:54:07 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @AndrewDalek LIBERAL.
1314368379793346560 2020-10-09 08:53:36 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @StationInner True. But the American Whigs ultimately won this civil war; which is why American civil rights mutations have colonized both Canada and Britain.

1314359217915125766 2020-10-09 08:17:11 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @DirtyErnieDeux Christopher Caldwell nailed it with civil rights being a revolution and civil war by other means:  https://t.co/pkGjZD7GxS
1314358349539037184 2020-10-09 08:13:44 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @StationInner Dude, one of the slaves that ended up fleeing the plantation for service with the British, and then going with the Loyalists to Nova Scotia, abandoned his ‚Äúslave name‚Äù and took on the new nom de guerre ‚ÄúBritish Freedom‚Äù. If that‚Äôs not badass, I don‚Äôt know what is.
1314357129751465985 2020-10-09 08:08:53 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @DirtyErnieDeux The abolitionists pushed that forward; they and the southern fire eaters drew energy from each other.
1314356902114070528 2020-10-09 08:07:59 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @DirtyErnieDeux ...and all that stuff about the Royal Navy press ganging American sailors as a cause of war becomes understandable: it was a cold civil war still going on; to the Brits these guys were still subjects.
1314356399640633345 2020-10-09 08:05:59 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @DirtyErnieDeux It really is amazing; was often really brother against brother. Like colonial Loyalist militiaman sniper in 1812 shoots American officer, then rifles the dead officer‚Äôs pockets and finds that it was his actual brother who‚Äôd broken with his fleeing Tory family and stayed back
1314355419314298883 2020-10-09 08:02:06 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> As for this being a Second English Civil War...King George and his courtiers perceived the American Revolution as being specifically a ‚ÄúPresbyterian rebellion‚Äù, taking in both the New Englanders and the Scots-Irish.  https://t.co/wtcU5VHNcD
1314354293001146368 2020-10-09 07:57:37 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @RyanProng It really is. Puts so much into perspective about everything from Canadian nationalism to the Anglosphere.

1313999056293826562 2020-10-08 08:26:02 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> This is apparently really a thing. The Winnipeg school board buying copies, even.
1313996518022541312 2020-10-08 08:15:57 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @byzantinepower My mores were definitely shaped by a society established by that staid colonial Middle, as the utter degradation of the British underclass has utterly horrified me ever since Theodore Dalrymple shone a light on it.

1313921037952745476 2020-10-08 03:16:01 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Indeed, the documentary was Canada‚Äôs national cinematic form. The National Film Board started as a  state propaganda arm during WWII, and after a flowering of creativity is reverting to that.

1313543185021296641 2020-10-07 02:14:34 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @deploradude The government plan here does; healthcare is on a provincial (‚Äústate‚Äù) basis, topped up by federal subsidy. The Ontario Health Insurance Plan in my case, basically a state HMO:  https://t.co/HRO2Et8JkK
1313542649417273350 2020-10-07 02:12:26 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Ajsoti @DirtyErnieDeux Yeah; it‚Äôs the job benefits plans, which pay for things like glasses, drugs and dentistry (none of which are govt covered and all of which are pricey) that are very coveted indeed.
1313542030870687744 2020-10-07 02:09:59 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> From what I see so far, Australia‚Äôs hybrid Medicare system may offer a way forward for Canada at least:  https://t.co/9VOzJ55muh Should be more politically palatable too, coming out of a ‚Äúsister Dominion‚Äù:)

1313539761685102598 2020-10-07 02:00:58 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @constans It‚Äôs true. There are so many options First World countries are using; but we‚Äôre the same way up here. There are only two systems in the world: ours and the States. And local bureaucracies have no incentive to correct the impression.
1313539335053025281 2020-10-07 01:59:16 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> My own mom, during her second bout with cancer, was nearly medevaced by chopper to Buffalo because of a surgery that had to be done immediately, and no available ER slot. Only the fact that a surgeon who had finished early and decided to be a saint kept her procedure here.

1313535952816611329 2020-10-07 01:45:50 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Thesokorus I can‚Äôt stress enough that I feel having some real subsidy to working people for medical bills is necessary. But not even European countries or Australia have single payer on our format. There have to be  better ways to do this sustainably.
1313535303857180673 2020-10-07 01:43:15 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> &gt;where do they turn? To the United States. U.S. health care serves as an ultimate safety net and relief valve to Canadian health care.
1313535140187066368 2020-10-07 01:42:36 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Even when working &amp; middle class people can‚Äôt wait years on a waiting list, they‚Äôll dip into savings or raise money. Even when Canadian health authorities close to the border can't find an expert surgeon to do a rare emergency procedure, or even just run out of acute-care beds,&gt;
1313534591299391488 2020-10-07 01:40:25 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> ...namely, a large neighbour to the south with a market-based health system. Where do nine-tenths of all technical innovations in medicine come from? The United States. When the elite in Canada get sick, do they stay home &amp; wait in line in Canada? They go to the United States.
1313533794507513857 2020-10-07 01:37:15 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> I‚Äôm a fan of single-payer healthcare, it being all I know and medical bills being what they are...but I can‚Äôt see how the U.S. is going to adopt a single-payer national health care system like Canada's. The United States is missing an essential component of the Canadian system...

1313132060295471104 2020-10-05 23:00:54 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @bdunbar My understanding is that actual power seems to be the greatest perk of political office. By that standard, being a VP is less than satisfactory.
1313131440377339904 2020-10-05 22:58:26 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> The US is a nation over 300 million, keystone of the world‚Äôs economy and alliance structure. Its military is an order of magnitude more powerful than the next two biggest military powers. It‚Äôs the planetary hegemon by any measure. Denying this is boring, a little sad &amp; weird.

1310966407300108288 2020-09-29 23:35:22 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Trump should tell black people that the Democrats actually took down Wakanda, and handed it over to slave traders. It would even be true:)

1310958240079978496 2020-09-29 23:02:55 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @PeterSaker2 It‚Äôs crypsis similar to wokeness: intersectionality means that the $3000 a seminar professional HR consultant can call a blue collar general labourer an oppressor.

1310944115811594243 2020-09-29 22:06:48 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Progressives will never actually learn from this not to make culture war though: ‚Äúso religious people will vote for someone who isn‚Äôt a believer, and moreover has basic liberal personal opinions? Hmmm, weird.‚Äù

1310909592474390530 2020-09-29 19:49:37 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> The takeaway: classic small-l liberalism is an interregnum between ruling ideologies; it results from the breakdown of the old one and acts as a vacuum drawing in the new.

1309150885449265152 2020-09-24 23:21:08 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> This is piddly shite; should go all the way: dialectics is racist because it emerged ultimately from the aristocratic war councils of the nomadic Indo-European tribes still living on the steppe Sea of Grass.  The Woke well on their way to vindicating Ricardo Duchesne; good jobüëç
1309148494607855617 2020-09-24 23:11:38 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Progrockfarmer A lot of American ex-Baptist converts arrive there for the same reason. Some of them bring even more inappropriate Prot baggage; if it‚Äôs a choice between them and acolytes of the John Julius Norwich school...honestly, I‚Äôd choose the Brits. You gotta take the allies you get.

1309137939503419392 2020-09-24 22:29:42 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @lilchiva @DirtyErnieDeux There may be a range, but the outliers aren‚Äôt as common as they might like.

1309109876627570695 2020-09-24 20:38:11 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @lilchiva Most societies (incl overwhelmingly ‚Äútrad‚Äù ones) have an established place for courtesans, heterai etc. Thing is, there‚Äôs both no established place for such persons now. Also, many of these people (or their spokesbeings) have delusions of grandeur about what that place should be.
1309108964328701953 2020-09-24 20:34:33 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Progrockfarmer ...the ‚Äúbio‚Äù part comes from those said outcast groups being these days defined by gender, race, sexual orientation, BMI etc.
1309108048041046017 2020-09-24 20:30:55 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Progrockfarmer Might as well give it a shot: a faction of the big shots (or their spoiled brats) organizing the congenital losers and fuckups of society as a weapon against the normal people, for status money and power.

Is it an invisible mysterious evil spirit pervading Western societies, the modern leftist version of the old Christian notion of Original Sin? Is it just living a quiet life in the suburbs while having a white skin? All these have been called ‚Äúracism‚Äù recently

1308070272239579136 2020-09-21 23:47:10 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> To make it entirely clear: people like Kendi do not want a firm definition of ‚Äúracism‚Äù. They want it as flexible a definition as possible, all the better to apply it to the enemy of the moment as needed. Hence all this shamefully smooth-brained waffling.

Not many have remained there tho; it was the Greek neighbourhoods in the east end of the city that have proved more enduring, and to which most have remigrated.

All PR did was externalize the necessary job of coalition building; instead of keeping it under a big tent party made it harder in public glare
1307764252124549122 2020-09-21 03:31:09 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @JohnGild88 It‚Äôs true enough. The overwhelming majority of us aren‚Äôt alpha, and do ourselves no favours in this game by just putting our heads down and working. Hoping for, at most, _a little_ peace, happiness and leisure.
1307763609351720963 2020-09-21 03:28:36 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Scribulatora Yeah. Australia got PR, still ended up with dominant Labour (Liberal) and Liberal (Conservative) parties...but now with even more political horse trading and skullduggery to rope the smaller parties into line. Goody.

1306642246633103360 2020-09-18 01:12:42 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @CatholicKanger1 Some people live on hatred; it‚Äôs the stimulant that gets them out of bed in the morning, and keeps them going. I guess you have to pray for them, because only God can save them from where they‚Äôre heading.

1305274450112393217 2020-09-14 06:37:34 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @constans Canada is a one and a half-party system; even when Tories are in power much of the bureaucracy and Establishment just resentfully waits them out. Then they literally applaud the Liberals when they get back in power.

1304658005179469825 2020-09-12 13:48:02 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> I always figured Eric Hobsbawm‚Äôs sympathies for Stalinism caused him to make ‚Äúthe short 20th century‚Äù a decade _too_ short: beginning in 1914 and ending with Soviet collapse in 1991.

1304619079387537410 2020-09-12 11:13:21 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @Progrockfarmer When I was a nerd, I spake as a nerd, I understood as a nerd, I thought as a nerd: but when I became a man, I put away nerdy things.  Well...not completely. But seeing those stunted ones who didn‚Äôt grow up did make me rethink the old geeky assumptions.

As well as the year a major government commission was convened whose eventual recommendations represented a major paradigm shift from that nationalism‚Äôs Keynesian dirigism, to free trade and economic liberalism.
1304611151410597888 2020-09-12 10:41:51 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @consptheory77 I can definitely see that.

1304603645590335488 2020-09-12 10:12:02 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @NOYB2869 The interesting question is, when did ‚Äúthe long 80s‚Äù start? Is there a specific symbolic event?
1304603055221084161 2020-09-12 10:09:41 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Yeah it was a continuation. 9/11 the end of that era.

One of my grandmother‚Äôs Portuguese friends came of an ex-planter family from Angola. She said of the place that it was so fertile, if you pushed a dead stick into the soil it would soon flower
1304580261208879108 2020-09-12 08:39:06 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @valueterminal The Lal episode was one of the very best. When my bro and I first watched them broadcast, my mom grew to enjoy watching ST:TNG also, despite herself. This episode, ‚ÄúData‚Äôs Day‚Äù and the one with Data‚Äôs ‚Äúmother‚Äù convinced her that Data _did_ in fact have a soul (ie ‚Äúwas human‚Äù).

1304558206744694789 2020-09-12 07:11:28 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @AliceTeller That she is ‚Äúdisgusted and sad‚Äù over the response, rather than the film itself, says much more about her than about the critics...none of it savoury. If one is willing to normalize such depravity in order to ‚Äúepater les bourgeois‚Äù, this makes that person an enemy of humanity.

1303517682864730118 2020-09-09 10:16:48 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @RyanProng The logic is unanswerable.
1303517534629617664 2020-09-09 10:16:13 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @RyanProng This is why the Conservative war rooms kept pushing to bring the more socially conservative in the suburbs into alliance with rural and small town Canada.

1303512303262932994 2020-09-09 09:55:25 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> In the run up to the 1995 Quebec Sovereignty Referendum there was some grassroots demos here through the GTA using the slogan ‚ÄúMy Canada Includes Quebec‚Äù, to show Quebeckers they were welcome in Canada. I don‚Äôt see that happening now, at all. The mood is less naive, more hard.

1301002743537074176 2020-09-02 11:43:20 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> @ne0agent1c Yeah no kidding. So if I don‚Äôt devote all my resources to AI, you‚Äôre gonna torture a simulated me that isn‚Äôt really me? Good luck with that; imma spend my money on beer and chips, and my time watching TV pls &amp; thank u.
1301002104883077120 2020-09-02 11:40:47 +0800 <JimmyLevendia> Indeed, it wouldn‚Äôt be you; it would be an identical virtual twin. _Something_ would wake up in the simulation, would have your memories even...but that consciousnesses you experience right now, a continuous thread back to your misty childhood... _That_ will be gone.
