1342810379580289026 2020-12-26 20:31:57 +0800 <Astret> No idea on #brexit with all the #covid stress this festive season? The beeb have summarised some highlights of the new #BrexitDeal   https://t.co/bpqg2XvHzL

1342589730043604998 2020-12-26 05:55:10 +0800 <Astret> Well done to all the Xmas survivors who delivered their first Turkey dinner today! Your next challenge... #leftovers 🍗😁❤️
1342418192820563970 2020-12-25 18:33:32 +0800 <Astret> Merry Christmas!🎄🍗🍾
1341414102799949837 2020-12-23 00:03:39 +0800 <Astret> Iced the #Xmas cake, sorted a tax error with HMRC and (fingers crossed) booked a PT session. Productive day! #holidays
1341413207794216967 2020-12-23 00:00:05 +0800 <Astret> @SimmsMelanie This is the best accident! But do you have enough coffee to go with it?
1341049899509559296 2020-12-21 23:56:26 +0800 <Astret> Gorgeous note and package from @Archanejil today. Miss you too!  https://t.co/yVdIKIV6Ub

1341018845830647809 2020-12-21 21:53:02 +0800 <Astret> @DocHackenbush All done. Unrelated though - your birds comic content on red bubble is formatted wrongly for some products , be nice if you could fix that sometime!
1341017246844547073 2020-12-21 21:46:41 +0800 <Astret> @DocHackenbush My mistake - there is a link to your red bubble though which I presume is fine?
1340995578306682880 2020-12-21 20:20:35 +0800 <Astret> @BillCookester @HalaMansour @UniOfYork I was sad to hear you were off! Is it something I said? 😅
1340995094145544194 2020-12-21 20:18:39 +0800 <Astret> I know a lot of folks won't be having the Xmas they planned. I made a load of #resources to host a pie-based festive #party; in case anyone else would enjoy them, they are shared here:  https://t.co/6yOFYUgEbA #christmas #pie #games Special thanks @DocHackenbush
1340983509553442816 2020-12-21 19:32:37 +0800 <Astret> Happy solstice! In the spirit of new beginnings I’d like to announce I will be starting a new job at @UniOfYork in the New Year!  https://t.co/C9Vd2nCRTz

1339702215703969793 2020-12-18 06:41:13 +0800 <Astret> @BootstrapCook Get well soon @BootstrapCook !
1339613162925150210 2020-12-18 00:47:21 +0800 <Astret> I have been adding to the UKLARP wiki. We need more terms to help discuss online #LARP people have tried this year! Anyone want to help out is welcome 😀  https://t.co/0K4d3vEWLu
1339559551327227910 2020-12-17 21:14:19 +0800 <Astret> @MENnewsdesk My first response is to swear too. This responsibility narrative is false and misleading when T&amp;T has failed to deliver. High restrictions have been continuous in Manchester since the end of July. People are sufferring mentally and economically.
1339543867440443392 2020-12-17 20:12:00 +0800 <Astret> @Weights_Wine looks that way. We can enjoy our 'non essential shops' or gyms, but that's it.
1339540714833780737 2020-12-17 19:59:28 +0800 <Astret> So despite these figures they are keeping Manchester in Tier 3 - so many businesses are going to lose out on festive trading 😢
1337357258683015168 2020-12-11 19:23:12 +0800 <Astret> @UWankings @FelixVuo Given that the original snippet is for a role with a Law journal I think there’s more to be said about elitism in the law profession here than HE snobbery and relevant skills.
1337356653755310081 2020-12-11 19:20:47 +0800 <Astret> @TomasCanning Why didn’t they just say blankly in the advert, “needs to be socially connected in high profile legal circles?” I mean that’s what they are looking for? No wonder law has a diversity problem.
1337116036013973508 2020-12-11 03:24:40 +0800 <Astret> Great workout this morning!  https://t.co/VupvOWwKWb

1334554561240031242 2020-12-04 01:46:16 +0800 <Astret> Consumption doesn’t make us happy - people do. It’s better to invest in experiences together than to buy stuff 3/3  https://t.co/u1rodQAp1S
1334554550133530627 2020-12-04 01:46:14 +0800 <Astret> We don’t need to travel as often or as far, and it’d be much better for nature and our air quality if we appreciated our local or home environment more. #staycation 2/3  https://t.co/rJmH0Qkfqo
1334554535906439169 2020-12-04 01:46:10 +0800 <Astret> Very hopeful that the vaccine roll out will pave the way for better social interactions, but we could all learn a lot about the positive benefits of 2020. 1/3

1333692821778423809 2020-12-01 16:42:02 +0800 <Astret> @lfb500 Thank you 😊 The holly is very shiny - but took its price in the assembly!
1333538360359575552 2020-12-01 06:28:15 +0800 <Astret> Spent a lovely evening on zoom with friends making a Christmas wreath 😊 #FestiveSimpleJoys  https://t.co/P6STZJvT0a
1333046066573402113 2020-11-29 21:52:03 +0800 <Astret> Mahoosive Sunday lunch enjoyed by all - eating meat less often but buying organic and slow reared is definitely worth it 😊

1329497550064410627 2020-11-20 02:51:31 +0800 <Astret> @DrChloeVitry @tom_redshaw Someone said ‘game’!! But yeah, the number of pen-and-paper rpgs that use a system of ‘class’ to differentiate between player capabilities is huge. Many narratives then utilise factions to create a ‘realistic’ diverse and unequal society in which players have to overcome this

1327550489022640129 2020-11-14 17:54:35 +0800 <Astret> I’m going to try making them another time with more liquid than the instructions, and perhaps some oil or banana for moisture as they were a bit dry too!

1321768751956635648 2020-10-29 19:00:02 +0800 <Astret> I just want to go on the record to say that I hate all the new #Google icons. They're fun, but it makes it stupidly difficult to differentiate between different applications. Surely they're not #accessibility friendly either?
1319035598137688064 2020-10-22 05:59:27 +0800 <Astret> I can’t change the outcome of parliament today but I can put my hand in my pocket. If you were able to eat comfortably today you can too.

1315649315675795462 2020-10-12 21:43:35 +0800 <Astret> An interesting contradiction in dignity and human rights lies in the support #dignity gives to moral #individualism rather than collective moral #obligation.

It’s such a farce. There *is* such a thing as #society and the #public.

1301951647447486464 2020-09-05 02:33:56 +0800 <Astret> @SamWPsychology @AcademicChatter So I didn’t do paid work, as I had a lot of unpaid legal work and advocacy to do on behalf of my mum who became very ill and was placed under a compulsory treatment order. I suspect there are a fair number of people who similarly had unpaid care work

1301802296796491778 2020-09-04 16:40:28 +0800 <Astret> @ITStudiosi @PhDiggity @Lizz_S2 @AcademicChatter The scientific method is just as applicable to other fields of study - but we need to be more aware of our assumptions. ‘Science’ has become shorthand for ‘universal replicable laws useful to productivity or efficiency in valuable human endeavours’ - this isn’t the same as truth
1301801507030020101 2020-09-04 16:37:20 +0800 <Astret> @ITStudiosi @PhDiggity @Lizz_S2 @AcademicChatter Your argument here is based on a lack of appreciation of the underlying philosophy of science. Reproducibility is one core way of identifying research outcomes that are reliable and valid. But beyond reliability and validity are other valuable criteria for measuring ‘truth’.
1301795540603150336 2020-09-04 16:13:37 +0800 <Astret> While I find a lot of his material horrifying, @frankieboyle is still a comedian who manages to make me laugh until I cry. I think it’s maybe because he lays bare the horror of everyday political reality.

1301500049617190918 2020-09-03 20:39:27 +0800 <Astret> @JaclynASiegel @AcademicChatter To add, for students the struggle is frequently poor pedagogical scaffolding and support, mis-selling + exploitation via fees,loans &amp; student housing. For staff it’s unsustainable workloads, misaligned reward structures and poor career development pathways/opportunities.
1301499426851221506 2020-09-03 20:36:58 +0800 <Astret> @JaclynASiegel @AcademicChatter This doesn’t require huge thought or research. A simple application of the JDR model highlights all the structural issues facing staff and students alike. Either unsustainable demands need to drop, or resources increase. Likely both!

1301080941591396353 2020-09-02 16:54:04 +0800 <Astret> @helenaliu Also great idea, thanks! I have generally used movie soundtracks but game soundtracks are probably better :)
1300927907917856768 2020-09-02 06:45:57 +0800 <Astret> @helenaliu Your work is fantastic. Writing is tough. In time you might feel it has a better fit in a different outlet or would benefit from a different perspective, but neither decision will change the great progress you have made in getting it so far.
1300865840338919425 2020-09-02 02:39:19 +0800 <Astret> @AcademicChatter The ease of securing funding for any exciting new research plan with no red tape.
1300833984331550720 2020-09-02 00:32:44 +0800 <Astret> @evamarieluter This ‘prince and the pauper’ remake wouldn’t really work because the billionaires wouldn’t have the relevant knowledge to survive, but they would have all their social connections and who could give them access to resources, eg credit.
1300831965982138369 2020-09-02 00:24:43 +0800 <Astret> @meredithfox22 Had a white noise app for the baby for a while - unfortunately it tends to put *me* to sleep! Good idea for a power nap though? 💤
1300808906365698048 2020-09-01 22:53:05 +0800 <Astret> @JonHogg1979 I do like Orbital 😁

1300775754511405058 2020-09-01 20:41:21 +0800 <Astret> I need some lyric-free music recommendations for writing - something to drown out the noisy coworkers (man &amp; dog) at home without inhibiting word production? #AcademicTwitter #Playlist
1300759536882647041 2020-09-01 19:36:55 +0800 <Astret> @__mns_____ @AcademicChatter @PhDVoice To add to other comments, it incorporates a type of micro aggression that prompts the silencing of negative experiences as invalid or untrue, and consequently can lead to bullying or gaslighting.
