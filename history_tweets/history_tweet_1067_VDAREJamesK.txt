1344065387319713795 2020-12-30 07:38:54 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Interesting, but still going to get buried in the "McConnell blocking everything" narrative. This is probably a deliberate poison pill. Only way you could actually go on this is if you up the bidding - $2,500 survival checks, plus Section 230, plus election fraud.
1344000469505613826 2020-12-30 03:20:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Still not seeing the problem here.
1343984239843434497 2020-12-30 02:16:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Not only should America have the uniforms from Starship Troopers, the country should adopt the political model. Reminder that Heinlein was not being ironic and the movie's attempt to be ironic just ended up making it look awesome.
1343978776322039812 2020-12-30 01:54:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Of course, the same applies to POTUS and the so-called GOP "workers' party."

1343936353071935489 2020-12-29 23:06:10 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I like how the mainstream media is now casually admitting that all the "baseless charges" President Trump was making during the campaign were all essentially true.
1343934799879266304 2020-12-29 23:00:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @adamscrabble He was the master of cutting through the nonsense. "England, Your England" is also a powerful article about the possibility of a genuinely leftist patriotism.   He wouldn't last five minutes among the SJWs of today.    https://t.co/k1tKzcZgbg
1343933108207448066 2020-12-29 22:53:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I think George Orwell, who understands Fascism better than people who don't like President Trump's twitter account, had the last say on it.   "As used, the word ‘Fascism’ is almost entirely meaningless."   https://t.co/mgcVEoYaQv

1343679649071693830 2020-12-29 06:06:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> But that's a good argument for $2,000 checks. We want people to pay off debt or spend to stimulate the economy.   Republicans don't even need to talk about the tax cuts considering how much money is being blown overseas in pointless wars and aid programs.
1343641785940275202 2020-12-29 03:35:40 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Polk =most underrated president. One term, accomplished all his goals, practically doubled the size of the country.

1343376085992546304 2020-12-28 09:59:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The vote on $2,000 (assuming it even happens) will be enlightening.
1343369943094591489 2020-12-28 09:35:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Might be best to wait for a bit before a hot take on COVID-19 bill. Lot of details yet to emerge.
1343367240838750208 2020-12-28 09:24:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Lot of wiggle room here, this could mean anything.
1343367019723431938 2020-12-28 09:23:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Ok, so this is what was gained. But what is a "promise" worth? And would this bill be standalone on these two issues in the House as well? Can't imagine Nancy Pelosi allowing a vote on these without sneaking in a few more hundred million for random programs.

I just think a lot of the right has concluded the country is gone, we're being looted, and it's a choice of getting something or nothing. At least with universal entitlements, we get something. Think of it as a tax break.

1341568441615069185 2020-12-23 10:16:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @rappingboomer @realDonaldTrump GOP consultants are good at their job, which is getting money from campaigns. Victory or defeat is irrelevant. In fact, respectable defeat is preferable to controversial victory, because it ensures the next goofball will hire you or you can be a "Republican strategist" on TV.
1341559486079782912 2020-12-23 09:41:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> He's having a hard time tonight.
1341559157971890178 2020-12-23 09:40:02 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Can't wait to hear Twitter socialists lecture us that it's bad Trump wants to give Americans more money, because we need gender studies in Pakistan.
1341557916571197443 2020-12-23 09:35:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It all down to which party (if any) is going to be the economic populist party. Crush the ruling class, represent the people, champion the nation.   @realDonaldTrump just laid down how to do it for the GOP.  If only he had done this since day one. Or even during the campaign.
1341556439945502723 2020-12-23 09:29:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> President @realDonaldTrump message = "This bill is corrupt BS, every American gets a $2,000 survival check" Joe Biden message = "Our darkest days are ahead of us."  Any Twitter anon would have led POTUS to a crushing victory. Only GOP consultants could have screwed this up.
1341552227652153350 2020-12-23 09:12:30 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "President Elect" Biden will be out here soon to mutter something about our vital national interest in funding one horse ponies in Pakistan.
1341547661162409985 2020-12-23 08:54:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> For once, no countersignaling, no quibbling, no nothing. President @realDonaldTrump is absolutely 100 percent right here. $2,000 survival checks for Americans, cut the nonsense, up and down vote.   My only regret is he didn't do this sooner, before the election.
1341547176598487043 2020-12-23 08:52:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @realDonaldTrump Caesar vibes. Yes! This is exactly what @realDonaldTrump needed to do. Thank you @POTUS
1341437813133373443 2020-12-23 01:37:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Demographics change.   In 2000, Fairfax County was 70 percent white.   In 2020, it was 50 percent white.   Also, as anyone who has lived there can testify, a lot of white people in Fairfax aren't FROM there now. Just strivers migrating to Nova for government work or politics.
1341436728847048706 2020-12-23 01:33:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The rationale for WHY he should veto is far more important. I don't want to hear anything about deficits or austerity.   @realDonaldTrump should say I want to give every American $2,000 survival checks and make Congress vote up and down on that. Nothing else.

Set a new orientation- no interventions in Latin America (which drive immigration north), no more Middle East wars, no more provoking Russia.   Instead, we got Pompeo, who's practically Cheney.

1341073781884903425 2020-12-22 01:31:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Trump wanted $2,000. Hawley and Sanders wanted $1,200.   Obviously, McConnell bears a huge amount of blame for this, but the $600 could have been passed months ago and Pelosi stonewalled.
1341073120430579712 2020-12-22 01:28:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> There's no argument you can make against Robert E. Lee that you can't make against George Washington.

1341045780614946816 2020-12-21 23:40:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The greatest tribute one could pay Robert E. Lee is to remove his statue from the swamp on the Potomac. The existence of our current System is the ultimate proof that he was right.
1341043335289593862 2020-12-21 23:30:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> In light of the Robert E. Lee news, I restate that I unironically support renaming Washington D.C. (including the "District of Columbia") because the existing city is of less value than the dead bones of better men.   Just call it Floydtown and be done with it.

1340881353961861127 2020-12-21 12:46:41 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> 1. Border control and deportation of illegals 2. Universal Basic Income for citizens 3. Eliminate affirmative action and racial discrimination in law 4. English is the official language 5. Public option for healthcare 6. No H1-B visas 7. No ME wars.   That's the entire program.

1340823910519099392 2020-12-21 08:58:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @VonLemmings Given that we're spending the same amount of money anyway, I don't think it will impact inflation. It's just a question of who is getting the money.   Could certainly make argument that printing infinity dollars will lead to inflation, but they're doing that anyway.
1340823461879549953 2020-12-21 08:56:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> For all the #crossingtherubicon talk, you'd think somebody would remember the part in Antony's eulogy where Caesar gave the Roman people seventy-five drachmas each. @realDonaldTrump supposedly favored 2K checks at a minimum. Yet once again, here we are.    https://t.co/JayUwGLDWg
1340821470822457345 2020-12-21 08:48:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> No one, Democrat or Republican, is saying "no foreign aid, no dumb wars, no immigration, no work visas, let's give checks to our people to keep them alive until this is over."  Pretty much everyone is on board with the stimulus checks, except the people who can make it happen.
1340820527959695364 2020-12-21 08:44:59 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @BrandenPeterse4 What I do.
1340819629409775618 2020-12-21 08:41:25 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I'd be mad about $600, but I got $1,800 more than the government has ever given me before. The feds want us replaced, spend billions to lecture us on how evil we are, and use tax money to make things worse.   But that's no different than any other year.  So net plus.
1340735666188115972 2020-12-21 03:07:47 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Every political faction unites to make sure Hungary, like almost other European nation, is gutted like a strip mall.

Most Republicans are willing to go to the mat on deeply unpopular economic issues, while refusing to act on issues their base cares about. The goal isn't to win; it's to get the Board of Directors gig later.

1339992857969627138 2020-12-19 01:56:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Fast94stang That is already happening. This is what is happening with all these programs. Must to assume they're going to exclude us somehow anyway so the best bet is to have it set down as a universal entitlement, make it hard for them   If it makes the system untenable, so much the better.
1339987989783572480 2020-12-19 01:36:47 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "White Americans left out of the ethnic spoils system should urge universal programs such as direct stimulus payments and universal basic income (UBI). Given that we are already paying for socialism, we might as well enjoy the benefits." #StimulusChecks    https://t.co/0oz2tdbdFz
1339984186309038080 2020-12-19 01:21:40 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Hawley should just filibuster until he gets a $1,200. Hell if @SenSanders joins him, it might actually have a chance. Austerity is not what the country needs right now.
1339818027370622977 2020-12-18 14:21:24 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Today, power doesn’t come out of the barrel of a gun, but from a platform which can shape the mind. If you control those, elections, laws, and constitutions are practically irrelevant.   https://t.co/0oz2tdbdFz
1339817816178962432 2020-12-18 14:20:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @kangfrenly Oh yes. Christmas was frowned upon in much of New England too for quite a long time.   I celebrate as a reminder of our Odeo-Christian traditions.

1339718992857079810 2020-12-18 07:47:53 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This is what most Americans want. The president goes back to being another celebrity, the country rots, the same people run the show but we can ignore it. Trump, perhaps inadvertently, gave a glimpse behind the curtain, and many Americans sincerely said, "No, I don't want to see"
1339717133572468742 2020-12-18 07:40:30 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Misleading title in this YouTube, but Hitchens was one of the few who defended free speech and also said dissidents deserve extra protection.

1339651579549511686 2020-12-18 03:20:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> We're either a nation in decline (or, really, a nation trapped within a collapsing empire) or a nation that's struggling to be born.   The choice is up to us.

1339649356790722563 2020-12-18 03:11:10 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I don't know what The Patriot Party is or supposed to be. I see no news about it. All I know is that everyone says it is racist.   It's like a quantum theory of politics. Something doesn't actually exist until it is observed and called racist, whereupon it becomes all important.
1339633837119193088 2020-12-18 02:09:30 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> We don't need to "rethink" transportation. We just need cool looking trains that arrive on time and a competent staff. We won't get it.

1339298030542065667 2020-12-17 03:55:08 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> And yet the value of a college education, outside STEM, is practically worthless.   All for paying off student loan debt if it means seizing endowments, ending all federal student loan programs, and putting the colleges themselves on the hook for repayment.
1339240151302680582 2020-12-17 00:05:08 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> However, screaming that police were just randomly killing blacks for no reason, leading to widespread riots and increasing rates (mostly in, not that they care, black communities) is not radicalization. That's journalism.
1339093129731973120 2020-12-16 14:20:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @GlennLittle5 @OcrazioCornPop I think Jefferson was right when he talked about a Natural Aristocracy. Basically, your right to power comes from your record of service.
1339092807399731201 2020-12-16 14:19:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @dpinsen I've never understood how the Cloward-Piven strategy was supposed to help the Left. "First, we get the whole population on welfare, then collapse the financial system because we can't pay for it, and this ends with socialism somehow."
1339089298394640384 2020-12-16 14:05:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Nationalism is a middle-class movement. Strong polities are built on small property holders - those who have a stake in the social order and can't just buy their way out. That means a nationalist elite accountable to the people through service. No Left or Right, but America First
1339088115894513665 2020-12-16 14:01:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> So let's push for universal entitlements. Oh that will crash the system because it depends on whites to be paypigs subsidizing the whole thing? So much the better.   Either that or just say you identify as black/LatinX or whatever stupid category and grift for all its worth. 2/2
1339087732853903362 2020-12-16 13:59:29 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Guys, we already have socialism. We have socialism for every non-white group. We have socialism for the rich. We have massive foreign aid for Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. The only group that doesn't get anything from its government are the white workers. 1/2
1339084337724203010 2020-12-16 13:45:59 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It's truly amazing how the murder rate has skyrocketed in major cities around America - you know, in "the community" we hear so much about - and journos are running around looking for Facebook groups to complain about.   Joke country and AJAB.

1338718835273293825 2020-12-15 13:33:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @CrassusT Bad care is certainly preferable to no care. Most of the time anyway.

1338561109587079171 2020-12-15 03:06:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Most contemporary journalism consists of neurotics demanding Visa and other companies deplatform political opponents. Journos exist to protect power. They always have. AJAB.   Suddenly, when it comes to porn, they become free speech absolutists. Revealing.
1338559894434291713 2020-12-15 03:02:02 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The corporate "master" keeping Tucker Carlson afloat is Mr. Pillow. The rest are boycotting him, despite the ratings.   All the major corporations from Amazon on down are backing Black Lives Matter.
1338559393047195649 2020-12-15 03:00:03 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Oh, so that's how it works now.
1338558938816651268 2020-12-15 02:58:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> In a real country of course, universal health care would be a good idea. But you'd have to couple it with massive R&amp;D for cures, efforts to ensure physical fitness, bans on all the subsidized garbage food, immigration moratorium... none of that will happen.
1338558422162288643 2020-12-15 02:56:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> We'll eventually get Medicare for All and it will be terrible, like public education. The point of American life is to loudly defend equality so you can be permitted to make money. Then you use that money to buy your way out of as many American institutions as possible.
1338556999181676544 2020-12-15 02:50:32 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Burn someone's American flag, it's destruction of property and probably won't even be prosecuted. If you desecrate an icon of the Official Cult, the state won't tolerate your blasphemy.  Incidentally, murder rate in DC highest since '08, but "the community" doesn't care.
1338305546663899136 2020-12-14 10:11:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @nytmike @DavidWaldstein The Cleveland Caucasians. On behalf of whites, I assure you we won't be offended.

That sends American soldiers to die for foreign interests? That discriminates against the European-American majority?  What is there to betray?
1338192799590719488 2020-12-14 02:43:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Again, long term I think it has to be this way. System forcing us to do the nation building projects we would have had to do anyway.
1338192456303702017 2020-12-14 02:41:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Yeah, and we should conquer the whole thing. Pursue greatness, not equality.  https://t.co/fcgDPA3oQD

1337664894473211904 2020-12-12 15:45:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @SenSasse Every American who cares about the rule of law knows it doesn't exist because there are 20 million plus illegal immigrants in the country. "The rule of law" is a fraud, justice is arbitrary, and you're a glorified corporate lobbyist. The Regime has zero legitimacy.

1337548361793216512 2020-12-12 08:02:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Supreme Court is giving Republicans a good education. Judges and justices are politicians. I don't care about their "dogma" or values or whatever theory they have. Will they vote the way we want? That's it.
1337547641085898756 2020-12-12 07:59:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If President Trump was the nationalist authoritarian that his critics imagine, he wouldn't be here. He would have broken Big Tech, not given them tax cuts. But it's good that this shows GOP voters that "our system" is the same as China's except ours promotes worse values.
1337541540223311873 2020-12-12 07:35:28 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Well, that was fun.   Remember to hold your nose and vote R for the judges guys!

1335773564708990980 2020-12-07 10:30:09 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> At least Boxing Day is in second.   Kwanzaa is beating out Hanukah. I expect the intersectional pokemon points will be adjusted over the next few days to more accurately reflect the post-Western world's caste system.
1335755297659432960 2020-12-07 09:17:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @pacificbells Oh, good, you're right. Back in the real world. Sorry, I left these Nightmare Vision goggles on too long.
1335754853738536961 2020-12-07 09:15:48 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Camelback71 And even this "multi-ethnic working class party" can't bring itself to vote against Big Tech and cheap labor. Wall Street backed Democrats in both '16 and '20! This whole situation is surreal beyond belief.
1335754033546604546 2020-12-07 09:12:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> And even "true conservative" types know this - the appeals for "party loyalty" only go one way. GOP demanded the Buchanan Brigades stand down in 1992 and 1996. They did and supported George H.W. Bush. What was achieved?
1335753329884999681 2020-12-07 09:09:45 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If you support any of the following -  1. Forcing GOP to choose pro-worker position or extinction. 2. Creating third party bc GOP will never change. 3.  Discredit existing system in general.   I don't see what the point is of counter-signaling pro-Trump demonstrators now.
1335752456714776578 2020-12-07 09:06:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PhilippusArabus @realDonaldTrump Right, he didn't follow up. But neither did anyone else. This includes the so-called "populists" in the Democrats like Elizabeth Warren, who voted for the Big Tech H1-B giveaway just like everyone else.
1335752184579977217 2020-12-07 09:05:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> And for that reason, I don't see what the downside is in demanding GOP support @realDonaldTrump at all costs. Sure, POTUS failed in many ways. But GOP and "true conservatives" are worse, and if you want to change/replace them, this is the way to do it. 3/2
1335751817586741256 2020-12-07 09:03:45 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> But this idea that GOP will somehow take the right lesson if he goes is absurd. They'll conclude they just need to do more amnesty, more opportunity zones, more tax cuts for oligarchs. If you want to radically change/replace GOP, makes more sense to me to fight for Trump now. 2/2
1335751381479731205 2020-12-07 09:02:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Big reason @realDonaldTrump beat both parties was that he was an economic moderate. Need more economic aid to workers, support for infrastructure, high wages via immigration control, etc. His biggest mistake aside from personnel was going along with Paul Ryan economic agenda 1/2

1334701791624179712 2020-12-04 11:31:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @JulesAdams1776 That's an essay in itself. But universal minimum standard for everyone, a grant (similar to UBI) that can be used/saved for health care, emphasis on preventative causes (diet, exercise, what foods we subsidize), massive investment in R&amp;D, and nothing for non-citizens.
1334697991828107264 2020-12-04 11:16:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @RWHockeyJohn Well, he's apparently making political donations in 2030
1334693107712094208 2020-12-04 10:56:48 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> We have the worst case scenario. You don't have universal care but you somehow still have the massive government intervention, price-fixing, and inefficiency of bureaucracy. So you just fight insurance companies all day. My solution for health care is like UBI - cut a check. 2/2
1334692682799702016 2020-12-04 10:55:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Health care is the issue that is hurting GOP more than any other. But still... have to point out that the Left's big cause is radically changing the health care system, because it became so much worse after their last president radically changed the health care system. 1/2
1334667476748136461 2020-12-04 09:14:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @DKaiserjager already over. GOP never wanted it.
1334656575882080261 2020-12-04 08:31:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Affirmative action would have been abolished 25 years ago but Newt Gingrich thought the GOP could win the black vote.

1334635550918193154 2020-12-04 07:08:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Again, the Republican Party loves identity politics. There's gibs for everyone except the people who vote for them.

If you're five percent black, you get fifteen percent off at Walmart, unless you voted Trump. Then you have to pay more because you internalized racism.

1334613841418858498 2020-12-04 05:41:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> For Republicans, staying in office is not the goal. The goal is the gig in the private sector after you use your term giving Jeff Bezos a tax cut.   Democracy's only value is as a transactional system. We either get gibs, same as any other group, or we don't vote. Simple as.
1334612977211858950 2020-12-04 05:38:24 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @realDailyWire Ronald Reagan will be remembered as the man who gave away California, and ultimately the country, with the 1986 amnesty.   That's his only significance for today. He should remind us that conservatives are fools who can't think beyond the GDP figures for the next quarter.
1334609829680254976 2020-12-04 05:25:53 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> What happens when you do provide a quality education... and you still get racial disparities in test results, school discipline, and graduation rates?

James Burnham (you know him, he was an NR Editor and you stole his title "Suicide of the West" for your own inferior work) understood this. Politics is about power. Ideology is the mask power wears.   We want power and we intend to use it.  https://t.co/khrcydG3Eq
1334348098903093249 2020-12-03 12:05:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Just remembered @vdare Castle is in Fallout 76.  https://t.co/jguX3lZl1L
1334329728531116034 2020-12-03 10:52:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @vincevega68 I might actually have to make this.
1334329671366881282 2020-12-03 10:52:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @vincevega68 Coming soon, the "Republican Tarot Deck"  Every single card prophesizes betrayal.

1334280385115656192 2020-12-03 07:36:48 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> More cheap labor handouts to corporate America. This must be that "multiracial workers party" @marcorubio is telling us about.

1333856025787719686 2020-12-02 03:30:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Solution - more H1-B visas.
1333853930636390401 2020-12-02 03:22:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Just print the checks.

1329814562376396828 2020-11-20 23:51:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Journos are culpable for the disproportionate violence against whites in this country.   AJAB
1329814027028074496 2020-11-20 23:49:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I love the switch from "America was built by slaveholders and white supremacism and it permeates all our institutions" to "we have scared institutions and founding principles"
1329479258494947329 2020-11-20 01:38:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Foxyfloof I agree with you there 100%.
1329478565251964930 2020-11-20 01:36:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Foxyfloof See, and that's how I know you're not serious and nothing will change. "We imported the Third World, why can't we have a functional middle class society?"   If you want the strong American middle class that existed mid-century, you also need the moratorium.

1329478044445253634 2020-11-20 01:34:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @thrashtom @Rural_Respecter Then read the evidence on the subject and come to your own conclusions. You can believe whatever you want. But reality has a racist bias.
1329477793214816258 2020-11-20 01:33:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Foxyfloof I think we are in agreement that the oligarchs should be taxed into the ground. I also favor nationalizing certain industries. However, I also think you simply cannot have a strong middle class without an immigration moratorium. We want labor expensive.
1329477562976886784 2020-11-20 01:32:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @thrashtom @Rural_Respecter Oh, I see you are another one of those liberal creationists. Well, you are entitled to your faith-based beliefs, but we don't have to accept such claims.
1329476862410682373 2020-11-20 01:29:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> So not a majority. Interesting frame.
1329476602099535875 2020-11-20 01:28:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @thrashtom @Rural_Respecter I too believe in intelligence. It's especially interesting how it varies across different population groups.   You might be especially interested about the average intelligence of your voting base. Have fun with those guys.
1329476163236995076 2020-11-20 01:26:32 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Foxyfloof Agreed! And what were the demographics like back then? Incidentally, how was a huge pool of cheap labor (what Marx called the reserve army of capital) created?  Answer: mass immigration, a hugely regressive policy.
1329473612928208903 2020-11-20 01:16:24 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> same
1329473524776513542 2020-11-20 01:16:03 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Foxyfloof Fine. Go do that. See how it goes. We don't care.   But given the state of California, a blue state with Third World levels of income inequality, I think you'll have a harder time than we will.
1329473152561385475 2020-11-20 01:14:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> lol journos are going to accuse him of body shaming
1329472609898156032 2020-11-20 01:12:25 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @thrashtom @VolsHD @Jballard11Josh Cool, fine, whatever, we'll starve or make our own stuff. Why do you think so many of us are growing our own food now, hunting, etc.   You go nuts accusing each other of privilege in your cities. We don't care. We just want to be free of you.
1329471149252759555 2020-11-20 01:06:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @thrashtom @VolsHD @Jballard11Josh Cool, we'll take our chances.
1329469450303762436 2020-11-20 00:59:51 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PDXallonee @u_do_u_girl No, we fully understand that. But who within those red states gets the welfare. Which cities, which populations.   But it's not even an economic question fundamentally. That's the whole point - we are more than consumers. Bugmen aren't. Let's just separate and be done with it.
1329468975999291394 2020-11-20 00:57:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @u_do_u_girl @PDXallonee Yes. Incidentally, you might want to take a look at who receives welfare within those red states.
1329468825511862275 2020-11-20 00:57:22 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @eronian wtf i love vaccine mandates now
1329468752950386690 2020-11-20 00:57:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PDXallonee Homeschooled. Want them to be able to do math and read the Western Canon, not critical race theory. Heck, Baltimore's schools are churning out high schoolers that don't have a single student proficient in math.    https://t.co/CjxMFudhgc  They should be your problem, not ours.
1329467173081919489 2020-11-20 00:50:49 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PDXallonee No. Have your cities and your economy. I'd rather be poor and not have to deal with progressives lecturing us and importing their pets to destroy everything.   Call us hicks, we don't care. We want to be free of you.
1329464650891718661 2020-11-20 00:40:47 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @20_mockingbird @DancingApus Probably would turn into a shooting war between Indian and Chinese expatriates anyway. Childless white libs would be inside making unboxing videos for YouTube.
1329464156890796033 2020-11-20 00:38:49 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @demon_helpful I would definitely take that.
1329464039324389386 2020-11-20 00:38:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @DancingApus Not to mention the purity spirals as they accuse each other of racism while the power grid fails.
1329463200451076098 2020-11-20 00:35:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @CharlesMartel79 A lot of the divisions are within states. We redraw the boundaries and call it a day. If the Czech Republic and Slovakia can do it, no reason we can't.
1329462575126491136 2020-11-20 00:32:32 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Somewhere from Chronicles way back when.
1329462490091167752 2020-11-20 00:32:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Why should we share a country with these people? Just break it up. You entertain your pets in your urban hellholes and we'll go do our thing. Call us hicks, racists, nazis, whatever, we don't care.   National divorce now.
1329457593761345537 2020-11-20 00:12:45 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Reach Out To Trump Supporters   *Leftists immediately start screaming for retribution instead*  Cool, national divorce. Why must we live with people who hate us? We'll have a country and you guys can have whatever urban hellscapes you want.
1329456582078423040 2020-11-20 00:08:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @WajahatAli @nytimes Cool, let's have a national divorce. Then you won't have to deal with us horrible people ever again.  Why are you even here anyway?
1329326220803268608 2020-11-19 15:30:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Cheap labor kills nations.   Not just metaphorically.

1329168573479194624 2020-11-19 05:04:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @washingtonpost No, and neither did the Founders.   Enough with this corrupt system.

1328924180943949828 2020-11-18 12:53:09 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @JackPosobiec Republicans surrendering and leftists getting what they want.
1328888042229288960 2020-11-18 10:29:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> When you're some local bureaucrat and you find out every NGO and journo nationwide is bearing down on your location, you're going to bend the knee.   A tweet from @realDonaldTrump might make you feel good, but he's got nothing material to offer and lacks the will to use power.
1328884839601348615 2020-11-18 10:16:49 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Once a mistake, twice a coincidence, three times...
1328826758204952578 2020-11-18 06:26:02 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Sorry, "American" cities.
1328826558757400577 2020-11-18 06:25:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Actually, maybe she's right. Considering the state of American cities, you're probably better off patrolling some mountains along the border of Pakistan than making a wrong turn in Chicago.
1328825805993021440 2020-11-18 06:22:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Willing to bet that the United States of America will have literally fragmented and broken apart before the government withdraws troops from Afghanistan. We have a foreign policy that's utterly nihilistic; completely disconnected from what's left of this country.
1328824842074939394 2020-11-18 06:18:25 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Camelback71 Some people think the Constitution failed after 1865. I think it's essentially been a dead letter since Marbury. Framers totally failed to imagine that (with exception of Jackson) politicians would be happy to have random judges make all the important decisions.
1328823057721462784 2020-11-18 06:11:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> GOP needs to step over this idea that courts are anything other than small legislatures.   Tell me how they will vote, come up with window dressing later. No one believes it anyway. Even Jefferson said "well, this is unconstitutional but whatever" when it came to the LA purchase.
1328822475103346695 2020-11-18 06:09:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> whoops! happened again, lol
1328822201156595714 2020-11-18 06:07:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "If you bring home the troops from a failed 20 year war, that kills them."
1328774903118635010 2020-11-18 02:59:59 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @CharlesMartel79 Either the Constitution is working as intended, in which case it isn't much good, or it failed to restrain government power, in which case it isn't much good except as a totem.   Only power can check power, no matter how many flags or constitutions you wave.
1328773199157456896 2020-11-18 02:53:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The root cause of racial inequality is racial inequality.   You can send me my check @JoeBiden.
1328764932402376711 2020-11-18 02:20:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Cruz: "Anyway, thank you for coming, I'll get some cool writeups on conservative blogs, and you can expect your next tax cut early in January."

1328756277418274817 2020-11-18 01:45:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This is a transparent lie, but he knows GOP won't do anything. Again, why WOULDN'T you censor Republicans?   What are they going to do, whine on the platforms you control? Give you more tax cuts? Say that a corporate oligarch is actually a socialist who opposes the "free market?"
1328755796457508864 2020-11-18 01:44:03 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @scrowder @tedcruz Yeah he's coming to show off for the cameras and then give them more tax cuts.   Break them up, nationalize them, or stop wasting our time. Enough talk.
1328755369758388231 2020-11-18 01:42:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I'm not interested in hearing nonsense about "limited government" or "stop socialism!" We have one of the most invasive governments possible and we already have massive wealth transfers to privileged groups (who claim they are "oppressed.")  The Next Right must be statist.
1328754983475482625 2020-11-18 01:40:49 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Maybe. Don't underestimate the way all those who moved to the "New South" hate the real South. Sherman's March was far less devastating than Yankees moving to the South for "good schools and low taxes" and turning it into just another 3rd world wasteland.
1328754637839675394 2020-11-18 01:39:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @eronian True. "Put us in office so we can refuse to do anything."
1328754437188358145 2020-11-18 01:38:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @pimpisyou A lot depended on where you lived. As you say, for many, the tax cut was a huge tax increase.
1328753788786761731 2020-11-18 01:36:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> There is no political downside to opposing corporate America. Fortune 500 funds BLM, Democrats, and critical race theory. They hate Trump and love Biden/Harris. How long can GOP continue with a message of "vote for us so we can support your enemies?"
1328753281846403077 2020-11-18 01:34:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> GOP Solution: Tax cuts and more subsidies.
1328753128741724160 2020-11-18 01:33:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Don't worry, @MittRomney et al will continue to preach unilateral surrender so the GOP base suffers.   What does he care? Mr. Bain Capital got his. What's America other than a marketplace?  Say what you will about the tenets of anarcho-communism dude, at least it's an ethos.
1328752218208657409 2020-11-18 01:29:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Imagine thinking Los Angeles is anything other than a cautionary example to the world.
1328736331179188224 2020-11-18 00:26:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Camelback71 That's not true, he'll give them more money.
1328729427098955779 2020-11-17 23:59:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "Our Democracy" is one of those terms like "People's Republic." It's just an admission that the speaker wants censorship and repression.
1328729037880094720 2020-11-17 23:57:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Actual good news.
1328724512280629248 2020-11-17 23:39:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @voxdotcom Maybe "Our Democracy" is a fraud then. Let's scrap that instead of free speech.
1328723697352454144 2020-11-17 23:36:30 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "Our democracy" is just a lump of random people reacting to whatever nonsense sloganeering is vomited out by journos and entertainers.   Time for something better.
1328717943832784896 2020-11-17 23:13:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Interesting data .   One reason I was bearish on Trump winning was that he caught the Left sleeping in 16. Media treated him as a sideshow, lefties thought it was in the bag and could vote Green Party, etc.   This year, Left did a full scale Popular Front to stop Trump.
1328705170629332999 2020-11-17 22:22:53 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @HielandWaylon Gonna have to do it again.
1328560400103837699 2020-11-17 12:47:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The United States of America should make a formal apology to @BelarusMFA for calling into question the results of that nation's recent elections.   We have no standing to lecture others about what counts as "free and fair" elections.
1328559236272574464 2020-11-17 12:43:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @bethanyshondark @TomCrowe Claiming you are the "chosen people" is supremacist.
1328559132291567616 2020-11-17 12:42:35 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @thedailybeast ... so he's a Christian. That's the takeaway here?
1328541897422495744 2020-11-17 11:34:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Build your own country really is the logical conclusion of all this.   Ok then.
1328508880654131201 2020-11-17 09:22:54 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Listening to the "bad guy music" from Far Cry V again. One of those nights.

1328498620929347586 2020-11-17 08:42:08 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> So basically all the stuff the journos were telling us was completely impossible actually happened.   No one can be surprised by this. AJAB.

1328480008139051010 2020-11-17 07:28:10 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @echo_chamberz No, it will be much worse.
1328475458237771776 2020-11-17 07:10:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @HawleyMO @Facebook @Google @Twitter @jack No more hearings, either do something or quit and go be a lobbyist somewhere.
1328469271366791169 2020-11-17 06:45:30 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @DanRather I mean, you're right in the sense that the Proud Boys aren't Nazis and it was an actual Nazi who put a person on the moon.   But you're a journo so you've never read anything in your life except a script.  https://t.co/fThivfdckI
1328468808420519937 2020-11-17 06:43:40 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Whoops!  This fetish about congratulating people for voting is especially foolish considering that 1.) Your vote is undone by any random person voting the pro-Media ticket and 2.) Depending where you live, the DMV tier election office will probably just lose your vote anyway.
1328432702622732289 2020-11-17 04:20:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @GlennLittle5 No. The last GOP Congressman somewhere in Middle America in 2050 will be babbling about the deficit and why a mandatory gulag system is a good thing but, gosh darn it, we just can't afford it.
1328430981351694337 2020-11-17 04:13:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Not if you connect the dots between economic and identity concerns. What's fading is empty culture war rhetoric. What's needed is a movement that challenges Woke Capital and moves beyond think tank babble about the glories of free markets.
1328180910819315713 2020-11-16 11:39:40 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @recycledc0nsent Couple the policy by seizing the endowments and ending all federal loan programs. Call it a one time amnesty.
1328180718401433600 2020-11-16 11:38:54 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If there is a third force/nationalist party that emerges, it must be not just economically populist, but redistributionist. GOP will be babbling about tax cuts, even as oligarchs openly denounce them and debt skyrockets.   UBI, nationalize Big Tech, seize university endowments.
1328119819699429378 2020-11-16 07:36:54 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Yes, support Assad.

1327686231015256064 2020-11-15 02:53:59 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Can't get over how important this essay is.  "White working-class Americans continue to constitute the largest component of America’s broad mass who do the work, hold the country together, and sustain the ruling class that despises them."   https://t.co/O3iQ9VFaMK
1327683518445613056 2020-11-15 02:43:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @GlennLittle5 I don't think it was just that. Think there was a bit more going on.
1327666187162038274 2020-11-15 01:34:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> President Trump didn't govern much differently from a typical Republican, yet every mainstream institution including the press, the federal bureaucracy, the "intelligence community," the FBI, etc, shredded their credibility to stop him.
1327658302596059145 2020-11-15 01:03:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Only one man has the answer -  https://t.co/19b1jluQNv  "Early and often"
1327456871784067072 2020-11-14 11:42:35 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @eronian I think the American military has the best elite forces in the world. Still the strongest military. But no bench if it hits the fan.   This country couldn't handle a Vietnam now, let alone a "carrier goes down with all hands" type conflict like WW2.

1327443464208920576 2020-11-14 10:49:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> America isn't a nation or even an idea, it's a big mall in a declining neighborhood.    Proceed accordingly.
1327305320469852160 2020-11-14 01:40:23 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Can a large shopping mall have "well-being"?

1326993925731721219 2020-11-13 05:03:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Cool, we don't need to talk about it anymore.
1326965606105624584 2020-11-13 03:10:28 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @JoeNBC More proof we should skip elections and just have a census. More honest, less time-consuming.  https://t.co/VTrHMKG5rd
1326963533725184001 2020-11-13 03:02:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Solution: more symposiums on the free market.
1326963222818271245 2020-11-13 03:01:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Thank you @JoeNBC for agreeing with all of us at @vdare , very cool.
1326956836319268868 2020-11-13 02:35:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> BETTER NOT DO IT AGAIN! MONITORING TO LEVEL 11!
1326940062072918016 2020-11-13 01:28:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> There's no nation. Tens of millions of foreigners occupy our soil, our government is basically controlled by those who put foreign countries over our own.   What's to "secure?"
1326939124423602178 2020-11-13 01:25:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Indian_Bronson IF
1326937880296615942 2020-11-13 01:20:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Whatever happens with POTUS, there has to be a third force, and that starts with economic populism. Not being "even more principled conservatives" with vague references to workers.  Redistribution of income from oligarchs to workers, immigration moratorium, end affirmative action
1326929789719031809 2020-11-13 00:48:09 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> My argument is not that America already has a Social Credit System like China's.   My argument is that China's is morally superior.
1326929621460377600 2020-11-13 00:47:29 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It'll be financially deplatformed and banned from social media.   This could have been prevented with state power. If only there was someone in control of a branch of the government to do something about it.   Oh well, too late now. Better give Soros another tax cut. Freedom!
1326927637206478849 2020-11-13 00:39:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> And today, the UK is arguably the most subjugated, enslaved, and degraded country in all Europe, if not the world. "England" won't even exist as a meaningful concept within the century.   So basically these guys were right.
1326920872385519622 2020-11-13 00:12:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> oh
1326920600904929282 2020-11-13 00:11:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @HapppyWarrior @esaagar @TuckerCarlson I think he did but want better data than CNN exit polls. However, it's clear he didn't do as well in mostly white states in New England as he did in 2016, especially Maine.
1326918769000767488 2020-11-13 00:04:22 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @WolfLarson10 That's where the lockdowns come in and they tell you you aren't allowed to go to small locally owned businesses. Sorry, have to use Amazon. Oh, you started a website? Nope, financially deplatformed.
1326918569293205505 2020-11-13 00:03:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @surfsk8swing Urbanites should not be allowed to vote. Only property owners.
1326918404708704258 2020-11-13 00:02:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @andrewsiff Yes. Which is why I do not regret my 2016 vote and want him to pull this off somehow. The System is beyond saving, but if he can keep delegitimizing it, so much the better.
1326916214682251264 2020-11-12 23:54:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @esaagar @TuckerCarlson And he lost support among white working class voters. Brilliant strategy.
1326914754955386882 2020-11-12 23:48:25 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @JeffreyGoldberg @BarackObama The ideals are stupid. Time for something better.
1326913616457715712 2020-11-12 23:43:53 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Trump is more valuable as a symbol than as reality.He governed mostly as a conventional Republican, but because he simply *said* things you shouldn't, the System burned through its credibility to take him out.   And, in fairness, he did accomplish some good stuff on immigration.
1326913140433571840 2020-11-12 23:42:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Why is this even controversial? If the police can't (or won't) enforce the law, and you can't protect your own property from being looted, then how is this government legitimate in any way? Why does it even exist?
1326912370011238401 2020-11-12 23:38:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Whose "ideals?" They certainly aren't the ones understood by the Founders. If it's "equality before the law," scrap affirmative action. If it's some egalitarian ideal and we have to butcher "the reality of America" to fit it, it's a stupid ideal. Scrap the ideal and keep America.
1326911793864773633 2020-11-12 23:36:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> According to Marxists, business props up "nationalism" and "racism" to divide the working class. But we can actually see Big Tech and Fortune 500 companies demanding more immigration and more BLM policies. Nationalists should stop defending these groups. Punish them.
1326906207794323458 2020-11-12 23:14:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If you don't want to do these things, fine, but then don't talk about being a "workers party" when your policies are waving the flag of a government that hates you and vaguely muttering about Jesus.
1326905931855228932 2020-11-12 23:13:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Remember when President Trump was bragging about the stock prices of Microsoft, Amazon, and Google?  Fraud occurred, but it wouldn't have mattered if he had delivered for white working class. Big Tech should be regulated, Amazon outright nationalized, UBI implanted for workers.
1326905473115836421 2020-11-12 23:11:32 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Instead of one billion Americans, we should actively discourage urbanization and reduce our population to 100 million Americans. As Jefferson said, cities are as to the health of the polity as sores are to that of the body.
1326904838572138502 2020-11-12 23:09:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @AICFound @Pontifex The pretense that we still have a stake in the political order.
1326901604168200198 2020-11-12 22:56:09 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> You get nothing for supporting big business politically. You don't even get donations. They give to the left.   Tax them, nationalize them, break them utterly. The State, the political expression of the Nation, must rule. Liberalism, classical or otherwise, is a disease.
1326896242664857600 2020-11-12 22:34:51 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Unlimited immigration, anti-racist signaling and vague Catholic religiosity which will be condemned by journalists and the @Pontifex anyway.
1326893440001601539 2020-11-12 22:23:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> oh

1326774526257082369 2020-11-12 14:31:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @On_God_ I doubt it, especially with GOP governor.
1326736849528889345 2020-11-12 12:01:29 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> As goes California, as goes New Mexico, so goes Arizona.   If only someone had warned what decades of uncontrolled immigration could lead to!
1326708533547720704 2020-11-12 10:08:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Journos really, really want Americans to stay in Afghanistan for some reason.
1326702975243448325 2020-11-12 09:46:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @CouchDogWolfie Let the Empire rise.
1326702689984651265 2020-11-12 09:45:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> 1. President Trump offered something specific to everyone except white working class voters. Not surprisingly, they didn't turn out in the numbers he required for a crushing victory. Economic populism is needed.  2. I still think he won if there was no fraud.   Both can be true.
1326702190501703681 2020-11-12 09:43:45 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> What's shocking is that 27 percent believe we will.
1326698309470351365 2020-11-12 09:28:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @quantuspolling I'll go down with the ship here but will get my account set up there too.

1326694690654216192 2020-11-12 09:13:57 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> And conservatism has no answers other than "give them tax breaks" or "just start your own Internet."  Nationalize.
1326694418171170816 2020-11-12 09:12:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Well, then a simple investigation should prove him wrong.

1326615374712991745 2020-11-12 03:58:47 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The problem is not that the United States might intervene in Syria.   The problem is that American troops would be fighting for the wrong side.
1326613070320439297 2020-11-12 03:49:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> None of this should even be controversial in a real country.

1326357934184550400 2020-11-11 10:55:48 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @quantuspolling It's not horrible as far as history goes, it's just "the anarchists were noble angels and this is why everyone else sucked." "The Last Crusade" is probably best Francoist history, and of course, @MysteryGrove's edition of "Mine Were of Trouble" for a firsthand account.

1326315604974907398 2020-11-11 08:07:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "The West," if we can even speak of such a thing, has a heavy moral burden for its betrayal of Armenia, the first Christian nation in the world. Absolutely shameful.   Turkey needs to be out of NATO.

It's all speculation.   Just find out what information you can, go through the data looking for actual proof of fraud, or just kick back and enjoy the ride. Gonna be lit no matter what.

1326002961739288576 2020-11-10 11:25:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Yeah, imagine what people would feel like after being told for 4 years that Russia stole the election and is our hated enemy for some reason. Can't imagine any bad social consequences.
1326002382753427456 2020-11-10 11:22:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The British wrote Yankee Doodle to mock the colonials. Then it became a battle song for the Continental Army. If all hell breaks loose, you'll have Zoomers singing the "bad guys" songs from Far Cry V around the campfires.

1324811165613101056 2020-11-07 04:29:30 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> We shouldn't have media outlets "calling" states.   You count the votes, you publish the results when everything is complete.

1324792525727637509 2020-11-07 03:15:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> 1. There was fraud. It cost Trump the election. He should never concede.  2. It wouldn't have been close enough for fraud to work if Trump had focused on white working class in Midwest.  3. We need a third force, but that means actual political organization, not hot takes.

Nor am I arguing that he ran a great campaign. He didn't focus on white working class in Midwest.   But it doesn't follow that there was no fraud in Philly or other cities. We've known about this for decades.

Whatever the complaints about him (and I have many, mostly about him being TOO much of a "classical liberal") he needs to fight to the end.   Even Gore fought till December.

1324592722292969473 2020-11-06 14:01:29 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Does anyone seriously believe North Carolina is in doubt though? Not asking rhetorically, from everything I've seen, Trump has won it, which makes this pretty misleading.
1324591893892706305 2020-11-06 13:58:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I don't doubt that there was massive fraud.   But maybe if you are going to be the "Working Class Party," Republicans should offer workers material benefits. And since they're already giving race-specific benefits to blacks and Hispanics, maybe whites should get something too.

When they're just replacing the population anyway and you have no control over how you are governed, I'd rather just have a sovereign with actual power. More accountable.

None of this ridiculous chaos and ballots magically appearing at 4AM so they can make up whatever numbers they need.

Yes, if you had someone with the will to use state power to confront Big Tech and rally the masses. But POTUS gave his enemies tax cuts instead.

1324124468067840001 2020-11-05 07:00:48 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @GlennLittle5 @realDonaldTrump yes it failed
1324123082005663744 2020-11-05 06:55:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Of course, something could have been done about this instead of giving Silicon Valley tax cuts.   You can support the nation or you can support GDP. Pick one.
1324121814235308033 2020-11-05 06:50:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @monke_kang @realDonaldTrump No, it always does that now.
1324121681393340416 2020-11-05 06:49:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Bearcingetorix Trump should not concede no matter what.
1324120546053935106 2020-11-05 06:45:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The system is being utterly discredited. That in itself is a major victory. Can't just keep losing in slow motion. No way out but through.
1324117282537279488 2020-11-05 06:32:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> One good thing about POTUS is that even though he's mostly complained instead of exercising state power when he had the chance, he's not just rolling over for this. Any other Republican would be.   I'm sure Sasse, Romney, etc will be urging surrender soon.
1324116901677641729 2020-11-05 06:30:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Election results in Belarus are far more legitimate than those here.
1324116726687125510 2020-11-05 06:30:03 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> You would think that this would finally get it through the skulls of the GOP that you can't be a nationalist party and a pro-corporate party. You can't just keep offering tax cuts to managerial elites who hate your voters.  But the GOP hates its own voters too, so nothing learned
1324114657511198721 2020-11-05 06:21:49 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Amazing that Trump is still just kicking back, letting Twitter his accounts.   All they had to do was reign in Big Tech and throw a bone to the working class in the Midwest   Nope! Platinum plan.   There's no point in trying to win votes in Philly, Detroit, etc. It's all made up.
1324092583870681088 2020-11-05 04:54:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @MarkSleboda1 Speaking for the 'Murkians, all those campaigns were bad and were opposed by actual conservatives like Pat Buchanan.   I support reparations... for Serbia.
1323899337227800577 2020-11-04 16:06:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Fairly good night for GOP in the House.
1323897950607675392 2020-11-04 16:00:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @SelimSeesYou @NapoleonAnon Is Trump getting ME-2?
1323897808500461568 2020-11-04 16:00:09 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Current mood  https://t.co/GAHTecjmdD
1323894354046558208 2020-11-04 15:46:25 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Yes, but not for the reasons you think.
1323893463935447044 2020-11-04 15:42:53 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Count the votes. That's all people want. But you can't just invent new ones until you get the desired result.   Total nonsense.
1323892864250773507 2020-11-04 15:40:30 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I've pulled all nighters to write a 50 page thesis in two days, but they can't count some ballots? Give me a break.
1323891641111977987 2020-11-04 15:35:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @DanielleSavoy Defund PBS
1323889823959207936 2020-11-04 15:28:25 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Trump isn't making some crazed call to battle. He's calmly laying out the case for why he's winning and asking why it's somehow impossible to finish this up. Don't see why this is a problem.
1323889131425042433 2020-11-04 15:25:40 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This what I mean. President Trump says a Biden victory in Arizona is "possible" but you just have outlets declaring victory. Really don't see how this is some norm-breaking speech.
1323888281143136258 2020-11-04 15:22:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It begins.
1323887704199876610 2020-11-04 15:19:59 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Nationalize the stations.
1323886800616771585 2020-11-04 15:16:24 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I just don't understand how it somehow impossible to collect and compile the votes by Election Day and then release the results. Not "whoops, suddenly this takes weeks."  It's wildly irresponsible.
1323886083344605185 2020-11-04 15:13:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If they just counted the votes now and said, "Yes, here is the total, Biden won," we'd grumble and say, ah well, Trump lost, what's next?  But this "hang on, we have to see how many votes come in after Election Day so we can invent a new total" is just transparent fraud.
1323885362855481344 2020-11-04 15:10:41 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> What are we waiting on in Georgia? 0.6 percent left to report, POTUS up by about 110,000.
1323883593291206660 2020-11-04 15:03:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @roytapel For me it's about what POTUS represents right now, tonight. Not even yesterday.   This just a blatant flex by Big Tech and the NGOs against the voters.
1323883287937490945 2020-11-04 15:02:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @eronian I mean, it was perceived to be this cycle. It wasn't like the Democrats didn't campaign hard there.
1323882747841175553 2020-11-04 15:00:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I wasn't heavily invested in Trump winning. I expected he would lose. I could even see long-term advantages if he lost (though that might be a cope). I'd get annoyed at liberals for a day and then forget it.  But this is blatant fraud. It's outrageous. All in for POTUS.
1323878669056679936 2020-11-04 14:44:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Might be waiting on some more results.
1323878486386397189 2020-11-04 14:43:22 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @MisterBlackPill Yes. And yes you are right he has no one else to blame for not cracking down on Big Tech.   But this is nonsense.
1323878307243429888 2020-11-04 14:42:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @joshdcaplan BS
1323877918326640641 2020-11-04 14:41:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Texas and Florida are huge, diverse, competitive states with cities of global importance. (They also occasionally get hit by hurricanes.)   Yet somehow, they can pull off an election no problem. Magically, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin just can't. Counting is too hard.
1323875508954816512 2020-11-04 14:31:32 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> No contrarianism, no clever takes, none of that. Yes I know POTUS didn't do this or that. We're beyond that now.   The only question is which side are you on?  President Donald Trump won. I'm with POTUS.  #StopTheSteal
1323872988622708736 2020-11-04 14:21:31 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Over/under on when Romney says Biden won?
1323869648421531648 2020-11-04 14:08:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> We all knew it would end this way.
1323869594927312897 2020-11-04 14:08:02 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Nationalize this platform @realDonaldTrump    https://t.co/VmtiT0056w
1323868927110336512 2020-11-04 14:05:23 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> oops sorry, can't finish counting.
1323868063754788865 2020-11-04 14:01:57 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Biden started it. Trump hit back.   That's it.
1323866555831193600 2020-11-04 13:55:57 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I have a solution. Just put Florida in charge of running everyone's election. Apparently, only Florida can do it right.
1323866121615904768 2020-11-04 13:54:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK>  https://t.co/1tRXcpvkr8
1323861443238940672 2020-11-04 13:35:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Amazing how Florida, the state everyone is always dunking on, is apparently able to hold an election without incident and deliver results quickly but no one else can.
1323860195081113607 2020-11-04 13:30:41 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This happens every cycle.
1323859717777743877 2020-11-04 13:28:47 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Of course
1323853129893425152 2020-11-04 13:02:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> So, are we all just forgetting about Virginia?
1323843996813320193 2020-11-04 12:26:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Don't think this is being settled tonight.
1323842197201047553 2020-11-04 12:19:10 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> /pol is lit, as you might expect.
1323841381438234625 2020-11-04 12:15:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Journos, this one is for you.
1323835196643434496 2020-11-04 11:51:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @pimpisyou You are both just and merciful.
1323834437809938433 2020-11-04 11:48:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @pimpisyou YOU WERE RIGHT
1323821155015397377 2020-11-04 10:55:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @ErnstHeidegger @tempestt0st Gonna be close but NYT has it basically called and absolute numbers on Fox show POTUS closing the gap fast.
1323818422581534720 2020-11-04 10:44:41 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @klein03251998 Doomerism is my coping strategy, you'll just have to accept it.
1323818321993781249 2020-11-04 10:44:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @wasphyxiation Here's hoping.
1323818247582556160 2020-11-04 10:44:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PolymathPenman @paulsperry_ I mean, I get this, but what is to be gained? The polls are closed. NYT has Trump virtually guaranteed to win NC. How would you benefit by making a wrong call when other mainstream outlets (arguably more mainstream outlets) are saying you're wrong?
1323817619108122624 2020-11-04 10:41:30 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Closing gap fast in NC, 15 percent left to report. POTUS down by less than 30,000 votes.
1323816486478204930 2020-11-04 10:37:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @RameshPonnuru @johndurant That's what you think. The Cubans are just being reassigned to "white."
1323816277455101952 2020-11-04 10:36:10 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @CorintheansXIII I have won the state of North Carolina.
1323814799575310336 2020-11-04 10:30:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @mart_chaz Depends on the outstanding counties. It's about 75,000 votes
1323814327028224001 2020-11-04 10:28:25 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @e_cornetto That's a hell of a lowball. Someone is just flat out completely wrong.
1323813315399876608 2020-11-04 10:24:24 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PolymathPenman thank you.
1323812367864631297 2020-11-04 10:20:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Fox now says 92 percent Biden gets North Carolina, NYT 88 percent Trump gets North Carolina.   Someone tell me what to think.
1323808976639873025 2020-11-04 10:07:09 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Meanwhile Fox says 91% chance NC goes for Biden. ???
1323808642290884608 2020-11-04 10:05:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @roddreher Peter Brimelow, about three decades ago, back when California was still a Republican state.
1323805883630014466 2020-11-04 09:54:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Yup. Took the base for granted. Doesn't mean all is lost of course, but this shouldn't even be close.
1323805332490113036 2020-11-04 09:52:41 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> MSNBC viewers behave like this every day tho
1323804445147340803 2020-11-04 09:49:09 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Vaiv71738794 That's assuming Ohio and Iowa are won though.
1323803693737758724 2020-11-04 09:46:10 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @leadpacer "This ain't over yet" is not what I want to hear right now.
1323803418654314497 2020-11-04 09:45:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> White working class...   Another stimulus check would have done it. But early yet.
1323801983980097536 2020-11-04 09:39:22 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I swore I wouldn't do this. But here we are.
1323801674755002369 2020-11-04 09:38:08 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> [looks at the needle]
1323800744068288513 2020-11-04 09:34:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> +2 for the shy Trump voter theory
1323799751968673799 2020-11-04 09:30:30 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Wistfulanimeman @SelimSeesYou Yup. Never was that worried about Florida but thought NC was too close. Still fwiw, needle slightly tipping to POTUS as of right now.
1323799288695214081 2020-11-04 09:28:40 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Lures us in with the whitepill and than a crunching right hook of a blackpill immediately afterward.   Still, long term, might be good if SW Virginia breaks off from the Commonwealth and joins West Virginia. Some counties already toying with it. Maybe this will make them serious.
1323798899866349569 2020-11-04 09:27:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @SelimSeesYou I don't know which needle and I don't care. It's just random movements and I recognize the stupidity, yet cannot turn away.
1323798713584812032 2020-11-04 09:26:22 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> No, it already happened.
1323797091886485509 2020-11-04 09:19:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Our quadrennial ritual of watching needles swerve wildly back and forth on different websites based on seemingly arbitrary criteria may need to be rethought.
1323791302505517059 2020-11-04 08:56:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Nor does "inreach" into the Trump base forbid an effort to get larger shares of other groups. But you have to give people something other than a pat on the head if you want them to turn out and not just stay home.
1323791035579944960 2020-11-04 08:55:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Don't get me wrong, Trump's benign neglect is better than Democrats' "we hate you and want you to die." White workers may still deliver victory for POTUS.   But this is so simple and it's not like people haven't bee warning about it for years.
1323790606154563590 2020-11-04 08:54:10 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Four years to give white working class a Platinum Plan, or an American Dream plan, or even a "here's some rust I found on the side of the road you can sell for scrap plan."  Instead, we're in a situation where both campaigns need the one demographic group that gets nothing.
1323772215276539908 2020-11-04 07:41:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @dpinsen yup. Grand compromise opportunity missed.
1323661953198444549 2020-11-04 00:22:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @ZTMbaronofurga Interesting possibility.
1323503368728444928 2020-11-03 13:52:47 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @stillatlarge Illinois is a subjected territory of Chicago.
1323417436822114305 2020-11-03 08:11:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @ladygaga My culture is not your costume.
1323087842449510400 2020-11-02 10:21:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Last, 10. While America will be increasingly dysfunctional, dangerous, and incompetent, it will also provide new opportunities outside mainstream culture. National politics almost irrelevant. Best way to defeat Leviathan will be by ignoring it.   Hope I'm wrong, see you Wed.
1323087232287297538 2020-11-02 10:19:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> 8. Identity politics will grow even more absurd as white strivers try to avoid affirmative action. Many more Rachel Dolezals in future and who knows how many more genders. 9. Silver lining - circumstances will force dissenters to build those things that we need to build anyway.
1323086990875742210 2020-11-02 10:18:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> 7. There will be more sensationalism about "far right violence" especially as they push through gun control, etc. Probably biggest victims will be hapless Boomers who think Constitution is still a thing. State repression will intensify.
1323086440742428672 2020-11-02 10:16:03 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> 6. The next term is going to be hell for Biden because "Orange Man Bad" has hid reality that America's financial, military, and cultural power is in decline. Attempts to impose "equity" (Kamala Harris cartoon today) will speed that decline. Media can only hide so much.
1323085784703000577 2020-11-02 10:13:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> 4. Trump's second term would almost certainly feature a push for amnesty and war with Iran, both of which would be hard to resist.  5. Biden Administration will rip the mask off - though I doubt conservatives will react, I don't think Dems can hold their coalition together.
1323085355134918657 2020-11-02 10:11:45 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Last thoughts before election and then no Twitter until it's all over. Too much time sunk.   1. My bet is Biden wins convincingly.  2. I hope I'm wrong.  3. Regardless, doesn't change what must be done building IRL networks and financial structures that can resist deplatforming.
1323083032010645505 2020-11-02 10:02:31 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PedrodeAlvara17 At that point, probably better off just moving to Latin America or expat in Asia.
1323081945597812736 2020-11-02 09:58:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @hocmountain Tears in rain.
1323081856137515010 2020-11-02 09:57:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "Moderates" value social proof. This cartoon makes them feel good, so they support it. Of course they don't think it through.   Ask yourself - do liberals who move away from deep blue areas change their votes? Of course not, they vote blue, move, and repeat.
1323081106044948482 2020-11-02 09:54:51 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Was wondering what Bill Mitchell's take was about all this, then remembered he got kicked off Twitter.
1323075395583905799 2020-11-02 09:32:10 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PhilippusArabus I doubt it. I think you'll just see moderate whites (i.e. rich suburban whites screaming at MSNBC every night) move away from the consequences of their policies, up the virtue signaling a bit more, fudge their ethnicity a bit more. A lot more Rachel Dolezals in our future.
1323071992682217472 2020-11-02 09:18:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Objectively the funniest outcome would be Texas goes blue but the entire Midwest goes red.
1323070466219757569 2020-11-02 09:12:35 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @_khaaan @guypbenson This is true. I don't think the polls are that far off. However, if there ever was a year where the "shy voter" phenomenon is a thing, this is it. And if that is enough to swing the election, polls are done for good.
1323059790432657409 2020-11-02 08:30:09 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @eronian In a better world.  https://t.co/HBLuYLdbCT
1323059519338012673 2020-11-02 08:29:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Basically the future is about coming up with increasingly convoluted theories about the invisible privileges of others in order to justify tangible, state-mandated privileges for yourself.   Again, just check the Hispanic box on the form and call it a day.
1323046230512062465 2020-11-02 07:36:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Why would anyone be mystified by a political party that uses state power to protect its own interests?  What's truly mystifying is why Republicans think the solution to Woke Capital is tax cuts and deregulation.
1323042778566299648 2020-11-02 07:22:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "Replacement migration isn't happening and it's good that it is."
1323002308633022466 2020-11-02 04:41:45 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Lol, it's all fake.
1322999921272868868 2020-11-02 04:32:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @TheTurbatron @RyanGirdusky The "Shut Up And Take It, You Have No Choice" Plan.
1322999784098201602 2020-11-02 04:31:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "Don't worry, I'll never do this."  "By the way, I'm definitely going to do this."  Long and short of it is that law-abiding Americans will be banned from owning certain weapons, crime will go up in inner cities (mostly handguns), Russians or God knows who else will be blamed.
1322988099652276227 2020-11-02 03:45:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> No. They will simply move to red areas, turn them purple and then blue, and then move on. Look what happened to Colorado, Virginia, and other states.
1322980283197607938 2020-11-02 03:14:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It's just baffling and infuriating that from day one of Trump's term there wasn't a massive effort to lock down the Midwest for good.   Maybe I'm just wrong, maybe they're still with him. And it's not like the Democrats will help them. But where's our "Platinum Plan?"
1322979309267595266 2020-11-02 03:10:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @crypto_passion They'll be more subdued, but there will be the typical celebratory destruction. I mean, again, it's like being in a college town when the team wins the NCAA. Celebratory rioting that just kind of happens, but won't have too much of an impact. If Trump wins, yes, much bigger.
1322979015276269568 2020-11-02 03:09:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> At least he'll win 2 percent more of the black vote.
1322976322134659073 2020-11-02 02:58:29 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Regardless of Biden wins or loses, you'll see some looting and property destruction in major cities, much like you do after a basketball championship. It won't be the end of the world, but there's a reason DC businesses are boarding up.
1322971532956782592 2020-11-02 02:39:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @armgfour Yeah I think most conservatives, especially those who have already been deplatformed and whatever else, will just say, well, more of the same. The victory party will be mildly annoying but in four months we may be in much the same place.

1322969686464745472 2020-11-02 02:32:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @eronian Empires have been built on less.
1322969419786702849 2020-11-02 02:31:03 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Koondey1 Luntz is right in that case. It's done.   I mean, I think they're right. I think Trump loses. But... I'm not betting money on it. I mean, if there was ever a climate where they just miss Trump supporters, this is it.
1322969158192144385 2020-11-02 02:30:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If Trump loses, he'll say nothing for a day, concede, journos will celebrate, and then they'll realize they built a coalition that can't stick together.   There's no dread, it's just journos making people hyperventilate about something that's not there, like "the Russian threat."

1322956190532489218 2020-11-02 01:38:29 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Election Night will be early.   POTUS loses NC, Florida, Georgia or (doubtful) TX, it's over.   If he wins... then it goes to the Midwest and a court battle that will go on for a while.   Bookmark this so you can mock me when I'm tweeting out insanity at 4AM Wednesday morning.

1322743415692513280 2020-11-01 11:33:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @themindofmurray Yeah, absolute nightmare. It's not my business to tell others how to be charitable, but it infuriates me to see countless billions of dollars thrown at diversity schemes while you have these heartbreaking local efforts trying to scrounge a few bucks together for medical research.
1322742138690482176 2020-11-01 11:27:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If we do get universal healthcare (inevitable ), it does become your business how others live . What they eat, whether they smoke, whether they are fit. I'm sure this will lead to just paying for more nonsense, bu it should make public health (and aesthetics) a policy goal. 2/2
1322741503987535873 2020-11-01 11:25:24 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Very good news for those suffering from this terrible disease. If any good comes out of this COVID-19 mess, it will be more funding towards defeating serious illnesses.

1322739197418086402 2020-11-01 11:16:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> In fairness, they basically did that with Germans towards the end of the Western Empire, and it destroyed them.
1322632233568579585 2020-11-01 04:11:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Either "shy Trump voters" is the biggest, most laughable Cope of all time and we go to bed at 11 on Tuesday or polling as an industry is utterly destroyed forever.   No middle ground between these positions.

1322607642074861575 2020-11-01 02:33:29 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> In this version, Anne Boleyn turns the tables on King Henry VIII, beheads him, usurps the throne, is proclaimed the "Slay Qween of Birtbong," and forges an alliance with Wakanda that conquers the world. Stunning and brave.

Check out all the cities that have been rendered into bombed out wasteland thanks to the social policies of the last half century. Horrifying yet fascinating.

I say this without irony. He should not have let this crisis go to waste. That was the moment to mandate UBI, close the borders, and cast himself as a protector. He didn't.
1322586024044879873 2020-11-01 01:07:35 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> No matter what happens, always remember.   AJAB.
1322585913172570119 2020-11-01 01:07:08 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It's astonishing how President Trump even has a chance at all considering everything they've thrown at him. Ongoing disinformation campaigns that have lasted for YEARS (Russia! Taxes! Steele Dossier!). Blatant treachery from GOP. Mixed messages from "experts" on COVID. Amazing.

1322346647700017158 2020-10-31 09:16:23 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> There's always a market for "I'm a brave dissident from within this conservative organization." You get all sorts of media attention and praise.   But once you can't undermine that institution from within anymore, you are no longer relevant.
1322346042885611520 2020-10-31 09:13:59 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Ah, I see the rest of you are catching up to us.

1322294191393832962 2020-10-31 05:47:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @tw_derecha No. I think it's going to be hell for a while but it's something that has to be happen.   There's a case that a neoliberal Democratic government that can be opposed openly is probably better in the long run than POTUS 2nd term. But I'm not sold on it.
1322287629753290753 2020-10-31 05:21:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @vincevega68 Probably doing wonders for diplomatic ties between France and India though.
1322287185782079493 2020-10-31 05:20:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @theaschop I mean, day one should have been the stuff that would have gotten at least some crossover Democrat support. Instead "infrastructure week" became a running joke. If he had said, "Fine, Ryan, we'll do your tax cut but we're doing this first" he'd be in a much stronger position.
1322286217623457792 2020-10-31 05:16:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Doomerpilled but think Trump will win Florida without too much difficulty.
1322285991110057990 2020-10-31 05:15:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Seems short-sighted. France has nukes and will be a Muslim country within a few decades. They'd be better off just waiting.

1322259355278954498 2020-10-31 03:29:31 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @JimmyDe52029210 @NYTDaniel @Barnes_Law @Peoples_Pundit Texas kept telling affluent liberal voters to come there because there was cheap labor and no regulation.   Well, they came. And now it will be turned into California. And then some other "limited government" state will invite the invaders in, and the process repeats.

1322017057794412544 2020-10-30 11:26:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> In the long run, the biggest problem this country faces is not unemployment, but people who are unemployable. Their only value is their vote, votes for a dysgenic system that systematically destroys quality, excellence, and beauty.
1321998186702098438 2020-10-30 10:11:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> All voting is an act of violence. The fact that you are outsourcing violence to other people doesn't change its reality.

1321969788499972104 2020-10-30 08:18:53 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Remember when the president had Covid? That seems like a decade ago.
1321966955608363009 2020-10-30 08:07:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Vaiv71738794 pretty much.  I mean Frank Luntz himself says the industry is destroyed forever if Trump wins.   I'm still bearish. But you have to ask yourself why Biden is campaigning in states he should have locked down.
1321966103883632641 2020-10-30 08:04:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> They're really putting themselves out there with this one but we'll have to see.

1321935145708957696 2020-10-30 06:01:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This is a cope but also my honest opinion - whoever wins, what we have to do doesn't fundamentally change. And having a neoliberal Democrat in charge of a hostile system does provide unique opportunities. Much easier to oppose.

1321918115664531456 2020-10-30 04:53:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @B_P_2020 Well I think it's also the deplatforming, which, of course, POTUS did little to stop. If a new American Right emerges, it needs to be forthrightly statist and willing to break up or nationalize companies with dominant market share.
1321917423705034753 2020-10-30 04:50:48 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @B_P_2020 Agreed. I do think he'll win Florida though.   Will be interesting to see if Biden Administration will calm down the cities. I have my doubts. I think they've unleashed something they can't control.
1321916280174219276 2020-10-30 04:46:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Blair_A_Nathan way ahead of you
1321915793454600193 2020-10-30 04:44:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Oosh. One of the accounts more favorable to Trump.   This is pretty much what I have too, though I'm not even sure about NC.
1321902139980079106 2020-10-30 03:50:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @JimmyDe52029210 That's what I expect and have always expected. But I'm not putting any money on it.

1321898264879341568 2020-10-30 03:34:40 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I have no idea what's going to happen yet after we know it's going to seem so obvious in retrospect.

1321850019822080001 2020-10-30 00:22:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @HawleyMO @PatriotZoomer @Twitter So do something about it.
1321845078319632386 2020-10-30 00:03:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I feel for the faithful Catholics who have to defend the verbal and physical attacks against the Church, and have to do it with most of the priests, bishops and the Pope himself telling them to stand down and let themselves be crushed.

Of course, the type of lefties fired up to vote are overrepresented on here - rich whites, journo types, etc.   If I'm in DSA, I want Biden to lose so we can take over the Democrats on the line that DNC lost to Trump twice.

1321712377629450240 2020-10-29 15:16:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Feel like these "here's how Trump can still win" are starting to sound like "here's how Bernie can still win" copes.

1321642639490457601 2020-10-29 10:38:54 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> From 2016 - Imagine if Trump had built on this instead of First Step Act and handing over the campaign to Kushner and policy to Ryan.

1321635737935204352 2020-10-29 10:11:29 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PunishedHank Because that's not who we are or something.
1321635647728340994 2020-10-29 10:11:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @emeriticus If it works, yes.
1321635193992732674 2020-10-29 10:09:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Like Kavanaugh, her first instinct is "how can win over these people who hate me?"
1321634775254372354 2020-10-29 10:07:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Maybe if whites just identify as Hispanics, the Trump campaign will pay attention.
1321621456531447808 2020-10-29 09:14:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If you're following along at home, the Trump campaign has set aside special benefit plans for blacks and Hispanics, but nothing for the white working class except more government-mandated discrimination against them.
1321620465807433730 2020-10-29 09:10:48 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Tax cuts for Twitter, Google, and Facebook.
1321619322666700805 2020-10-29 09:06:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @hughhewitt @RichardGrenell Given that "Western liberal values" lead to civilizational death, you'd be insane to adopt them.   Liberalism, "classical" or otherwise, is the problem. The modern "West" has value only as a cautionary example to nations, civilizations, and peoples who don't want to go extinct.
1321611901286141952 2020-10-29 08:36:46 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @OrwellNGoode At least they're not speaking German!
1321594782863577094 2020-10-29 07:28:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "The problem with Scotland is that it's full of Scots" is now the official policy of the Scottish Nationalist Party.
1321579612942553092 2020-10-29 06:28:28 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @AllisonLeeSolin @dundreary They just want to be accepted by their social class.
1321579543539470337 2020-10-29 06:28:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Your tax dollars at work. Why do we have crumbling infrastructure? Why can't we explore space? Why are taxes so high and public services so low?  Because you have to pay for this instead.
1321578230000877569 2020-10-29 06:22:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @JeffFlake Yes, but which country? This clearly isn't the one you care about.
1321577754094145536 2020-10-29 06:21:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @TheHinduDindu @CocosPatient True, the trillions wasted on welfare and affirmative action represent an unbelievable opportunity cost. We could have gone to Mars, but instead, we got modern Philly.
1321559340868898817 2020-10-29 05:07:54 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Solution - tax cuts, more copies of "Capitalism and Freedom" for college students.
1321549821426151424 2020-10-29 04:30:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Amazing how the #MeToo movement shifted seamlessly into burning down cities for people who threatened women with guns.   I mean, it could be worse, he could have said "you look nice today" or something equally traumatizing.
1321549465384292361 2020-10-29 04:28:40 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Tucker Carlson has broken the record for cable news and yet I'd say the odds that he is still on the air in a year are less than 50 percent.   They'll eventually come up with some kind of excuse. I imagine Fox News executives are deeply unhappy with his success.
1321543287459762177 2020-10-29 04:04:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Just skip the election and have some CEOs in Silicon Valley choose the president.   Much more direct.
1321542871187685385 2020-10-29 04:02:28 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @NeoPenthesilea I don't think it will be a slaughter. I wouldn't be THAT shocked if he goes down in flames, but I think it will be fairly close.   Maybe that's just a cope. Again, if GOP had acted on free speech online, we wouldn't be in this mess. But they want Trump out too.
1321539174093172736 2020-10-29 03:47:46 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Nothing means anything anymore.
1321539086977552389 2020-10-29 03:47:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @jj75313739 Yeah, he's the trusted old border collie that gets the horse on the cart to the glue factory.   He gives people the comforting illusion and that's all they want.
1321538859486818305 2020-10-29 03:46:31 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "Is that who we are?"  No, that's the point, there is no "we." If America will just be a continent wide shopping mall open to the world, why should anyone care about it?  Everyone just needs to take care of their own and to hell with the rest. That's who "we" are now.
1321537473915297792 2020-10-29 03:41:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It's really just coming down to the white suburbanites who want things to go back to "normal" and think Biden will do that.   Scandals, corruption, violent crime... all of these things are secondary to making sure that people can giggle along with their TV friends in peace.
1321505377599524865 2020-10-29 01:33:29 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Toral1 Hopefully!

1321501723375095808 2020-10-29 01:18:57 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @vordorsai I know. But complacency is more dangerous than Doomerism. Always fight like your back is to the wall.   Because in our case, it really is.

Putting your life on the line every day just so your own race can scream outrageous slurs in your face. And you just have to sit there and take it.

1321258641467576320 2020-10-28 09:13:02 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Government preferences in jobs and education, untold billions thrown away, and this is what you end up with.
1321258194207952903 2020-10-28 09:11:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This is just how it is going to be forever now. Doesn't matter if the guy had a knife, a gun, attacked women, children... totally irrelevant. Just every city in America on the brink of a riot, always.

1321248322150125569 2020-10-28 08:32:02 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Bad wording on my part. I mean Turkey and France are treating each other as enemies, not that France is an enemy of the US.

1321238108344623104 2020-10-28 07:51:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Turkey and France are declared enemies now, yet somehow we are supposed to believe NATO is still meaningful.   Turkey should be expelled from NATO and Congress needs to forthrightly condemn the Armenian genocide, something Turkey still pretends never happened.
1321232611101069322 2020-10-28 07:29:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @JoeBiden Yeah, so does the cop's. That's why society, until now apparently, frowns upon attempted murder and charging people with knives.

1321195749116465152 2020-10-28 05:03:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I think this year the pollsters have done a better job at analyzing these states. Many of them were simply assumed to go for Hillary in 16.   Of course, as Luntz himself says, if Trump wins, his industry is done, at least for politics.
1321193250099703809 2020-10-28 04:53:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The argument FOR Democratic enthusiasm are these people voting and getting on TikTok crying about what a heroic and brave act it was. It's sad because their whole lives revolve around something that in the end, they can't control. But they do mean it and it's real.

1321174299202506753 2020-10-28 03:37:53 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Tom_in_SFCA Right, think it's just referring to TV. I have heard there's a lot of GOTV in FL.
1321171976350846976 2020-10-28 03:28:40 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> No, it makes no sense unless you think you have Florida and so you're going for a reach in MN.   Trump may be wrong. The complacency and "Red Wave" talk is reminiscent of 2018. But this isn't some Doomerpilled move by the campaign. It's an act of confidence.
1321162074811228167 2020-10-28 02:49:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> All GOP fools had to do was pass a stimulus bill. They wouldn't do it.   Just mandate it. Send the checks out of funds previously allocated. Lefties don't like it, let them explain to the people why they get no money. Fight it out in the courts. Show some spine. @realDonaldTrump

1320948605516173313 2020-10-27 12:41:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Luckily, the Poor Boys will respond quickly to quell any disorder.
1320948050781757441 2020-10-27 12:38:51 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Mostly peaceful torching.
1320935642021376000 2020-10-27 11:49:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @danfromdc That's a good way of looking at it.
1320935199836950529 2020-10-27 11:47:48 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @niceshirt16 TV told them to.
1320935040197472256 2020-10-27 11:47:10 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @danfromdc I thought Trump was going to get crushed in 16 until the day before Election Day.  It's just early voting and the absolutely monolithic platform control are so dominant this time around.
1320934728183226371 2020-10-27 11:45:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Expand the Supreme Court... to a few hundred seats and then abolish Congress. Because the Court is just the legislature which imposes all the important laws. Might as well scrap a redundant arm of government.
1320934163852251137 2020-10-27 11:43:41 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Pretty sure that my white privilege wouldn't save me from being lit up if I charged police with a knife.
1320934014698532864 2020-10-27 11:43:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Everything tells me that Trump is going down to a historic defeat. The polls, the deplatforming, the media, the demographic changes. The only voices against it are a few random Twitter accounts who want Trump to win.   And yet I can't help but think they are right and I am wrong.
1320917204951572481 2020-10-27 10:36:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It's almost like the Left is serious about using power.   All political questions are about who, not what.
1320849526132006912 2020-10-27 06:07:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I for one fondly recall the good ol' days of the George Lopez administration.
1320839072684953600 2020-10-27 05:25:49 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @klein03251998 Absentee voting is different.
1320838367140061185 2020-10-27 05:23:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Yeah, I think that line failed sometime around Marbury vs. Madison.   The Court is a small legislature. Nothing more.
1320837742855671809 2020-10-27 05:20:32 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Which is absurd. Advance voting makes a farce out of the whole process. There should be one election day for everyone.
1320801898014924800 2020-10-27 02:58:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If he's wrong here, polling is done forever.
1320794988553379840 2020-10-27 02:30:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Holbornlolz  https://t.co/9fdE9qHerA
1320786432798134275 2020-10-27 01:56:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @groyper_boston I honestly don't know. I just don't. My brain tells me he'll lose, but something just seems off. Maybe that's just misplaced hope/fear.   We'll see. However, I will say that the failure of GOP on healthcare is the main reason Trump is in this mess. No plan.
1320783217868361728 2020-10-27 01:43:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @SpeakingBee @groyper_boston Right. Rationally, I don't think he even has a chance.   Luntz is right that if Trump somehow pulls it off, political polling is done forever. The entire industry would be completely discredited.
1320782777885884417 2020-10-27 01:42:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @groyper_boston MN would be incredible.   Rationally, I think POTUS loses in a landslide because of demographic change, COVID, media bias, deplatforming, host of other factors.   But I honestly don't know. I don't have enough confidence to even venture a prediction. Totally uncharted territory.
1320778826901839872 2020-10-27 01:26:25 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> So China's Social Credit System is slightly less repressive than ours.
1320777956185264129 2020-10-27 01:22:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "For ourselves and our posterity" is the correct foundation for any moral code.
1320777649942384640 2020-10-27 01:21:45 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Interesting because Goldman Sachs recently said Biden win was better for stock market. People working in financial industry have given about $50 million to Biden, about $13 million to Trump.
1320766803233132547 2020-10-27 00:38:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @TendiesB I suspect there's a lot of that going on. Subtle cues like Betsy Ross flags, pro-police bumper sticks, pro-life stuff etc.
1320766281298153477 2020-10-27 00:36:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Camelback71 I'm one of the few who wants Trump to win but thinks he will get obliterated.
1320766093221371904 2020-10-27 00:35:49 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Only thing I'll say about Biden enthusiasm is I see major excitement for Biden in affluent suburban areas. Biden signs everywhere. It really does come down to a question of whether there are "quiet" Trump supporters in those areas. Rural areas, with few exceptions, Trump country.
1320765653922533377 2020-10-27 00:34:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @groyper_boston I mean who knows at this point. But one can imagine a scenario where Dems win Texas but GOP compensates by winning the Rust Belt and forming a new coalition.
1320764678730141696 2020-10-27 00:30:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @BaneDoomer1356 Yes, I think the Left would collectively snap. They've thrown everything at POTUS, even though POTUS has largely governed like a normal Republican (though he doesn't tweet like one.)
1320764519921131520 2020-10-27 00:29:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The polls are absolutely incredible right now. It's extremely hard to reconcile polls showing Trump leading NATIONALLY while being behind in Texas.   Some people are going to be massively, utterly obliterated no matter what happens in two weeks. I won't even venture a prediction.
1320753807215763457 2020-10-26 23:47:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> In 2012, I said Romney needed to lose because only then could the GOP orient to something more populist. That played out well.   In 2020, if I'm in DSA, I want Biden/Harris to lose against a weak incumbent because it discredits the neolib/neocons. Then you get your own in 2024.
1320572561940512768 2020-10-26 11:46:48 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Filed my early ballot for the 2024 election.
1320572460476125184 2020-10-26 11:46:24 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> In the future, we will just have a continuous campaign with public officials taking or leaving office on random dates.
1320567802030411777 2020-10-26 11:27:53 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @mewIina Yes, though I have no illusions anything will be done at the policy level. If Trump is re-elected (which I doubt very much), the loss of media credibility would be worth it. At the end of the day, we're governed by media, not the state.

Russia should be our ally, but our domestic political climate makes that impossible now.

1319469299199856641 2020-10-23 10:42:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Not happy about Trump's answers on immigration and crime. But I think the only thing that people will remember from tonight is Biden's own goal on fracking. Every campaign ad in PA.
1319466353464659968 2020-10-23 10:31:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Join your local Poor Boys chapter today.
1319458508023255040 2020-10-23 09:59:57 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The amazing thing about the Affordable Care Act is that it is somehow popular, even though everybody in the country seems to agree that health care gets worse every year and so we have to repeal or replace President Obama's sole accomplishment.
1319456795623084033 2020-10-23 09:53:09 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This is the albatross that has been destroying Republicans for four years. Not Trump's "tone," not journos, not even demographics. It's the complete lack of a plan on healthcare.   Medicare for All combined with border security, economic populism, and taxing oligarchs would win.
1319450571070410754 2020-10-23 09:28:25 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Huh, the travel ban was "xenophobic fear mongering" back in March   I think Trump didn't do nearly enough on the pandemic. It was a cataclysmic failure. But based on what Biden was saying at the time - and now at the debate - he'd have handled this far worse.
1319439428729868289 2020-10-23 08:44:08 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Just going to say this about anything I don't like.   "Oh, you have evidence? Nope, Russian disinformation. You're just a bot. BLOCKED."
1319427792195506183 2020-10-23 07:57:54 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Half-expecting Turkish intervention here.
1319341796888072192 2020-10-23 02:16:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @CottoGottfried Yes this is complete nonsense. Down in Ohio but tied nationally while other polls are showing double digit leads for Biden nationally.   I think they really are just throwing out random numbers at this point and yet I cannot turn away.
1319341306628493313 2020-10-23 02:14:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> POTUS needs to go all in on working class voters in the Midwest.
1319335553536544769 2020-10-23 01:51:22 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The horse race is fun and it's impossible to avoid being dragged into it. But from our viewpoint, nothing fundamentally changes in terms of what must be done.   The goals will remain the same, the strategy will change depending on what happens.
1319334088671723520 2020-10-23 01:45:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "Sorry bigots, we have to kill your dog to make things equal."
1319332718799441921 2020-10-23 01:40:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Better idea - the franchise has to be earned via service to the state and ownership of property.   Far too many people vote already. People need a stake in the political order ("skin in the game") or else you are just turning the state over to dependents.
1319306093588250624 2020-10-22 23:54:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Identity politics is fake and we shouldn't talk about it. Also, we can predict who is going to win the election just by adjusting the turnout of different groups.   @BillKristol was right about one thing. We don't have elections anymore, just an occasional census.
1319303900999131136 2020-10-22 23:45:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> These letters strike me as fake, just like the supposed "Proud Boys" emails that the entire media fell for.

1319301546287431681 2020-10-22 23:36:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> About 20 million illegals in this country would disagree.
1319061331459395590 2020-10-22 07:41:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @CottoGottfried I'll bite. Why would a poll showing DJT is down suppress GOP enthusiasm? If you think you are behind, you work harder, do more to get people to the polls.   I'd think complacency would be the real danger. Hillary lost the Rust Belt because she assumed it was already a lock.
1319055441880637447 2020-10-22 07:18:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> So President Trump is either winning Michigan by 3 or is down by 11.   I've had enough.

1318380868138881026 2020-10-20 10:37:47 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> White suburbanites think Biden will bring things back to "normal" so TV won't upset them anymore. Blacks politicians know his racial record is questionable, so they have a lot of power over him. Socialists can tell themselves he's just a "transitional" candidate. 2/2
1318380463262662656 2020-10-20 10:36:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Biden's front porch campaign is probably the best move for him. He's got the media doing the heavy lifting. Platform control for the Left already secured. And like Obama in 2008, people can read whatever they want into Biden. 1/2
1318365719168491522 2020-10-20 09:37:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Of course the GOP Senate doesn't want to stop Big Tech censorship. Of course it doesn't want to cut a stimulus check. You can't assume their priority is to stay in office. It's to remain respectable to the Left, lose, and get the nice job. See Eric Cantor and Paul Ryan.
1318363454139486209 2020-10-20 09:28:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> No, nationalize them outright. We need a strong state.

1318284870234361856 2020-10-20 04:16:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Ah yes, those conservative justices we hear so much about.   Again, the Court is just a small legislature. I don't care what stupid ideology justices invoke. I care if they rule the way I want them to.
1318280835901120512 2020-10-20 04:00:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @hocmountain True.
1318277806040797186 2020-10-20 03:48:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If it was pro-European, yes. The EU, as presently set up, is anti-European and encourages the demographic displacement of the indigenous European people.   Not sure if that institution can be changed from the inside. Think Eastern Europe would be better off with its own bloc.
1318252704154738690 2020-10-20 02:08:31 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Will President Trump win North Carolina? (I'm thinking not, but who knows.)
1318251119643185152 2020-10-20 02:02:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> God almighty no. Tax the oligarchs, send the checks, and stop this stupid accounting fetish that masquerades as a political movement.   If the ballooning deficit brings down the System someday, so much the better.
1318228501787455488 2020-10-20 00:32:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @shufflinsam I'm hoping that's true.

1317957325316100096 2020-10-19 06:34:47 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Elections are downstream from culture. Culture is downstream from platform control.

1316800098601447424 2020-10-16 01:56:23 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Is this even up for debate?
1316798350369456130 2020-10-16 01:49:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The only way to interpret this is "I want Trump to lose because I don't want to give the American people money, just random companies."  No pre-election stimulus, no check, @realDonaldTrump loses and it won't be close.
1316797178774519810 2020-10-16 01:44:46 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If you want to make this argument, then don't appeal to the Founding Fathers or "American ideals" to cloak your agenda.
1316794243130822656 2020-10-16 01:33:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> And yet, it will if your political ideology is "we refuse to use state power" and your foe's ideology is "we WILL use state power."
1316792693213802497 2020-10-16 01:26:57 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @saveusculture The free market is and has always been a lie.   Yes, I want Big Government and for state power to be used for my interests. What checks power is power.
1316791265955061762 2020-10-16 01:21:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I don't want to hear the words "hearings" or "lash out" or "berate."  I want these companies nationalized and assets seized unless they commit to clear guidelines that protect free speech. Platform access is a civil right.

1316787247816085504 2020-10-16 01:05:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Twitter should just ban Trump's account now. At this point, we all know the entire GOP would roll over for it. Or try to give Twitter another tax cut.
1316787101967491074 2020-10-16 01:04:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> POTUS going to put Twitter on Super Secret Level Monitoring.   Just six more chances Twitter! He's warning you!
1316786334279839747 2020-10-16 01:01:41 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Journalists are defending their preferences. Can't be mad at them for that. Be mad at conservatives who seem to get off on screwing over their voters.
1316786303967559681 2020-10-16 01:01:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Journos never forgave themselves for reporting on Hillary's emails. This was always the strategy. Good ol' Joe will give the Boomers one last nostalgia vote, pass amnesty, permanent Democratic rule just like ANC in South Africa.
1316778763569504257 2020-10-16 00:31:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @DelawareJk I mean, its right. Conservatism legitimizes liberalism. Which is why it needs to go.

They spread stories (true or false) that help their side, they suppress or ideally deplatform outlets that help the other side.   That's all "journalism" has ever been. AJAB, always.

Who is sovereign should be known by all, not because he should be all-powerful, but so he can be held accountable. It's precisely because "no one" is actually in charge of the state that we are in this mess. You don't know who to replace.

1316520654347350018 2020-10-15 07:25:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @ComicDaveSmith Yes, because we can at least mandate First Amendment protections. We have no counter against corporate power.
1316519409201098754 2020-10-15 07:21:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @vincevega68 Need to insert that.
1316519338573262848 2020-10-15 07:20:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @OutsideFreq @shufflinsam That's my thought. We forget how many people assume since they would never knowingly lie, they can't imagine journalists would.
1316519137900990465 2020-10-15 07:19:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @justinamash Yes, that's why platform access as a civil right is better than repealing Section 230. Don't give me the "private company" nonsense, that's been gone since the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Unless you want to repeal that, your "free market principles" are just cowardice and hypocrisy.

1316506847935946753 2020-10-15 06:31:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @OutsideFreq If the popular vote is close, Trump wins an electoral college landslide.   I think he's going to get utterly blown out. But I thought he was toast after Access Hollywood in 2016. Didn't change mind until day before election. Friends called saying, "Trust us, he'll win PA and MI"

1316501225509195776 2020-10-15 06:08:46 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> One of the amazing stories of this presidency is how powerful Mike Pence is within it, especially when determining personnel. He's somehow managed to walk the knife-edge of being a Trump loyalist while not being caught in many negative news cycles. Imagine he'll be back in 2024.

1316462922567233538 2020-10-15 03:36:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Why don't you give them more tax cuts.
1316462843798188035 2020-10-15 03:36:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @KurtSchlichter Yeah, but Republicans are gleeful that in 2017-2018 all that happened is that the GOP gave these guys a tax cut.   Open your eyes. Capitalism is not our friend.
1316461080680562690 2020-10-15 03:29:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The conservative movement systematically trains activists to sacrifice themselves for corporate interests and cheap labor. It trains homeschooling Christians to fight for Netflix and Amazon. Don't complain about Woke Capital. You made this bed @GOP   We need a strong state.
1316459873224228864 2020-10-15 03:24:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @charliekirk11 Because activist organizations like yours tell them to fight for "low taxes" and "free markets" and "capitalism." So they do. And now we live under Woke Capital.   We need a strong state to bring the oligarchs to heel.
1316459465319813120 2020-10-15 03:22:49 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If you think the problems are foreign countries outside our borders, be they China, Russia, Iran or whatever other enemy of the week, you're not even in the battle.

1316454035646550018 2020-10-15 03:01:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The faux shock and outrage is just maddening.  We all know what they are doing. They have been doing it for years. Constantly hoping leftists will "play fair" is why all we have left are the ruins of a once great country.
1316453450000064517 2020-10-15 02:58:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PhilippusArabus Of course not. They got theirs. Besides, America defined by "individualism" and money, so they are acting in accordance with their moral code.
1316453058696622082 2020-10-15 02:57:22 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> President @realDonaldTrump must use whatever funds are available to start sending direct stimulus checks to American. Let the Democrats and "True Conservatives" fight it in court.
1316452685927911424 2020-10-15 02:55:53 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Yup, these idiots want Trump out, to pivot back to being deficit hawks, and to making sure the System that is crushing their voters is run as efficiently as possible.
1316426605179408388 2020-10-15 01:12:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @andkon @vdare Gonna happen anyway, though probably not through formal nationalization. Just rules against "disinformation" being promoted, with disinformation defined as anything leftists don't like.

1316422019941007362 2020-10-15 00:54:02 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> After 2016, journos berated themselves for even covering Hillary Clinton's emails. They thought they had enabled the "wrong" result. Now, they will work hard to bury this Hunter Biden story. GOP will complain they aren't being "fair," but won't go beyond that.

1316418742327410690 2020-10-15 00:41:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Yeah, that's what we're already living, mostly because journos cheer it on.  https://t.co/deF9474RdW
1316417708423024642 2020-10-15 00:36:54 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @aftradjon1 Yes, but I think the nature of this means that outright nationalization might be necessary. If you have a system that can shift preferences, control information and determine elections, it rules, not the government.
1316416711843885058 2020-10-15 00:32:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Nationalize Big Tech. Nationalize them all. The state must rule, not oligarchs.   At least with the state, there is some public accountability and we can establish uniform standards for free speech and a reasonably fair market for small businesses advertising or selling online.
1316415682293137409 2020-10-15 00:28:51 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Biden should be up by 20. The entire power structure is trying to shove him over the finish line, chaos with mail-in ballots, a vast social credit system that punishes supporters of the President, news censored.  We just need someone willing to ACT, not tweet.
1316414878660296705 2020-10-15 00:25:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Man, maybe you should have done something about it when you were the majority instead of giving them tax cuts.   The next Right has to be willing to confront and subdue corporate power. If necessary, nationalize such companies, which are the modern day public square.
1316282736961826816 2020-10-14 15:40:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Daily reminder that when there's a real populist right, we're going to tax the System's mouthpieces into oblivion. The  Romans knew the proper way to regard such creatures. An unclean trade.

We're already in the post-Western, post-Christian world. What comes next?  I feel intense dread, but also excitement. A lot happening.
1316262017016238080 2020-10-14 14:18:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> When (and I think it's when) Biden is president, he'll enjoy corporate media guarding him from gaffes and scandals. Only investigations will be against what independent remains.   His biggest problem will be telling Dems' pets in the cities to stop rioting. I doubt he can.

1316232879597391872 2020-10-14 12:22:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @20_mockingbird @breddy_gud Catholic Taqiya
1316232400792416257 2020-10-14 12:20:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @breddy_gud Oh, my gut says she'll be hopeless on immigration cases. But we will see. Her past record isn't bad on that issue.
1316231809949224960 2020-10-14 12:18:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Keep in mind, this is the arch-conservative, the uber-Catholic, the trad who champion dogma and all the rest of it.   However, she bends the knee because someone decided, today, that "sexual preference" has magically become offensive.   Consider it burning a pinch of incense.
1316229491061149696 2020-10-14 12:08:59 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> .@realDonaldTrump go on Joe Rogan.
1316226099458772992 2020-10-14 11:55:31 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "The dogma lives loudly within you," except the dogma is just whatever new definition can be weaponized against American conservatives and Christians who gave away their entire civilization for fear of being called words.
1316219635809878018 2020-10-14 11:29:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @groyper_boston @NickJFuentes 2021. Election Day will be annoying, but clarifying. And no way Biden can hold his Merkel-style Grand Coalition together until the midterms.
1316218142197243904 2020-10-14 11:23:53 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @groyper_boston If he goes full Caudillo we would all rejoice, but that requires using power. Not tweets.
1316217962773217280 2020-10-14 11:23:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @groyper_boston I mean I still think he can win just by making printer go brrrrrrr and sending the Trumpbux. But he has to actually do it and time is pretty much out. Screw Congress, use money already allocated and let them fight it in court.
1316217750226898944 2020-10-14 11:22:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @groyper_boston 2016 isn't 2020. We don't have independent media, friendly media once enjoyed has switched sides (Drudge), and Biden is far more likable than Hillary Clinton. In '16 we all knew the slogan - Make America Great Again. What is it now? KAG? MAGA? Re-open America? Who knows?
1316215884185296899 2020-10-14 11:14:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> ... so she actually believes it unlike the politicians and celebrities who say they are "devout Catholics" but don't believe any of it or do anything.
1316215131311935488 2020-10-14 11:11:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Abolish existing student loan debt and with it, federal aid programs.   Set students free but make sure colleges aren't just factories for left-wing activists.
1316214452077948929 2020-10-14 11:09:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It's easier to fight a common enemy than unite behind a common agenda.   Trump's '16 foe was the Swamp and its exemplar, Crooked Hillary. She's still free and GOP Establishment was given control over agenda.   What's the enemy in '20? A "Sleepy" guy we shouldn't take seriously?
1316213494535127040 2020-10-14 11:05:25 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @hishershehe That would also work if he was charismatic enough.
1316212915054227456 2020-10-14 11:03:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Of course, this raises another question. Just out of sheer self-interest, why didn't ANY Republicans seize on Trump's 2016 agenda and advance it more effectively? Either they are stupid, have more important goals than winning and keeping office, or both. 2/2
1316212390309113857 2020-10-14 11:01:02 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Again, President Trump's problem is that he keeps saying the stuff we all know to be true out loud instead of letting people live with lies. A better politician would speak softly but swing a big stick. Trump just screams, enrages the Left, and then doesn't follow through. 1/2
1316212023584337922 2020-10-14 10:59:35 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> You can't win suburban women by telling them to like you because you saved their neighborhood from Section 8. Obviously that's why they live there, with "good schools" and "low crime." But you have to let them live with their hypocrisy. People want pretty lies, not harsh truths.
1316174362349907970 2020-10-14 08:29:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @CaribouXLou I think Sweden has a shot. Anglosphere is done.
1316173790393630720 2020-10-14 08:27:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @CaribouXLou Think every Western European country (except UK) has a change. USA as a whole doesn't.
1316168887717769218 2020-10-14 08:08:10 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @laugh_having I try.
1316166691643101184 2020-10-14 07:59:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Moral is that platform control determines belief. Control the media and all else follows.   To save the read, daughter who thinks "Homeland" is real life switches parents' media to CNN, predictable results, old white man votes Democrat and kills himself. Basically, journo porn.
1316165060776071168 2020-10-14 07:52:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @CaribouXLou The collapse already happened, it's just going to be long, boring, and very stupid.
1316163625661366272 2020-10-14 07:47:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It is the same job. The reason Supreme Court matters at all is because John Marshall just declared it has power to determine what is unconstitutional and what's not, and nullification failed.   Supreme Court is a very important legislature with a very small number of legislators.
1316162300278181889 2020-10-14 07:42:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Boomers get platitudes; Biden won't confiscate 401(k)s. Suburban women get harmless entertainment rather than outrage from TV. Journos switch to supporting regime. Socialists told "be patient." DC gets wars; GOP gets cheap labor; nationalists and Russia blamed for everything bad.
1316161499417772032 2020-10-14 07:38:49 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @BunkersPlace2 Yeah another example of "this didn't happen and it's good that it did."
1316157815095005185 2020-10-14 07:24:10 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Notice how the NYT casually smears the dead. He was "far right."   In contrast, Reinoehl was "carrying a gun and providing security."   Somehow, when militia members do this, they aren't described in such neutral terms.
1316154227497070594 2020-10-14 07:09:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Don't care who got the polls right or wrong in '16. Who had it right in '18?
1316139958055374849 2020-10-14 06:13:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @groyper_boston Same. Still need to do my election bit but "what must be done" doesn't change too much either way.
1316139559432916992 2020-10-14 06:11:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @groyper_boston He won't if he doesn't get COVID stimulus passed before election.
1316138571850489856 2020-10-14 06:07:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Senate Republicans think a COVID stimulus will lead to "backlash" at the ballot box. That's right, they think that white working class voters care about... too much government spending.   Are they truly this stupid? Do they think they'll survive if/when Trump loses?
1316129465261580289 2020-10-14 05:31:31 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Suspicious about the "no enthusiasm for Biden" talking point. Again, love it to be true, but the "enthusiasm" is the sheer, frothing hatred for Trump and his voters. It makes sense they also think the virus will kill them instantly. They'll mail in their votes or vote early.
1316126744726966274 2020-10-14 05:20:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PhilippusArabus Would never be published now.
1316123200686784518 2020-10-14 05:06:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Yeah, this is "our" State Department at work. Can't wait till we are in a war because Belarus doesn't have enough Gender Studies programs or BLM protests.
1316098221916278785 2020-10-14 03:27:22 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Irusk8 If Trump really wants to win a larger share of the black vote, he should pledge to restore the House of Selassie. The Rastafarians will deliver him victory.   Makes more sense then Blexit.
1316096340271812608 2020-10-14 03:19:54 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> ... we had forces in Somalia? Why?
1316095993969086466 2020-10-14 03:18:31 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @zvZ7lsHl4Jugtxs True enough. But two points. 1. If Democrats win, you are going to see massive government spending beyond a stimulus anyway. 2. Overall inflationary pressures are down because of decreased consumer demand. Inflation is a worry, yes. But not in the short-term.
1316075229589000193 2020-10-14 01:56:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @nypost  https://t.co/SvyfDCwkQ1
1316069544126017539 2020-10-14 01:33:25 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Yeah but it also shows Biden essentially tied with Trump among men and Trump losing by almost double digits overall.   It's either a bad poll (in which case these Hispanic numbers are meaningless) or Trump is losing. Either way, strange to promote it.
1316066080838823936 2020-10-14 01:19:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Stimulus. Nothing else. Send the checks.
1316059867942195200 2020-10-14 00:54:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Re: nature of the media and how bad it's going to get, the man is right   https://t.co/S58QhcUgh3
1316057758563794946 2020-10-14 00:46:35 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @DavidSharp84 This is true but it is also because Americans know the police will suddenly show up to arrest them if they try to prevent this.
1316057571837595648 2020-10-14 00:45:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @reilly_kj Yeah I think it's also the state where you will see the most fraud, perhaps just behind Pennsylvania.
1316055851774472193 2020-10-14 00:39:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Think Trump will be on the defensive this election. But if he's going to flip a blue state, Nevada is probably his best bet.
1315846214664040448 2020-10-13 10:45:59 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> At least the parasite is self-aware.
1315844638041874432 2020-10-13 10:39:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I can't stop laughing, this really looks like a hostage video.
1315842301525098498 2020-10-13 10:30:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> His hope and optimism: gone
1315840729785266178 2020-10-13 10:24:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Cernovich I think at least some people who voted Trump will vote Biden. I think that number is bigger than those who voted for Hillary and switched to Trump.   Trump will definitely get 99% of the Evan McMullin (remember him?) voters though.
1315840320182063104 2020-10-13 10:22:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> No, send Trumpbux.
1315840106943721472 2020-10-13 10:21:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PaulFor86 Agreed.
1315826282609995776 2020-10-13 09:26:47 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @BillTaggert I have no idea why they are doing that, maybe support for some congressional race. That state is as gone as Virginia.
1315824861529473024 2020-10-13 09:21:08 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Doomer reporting in but also think Trump will win Iowa and Ohio.
1315824465427804160 2020-10-13 09:19:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @somefellow6 Thanks. I'd say "American" government pressure is a big reason. NGOs, State Department money ("we" are still funding anti-Orban media for some reason). Also "American" pop culture, which is pure poison, replacing shattered European cultures after WWII.
1315823720682975233 2020-10-13 09:16:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Goldman Sachs pulling for Democratic sweep. Again, Republicans, what is the logic of directing all your policies to benefit people who hate you? -  https://t.co/UNjZ7F2bTG
1315823068976238592 2020-10-13 09:14:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @CanDoAutistic @HarmlessYardDog 1 year.
1315823024466264064 2020-10-13 09:13:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Have universally positive mainstream media coverage and enjoy the full use of all financial services and tech platforms despite being "socialists."  That's it.
1315822051014447110 2020-10-13 09:09:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Trump is too authentic. He can't fake sympathy or exude pessimism. His life is optimism and overconfidence.   Biden is perfectly suited. He can read a script, mouth platitudes, fake sympathy (his private life shows he's a sociopath), and console Boomers that USA is still a thing.
1315820434093416449 2020-10-13 09:03:32 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @americanzoomer I don't think they are all fake. I do think Trump will do better than predicted. But when you are looking at the same poll and movement over time, that shows something, especially if it is a tracking poll.
1315820230870999041 2020-10-13 09:02:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @GobanPuppy You can take comfort it's in mine now too.
1315819560864559104 2020-10-13 09:00:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Since I'm Doomer posting, I'll hazard one optimistic prediction - I think Trump will win Florida.
1315818687522373633 2020-10-13 08:56:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @_RichardHall Just pretend it's a BLM rally, just without the fires and random assaults.
1315817936200884226 2020-10-13 08:53:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @NRxPenguin  https://t.co/hh0rsLuP7d
1315817653391458304 2020-10-13 08:52:29 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @trad_art @CriseraW Yes. There is a case that POTUS, if re-elected, will do more directly against it. But he'd have to drag the GOP kicking and screaming. Either way, can't count on it.
1315817350629912578 2020-10-13 08:51:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @NRxPenguin Is it? I would have said the very idea banks would start denying personal checking accounts to people is completely insane and would never happen. But here we are.   If I'm being melodramatic on Twitter Dot Com, so be it. But given the last few years, not so sure.
1315817038347210753 2020-10-13 08:50:03 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @RegularRon Ah yes, I see you also are a man of culture.
1315816850056458241 2020-10-13 08:49:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @MsDeclare Me too.
1315816778967252992 2020-10-13 08:49:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @trad_art @CriseraW Let's say I'm wrong. Completely utterly wrong, Trump wins everything. I've never hoped I'm wrong so badly (not even in '16 at this point).  Still won't protect us from deplatforming, loss of financial services, etc. Those alternatives and networks have to be built now.
1315814156533207041 2020-10-13 08:38:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Twitter will ban Trump's account the day after the election. Then a lot of others.   Too late now. Time to do something about this was 2017-2018. Instead, GOP gave oligarchs tax cuts.   Build structures offline that will allow you to survive when you're cut out of normal economy.
1315813216199602176 2020-10-13 08:34:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Before everyone starts going "the polls are all fake!" look at what this one shows over time. President Trump received a boost and was leading in this poll in March. That was the time to go after China, provide stimulus payments, lead.   Instead, let 'er rip. And now here we are.
1315812555412168704 2020-10-13 08:32:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Solution: more tax cuts for Facebook.
1315802087133937664 2020-10-13 07:50:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I know I've posted this video before but while Republicans say things like "You hurt my feelings," Mongolians are making heavy metal songs about the need to reject modernity and rule the world.    https://t.co/tJT9Cz7TBg
1315792841084370944 2020-10-13 07:13:54 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Ah yes, Revolutionary Communist Party as usual. Journos can't be bothered to search for who is putting out these signs.
1315762263052161025 2020-10-13 05:12:23 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Posted on this earlier so looking forward to this debunking. I want to believe (that this map sucks).
1315725416641040384 2020-10-13 02:45:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @BundleofS On both sides. We have Boomer Democrats thinking Ol' Joe will get "us" working together and Boomer Republicans warning us about socialism and Iran. Both are in for a rude awakening.
1315723805202022402 2020-10-13 02:39:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PhilippusArabus I imagine after the next amnesty the country is done anyway, but a Tucker like figure would be the only one who could maintain civic nationalism and keeping the country together. Assuming that's even worth pursuing.
1315721825322762240 2020-10-13 02:31:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @sandiv11 Here's hoping you are right.
1315721764501106689 2020-10-13 02:31:28 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Vaiv71738794 Fair enough. But I think to really break through, you have to do something truly different. Direct stimulus payments to Americans (not funneled through a program that was riddled with fraud) was the best opportunity. He didn't act on it.
1315721536356200450 2020-10-13 02:30:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "Why do Republicans keep losing all the time?"
1315721232411774976 2020-10-13 02:29:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @sandiv11 @nytimes Not a Dem and want Trump to win. But your complacency isn't helping.   Remember all those "Red Wave" posts back in 2018?
1315719545986965507 2020-10-13 02:22:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The GOP has an unpopular economic agenda. It uses culture wars, nationalism, and anti-Left sentiment to win votes, but never delivers anything but tax cuts for oligarchs, foreign aid, and foreign wars. Trump was supposed to be the cure, but instead he caved to the people he beat.
1315718901498630144 2020-10-13 02:20:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Remember when Steven Crowder basically got chased away by union workers after he tried some Beltway Right talking points about socialism? That's what Trump is doing now when he's talking about the stock market.   Biden's not a socialist, he's a corporate stooge.
1315718446752116737 2020-10-13 02:18:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @GlennLittle5 No argument here. That's why Biden should have been portrayed as a corporate stooge, not a "socialist." Only Conservatism Inc. types think such framing works.
1315717747326816256 2020-10-13 02:15:30 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @fredocuomo0 I don't think undecided voters care that much about the Supreme Court justice. Acting on that to ensure the "True Conservatives" have his back and using economic policy to win independents is the way I'd proceed.
1315717232387911683 2020-10-13 02:13:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It's now mid-October. Biden is more likable than Hillary was. Votes are already being cast. POTUS needs to bring the GOP to heel and push an up and down vote on stimulus check. Bigger than $1,200. Just do it and at least have a shot.  We blow more in pointless wars every year.
1315715999879122944 2020-10-13 02:08:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It's not blackpilling to point out what's actually happening. The absolute worst thing that Trump supporters can do is buy into this myth of complacency. Midwest voters love their country but they need an economic policy that isn't just "let them eat cake."
1315712973755871238 2020-10-13 01:56:32 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @goodforharriers Of course!
1315711036637540363 2020-10-13 01:48:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Turns out those Rust Belt voters didn't really care about moving the embassy or giving the CEO who outsourced their jobs a tax cut.
1315700641508065283 2020-10-13 01:07:32 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Again, all that had to happen was for POTUS to use his GOP majority on infrastructure and more help for the working class, measures that could split the Democrats and move GOP in right direction. Instead, we got tax cuts, no health care plan, and a "go shopping" plan for COVID.
1315698713604632581 2020-10-13 00:59:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Yes, thank you @NATO for reminding Americans that we are treaty bound to fight for Erdogan's Turkey, which is even now supplying weapons and jihadists against Armenia so they can finish the job of genocide.   Dissolve this wretched alliance for good. #SupportArmenia
1315696016138567680 2020-10-13 00:49:09 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> When President Trump proposed $500 BILLION for black Americans, GOP said "fine." But when it comes to sending direct payments to all Americans (including blacks of course), they put up a stone wall. Anything that might help their actual voters, they oppose.
1315695664496603137 2020-10-13 00:47:45 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @BillAdelberger @RobertsAmRen Changing demographics are obviously the critical factor over the long term. However, the loss in white support is also catastrophic for this cycle.
1315695301571817484 2020-10-13 00:46:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If President Trump was an authoritarian nationalist, he'd be easily winning this election. Instead, he's probably going to lose to a senile man who can barely remember where he is. Trump isn't losing because he's Trump. It's because he's too much of a classical liberal. (6)
1315694793775878147 2020-10-13 00:44:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> And now, we see the final catastrophe. President Trump wants direct aid to Americans, something he should have been doing all along. But suddenly, GOP Senate now worries about cost. The point is to lose so they can go back to fretting about budget deficits and foreign wars. (5)
1315694509754388481 2020-10-13 00:43:10 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Now, you have a situation where seniors have turned on Trump. White women (especially college-educated) have turned on him because TV says he's mean. There's little independent media, because Big Tech deplatformed them (to relief of Conservative Inc., which hates competition. (4)
1315694197798731776 2020-10-13 00:41:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> One group which actually was in real danger from the pandemic was seniors. Knowing the media was biased, Trump should have put protecting them at the center of their strategy. He didn't. It's true Cuomo's strategy was disastrous. But he has media on his side, so he's popular (3)
1315693907406094342 2020-10-13 00:40:46 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Post-Americans don't want liberty at the expense of safety. They want (and in truth, probably need) government to make decisions for them. If Trump was an actual authoritarian, he would have imposed sweeping lockdowns, a mask mandate, and UBI for the duration (2)
1315693528454922245 2020-10-13 00:39:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump, who is a germophobe, chose liberty, freedom of choice, and hope. He put money behind vaccines and cures and tried to keep the economy going.   This was the wrong strategy (1)
1315687513785331715 2020-10-13 00:15:22 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @projektinsane It's much worse in Scotland than it is here.
1315681339950141441 2020-10-12 23:50:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> In retrospect, decolonization was completely pointless. It's extremely tiresome seeing Brahmins lecture us about the evils of colonization when the first thing their families did after the end of the Raj was leave India as fast as possible.
1315680885744766976 2020-10-12 23:49:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I don't think they "love" him for refusing to answer questions. They are all on the same team. If Biden accidentally answered a question, the journos would team up to suppress the answer and try to get whoever asked it fired.
1315679710500847618 2020-10-12 23:44:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "Go back to Europe colonizer!"  I think a lot of European-Americans would take that deal, provided non-Europeans didn't follow us. But of course, they would. Look at what happened after France pulled out of Algeria. Didn't stop anything.
1315677320175329285 2020-10-12 23:34:51 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> We need to support the rights of Indigenous Peoples all around the world. That's why I believe all non-whites must be expelled from Europe so that its natives can live in security and peace. #IndigenousPeoplesDay #ColumbusDay
1315497766320246784 2020-10-12 11:41:22 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @DavidSharp84 Not that I know of.
1315494646278168582 2020-10-12 11:28:59 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It won't even be a story. What would they say? "Journos allegedly hire random antifa to kill Trump supporter." They aren't going to publish anything against themselves.
1315472192621228034 2020-10-12 09:59:45 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @LDF120 Testament to value of platform control. Which of course, POTUS did nothing about except "monitor." Hearing good things lately, but too little, too late.
1315472031278923776 2020-10-12 09:59:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @klever_garcia I thought the GOP consultant memes were bad, but this is worse.
1315438112890327046 2020-10-12 07:44:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I mean I suppose we should be glad that journos are skipping the "wink, nod" approach to getting people killed and just subcontracting it directly. At least it is more honest.
1315435455471591425 2020-10-12 07:33:46 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @VacationRonin @emeriticus @JackPosobiec The Caudillo we need.
1315424799175385090 2020-10-12 06:51:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> And yet, the entire GOP is built upon giving those with college degrees (i.e. higher income whites) tax cuts, at the expense of all other priorities.
1315372647933521926 2020-10-12 03:24:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> No way around it, crushing loss of support for FPO, though we can assume some of that went to the OVP.
1315363666355728387 2020-10-12 02:48:30 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "Trust the scientists."  "No, not that scientist."
1315363531508912134 2020-10-12 02:47:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> American journos, in contrast, will tell us this isn't happening.
1315361132257906688 2020-10-12 02:38:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> No more brothers' wars.
1315341837134163968 2020-10-12 01:21:46 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The only possible explanation for the GOP Senate suddenly deciding they won't support a stimulus before the election (despite spending record amounts over last few years) is that they want to throw this thing and they want Trump out.
1314764620968714242 2020-10-10 11:08:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @XSenJ11 No, I think typical Republicans rather lose and be respectable than win and have the kind of reputation Trump has with journalists, academia, and urban elites.
1314764294794379264 2020-10-10 11:06:49 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The Right needs to start using Modern Monetary Theory.  Print the money, send the checks, rule. Make it happen @realDonaldTrump
1314762342455009280 2020-10-10 10:59:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @WellSetBanana @mcclure_phil The Balding Grifters
1314761821899943944 2020-10-10 10:57:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @XSenJ11 Not so. Just making the point that to GOP politicians, staying in office isn't their highest priority. Whether Trump falls in that category is unclear. I think he wants to win but was naive and was over his head.
1314693347202805760 2020-10-10 06:24:54 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Notice that the GOP is firmly resisting President Trump's call for COVID stimulus. Again, the point is to lose. Then Con Inc. can get back to fretting about budget deficits.
1314653175949844481 2020-10-10 03:45:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I thought Republican "outreach" was embarrassing and condescending, but this is much worse.
1314635507830337539 2020-10-10 02:35:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> We should nationalize big tech, tax the oligarchs into oblivion, and throw anyone who hires illegals into prison.   That's the Right now. Deal with it @chrislhayes
1314631681979158534 2020-10-10 02:19:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Don't worry, Sinn Fein is still seething about Anglos and supports more Third World immigration. So these "gangs" have nothing to worry about.   Amazing how a party whose very name means "Ourselves" has been transformed into just another "import the world" Establishment party.
1314626436490317824 2020-10-10 01:59:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Nothing to see here, move along.
1314626369679167488 2020-10-10 01:58:45 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The Republic of Flanders must become a reality.

1314599305764798464 2020-10-10 00:11:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This will be extremely interesting. I don't think Tucker will do the usual "you are so great, everything you've done is wonderful." Definitely will make time to watch this.
1314595146957164544 2020-10-09 23:54:41 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Future of war here. Swarms of drones. Going to be nightmarish if China/USA stumble into the Thucydides trap.
1314592988815908865 2020-10-09 23:46:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Again, GOP apparatchiks seek defeat. They want to go back to the 2012 party. Which will lose of course, but a few can do a term or two lecturing us about the deficit, then move on to a corporate lobbying job. Which is the real goal.  We need a Third Force.

1314395590042755072 2020-10-09 10:41:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @CaribouXLou Dawn of the Dead intro vibes.
1314394355113889792 2020-10-09 10:36:49 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> That's it, I'm out of here.
1314389647531945984 2020-10-09 10:18:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Well, we aren't free, so it doesn't apply anymore.
1314387717057376256 2020-10-09 10:10:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @eronian Right. This is also why I don't support free speech merely as a tactic. I support free political speech, full stop. If we have that, we win.
1314377198606995457 2020-10-09 09:28:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @bl4nk___ @realDonaldTrump That would be best move.
1314376560783306758 2020-10-09 09:26:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @LEGOgroyper @NS227172887 Many such cases
1314376207539089409 2020-10-09 09:24:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> There's an election in less than a month and there's a GOP Senate.   Wouldn't it make more sense to have an up or down vote on a $1200 check for every citizen like @realDonaldTrump suggested?
1314375580826112000 2020-10-09 09:22:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This is why platform control is all important. Truth depends on a multitude of independent outlets, which is why the Left must censor in order to win. In contrast, I'm confident that just about any space which allows free speech without fear of retaliation will go "far right."
1314374890200485893 2020-10-09 09:19:28 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I will make sure to patronize any such businesses, not because I actually think they are "racist," but because these cowardly Stasi must be resisted at every turn.

1314328009516691457 2020-10-09 06:13:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "Trump is not your friend dude."  "Everyone who works for government is your enemy dude."  Ah yes, seamless overlap with all those Republicans with Blue Lives Matter flags outside their houses.

1314307016270196736 2020-10-09 04:49:45 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @hardknockoptics Because their imaginary celebrity and TV friends say it's ok.
1314306933860585474 2020-10-09 04:49:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Agreeing with David French for the wrong reasons - Platform control is everything.
1314306468515061765 2020-10-09 04:47:35 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Oh they will. They'll vote the same way. Or they'll move away and vote for the same policies.   Cthulu swims left. It's just pure entropy and it's going to have to run its course.
1314302001057013762 2020-10-09 04:29:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @sotallytober69 @GoodwinMJ No. Biden's lead is more than four points higher nationally at this point. And there are fewer undecided voters.
1314300826194714633 2020-10-09 04:25:10 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> He knows the journos will run interference for him, so why not do this? Remember, one journo literally had a photo of Obama smiling and posing with Louis Farrakhan and said "well, I'll conceal this because it might hurt him."   Journalism isn't a profession, it's a tactic.
1314298500662910983 2020-10-09 04:15:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @StarFox6441 American politics makes perfect sense when you realize journalists as a class are the ones who constitute the American Left. The politicians are essentially interchangeable and follow their lead.
1314296281083383814 2020-10-09 04:07:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> lol no, they're cheering it on. If Biden or Harris accidentally answered, they'd conceal it.
1314293067193741312 2020-10-09 03:54:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> AJAB
1314233707851644928 2020-10-08 23:58:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The only thing @realDonaldTrump should talk about from here on out is a direct stimulus payment. In fact, he should just order them sent out, using any money already allocated to executive branch. Dare courts and Congress to stop him. Either that or suspend enforcing taxes.
1314067023681466368 2020-10-08 12:56:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Go321D @mtracey Not really, at least during primaries.
1314061941921525762 2020-10-08 12:35:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @MarkRuffalo @KamalaHarris Yes, we get it, we need to apply affirmative action to debates too.
1314061539020812288 2020-10-08 12:34:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Which is a problem because she'd be the real president.
1314044146890539010 2020-10-08 11:25:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @JosephRoss1776 If you wanted to go that route, $7 trillion in tax cuts would be an awful lot more money in Americans' pockets. Think a lot fewer people would be living month to month.
1314042991636602880 2020-10-08 11:20:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The human and financial capital wasted in Afghanistan and Iraq is enraging to think about. Whatever your cause - universal health care, space exploration, UBI, border security - all of it sacrificed for nothing.   And Harris brags about support from George W. Bush's cabinet.
1314042041354129410 2020-10-08 11:16:51 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Biden and Harris really do hold their base in utter contempt.   Almost as much as Republicans hold theirs.
1314029311167528963 2020-10-08 10:26:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The fly was a psyop.
1314024897471971333 2020-10-08 10:08:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> VP debates normally don't matter, except when the entire country knows that Kamala Harris is the real Democratic nominee.

1313913612864557058 2020-10-08 02:46:31 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @mart_chaz Oh that's certain. I think some brave Republican should introduce a bill to rename Washington now, not because Washington is bad, but because his ashes are worth more than the actually existing city. It disgraces his memory to be associated with this System.
1313912633695838209 2020-10-08 02:42:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @allidoisgetpaid Yes, but once GOP is no longer competitive, not sure why donors would give. Better to give to neoliberal/neocon wing of Democrats (exemplified by Biden) who will actually wield power.

1313910626750791684 2020-10-08 02:34:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @realDonaldTrump No one cares, start sending out checks and dare the courts or Democrats to stop you.
1313910413977948161 2020-10-08 02:33:48 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @AdrienneM5 True, but I think a more Peronist type approach could win at least a good chunk of white and Hispanic working class voters.
1313908945254322177 2020-10-08 02:27:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @CaribouXLou same. There is a bright side to a GOP defeat in that we can get serious about building a Third Force rather than the current halfway-in relationship to the Republicans and the conservative movement.
1313908433062711297 2020-10-08 02:25:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If Trump loses, GOP will learn exactly wrong lessons. They will double down on extremely unpopular GOP economic agenda of upper class tax cuts, slashing entitlements, and opposing more money for health care. When they lose again, it will still be Trump's fault.
1313907293868744704 2020-10-08 02:21:24 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> What just about everyone, Republican or Democrat, agrees on is that we need another direct stimulus payment.   So of course it won't happen.
1313894635593441285 2020-10-08 01:31:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @ThorinReynolds Very interesting concept. If you have any sources, papers, books etc that go into it, let me know.
1313894340125745158 2020-10-08 01:29:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> 100 percent tax on "entertainment" industry immediately.

1313884736625012737 2020-10-08 00:51:46 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @DanielleSavoy Should actually do it.
1313883370976423938 2020-10-08 00:46:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Oddly enough, the "Christian Right" is virtually silent about this conflict. The Regime in Washington D.C. has presided over the almost wholesale destruction of Christian communities in the East.   Suppose it's left to my newest group, "Pagans for the Liberation of Armenia."
1313882246298955776 2020-10-08 00:41:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> UPDATE: Of course it wasn't.

1313878556557152256 2020-10-08 00:27:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Lemuet_ Basically during WWI, you had a bunch of different nationalities fighting a war but had nothing in common, including language. So morale sucked, entire groups surrendered, and eventually the entire state fell apart because there was nothing holding them together.
1313877749195591682 2020-10-08 00:24:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I see we are going with the Austria-Hungary approach for military organization. Should work out fine.
1313877389055795202 2020-10-08 00:22:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @CottoGottfried Question from a pessimist @CottoGottfried . Do you still think Trump can pull this off? It seems to me like he's on defense in all his must win states, and still needs to capture one of the Rust Belt states to bring this home. And he needs to deliver on stimulus, not just tweet.
1313871390798422019 2020-10-07 23:58:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Another great moment for "True Conservatism"

1313870246533632000 2020-10-07 23:54:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I'm a doomerist on the election and think it is basically over because Trump simply refuses to act.    https://t.co/cBMTuwgtDO  However, follow @CottoGottfried for more optimistic analysis.
1313869434902245378 2020-10-07 23:50:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This propaganda is laughably crude, especially given the almost nightly riots cities are dealing with across the country. Again, journos know this, they know they are lying, and they are laughing at the naive Boomers who buy this tripe.   AJAB

1313713780321288197 2020-10-07 13:32:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Good night everyone!
1313712692780204033 2020-10-07 13:28:08 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Biden’s speech also had an ominous undertone. It consisted of almost Simpsons-level cliches about being “united”—except when he began using eliminationist rhetoric about giving “no license” to “hate.”  Who defines hate?   https://t.co/cBMTuwgtDO
1313712196157874176 2020-10-07 13:26:09 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I also believe your genetic inheritance is more important than your passport.
1313702802414342145 2020-10-07 12:48:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @realDonaldTrump @MarkMeadows @senatemajldr @kevinomccarthy @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Just do it. No legislation. Just do it.
1313701646527070214 2020-10-07 12:44:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> yes
1313700511779086336 2020-10-07 12:39:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Earlier today, I tweeted that Trump lost the election when he torpedoed the stimulus.   He's since changed.   If he focuses everything on direct stimulus payments to Americans (hopefully above $1200), he can win.   It's Caudillo time. -  https://t.co/cBMTuwgtDO
1313686297970708480 2020-10-07 11:43:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Needless to say, Pence needs to just hammer away on direct stimulus payments tomorrow. Demand a vote. Ignore all questions and just keep bringing that point home again and again.
1313685427233206275 2020-10-07 11:39:47 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Somehow I don't think these were the "armed militias" Biden was so upset about today.   Oh that's right Biden gave a speech. Already, no one cares.
1313683555508248577 2020-10-07 11:32:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "The only thing that can oppose such an all-encompassing regime: strong personal leadership, an American Caesar. This is what many people thought they were getting with President Trump in 2016, which is why the 'God-Emperor' memes were only semi-joking."   https://t.co/cBMTuwgtDO
1313683178335473664 2020-10-07 11:30:51 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @AF_Brooklynite Well, if they kick in my door for Unauthorized Memes then I won't have to watch.

I will be sure to listen to the man whose failures, by your own admission, put us in an unnecessary war and killed hundreds of thousands.

1313670613328896001 2020-10-07 10:40:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @fredocuomo0 The unanswerable question is whether this is "Haha, 4-D chess, Just as Planned" or "Oh crap, everyone's going nuts and the market just tanked, time to pivot fast." Either way, always makes sense to speak up.
1313665505509732352 2020-10-07 10:20:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Koondey1 I am very, very happy to be wrong. But let's see if he can pull it off.
1313665326886850560 2020-10-07 10:19:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Pardon Assange, pardon Snowden, declassify it all.
1313664933159219201 2020-10-07 10:18:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It's remarkable watching the transformation among the exact same people who were screaming during the Bush years about the CIA lying us into war. They were right then. But now, only the CIA can save us.   The Iraq War should have led to massive reforms, if not abolition.
1313637821735940096 2020-10-07 08:30:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @jadedWestern @PatriotZoomer President Trump has spoken in the past about using money from the last COVID bill that wasn't distributed.
1313628462356336640 2020-10-07 07:53:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @EmmerichErin @HBatakus The problem is that Trump says enough to rile up the enemy, but not enough to crush them.   I just don't see what alternative is (aside from offline IRL organizing, running in local areas etc) and don't think Biden victory = better leader. It might, or it might get worse.
1313628148936962048 2020-10-07 07:52:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PIMPisme I hope so.
1313626982635237378 2020-10-07 07:47:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @EmmerichErin @HBatakus No dragon energy garbage. There's a pattern here. Trump tests things. If he gets backlash, he often reverses. That's why it's important to speak out. And no, I'm not voting Biden or staying home or whatever else.
1313625965134778370 2020-10-07 07:43:30 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Koondey1 I award you one follow for your allusion to classical literature.
1313625864928661511 2020-10-07 07:43:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @NYTDaniel @dpinsen @jcbonthedl That's the point unless there is a straight alternative he is pushing. Or he just stops collecting taxes, does an EO and dares someone to sue, etc. Time for Jacksonian politics.
1313625579221123075 2020-10-07 07:41:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Psammead5 Obviously supporting the bosses and cheap labor.
1313625519762608128 2020-10-07 07:41:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Koondey1 Yes but can these talking points get through media? I'd like to see him challenge Pelosi to straight up and down vote on just stimulus.
1313625306629103616 2020-10-07 07:40:53 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @LiveHonorably @realDonaldTrump Fair enough. Let me make my position clear. VDARE cannot endorse candidates or legislation. I, in my private capacity, will not vote for Biden. I might consider voting 3rd party if there was a populist right candidate, but there is none. Thus, voting Trump.
1313624153891778560 2020-10-07 07:36:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Huh, I wonder what this Workingmen's Party of California was all about.
1313623502130499590 2020-10-07 07:33:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @LiveHonorably @realDonaldTrump What? No, I'm saying it's important to push back when President Trump does stupid things. The bigger danger to his re-election comes from complacency and overconfidence, not defeatism.   Furthermore, whether he wins or loses, we still have to act, not just hope we're saved.
1313622075001757698 2020-10-07 07:28:03 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @dpinsen @jcbonthedl Noted. But again, it is about the messaging.
1313607941380026371 2020-10-07 06:31:53 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Shameful that it is the Democrats who are the ones exposing these companies. Big Tech ruthlessly censors and deplatforms conservatives, but GOP will defend them.
1313593599775444994 2020-10-07 05:34:54 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @3Positionist Hope you are right.
1313593569207291904 2020-10-07 05:34:46 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @nnanco179 No argument here.
1313586552551993346 2020-10-07 05:06:54 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @nnanco179 I like to think mine is too. Best of luck to you sir.
1313585090832683008 2020-10-07 05:01:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @nnanco179 I'm sorry you feel that way. If you have a different approach, I hope you meet with success, as that will benefit all of us.
1313583979157753856 2020-10-07 04:56:40 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @nnanco179 Let's hope you are right.
1313583727507918849 2020-10-07 04:55:40 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @HanmerWell @eronian Push him to go back and reframe.
1313583374955675648 2020-10-07 04:54:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @nnanco179 Except for the part about not negotiating anything, yes.
1313581764653219840 2020-10-07 04:47:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @nnanco179 Pushback isn't blackpilling. Saying this is secretly 34-D chess and a brilliant move is far worse than forceful criticism designed to push change.  And judging from reaction, most of American populist Right agrees with me on this issue.
1313578333620375555 2020-10-07 04:34:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Just do the opposite of what everyone in this thread suggests and you would be in power forever.
1313576681064607747 2020-10-07 04:27:40 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Once again, the fate of the Republic hinges on whether Tucker Carlson can convince @realDonaldTrump to stop doing obviously stupid things.
1313570766823325698 2020-10-07 04:04:10 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If only President Trump's "authoritarianism" extended to using state power to benefit people who might vote for him instead of complaining that journos aren't fair.
1313569791232348165 2020-10-07 04:00:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @jacecaudwell A lot of people don't understand what is at stake. They just know they need money. Besides, POTUS already promised $500 billion for blacks... but somehow, we can't afford stimulus payments now.
1313568450388856833 2020-10-07 03:54:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr You just demoralized your supporters and lost the election.   Force an up-and-down vote on direct stimulus or just send the money and dare Congress to stop you.   You hold to this position, you lose by double digits.
1313566998866132995 2020-10-07 03:49:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Losing the election to own the libs.
1313565583741460482 2020-10-07 03:43:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @terrorhousemag If he doesn't reverse course on this, then yes.   This isn't "blackpilling" it's pushing back against a stupid and self-defeating move.
1313565171890221057 2020-10-07 03:41:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @AdamJLowy I'm rapidly running out of drywall to put my fist through.
1313564726337712130 2020-10-07 03:40:10 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Up and down vote on direct stimulus. That's it. Call a presidential address, force an up or down vote. Do it via executive order and dare Congress to stop you. But this idiotic complacency is so stupid that the most likely explanation is that POTUS and GOP truly want to lose.
1313564386439634947 2020-10-07 03:38:49 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I suspect what will happen is he (or his campaign managers) will look at the reaction, go "oh crap," come crawling back, and then say "haha, it was just the Art of the Deal"
1313563587869388801 2020-10-07 03:35:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It's not hard. Pro-worker economics, nationalism on culture, cultivate strength, power, and solidarity.   Instead the American Right is "sacrifice yourself to give tax cuts to oligarchs who hate you."
1313563075744854016 2020-10-07 03:33:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @J1jonesJones He needs to at least try to say we want an up and down vote on direct stimulus. Give a presidential address - make them vote on that one thing, which both sides agree on.   Instead, we get "economy's fine and I'm winning." Just unfathomably stupid.
1313562231368450048 2020-10-07 03:30:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> When it's over, GOP will tell us it was because we weren't "fiscally conservative" enough.   Unless this is some unbelievable headfake, it is done.
1313560668797390850 2020-10-07 03:24:02 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @J1jonesJones No, but a lot of the Rust Belt voters he needs are.
1313558950600679425 2020-10-07 03:17:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @DarrenJBeattie Well, even the stock market is tanking now.
1313558758040231938 2020-10-07 03:16:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> President Trump has 500 billion for reparations-lite for African-Americans, who support him at 3 percent.   But suddenly, he's a fiscal conservative when it's time to bail out American citizens as a whole.   Unless this changes, the election's done and it won't even be close.
1313555755681931264 2020-10-07 03:04:31 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Pinning this now. It is done. No stimulus, no working class turnout for Trump and the stock market just tanked.   At least with Democratic government we might get a check or two before they start banning everything.
1313554931245252609 2020-10-07 03:01:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Koondey1 Yeah well they are about to get much larger sums of money once Democrats take House, Senate, and White House.
1313554804090777601 2020-10-07 03:00:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @NationalistTV It's over.
1313554541435138048 2020-10-07 02:59:41 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @OakenOdyssey Trump idiotically said no stimulus till after election. It is completely done imo. Get ready for united blue government.
1313553476589367303 2020-10-07 02:55:28 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand there goes the stock market. Great work Republicans.
1313545472477466624 2020-10-07 02:23:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @JoeBiden Fine, abolish affirmative action, i.e. government mandated racial preferences.

1313544137233387522 2020-10-07 02:18:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Canadian military propaganda versus Russia's. Self-hatred versus identity and strength.   Weak horse versus strong horse. You decide what you want.    https://t.co/iBd1DFdJy5
1313543136489209856 2020-10-07 02:14:22 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @MotherRobinson3 They would never come close to winning. GOP is done unless it adjusts. At that point, must form third party and start thinking about other solutions - redrawing state lines, pushing new programs, and possibly even secession.
1313542446031175680 2020-10-07 02:11:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> One cannot overemphasize this. Trump ran as a heterodox candidate and governed as a normal Republican, with rare exceptions. However, the Conservative Inc. program is extremely unpopular among the people, even Republicans. Need something new, but Con Inc. won't let that happen.
1313539914433277952 2020-10-07 02:01:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @MugabeJonathan @evelyn_waugh1 I will do my part.
1313534679644069889 2020-10-07 01:40:46 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @GreatKingOfCats Very good point. Remember Republicans confidently predicting victory in 2012 and getting stomped.
1313533660340027394 2020-10-07 01:36:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @evelyn_waugh1 possible.

1313533310510018562 2020-10-07 01:35:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If Donald Trump actually did govern like Abraham Lincoln, he'd deport seditious journalists, shut down more than 300 newspapers, use federal troops to occupy hostile state legislatures, suspend habeas corpus, and plan to send blacks to Africa.
1313532740915073027 2020-10-07 01:33:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Don't worry guys, there won't be any negative consequences to the entire media and Democratic party (same thing) making it impossible to have peaceful relations with Russia.   If it comes, draft the journos. It's their war, not ours.
1313532344456876034 2020-10-07 01:31:29 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Is this... is this supposed to be an attack ad? This is awesome.
1313531990340141062 2020-10-07 01:30:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I don't understand why leftists are thinking this is some great triumph. Trump must win every state he won in 16. He wouldn't pull these ads unless his campaign thought he had them won. The only other explanations are that there's no money or they've just given up.
1313496256715665408 2020-10-06 23:08:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The propaganda from the mainstream media is far more disconnected from reality than anything East Germany ever produced.
1313493743971033095 2020-10-06 22:58:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @groyper_boston You are more optimistic than I. But then, @peterbrimelow always mocks me for my pessimism. So hopefully my nightmare vision goggles are just wrong.
1313493562529591298 2020-10-06 22:57:23 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Get guns and ammunition seized by the police once they define certain beliefs as grounds for acting under red flag laws.   Guns are a cope. We're not free. I value the Second Amendment, but this fight is in media and courts. Some giant private arsenal won't do much good.
1313492830128672778 2020-10-06 22:54:28 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @groyper_boston Fair enough. Again, I'm not coming from a place of "all is lost!" I'm saying people should always assume they are behind and work hard.
1313492697987141633 2020-10-06 22:53:57 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @groyper_boston Well, just to take one example, I think there will be a push for amnesty for illegal immigrants regardless of who wins.
1313491184371855372 2020-10-06 22:47:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @groyper_boston I don't think he will. I think our actions in short term don't change either way.   That said, yes, I want him to win. I'm not doomposting. If anything, I'm stunned by the overconfidence and lack of urgency. Reminds me of 2018. I want people to work harder.
1313490839247761408 2020-10-06 22:46:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "To overcome the health crisis, we must learn to live with the virus." President Trump, bearing crazy and irresponsible? No, French President Emmanuel Macron in late August. Same people freaking out about Trump silent about this.    https://t.co/IaO98Z5a63
1313490275482906624 2020-10-06 22:44:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @JRRecGLR Trust me, I would love to be wrong.
1313489769444319233 2020-10-06 22:42:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Stop what you're doing and read this.
1313489318254727171 2020-10-06 22:40:31 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> We will certainly face more state persecution. But that may be coming anyway. Everyone must internalize the idea that no one is coming. It's up to us. It's going to be bad but the larger trends look good. I'm excited. The harder the struggle, the more glorious the triumph. 2/2
1313488582980636674 2020-10-06 22:37:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If Biden wins, nothing is "over." In fact, nothing really changes in terms of what we have to do. There are benefits as well as costs if POTUS loses, because you will have a vast number of people who (accurately) will see the system as utterly rigged. 1/2
1313488149579026434 2020-10-06 22:35:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "Admirable, but mistaken."  Our forefathers took on the most powerful empire in the world because of a minor tax. The consumer blobs on this continent are not worthy of those men. They want to be coddled.  Choose fear, not hope. Under this system, that's what will work.
1313487384248487936 2020-10-06 22:32:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @middott1 His polls initially went up when the virus hit. If he had addressed it full bore, he'd be utterly cruising to re-election. Not even close.
1313486935957086211 2020-10-06 22:31:03 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @breddy_gud Maybe. I think it is too early to say something like that.
1313486674387759104 2020-10-06 22:30:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @breddy_gud All he had to do was promise not to cut entitlements, take the COVID-19 thing seriously (appeal to fear, not hope), and paint Biden as what he is, a corporate fraud.   Instead, messaging is utterly incoherent. KAG vs MAGA, COVID is serious vs COVID is nothing.
1313485931584909313 2020-10-06 22:27:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @breddy_gud yes. At this point, I think that's almost certain.
1313483201868857346 2020-10-06 22:16:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Hot take: Biden is running a good campaign. Has media do the work for him. Mildly distancing himself from hard left (not doing anything to really get in their way of course.) Lets goofy naive whites vote for Ol' Joe in the hope things will get back to "normal."
1313482781012393984 2020-10-06 22:14:32 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Still no real message from the campaign. Now we're back to "go out and shop it's fine."
1313482288538288130 2020-10-06 22:12:35 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The "it's not a big deal" and "my opponent is old" arguments aren't helping among older voters.  Should be emphasizing safety and security.

1313319105030770695 2020-10-06 11:24:09 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @themindofmurray @Haunted_Backlog True enough. State polls are all that matter.
1313318883219181568 2020-10-06 11:23:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @StarFox6441 @themindofmurray @Haunted_Backlog Yes, they are going to be looking at those states a lot more carefully.   That said, if we see a sudden "polls tighten" 10 days away, then we know this was just to gaslight people into defeatism.
1313318319475359744 2020-10-06 11:21:02 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @themindofmurray @Haunted_Backlog That last prediction was off by 1.5 percent in popular vote. Biden's lead is much larger.
1313313031938625537 2020-10-06 11:00:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @lavrvsnovilis Hillary was uniquely unlikable. Biden isn't. That may be enough.
1313312055643045888 2020-10-06 10:56:08 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Haunted_Backlog I don't think it was that far off nationally.
1313311548589453317 2020-10-06 10:54:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Obviously, I'm hoping for the former, because AJAB
1313311357895352324 2020-10-06 10:53:22 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Either the polls are utterly, completely, totally wrong, wrong to the point the entire industry must be shuttered, wrong to the point where every single journo must never show their face again, or Biden is cruising to an easy victory.
1313308801882370048 2020-10-06 10:43:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @DolioJ That's the point. I don't understand why people are enraged at him doing this.
1313302473373777921 2020-10-06 10:18:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If Barack Obama was sick and Walter Reed treated him successfully, no one, not even his worst political enemies, would be saying "My God, this institution is in tatters."
1313301206090100736 2020-10-06 10:13:02 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @The_populus666 @SelimSeesYou Could be part of it. His policies weren't some dramatic change.
1313301019409944576 2020-10-06 10:12:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Turns out when hospitals successfully treat patients, it means it's a bad hospital.
1313300583743393792 2020-10-06 10:10:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> He's preparing to salute the Marines who flew him back to the White House. That's it. That's literally all he's doing.

1313280924944084994 2020-10-06 08:52:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Judging from the media coverage, the American Social Republic was just proclaimed. So I'll go to bed, wake me up if anything else happens.

1313278111212089344 2020-10-06 08:41:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Mussolini stood on a balcony. President Trump stood on a balcony. Therefore, Trump is Mussolini. QED

1313277746815160320 2020-10-06 08:39:49 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> How dare the president show respect to the people who flew him back to the White House.
1313277688900132864 2020-10-06 08:39:35 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Ah yes, every doctor and nurse at Walter Reed is in on a plot to help President Trump's campaign for some reason.
1313203137872830464 2020-10-06 03:43:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If we actually wanted Americans to live longer and healthier lives (and have a better chance of beating things like COVID), we'd be urging physical fitness, banning garbage food, and encouraging a culture of vitality and power.   But that would be body shaming. So we won't.
1313202748586962944 2020-10-06 03:41:48 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The virus is real and dangerous. You don't want to get it and few will get the treatment POTUS received. But it's also not the Black Death or an existential threat. In politics, even this level of nuance is too much. You have to make things simple in black and white terms.
1313202491140509703 2020-10-06 03:40:46 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> A real authoritarian would be championing safety and security. Post-Americans don't want liberty. They want someone to protect them from whatever the TV says is scary.
1312875556740960257 2020-10-05 06:01:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PIMPisme I certainly will in regards to election predictions. You might just be more of an optimist than me. I'm just reminded of 2018.   But again, like I said, it's certainly not over, even if you buy the polls.
1312869372143300608 2020-10-05 05:37:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I think the polls are mostly accurate and deplatforming of independent media hurt Trump a great deal. That said, Trump is 0.6 above in battleground states where he was at this point in 2016. He's behind, but it's not over. Biden favorability way higher than Hillary though.
1312853354540867584 2020-10-05 04:33:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This reflects nothing so much as the power of platform control.

1311855337650237440 2020-10-02 10:27:40 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @dpinsen No. I think GOP counter proposal should just be an up and down vote on a direct stimulus bill for Americans (endorsed by the White House and Senate) and run on that. Increase it to $2,400 per American. I think trying to be subtle about this isn't going to break through media.
1311848723731877890 2020-10-02 10:01:23 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> No coronavirus stimulus package without direct payments to Americans, Trump loses and it won't be close. GOP is opposing this because suddenly it cares about the deficit.   That said, doesn't change much imo. What must be done is the same regardless of who is in White House.
1311839982617792513 2020-10-02 09:26:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I'm glad to see people supporting my proposed rule that we skip the elections and have a consortium of journalists, tech oligarchs, and political police select the regime's next figurehead. Save us all a lot of trouble.
1311690074871001088 2020-10-01 23:30:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The people wailing about "the threat to democracy" have already given up on democracy. They want to have information controlled, platforms denied to dissidents, and an exclusive claim over what is "disinformation" and what's not. Russia has more real freedom.
1311673331456897026 2020-10-01 22:24:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Brought to you by the same people screaming that POTUS is a threat to democracy.
1311522562380304388 2020-10-01 12:25:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It took an "investigation" to figure this out?
1311507268098306050 2020-10-01 11:24:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> What's amazing about POTUS is despite all the screwups, weakness, and incompetence and the all but monolithic media opposition to him... it's still relatively close. I still say he'd win tomorrow if he went all in economic populism. The ruling class is fragile.
1311505622672826368 2020-10-01 11:18:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @CaribouXLou Latin America or Eastern Europe. I mean, it could be turned around here with just a small group of people. And groups exist. It's just a question of what kinds of sacrifices people are willing to make in terms of relocating, economic sacrifices, etc.
1311504208974282752 2020-10-01 11:12:24 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @CaribouXLou Probably, though USA is bad about taxing income of expats. Not as easy as it is for other places.

When something is anti-white, you have to identify it as such. When some new stupid moral panic is invented, you have to laugh at it. If you don't, trust me, it's just going to get worse. 2/2
1311503503429435392 2020-10-01 11:09:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Whatever line you think will never be crossed will be crossed. BLM riots and journos blame Proud Boys. People gunned down and we're talking about Charlottesville. There's no limit to what could happen, there's no "back against the wall" moment, no point when people "wake up." 1/2
1311502619857354752 2020-10-01 11:06:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Taxpayer money used to force people to sit through comically anti-white struggle sessions. POTUS says "hey, stop this." Now journos complain he has an "obsession."  Another classic example of "this isn't happening and it's good that it is."

1311388493508210689 2020-10-01 03:32:35 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Yes, the vote will be illegitimate. The whole system is illegitimate. Law is subjective and the American people are being replaced by dependents. Leftists want reliable votes, "conservatives" want cheap labor.  Why do we have to accept this? It's a hostile occupation.
1311387990267252737 2020-10-01 03:30:35 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Think how often you receive mail for someone who doesn't live there. I occasionally get mail for people who lived there even before the previous occupant. And it's not junk mail - bank statements, letters from gov't, etc.   That's what's happening with vote by mail.
1311386237471780870 2020-10-01 03:23:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @WolfNationalist @realDonaldTrump @joerogan The hottest take is Biden is running a good campaign by not campaigning. He mutters about disowning the far Left, without doing anything. So old white Boomers can think Ol' Joe will bring things back to "normal." They will get a rude awakening, but then it will be too late.
1311378015604088832 2020-10-01 02:50:57 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I would add that what I think the movement needs to do is completely independent of who wins or loses the presidential election. Our fate is not dependent on it. We will face different challenges depending on who wins, but no one is coming to save us from above. It's up to us.
1311377578322808832 2020-10-01 02:49:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Bottom line is that @realDonaldTrump is losing this election right now. He needs to do something to shake it up, not continue to embrace this complacency. Going on @joerogan would be a good first step.

1311080127003066373 2020-09-30 07:07:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Can't think of a single journo who follows these rules today. But then, the very concept that "journalism" is a profession, rather than a tactic for achieving political ends, was always thin.
1311078709395361792 2020-09-30 07:01:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PacificIsland17 "At least we moved the embassy. "
1310975715534397440 2020-09-30 00:12:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @groyper_boston No I know he's not going to lose North Dakota. My point is that he should be winning it by much more, and that the relative decline in support compared to 2016 shows serious weakness among northern Whites. And needs those people to win in the Midwest and win the election.
1310973479290839041 2020-09-30 00:03:28 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If this is how it is going to be, skip the elections. Just have the heads of the tech companies determine the winner. Journalists, academics, most politicians and rank and file Democrats all agree people can't be trusted to make up their own mind. So skip the pretense of voting.
1310973021906235398 2020-09-30 00:01:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Reminder that POTUS is ready to spend $500 billion for blacks specifically and in response, his poll numbers among blacks went down.   White workers? Nope, you get to enjoy neoliberalism. Now, if you can somehow find a job, get to work. We need you to pay for everyone else.
1310963009540501505 2020-09-29 23:21:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Wouldn't be surprising. Didn't do anything on free speech online. Again, for Conservatism Inc., it's a game, a way of making a living, and in the worst cases, an out and out grift.
1310960662995230720 2020-09-29 23:12:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> No, it will go down as something that actually happened. The facts are completely irrelevant. Assuming we'll still have literate students in public schools in 20 years (doubtful), they'll be reading that President Trump was literally a Russian agent.
1310957682195607556 2020-09-29 23:00:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> And here we go.

1310793456277745669 2020-09-29 12:08:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Again, this isn't resisting the System. This is the System's militant wing. Right wingers show up in force, suddenly, the law applies. Heck, go to church, suddenly, the law applies.   The double standard is there for all to see and so too the loss of the System's legitimacy.
1310791596179292160 2020-09-29 12:00:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I also think all Afrikaners should be allowed to flee government oppression and come to America.

1310784563946414080 2020-09-29 11:32:47 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @lucycali88 @CrassusT We do see something happening with some affluent white women who seem very unhappy and disturbed. But you are right, it should be framed in a better way by people like me. Ultimately, we need to be pro-family, and the household is one unit.
1310784234806800385 2020-09-29 11:31:29 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @lucycali88 @CrassusT White bugmen then. Fair enough, and it is totally true that married white women lean the right away. Driving a wedge between men and women is one of the worst things that ever happened to our culture. 1/2

1310779102580936704 2020-09-29 11:11:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Imagine the utter depravity of someone who would stab a 5 year old. It's beyond demonic.   Now keep in mind that that the entire cultural regime is fine with such behavior. Tell an AWFL about this incident, she won't even blink. You're the bad person for knowing about it.
1310778247316201472 2020-09-29 11:07:41 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I remember years ago when grizzled activists would tell me that "some day we're going to lose the Internet" and I would laugh. Well, they were right. In terms of the way it operates a Chinese-style Social Credit System is already here, and it arguably promotes worse values.

1310744705634840576 2020-09-29 08:54:24 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @fredocuomo0 I think it's closer than people think but I question whether Trump can get the turnout he needs. Also, Biden is not nearly as hated as Hillary was. There was a strong "anyone but Hillary" vote. Not sure there's an "anyone but Biden" vote.
1310742301724024837 2020-09-29 08:44:51 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @groyper_boston Just calling them as I see them. But I'd love to be proved wrong. Either way, what has to be done in the next few years doesn't change. We won't be saved from the top, as we naively dreamed in '16.
1310740764176064512 2020-09-29 08:38:45 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I'd like to believe in the Spirit of '16 again, but I think what's going to happen is that the Democratic frontrunner who has maintained a lead this entire time will keep it through the election and win quite easily. Trump can foil this only by offering Americans something new.

We literally have videos of voter fraud and they say, "Nope, not happening." But you can say POTUS is working for the KGB with zero evidence and journalists nod along and smile. It's completely absurd.

Then we wouldn't be bombing Syria, musing about killing Assad, and trying to do another stupid Color Revolution in Eastern Europe. Our foreign policy would be far more rational.

Caveats and explainers were not necessary, and were self-centered.   Dr. Paul is a great American and I'm glad he's recovered.

I'm apparently one of the worst people in the world, according to the new morality, but if I were in charge, I'd bring the hammer down and you would have less of these shootings. Yet it would do you no good - you would just get called racist. So it just rolls on.
1310604851060015105 2020-09-28 23:38:41 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> A great deal of media coverage is about what opinions should or should not be allowed. Few journos believe in free speech. They want speech to be managed by oligarchs and NGOs. We're moving in that direction. I don't see how this country is somehow "free" compared to Russia.
1310603776181653508 2020-09-28 23:34:24 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Not a libertarian but still glad to see Dr. Ron Paul recovered and back at it.
1310603236223651840 2020-09-28 23:32:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @kromagin I don't think the media will have any trouble finding some other run-of-the mill neolibs to fill the slot.
1310576436424650752 2020-09-28 21:45:46 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Would be good for POTUS to take this opportunity to call for the elimination of the income tax and return to funding the government through tariffs. That's what this country did before the Decline.
1310571041232650240 2020-09-28 21:24:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Taxes aren't the "price you pay for civilization." That presupposes you have a government willing and capable of providing basic services.   In 2020 America, taxes are the forced tribute you pay to those destroying your civilization.
1310564704658640897 2020-09-28 20:59:09 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The shameless lying coming from the press is enraging. Whatever his faults, and they are many, @realDonaldTrump  is faced with an impossible situation. You can't govern in the face of universal media opposition. Of course, this is why he should have defended free speech online.
1310558678744006657 2020-09-28 20:35:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> President Trump should not concede under any circumstances. The entire system is corrupt and illegitimate.

1310379758228844546 2020-09-28 08:44:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Biden doesn't matter. President Trump's opponent is the media. Best move would have been to defend independent media online. He didn't and went with "be good." But as Doug Jones victory in Alabama showed, enough goofy whites will believe what they're told to swing elections.
1310361897967943683 2020-09-28 07:33:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> So what exactly is the issue here? Trump wasn't as rich as everyone thought? Or that he paid too little in taxes?
1310311222999429120 2020-09-28 04:11:54 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @StarFox6441 They will learn nothing. Just move to red areas and vote for same policies.
1310308162491346944 2020-09-28 03:59:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If Biden wins, does anyone see this stopping? I think a lot of older white voters will vote Biden because once Orange Man is out things will go back to "normal" but I doubt it.

1310264574051078144 2020-09-28 01:06:32 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @dpinsen Oh this could definitely mean the end for NATO. I mean, again, odds are they will find some way for everyone to stand down but Azerbaijan really, really wants this war.
1310263775342272518 2020-09-28 01:03:22 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The biggest LARP is "we're going to retake Constantinople."  However, given current events, the odds of that happening have increased. It probably won't, but there is a small chance Armenia v Azerbaijan will turn into Russia v Turkey, with Greece jumping in too.
1310261448703127554 2020-09-28 00:54:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If it comes down to war, which side are you backing?
1310259181535080448 2020-09-28 00:45:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @HighEmpiricist I wish American leaders were as passionate about defending our territory.
1310258978388148225 2020-09-28 00:44:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @free_canuck Fair enough. But after years of running against Obamacare the GOP didn't have a plan it could pull out in 2017 when it had control of House, Senate, and White House. That's unforgivable.
1310257203006386178 2020-09-28 00:37:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @eronian It made sense during Cold War because US had nukes there and Turkey had (and still has) a strong military. But all the alliances have shifted. For example, India was somewhat against USA during Cold War, now there's a definite US-India alliance taking shape. But NATO remains.
1310256423583055872 2020-09-28 00:34:09 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Basically, Putin wants no escalation. But does Turkey? Does Azerbaijan? There's no way Russia can allow those nations to curbstomp Armenia without totally losing credibility. I don't think Putin wants a conflict, but he may get it. Russian "advisors" already in Armenia.
1310255708299055105 2020-09-28 00:31:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @StNick313 That would also be acceptable. There must be a rapprochement with Russia.
1310254896764063744 2020-09-28 00:28:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> One thing should absolutely happen right now (and General Flynn was dead wrong on this). Turkey is not America's ally. It should be expelled from NATO.

My major two reasons why is that he didn't fight for free speech online, and so no one is pushing back against media lies. And he hasn't done enough for white working class.

1310252054267531264 2020-09-28 00:16:47 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @OfBoudicca Come the Revolution, that would be my top priority.
1310251907336855554 2020-09-28 00:16:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @pots_boiling Erdogan has done a complete 180 on what Turkey is all about. It was founded as an explicitly secular state that rejected the Ottoman legacy. Ataturk used to mock Islam. Now, Erdogan is styling himself almost as a caliph and trying to reclaim the Ottoman legacy.
1310251171928567812 2020-09-28 00:13:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> And so it begins. Go Vlad. Urra!   https://t.co/VmtiSZIueY
1310249904518901760 2020-09-28 00:08:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @TRC0fficial I did a bunch of research into her immigration decisions. Not many, but she ruled correctly, in line with existing law.

1310248461737111553 2020-09-28 00:02:31 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Boris41552570 I'm part of the "Pagans for the reconquest of Constantinople" caucus. I think I'm the only member.
1310248238889529345 2020-09-28 00:01:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The world waits for Kim Kardashian to call for a holy crusade to save Armenia.
1310247435281801216 2020-09-27 23:58:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @ForecasterEnten He hasn't done anything for his base. He was far more nationalist in 2016. Far more "extreme." He's running like a normal Republican now. That's why crossover white workers aren't turning out for him.

1310246490267414528 2020-09-27 23:54:41 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @murideeg Yes. Erdogan does too from domestic opposition. But what better way to get your own people in line than a foreign conflict? Both leaders may think that is in their own interests.    https://t.co/M89Z3sweUd
1310245484452352002 2020-09-27 23:50:41 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I doubt it will come to a direct conflict between Russia and Turkey, just more skirmishing through their various proxies. But if it does, obviously I hope Putin drives all the way to Istanbul and takes it all back.    https://t.co/iBd1DFdJy5
1310244226333110272 2020-09-27 23:45:41 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @shelteredrobin1 Yes it's going to be very complicated.
1310242467988623361 2020-09-27 23:38:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Turkey and Russia have been frenemies for a long time. They have worked together quite a bit but their fundamental interests are opposed. If Russia backs Armenia and Turkey backs Azerbaijan, this will get interesting fast, especially since (and this is a disgrace) Turkey is NATO.
1310241332020027395 2020-09-27 23:34:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> President Trump is losing this election. He can turn it around with a plan to help white working class voters. They need their own Platinum Plan.   But I don't see it coming.

1310240378528899084 2020-09-27 23:30:23 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> And yes, this is the country's official Twitter account. We may have a Happening.
1310238700463325185 2020-09-27 23:23:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This should not be a surprise.
1310238275832107010 2020-09-27 23:22:02 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> There is no “Platinum Plan” – or much of anything else – coming from this supposedly “white nationalist” administration. Those who ultimately sustain the state are those who receive the least benefits.   https://t.co/f9gB3Ihh1g

1310102679654477825 2020-09-27 14:23:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @JRRecGLR Well, Turkey is a NATO member. If something happens and they invoke Article V, then America has the choice between siding with Turkey against Armenia, the Kurds and Russia, or dissolving the alliance.
1310100515179630602 2020-09-27 14:14:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> People are underestimating Turkey's ambitions. It's moving to take Northern Syria. If it backs Azerbaijan, it can completely change the regional geopolitics. That might mean Russia intervening to help Armenia.   Hopefully it culminates in taking Constantinople. Get 'em Vlad.
1310099352174637056 2020-09-27 14:10:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @eronian Love his talk on Baron Evola. "The world's most right wing thinker."  https://t.co/TQpka7TNUW
1310099098381488130 2020-09-27 14:09:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Let's goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
1310098881062088704 2020-09-27 14:08:08 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If I had to be on the next war, it would be Azerbaijan v. Armenia, and it would draw a lot of people in.
1310096971290628096 2020-09-27 14:00:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @4_Posterity I don't think America will fight Russia in this war. It will stay out or side with the Armenians.
1310096766512107520 2020-09-27 13:59:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @4_Posterity Yeah, it would be amazing to hear what he would have to say now.
1310096311908290560 2020-09-27 13:57:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @dundreary It could make a difference. I imagine America will side with Armenia.
1310096184191655942 2020-09-27 13:57:25 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Here's the key. Turkey said it will defend Azerbaijan. Which means you have a NATO country moving into the conflict. Armenia has a partnership with NATO, but isn't a full member. Armenia also moving closer to Russia and the Kurds.   This one could be big.  https://t.co/opyCJR5NLQ
1310094896271970304 2020-09-27 13:52:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This could really be a happening. Azerbaijan wants a war.
1310094497339056128 2020-09-27 13:50:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "To read about your own culture is a revolutionary act."
1310094132136812544 2020-09-27 13:49:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I've spoken at gatherings in the woods and at conferences of conservatives. I've heard the small arms in Donbass and been teargassed in Iceland. I've had adventures I can't believe I survived.

1310086674936926209 2020-09-27 13:19:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @MrShane32667728 Miguel Estrada, on the recommendation of @AnnCoulter   If it had to be a woman, I think Barbara Lagoa would have done more good politically. However, I see the value of this pick because it shows Christians (not just Catholics, but evangelicals too) that POTUS has their back
1310059241869381632 2020-09-27 11:30:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I'm sure @mattyglesias was baiting us, but, well, you knew we couldn't not talk about this. Here's part one.

1310057592719323136 2020-09-27 11:24:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @theaschop Think it was in Paul Johnson's History of the American People that he said boredom is an underrated cultural force.   I think people did think that. "We have a functional society, but there are rules. Let's abolish them. We can do anything!"  Fast forward a generation...
1310044841229811712 2020-09-27 10:33:24 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @DanielleSavoy Yeah, but equally likely it will be this.  https://t.co/IgVbnmMKbw
1310043883779354624 2020-09-27 10:29:35 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @AndreParadys Mencken was explicitly pro-German at the beginning of the war but basically went silent when USA became involved. It was only after the war that he reached his peak of influence.
1310042759689105411 2020-09-27 10:25:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @mcclure_phil Don't know. Urban policing is not something National Guard can do long term. Some states have "State Guards" but not sure they could be mobilized long term. Think we will have national military police eventually. Not that unusual - Italy, Spain, France, Netherlands, etc.
1310040657193467904 2020-09-27 10:16:46 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Starting to think it is inevitable that there will be an American Gendarmerie. Who will comprise it and how it will be used remains to be seen.  https://t.co/2ECKaw6AHc
1310039516837748737 2020-09-27 10:12:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @AndreParadys First read about it in biographies of H.L. Mencken. Completely insane. Here's a lefty take on it, but understates it. Basically was government sponsored pogroms and harassment. For a stupid war forced on the people.  https://t.co/kXOdqVtIqg

1310034985701834754 2020-09-27 09:54:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> VDARE isn't allowed on YouTube. AmRen isn't allowed. Countless other nationalist and conservative accounts who don't use vulgar language, slurs, or anything other than rational political arguments are banned.   But the most vile stuff imaginable remains up. Makes you think.

1310003805535297537 2020-09-27 07:50:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @NewCon_1 I think you are right. I think he will win Florida, NC, but maybe not Arizona. And he just didn't deliver enough for white working class to take the Midwest again. Unless he offers something concrete - $$$$$ - in next few weeks.
1310003512579952643 2020-09-27 07:49:10 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @BustoAlligator @veryfineppI You could be right. I also remember Dem primaries in 16 when most polls had Hillary winning Michigan by double digits and she got crushed by Sanders.
1310003275937337346 2020-09-27 07:48:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @veryfineppI Was it in '18? Don't know. I just think Trump Campaign is too complacent. Needs to make up ground with white working class. Where's their "Platinum Plan?"
1310003040892661761 2020-09-27 07:47:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @NewCon_1 No, it's fine. And I'm a pessimist so I could be wrong. I was wrong until a day or so before Election Day when people I knew in Midwest were swearing up and down he would win.
1310002681432473601 2020-09-27 07:45:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @NewCon_1 Yes, but these poll results are very tilted towards GOP. Still think it looks grim. But somehow I still think he will win Florida and North Carolina.
1310002459436347397 2020-09-27 07:44:59 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Howardt12041027 @peterbrimelow That's something a lot of people miss when they criticize VDARE as "white nationalist" or say Virginia Dare was "first white child born in North America." She wasn't, not even close. But she was first English child in the colonies that became USA, so that's why she matters more.
1310002048285519874 2020-09-27 07:43:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Howardt12041027 @peterbrimelow DNA test has me Norse, German, and Irish, with the usual sprinkling of other European regions. But at the end of the day, USA was a creation not of white people, but of people from Great Britain. They created the institutions and they should be recognized as the founding stock.
1310001532612550657 2020-09-27 07:41:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> And keep in mind, this is the Republican polling firm.
1310000704426303488 2020-09-27 07:38:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Ragnasal2 Yes, education would need to be totally reworked. History and Moral Philosophy class,
1310000321939341317 2020-09-27 07:36:30 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Howardt12041027 @peterbrimelow I'd go so far as to say that America should join the Commonwealth except I don't like the current dynasty, especially where it is going next.
1309999780710375425 2020-09-27 07:34:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> And everyone lived happily ever after.
1309999451008888833 2020-09-27 07:33:02 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @DCorpsegrinder Long story. Suffice to say that this book had a big impact on me. At some point I'll write a book or at least a series compilation of OC on all this.   https://t.co/1HXDqhzXRy
1309998753387089920 2020-09-27 07:30:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @DavidNathanaelx @SporkLiftDriver I agree with Evola that it's all been downhill since the Ghibellines lost.
1309998102376574979 2020-09-27 07:27:40 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> America isn't a theocracy. It's not governed by the Roman Catholic Church. This means that it is much worse to say "I'm a devout Catholic who doesn't believe anything the Church says" or "I'm a Catholic who thinks abortion is great." You're a liberal, don't cloak it in incense.
1309997189129797646 2020-09-27 07:24:03 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @DCorpsegrinder I'll just be here in my "Pagans for the repeal of Vatican II" caucus of the Dissident Right.
1309996312822198279 2020-09-27 07:20:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The fact that you have people with vastly different social views claiming they are all faithful Catholics is testament to the failure of Vatican II. It was the worst theological mistake in history and it will take the Church decades to recover, if it ever does.
1309994479621943302 2020-09-27 07:13:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Tuckerfan3 @OrwellNGoode yeah well at least he wasn't RACIST
1309994391348617221 2020-09-27 07:12:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Howardt12041027 @peterbrimelow The Anglo-American Day would basically be Boxing Day. It would give us another day off after Christmas and people could fly the Grand Union flag. Besides, Canada celebrates it and it would be good if the Anglo countries started celebrating our common heritage.
1309994014448513025 2020-09-27 07:11:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @DCorpsegrinder Strong suggestions.
1309983767445098498 2020-09-27 06:30:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @exoalter @ACLU There's a case to be made the capital punishment is bad, or simply not something the state should be doing. But calling a double murder a "mistake" and pretending a 19 year old is a "juvenile" is just insane.
1309982845742579713 2020-09-27 06:27:03 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> &gt;mistake  I made "mistakes" at 19. I drank underage. I sometimes drank to excess. I skipped the occasional class.  But somehow, I managed to avoid the "mistake" of carjacking and murdering two people and then setting their corpses on fire.   What the hell is wrong with you @ACLU?
1309981063758962689 2020-09-27 06:19:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @RetroGroyper @NOONELOVESMENOW No, People of Light is the preferred term.
1309980932267479040 2020-09-27 06:19:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @lillypadded Yes. The FBI would have dozens of agents working the case. Remember how many it sent to investigate the NASCAR Noose Hoax?
1309979317242265600 2020-09-27 06:13:02 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Mostly peaceful signs.

1309944432486158344 2020-09-27 03:54:24 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Imagine thinking in the age of Drag Queen Story Hour and rainbow logos from every big corporation in the country that we're just five minutes away from The Handmaid's Tale.
1309934187022102530 2020-09-27 03:13:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @RacistClip "may" need. But yes, capital W.   Honestly, no one knows what is going to happen. We can only imagine the challenges or opportunities five years from now. But I do think we should have things to say other than "I demand a Euro-Siberian Imperium" I mean, I do, but still.
1309930847814942721 2020-09-27 03:00:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> What the US government did to German-Americans during World War I goes far, far beyond anything people like Ilhan Omar or Kamala Harris could complain about. The government basically incited pogroms against German-Americans before sending them to fight and die in a pointless war.
1309930507275296768 2020-09-27 02:59:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Three small ones to start off -  1. @peterbrimelow's suggestion for Boxing Day as a specific holiday to honor America's founding stock -  https://t.co/giKSur0DQI 2. Refugee status for all whites from South Africa 3. Reparations for German-Americans for US govt action during WWI.
1309929781283168258 2020-09-27 02:56:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Also let's take the obvious civic nationalist things as a given. No affirmative action, English is official language, immigration laws enforced, etc. Things things would benefit most Americans of all races and are good, but we need some demands specifically FOR US.
1309929305972125699 2020-09-27 02:54:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> And yes, I realize we may need an entirely new political system to implement any of these. But frustrated whites need specific demands as well as Big Picture ideas about an entirely different order. Change will happen gradually then all at once.
1309928753791995904 2020-09-27 02:52:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Time for a policy program for whites. The Rhodium Plan. Leave your suggestions below. Doesn't include civic nationalist stuff that would benefit everyone (though those things are good of course) or new political order. Let's think about specific policies within current system.
1309928137980022784 2020-09-27 02:49:40 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It's , Harris from now on.

1309917156583387136 2020-09-27 02:06:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I have one question and one question only for Amy Coney Barrett. Can the president repeal birthright citizenship via executive order? I also have no illusions that question will be asked.
1309916639543152642 2020-09-27 02:03:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Not happy with this pick but nothing can be done about it now. She looks nervous. The media jackals can't wait to rip her apart, find anyone she's ever met to denounce her, spread whatever wild rumor they can. She clearly knows it is coming.
1309915061796962307 2020-09-27 01:57:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @HarmlessYardDog The white working class has zero representation in this country. The only role they have is to be used up as cannon fodder in foreign wars. The GOP views them with contempt, the Democrats with homicidal rage at their mere existence.
1309914656065105920 2020-09-27 01:56:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Ah yes, bureaucracy and politics, that's the explanation.
1309858036115296258 2020-09-26 22:11:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The @realDonaldTrump campaign, if it actually wants to win, needs to make registering these voters its top priority.   But instead, you know, Platinum Plan. Which won't work anyway.
1309851874732933122 2020-09-26 21:46:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @JacobCLloyd When the stars align, we're screwed.
1309847845424345094 2020-09-26 21:30:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> GOP lobbyist groups are attacking President Trump's plan to cut the price of drugs for the elderly. Again, they'd rather lose. Their job is just to be lobbyists for the oligarchs.
1309842939733041155 2020-09-26 21:11:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @LannyDavis "Red states, we're going to leave!" Then go "Lol, you guys are just Jesusland!" Fine.  "Enjoy living under fascism you hicks!" I'm sure we will "Diversity will be our strength!" Hope so, you're taking BLM and the rest of your pets.  "Our GDP will be higher!" We'll survive.

1309696199180668929 2020-09-26 11:28:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @LannyDavis please yes, please yes, please go.

1309659640855224320 2020-09-26 09:02:45 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @SaxonNewfie @TendiesB @PiousTusks @HarmlessYardDog I now retire from Twitter for the weekend. I will revisit this case on Monday. I expect all arguments to be prepared carefully.   Thank you.
1309659370578477057 2020-09-26 09:01:40 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> There a saying - "capital is a coward." Investment flees when property rights are jeopardized. But there's another meaning. If you have a self-confident civilization state willing to use power, companies submit. They spit on USA and bow to China bc China puts its interests first.
1309656936338595840 2020-09-26 08:52:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If President Trump offers something to white working class voters beyond culture war rhetoric - by which I mean give $ - he wins. Incidentally, that will do more to win black and especially Hispanic voters than any stupid "Platinum Plan."   UBI until pandemic over. That's it.
1309655615610986498 2020-09-26 08:46:45 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Not enough, eliminate these subversive organizations entirely. The Cold War is over.
1309653326078914561 2020-09-26 08:37:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Blair_A_Nathan Jefferson Davis, when Secretary of War, wanted a Camel Corps.   It's really a disgrace that we don't have Camels patrolling the border. Surely we should be able to find a few billions here and there for genetically and mechanically augmented camels to perform this vital task.
1309652627488210944 2020-09-26 08:34:53 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @anntensity Mitt Romney.
1309651613729067008 2020-09-26 08:30:51 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @BillAdelberger Election held today, he loses, no doubt in my mind. But of course, it is not. And he may very well roll something out for white working class. But that only happens if people speak out against his campaign strategy thus far.
1309651318106136576 2020-09-26 08:29:41 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @SaxonNewfie @TendiesB @PiousTusks @HarmlessYardDog I fully expect ALL of you to compile all evidence for and against before I return to Twitter.   This is a serious matter and I must think carefully before rendering a verdict.
1309644158152454145 2020-09-26 08:01:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This is very simple. If President Trump doesn't increase his share of the non-college educated white voters from 2016 (or register more), he loses. There is no sign that's happening. There's no sign the campaign even thinks it is a problem. Hence the "Platinum Plan."
1309642695690903554 2020-09-26 07:55:25 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Good, maybe they'll stop coming here.
1309642468871340032 2020-09-26 07:54:31 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Glaivester Good term. Shamelessly stealing. Boot me if I stop giving credit.

1309633588476940290 2020-09-26 07:19:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @StationInner Yup. Fouche, the leader of de-Christianization and arguably more extreme than Robespierre, was the key guy in Thermidor. Then he effortlessly shifted to become more of a conservative, Napoleon's (highly effective) minister of police, and Duc d'Otrante.
1309632607982940167 2020-09-26 07:15:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @StationInner Thermidor only happened because key leaders thought they were next on the list, especially Fouche. If Robespierre had said who he was going after specifically, no Thermidor. It would have kept right on rolling.
1309631650737913859 2020-09-26 07:11:31 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Camelback71 of course not
1309630949198622720 2020-09-26 07:08:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Dreyrugr1 @PiousTusks @HarmlessYardDog Oh Talos, now I've done it. This thread will have hundreds of comments before dawn.
1309629411520663554 2020-09-26 07:02:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Can Trump Administration offer White America at least a "Bronze Plan?" Even a "Copper Plan?"   We enforce immigration laws (especially against employers), stop discriminating against whites in jobs and education, and English is national language.   Obviously, too much to ask.
1309628783805321216 2020-09-26 07:00:08 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PiousTusks @HarmlessYardDog Wignat, amnat, white identity, Castizo Futurism, secession, reconquest, small ethnostates, Euro-Siberian Empire... all of this fades before the most divisive question in the movement.   Is Ulfric Stormcloak controlled opposition?
1309626857839628293 2020-09-26 06:52:29 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The only thing I want to know about Amy Coney Barrett is her position on birthright citizenship. If she says the president can't abolish it via executive order, then I'm against this nomination.
1309626075232731136 2020-09-26 06:49:22 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Sorry, Skyrim still belongs to the Nords.
1309625405100392448 2020-09-26 06:46:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Black America gets a Platinum Plan from the "white nationalist" Trump Administration.   White America gets the bill.
1309625028032462849 2020-09-26 06:45:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> One wonders about whether this is illegal or not, but of course, under our "white supremacist" system, no lawyer would dare touch the case.
1309552931851698180 2020-09-26 01:58:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The Republic would still be thriving if we had more men like Dr. Ron Paul. He is one of the very few statesmen the Founders would have welcomed into their company.   Dr. Paul is a great man, and everyone should be praying and hoping for his full recovery.
1309552493907632129 2020-09-26 01:56:59 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I think Caesar was right that the Republic was already dead. But that was because the politicians were too irredeemably corrupt. Cato was the one exception, someone whose integrity, incorruptibility and courage were beyond reproach.   Ron Paul is the closest thing we have today.
1309539577355481090 2020-09-26 01:05:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @YahooNews Yahoo News seems to be the Biden campaign. Biden himself is snoozing away in a basement somewhere.
1309539356345069572 2020-09-26 01:04:47 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Race clearly tightening. Much will depend on debates. If Trump can hold AZ, NC, and Florida, he just needs to crack into the Midwest again, where he is behind but in striking distance.
1309536139859066880 2020-09-26 00:52:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Valtr62498459 I think he's just doing it because he can.

1309535095766814720 2020-09-26 00:47:51 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> There are two parts of the draft Declaration of Independence that should have been left in. Denouncing slavery (and then paving way for American Colonization Society to really act).  The other was the line to to the British that "we might have been a free &amp; great people together"
1309534249251491841 2020-09-26 00:44:29 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> What could have been.  https://t.co/T5DeioG8Fd
1309532501560393728 2020-09-26 00:37:32 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Mass riots last night. Road Warrior scenes in Los Angeles. Uncounted assaults, property destruction.   What's on the timeline?  A one person protest about "climate change." In Russia. That happened two days ago.
1309532185716813833 2020-09-26 00:36:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Adam_Reynold5 No. And I understand that many on the Right are against or don't believe in Darwinism or the theory of evolution. This is more to make the point that the Left is dynamiting the foundations of its own worldview.
1309378777072447489 2020-09-25 14:26:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @DavidPDuffy25 @vdare good
1309376744433111042 2020-09-25 14:18:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Nope, too late. LA Times already running with "truck plows through peaceful protesters" Narrative. And that will be the story forever. Journos know what they are doing and why. Conservatives mostly naive and clueless.
1309375828380315649 2020-09-25 14:14:59 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This is the power of platform control. Yes, most people will believe whatever you tell them. Which is why "democracy" is a farce unless you have independent media and free speech online.
1309373307423260672 2020-09-25 14:04:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Of course. These are the choices you face now. You can die or get sentenced to 400,000 years in jail. No one in the mob will be touched of course.   Pure anarcho-tyranny.
1309352660945043462 2020-09-25 12:42:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @AnnCoulter I recall that there was one man who thundered against "RBG" on the campaign trail. He could have saved us, but the GOP didn't listen.  https://t.co/L8GtDnj2FX
1309351897418137601 2020-09-25 12:39:53 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Semmelweis7 @DarrenJBeattie I just started laughing at the phrase "secret CIA memo."
1309343017954836481 2020-09-25 12:04:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @LibertarianBlue Just start your own bank.
1309341908997726210 2020-09-25 12:00:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Notice the Papa Johns next to them.   It is yet another sign from the Prophet. We were warned, but we didn't listen!  https://t.co/2OjLS3hGba
1309340134559625217 2020-09-25 11:53:09 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PunishedHank Only thing I can think of is "vote Trump and hope he will be able to do something." And that feels like (and is) such a filthy shill answer that it humiliates me.   I mean there are productive things we can do, obviously, but not to stop something on this scale anytime soon.
1309339554244067328 2020-09-25 11:50:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @atastypizza @markgeragos @adamcarolla Quietly hoping the feds would get rid of Trump. Then Mitt Romney could give a speech about "norms" and "civility."
1309339053729427457 2020-09-25 11:48:51 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> You have journalists pretending President Trump is a dictator when he can't even stop federal law enforcement ostensibly under his control from launching phony investigations about him. And we're supposed to believe he's going to launch a civil war.   Just absolute fantasyland.
1309338707913302016 2020-09-25 11:47:28 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PunishedHank That's was so scary about it. President Trump apparently can't. Republicans won't. So what do we do?
1309338532008341505 2020-09-25 11:46:47 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @20_mockingbird To this day, people leave flowers and tributes on what remains of the altar of the Temple of the Deified Julius.   I think about this often.
1309338086548164609 2020-09-25 11:45:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Defund the political police.
1309338044403781632 2020-09-25 11:44:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The fact that every single journalist isn't demanding answers about this FBI scandal, and that no one will be held accountable, is proof that the entire system is illegitimate.
1309337547995320324 2020-09-25 11:42:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @TheCptBlackPill People get mad at the CIA for Operation Condor but I'm mad at them for contemporary art.
1309337400951410690 2020-09-25 11:42:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If they can do that to the President of the United States, imagine what they could do to normal citizens
1309337158617100288 2020-09-25 11:41:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I don't want to carry water for President Trump and I know I hit him constantly - and deservedly. That said, the fact that the FBI knowingly and deliberately launched a phony investigation against him is 1000 terms worse than Watergate. He was right about this and it's important.
1309329622102876165 2020-09-25 11:11:22 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @ThorinReynolds Correct. It's not that I think the Founders were wrong. I think future statesmen failed them. They didn't anticipate rule by judges. They thought legislators would jealously guard their institutional interests. They were wrong.
1309328800057102337 2020-09-25 11:08:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> A one man protest - is Russia - is on the Twitter timeline. It's clearly very important news.  This story isn't.    https://t.co/ur75072XXk
1309328226414665729 2020-09-25 11:05:49 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Rule by bureaucrats, oligarchs, and legalism isn't the "rule of law" or "liberty." It's just a System that is impervious to necessary change. It's the rule of money. When you have personal rule, the people know who is in charge. Sovereignty is clear. Failure can be punished.
1309326877786550273 2020-09-25 11:00:28 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> When I was first involved in politics, I (like the Founders) thought Cato had it right. The Republic had to be saved. But by Caesar's time, the "Republic" was already dead. It was just a protection racket for oligarchs. Caesar did nothing wrong.   We're at a similar time now.
1309325463928610818 2020-09-25 10:54:51 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @amconmag Yes, he conceded too much. He should stay in no matter what. The system is fundamentally broken.
1309323399320276992 2020-09-25 10:46:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Hopefully it's just every country in alphabetical order.
1309323039788728321 2020-09-25 10:45:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @FixtheDebt Speaking for the nationalist Right, no.
1309320028165156865 2020-09-25 10:33:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Nationalize 'em all.
1309319907952254977 2020-09-25 10:32:46 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @roto_dk @MysteryGrove IT MEANS YOUR TIME HAS COME.
1309309535853699072 2020-09-25 09:51:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @100years2late @TOOEdit Not trying to start an argument but just to clarify, because there is a distinction. Is your position that the theory of evolution is false? Or just the specific claim that humans are descended from (or related to) apes is false?   Not gonna argue either way, just curious.
1309308315705454592 2020-09-25 09:46:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @BHlacks I mean, Nixon is the guy who gave us affirmative action. He was a very intelligent, complicated man and was outrageously right-wing in private, but he really got steamrolled by liberal bureaucrats.   Smarter version of Trump, but Trump has more will.
1309308018195132419 2020-09-25 09:45:31 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @BHlacks You know I once actually believed that the Southern Strategy really was just the "segregationists switched to GOP" thing. But Pat Buchanan's book The Greatest Comeback shows that Nixon was something different. He probably would have pushed through integration but crushed rioters.
1309307416018911239 2020-09-25 09:43:08 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @MabelGator6 You win!
1309307058123091970 2020-09-25 09:41:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @BHlacks I think Nixon probably would have handled Cuban Missle Crisis worse than Kennedy. However, I think there wouldn't have been one with Nixon because USSR wouldn't have tested him and/or he would have supported Bay of Pigs landing with promised airpower and expelled Castro.
1309306490285629440 2020-09-25 09:39:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @HillBrunel I do not think Trump will win. I don't think it's a sure thing and am following the data-driven accounts that are pointing out errors in the polls. The registration numbers for Republicans look good but I think Dem turnout will be sky-high and there will be a lot of fraud.
1309305441286057990 2020-09-25 09:35:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @BHlacks I believe Nixon won Illinois. The question is whether he won Texas too. That's a harder case to make.
1309304612613222400 2020-09-25 09:32:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Trust the science, except when it tells you that evolution applies to humans too.
1309303827552784384 2020-09-25 09:28:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I mean, it's not like it hasn't happened before. Al Franken won his Senate seat through illegal voting, but GOP just shrugged. LBJ's political career started by cheating. 1960 election could have been contested but Nixon took the high road. (Look what that got him from media).
1309302980001361920 2020-09-25 09:25:30 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I just don't understand how people can think the polls are fake but that the election results won't be.
1309300498974027776 2020-09-25 09:15:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Understates the case. They all knew, supported it, and think that those who even question the lie should be deplatformed.
1309282682883502081 2020-09-25 08:04:51 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @juanderful3 @MysteryGrove No, Trump is Tsar Nicholas II. Too weak to do anything. Biden is Kerensky, though with less will. (Kerensky thought he was going to somehow become a Napoleon and kept the war going for that reason.) It's who comes after that which turns us into South Africa.
1309281116340342784 2020-09-25 07:58:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @UnivrslWrldBby In fairness, when you RT something, it shows others the wording of the tweet but not the title of the article.   So I do think they knew what they were doing when they said "a crime" and not "double murder" (but made sure to mention his age.) But still, no excuse on my part.
1309280124588691459 2020-09-25 07:54:41 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @UnivrslWrldBby I admit Twitter defeat and will delete in shame.
1309280047321223170 2020-09-25 07:54:23 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @UnivrslWrldBby I just played myself
1309268551421886467 2020-09-25 07:08:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> A horror movie where Satan is freed from hell, only he just rants at bored people about rainbow crosswalks until someone gives him a swirly.
1309267835840016384 2020-09-25 07:05:51 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Only shitlibs could succeed in transforming the Prince of Darkness into a hysterical schoolmarm.
1309256494702112772 2020-09-25 06:20:47 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> No, if you listen carefully, you can hear them laughing.
1309220141033500673 2020-09-25 03:56:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @AllYouHaveToDo3 Yeah, I think a lot of people in eastern Washington and Oregon, and the occupied State of Jefferson would have something to say if they tried that.
1309218855550623744 2020-09-25 03:51:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Lot of chutzpah for the Left to be hyperventilating about a #PeacefulTransferOfPower when it hasn't accepted 2016, Dems have already said they won't concede, and they are already rioting in the streets.   Again, "gentlemen cry peace, peace, but there is no peace!"
1309217850146672642 2020-09-25 03:47:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> In a serious country, leaders understand that diversity is a weakness. If there was a no-holds-barred war between China and the United States, the USA would be crazy not to arm minority populations and encourage rebellions. Of course, China would do the same thing right back.
1309202593160278017 2020-09-25 02:46:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> There is a very high chance POTUS will lose Florida and thus the election because Jared Kushner thought that felons would support the GOP.
1309202172119265282 2020-09-25 02:44:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> French President Emmanuel Macron's statement that "we must learn to live with the virus" is getting very little attention from journos.   One can only imagine what would happen if President Trump made the exact same statement, given that he's already being accused of genocide.
1309201595507318786 2020-09-25 02:42:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Stunning, really thought moving the embassy and giving Soros, Bloomberg, and Bezos more money would win the loyalty of working class white voters.
1309190444698480640 2020-09-25 01:58:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> At this point, you have to take for granted any election results will at least be partially fraudulent. The entire system is broken beyond repair.
1309189955567181832 2020-09-25 01:56:23 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Yeah and don't forget conservatives want to give them tax cuts.   Crush them. Tax them into oblivion and make them pay for the damage. If they try to dodge it, call them racist and nationalize them.   If these guys are doing something bad, rewarding them won't stop the behavior.
1309188151450259457 2020-09-25 01:49:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The people who keep this country going, especially the white middle class, are the ones who are the most screwed over by the System. The people who have a privileged status in the government's caste system and would starve to death without it are the ones claiming oppression.
1309187641288650753 2020-09-25 01:47:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "Oppression" = preferential treatment in jobs and education, set asides, grants to colleges specifically for their race, and countless other gibs  Hard to conceive of a more coddled, spoiled, and entitled attitude. If it's so bad, leave. Go build Wakanda. No one will stop you.
1309185729248067584 2020-09-25 01:39:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @WalshFreedom We have millions of foreigners occupying our country illegally. We have people rioting, burning the flag, shooting police. That's where the sedition is. If you want to see a traitor, you should look in the mirror.    https://t.co/Fmo4Bs4Wxj
1309183005877993472 2020-09-25 01:28:46 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This is biggest failure of Trump Administration and conservative movement in general. Top issue in 2018 midterms was health care. Need to offer people something.   Of course, Obama's major accomplishment, "Obamacare," is so bad Democrats are already running on changing it.
1309115244795572224 2020-09-24 20:59:31 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Genuine question. How's that "FBI investigation" of your "hacked blog" coming? Been a few years now. I mean, obviously you didn't write those things, right? Find any Russians?   https://t.co/ucBd4sGcjS
1309113527236468738 2020-09-24 20:52:41 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "Will you come with me to Washington? Are you with me?"
1309112894630572032 2020-09-24 20:50:10 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> #DictatorTrump ? The guy who hasn't actually cracked down on rioters? Who is asking permission from local Democratic officials to restore order? Not hardly.   I wish he was the nationalist strongman journos imagine he is. One will arise if he doesn't.   https://t.co/kIN8kai4to
1309110523594772480 2020-09-24 20:40:45 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> 2 policemen shot but it hasn't quite been violent  Again, if right wingers were doing this, they'd have dropped a neutron bomb on the city.
1309108717682556932 2020-09-24 20:33:35 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Just reframe it as abortion and then it becomes the Left's most sacred cause. What are you complaining about?
1309107438935826438 2020-09-24 20:28:30 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> And of course, the usual suspects, Goldberg, Romney, Cheney, etc, are all calling for unilateral surrender.
1309107308182622209 2020-09-24 20:27:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The Democrats have already said they won't concede on election night, no matter what. They never accepted 2016 results, which is why we got the Russia hoax. If only there really was a #DictatorTrump. Instead, he's far too fair minded in the face of open sedition.
1309106641124691983 2020-09-24 20:25:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Now, who knows because there's so much disinformation from all sides. But Foreign Policy recently reported the vaccine seems to be working so far. You would think the media would be interested but, you know, Russia Bad.
1309106363172257793 2020-09-24 20:24:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Mostly peaceful bat
1308970999858290689 2020-09-24 11:26:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Black Lives Matter is a domestic terrorist organization
1308955625251115008 2020-09-24 10:25:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @MarkDice No organization guys. Don't you trust journalists? Obviously, this is a deepfake video constructed by Vladimir Putin personally.
1308953347811147779 2020-09-24 10:16:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @JoeBiden Blood on YOUR hands, Slow Joe.
1308952152711327744 2020-09-24 10:11:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Actually, no one would ever hear about it.   There were no riots over Daniel Shaver. Wonder why?
1308950694343380993 2020-09-24 10:05:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Reuters Journos don't just lie, but lie intentionally. You know exactly what you are doing, media swine. We see you.
1308933067671773189 2020-09-24 08:55:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> These media swine incite people to murder based on lies. They know they are telling lies. They do it on purpose. And then they have the gall to say that we, who have .000001% of their platform, are the threat and the ones "radicalizing" people. Journos lie, people die.  #AJAB
1308932754898325505 2020-09-24 08:54:22 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> No, to hell with it. This is not a time for jokes.
1308926806259642368 2020-09-24 08:30:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The bills should be sent to CNN.
1308926235691700227 2020-09-24 08:28:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @JonahDispatch @jgrantaddison No, the best excuse is that he's completely right. The system is fundamentally illegitimate, many of the votes are fraudulent, and the Democrats have already said they won't concede no matter what. But you know all that, because your job is to serve as controlled opposition.
1308924435454480386 2020-09-24 08:21:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Another success for journos! The dishonest media's never-ending blood libels against whites are achieving what they want. MSNBC and CNN (among others) should be credited with the murder of yet another white child thanks to their hard work knowingly spreading lies.   AJAB
1308922867162255361 2020-09-24 08:15:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Increasingly of the opinion that the votes will be utterly illegitimate, that "democracy" just means oligarchic rule, that it creates perverse incentives to replace citizens with dependents, and that journalists are the greatest threat to Americans' constitutional rights.
1308860675247177733 2020-09-24 04:07:57 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "We have to oppose the existential threat of white nationalism. Racial nationalism is literally the worst thing ever. Also, all blacks must have the same ideology and we don't have to obey any laws or respect any property unless we own it. Oh, and whites have to pay for it."
1308855702803415040 2020-09-24 03:48:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Looks like an ethnostate is back on the menu boys.
1308854789460160518 2020-09-24 03:44:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PaterOlympus "Soldiers! I have led you to one of the crumbling cities of the Empire. In the name of the Nation and to further your immortal Glory, we will achieve Victory over the forces of Chaos. We shall rebuild and the Nation shall reach the heights promised by Destiny!" - him, probably
1308852521599983618 2020-09-24 03:35:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Extremely important article. And the sheer POWER. It's too much!  https://t.co/cSr4Uy2hjO
1308852015368462337 2020-09-24 03:33:32 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Only one man can save Louisville.   In the name of the Nation, Kyle Rittenhouse must be given absolute power to secure the city. He will be our Cincinnatus.
1308851525234634753 2020-09-24 03:31:35 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> True, but the fact that this double standard exists is the fault of conservatives who have built a movement around telling our people why we aren't allowed to use state power. Politics is power, nothing more. "Principles" are the post hoc rationalizations for pursuing interests.
1308849332985176070 2020-09-24 03:22:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> By unquestionable faith in victory, I obviously don't mean "Trump gets re-elected." That may be a good thing, but it's not "victory" in itself. No matter what on Election Day, it's the stuff after November which counts.
1308848923935637505 2020-09-24 03:21:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I leave Twitter for one morning and this is what I come back to.
1308641461878042626 2020-09-23 13:36:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> ... right into World War III, just like John McCain would have wanted.   I'm just kidding. Kamala Harris will be the one giving the orders.
1308638577123897345 2020-09-23 13:25:24 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> How is this any different than America's? Only "legitimate" news outlets are allowed on social media while "disinformation" is banned. In terms of how it actually plays out, the Chinese Social Credit system isn't much different than ours. Well, "ours."
1308633829171769344 2020-09-23 13:06:32 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PaulFor86 @HarmlessYardDog Don't be too sure...  https://t.co/lOY2aqEjpc
1308628573817917440 2020-09-23 12:45:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @AodhAscan They weren't that far off and Biden is ahead of where Hillary was at this time. But I'm speaking more broadly.   It is insane that voting has already started before one debate.
1308628261233135616 2020-09-23 12:44:25 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @rappingboomer Blackpilling is honesty on what I'm talking about. But there has to be a guide to productive action in response to these realities. Which I need to do more of.
1308626610451632129 2020-09-23 12:37:51 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Irusk8 Damn right.
1308626213439713280 2020-09-23 12:36:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Sorry for the blackpilling fam. I am actually extremely, absolutely optimistic for the long term, with unquestionable faith in victory. There's a lot of exciting stuff going on. It's just hard not to get sucked into the polls and the horse race that is the presidential election.
1308617768305152001 2020-09-23 12:02:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Weakest link here is Arizona. The state that gave us Reagan is gone. The state that gave us Goldwater may not be gone yet, but will be soon. Same reason.
1308608829035360261 2020-09-23 11:27:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> No, we aren't mourning the COVID-19 victims because we aren't allowed to have funerals unless the departed was a left-wing activist, at which point you can have a packed ceremony and the virus magically ceases to exist.
1308606219456671744 2020-09-23 11:16:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If this is "your country," then this isn't a real country. Time to go our separate ways.
1308605682636161026 2020-09-23 11:14:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @NoNameGirl8686 Yes, please! We in Jesusland strongly support this. Please, please let us get out of this failed experiment.
1308597175027408897 2020-09-23 10:40:53 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @RegularRon You Papists can burn me alive AFTER the Restoration, but you'll need me till then.
1308564827753844739 2020-09-23 08:32:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @RegularRon "The Pagan Case for Catholic Social Teaching," coming soon.
1308527729135017984 2020-09-23 06:04:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @cidcampante @Ragnasal2 @StJohnSmythe85 Hard to discuss on Twitter, but yes, a lot to that. Also, humanbiodiversity (shaped by environmental adaptation over centuries), culture (partially biological) and politics (Pareto's theory of elites) need to be combined. But I think Evola's Traditionalism has a place too.
1308524217625911297 2020-09-23 05:50:59 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> During the Dark Ages, we had festivals for certain saint's feast days. Now, in enlightened times, we celebrate the 25th anniversary of a movie everybody had forgotten about until it was put on the timeline.
1308523731514462208 2020-09-23 05:49:03 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @OrwellNGoode Studies show the "disgust" reaction is higher in conservatives than liberals. But I think they are set up wrong. Always fascinated by how shitlibs revert to how they need to "take a shower" or say something is "gross" when they hear or read something they don't like.
1308523238897651712 2020-09-23 05:47:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @cidcampante @Ragnasal2 @StJohnSmythe85 Ultimately it comes down to what is the nation? Who governs? If we are just individuals pursuing material gain, there's no reason you should care about nation, tradition, or values. But if you try to have a state command economy or just decree "equality," we see how that ends.
1308522606908379136 2020-09-23 05:44:35 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @DanieItmv I'll admit, that's a good line. 9/10 made me laugh.  I mean, really it just comes down to seeing capitalism and socialism as both flawed because they see economics as the key. We aren't just economic men. Efficiency and prosperity matter, but other things matter more.
1308521399712124935 2020-09-23 05:39:47 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @BelEsm127 I feel we could use a better term, but the theory seems fine. Basically what TR wanted. You have private property, but beyond a certain point, no, you don't get total market power. The state governs, not capital. And you have a basic safety net while still maintaining hierarchy.
1308516274402742273 2020-09-23 05:19:25 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> You can't support nationalism and capital. It's impossible. Its logical conclusion is the endless quest for cheap labor and short term profits, which leads to mass immigration, moral decay, and no identity other than consumerism. Socialism rots the body. Capitalism rots the soul.
1308515406597025796 2020-09-23 05:15:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Solutions - tax cuts for Google, let more felons vote, berate some Third World country into moving an embassy to Jerusalem.
1308512068123885568 2020-09-23 05:02:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> How many trillions have we spent? How many court orders? Bureaucracies created? "Programs" and "initiatives" and set-asides?  What's been the result? Yeah. Great work everyone. This dystopian hellhole is much better than conquering the stars or pursuing medical advances.
1308511195939377153 2020-09-23 04:59:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> In one case, you get a cool giant robot. In another, you have an entire society built around avoiding the consequences of school integration, even while praising it as a moral necessity.   Seems like an easy decision.
1308510762596470794 2020-09-23 04:57:31 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> No, I think that was the attempt to achieve racial equality.
1308510426750214146 2020-09-23 04:56:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Daily reminder to eliminate the liberal scribes.
1308510040962273280 2020-09-23 04:54:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Yeah if only the GOP would act like Poland's government instead of letting felons vote and pushing cheap labor at all costs.
1308462158590685184 2020-09-23 01:44:23 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> We must stop China from threatening this great way of life we all enjoy.
1308461997588086788 2020-09-23 01:43:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump Don't give him any ideas, the Trump DOJ will indict the corpse on federal hate crimes charges.
1308461810178236419 2020-09-23 01:43:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> President Trump and the GOP Congress used their two years of total power to give Mike Bloomberg a tax cut. Then, in the second two years, the major accomplishment was the First Step Act so felons can be released and vote.   This is what all those rallies in the Rust Belt led to.
1308460314334289921 2020-09-23 01:37:03 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "Won't" stop rioters.
1308397113777229824 2020-09-22 21:25:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> God almighty @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr do you not see this? Direct stimulus payments to citizens now, by any means necessary. That wins you the election. Not more culture war rhetoric, not mitigating COVID, not saying Democrats and journos aren't playing fair.
1308396676911173635 2020-09-22 21:24:11 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> A ban would not be enforceable. I would say it should be banned, I just don't think it would be practical. But it would be possible to levy a vice tax on these evil corporations and this entire sick industry. Use the money to fight sex trafficking.
1308396198081032195 2020-09-22 21:22:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Occidentan Fair enough.
1308395484801839107 2020-09-22 21:19:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> All the GOP needs to do to win this election is go hard on economic populism. It's not too late. UBI and break up or tax big tech. Remittance tax for the wall. Instead of bailing out corporations, send money to citizens. Same amount of money will be spent. Do it.   But they won't
1308393187921268737 2020-09-22 21:10:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "The Trumpification of the Republican Party was not the remaking of the Republican Party into a populist outfit... Instead, it was the reshaping of Trump into a mainline Republican."
1308393121265463296 2020-09-22 21:10:03 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @dooraven Agreed.
1308390994526777344 2020-09-22 21:01:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> GOP policy must shift in response
1308390330639712258 2020-09-22 20:58:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Occidentan I still think he will lose. But I feel like I should give you something if he wins and you prove me wrong.
1308284579069849602 2020-09-22 13:58:45 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @ChrisHaley22 @SelimSeesYou I think America will just go into a long, slow decline. It will stumble along, but it's like a zombie. There's nothing left. It just rots.   We could have had it all. We could be accomplishing wonders. But instead we threw it all away because people who hate us invented a word.

1308280935654199297 2020-09-22 13:44:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @NationalistTV @RonocReview Then he's done.
1308277282541309952 2020-09-22 13:29:45 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @BoySnakey @SelimSeesYou No there won't. Only thing we can do is move and build pockets of resistance that allow people to survive and have families. The USA, as far as I'm concerned, is totally spent.
1308275876388392960 2020-09-22 13:24:10 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @SelimSeesYou Dude, we are fucked. Have to assume the worst at this point. Just need to prepare for what's coming. Reading about South Africa in the early 90s... it will be worse than that.
1308274174742466560 2020-09-22 13:17:24 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @SelimSeesYou Honestly think this is how it will play out.

1308263162848915457 2020-09-22 12:33:39 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Cocaine Mitch is a GOP stooge but when he really wants to deliver, he can. I don't like a lot of his agenda, but he clearly has mastered the game as far as moving through votes.
1308262890626056192 2020-09-22 12:32:34 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @emeriticus You actually should run for something if you're in a conservative area.
1308255506633457664 2020-09-22 12:03:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @NOONELOVESMENOW Yup. What a scam.
1308255446579503104 2020-09-22 12:02:59 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @TrumpFailedUs Sweden has a far higher per capital death rate than Norway and Finland. I don't want to overstate things, it's not some apocalypse. But it's not a success story either.
1308254717286518784 2020-09-22 12:00:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Incidentally, President of France told everyone that they have to "live with the virus."   Few reporters having meltdowns about it. Because the alternative to the Establishment in France is Le Pen.
1308254553335361536 2020-09-22 11:59:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @FrankDeScushin Exactly. And so what if he overstated it? "I erred because I wanted to protect people. The CDC agrees with me."
1308254372296560641 2020-09-22 11:58:43 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @NYTDaniel After the funeral.
1308254266142994432 2020-09-22 11:58:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @4_Posterity American media is very quiet about Orban right now, because he shows what a nationalist leader could achieve during this period.   We are always told the Right uses "fear" to keep control, but instead, during this pandemic, the GOP tried to downplay fears. Huge mistake.
1308254015491395584 2020-09-22 11:57:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @LongDays10 @NOONELOVESMENOW Same. A lot of people are suffering. It's horrible. And it's not like the Democrats will make things any better. Just punish us more. Biden himself assured Wall Street donors that nothing fundamental would change.
1308253661106237441 2020-09-22 11:55:53 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @NOONELOVESMENOW I'm not disputing that at all. It's a travesty. Which is why I think the GOP should have gone all in on direct support for citizens - and nothing else - when this started. Instead we got a stupid bailout program filled with fraud and one check.
1308252917015642115 2020-09-22 11:52:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Meanwhile, in Hungary, Orban achieved highest approval rating in five years. Why? He closed the borders, emphasized security, and portrayed himself (accurately) as the defender of the people.   Trump message same as Bush's post 9/11 message. Go shopping.
1308252405038034944 2020-09-22 11:50:54 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Again, Trump was elected because we thought he would use power. He would use the state to protect supporters and punish opponents. He didn't. He talks different, but governs like a neoliberal. And he still gets called an "autocrat" anyway.
1308252139907579905 2020-09-22 11:49:50 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "The disease only hurts the elderly" is a bad message when the elderly are the people most likely to vote.
1308251938295820289 2020-09-22 11:49:02 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "But what about small businesses destroyed by the shutdowns?"  You're right. That's why you take the opportunity to crush Big Tech, save free speech online, and reward citizens with UBI for the duration.  But instead, the GOP wanted to make sure Jeff Bezos made more money.
1308251390209335301 2020-09-22 11:46:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Remember, when the pandemic started, President Trump received a boost in approval ratings. People wanted strong leadership and security. Instead, he tried to downplay.   If you are going to err, err in overstating the threat. Don't overpromise and underperform.
1308250972716707841 2020-09-22 11:45:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The problem is that Trump is NOT the power-hungry autocrat of the Left's imagination. If he was, he'd win easily. Instead of running on safety and security in the midst of a pandemic from overseas, instead of closing the borders and ordering shutdowns, he ran on the stock market.
1308248524849582086 2020-09-22 11:35:29 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @emeriticus That's it, the worst policy program I've ever seen. I'm done for the day.
1308248329034387456 2020-09-22 11:34:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @JonBownePolitix @justaclown8 @JoeBlog56220321 I don't know. The media's insane smear campaign against Roy Moore in Alabama (with the charges magically disappearing right after the election) convinced me that most people will go long with the Narrative. Even if the Narrative changes week by week.
1308246214668939264 2020-09-22 11:26:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Also, instead of 75 drachmas, all university endowments are seized and given to the citizens as a stimulus payment. Amazon is a utility. George Soros's citizenship is revoked.
1308245993079607296 2020-09-22 11:25:25 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This, only instead of Caesar's will it's a random piece of paper that President Trump says is Antonin Scalia's dying wish that only the first 13 constitutional amendments be considered valid.     https://t.co/PsENQS25Kq
1308237043349282816 2020-09-22 10:49:51 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I agree, it's absurd that Don Lemon gets privileged status under American law because of his race.
1308231865426481158 2020-09-22 10:29:17 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If the "color revolutions" are just harmless exercises to guarantee rights like freedom of speech, we'd see them in Western Europe.   Instead, same people who urge them on in Eastern Europe are screaming for further crackdowns on dissidents in the West.

1308218496652849152 2020-09-22 09:36:09 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Same journalists who will dig through hours of footage to use one line out of context against you - or just make one up - will run cover for their politicians.   Don't say this is "bad journalism." This is what it is and has always been.

Chasing people down become peaceful protesting. Also, the same journos who send online mobs against you run cover when there's blowback on their friends.
1308211995095818241 2020-09-22 09:10:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Just in case you're following at home, a complicated racial caste system backed by law, mass immigration, and an education system that fosters eternal racial conflict is the "uniting" position. Banning racial preferences in law and having one language is the "divisive" one.
1308203556000927746 2020-09-22 08:36:47 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @MysteryGrove @heywildrich Eliminate the liberal scribes.

1308179013748301826 2020-09-22 06:59:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "Eliminate the liberal scribes" is a slogan we can all get behind.
1308176129031843840 2020-09-22 06:47:48 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The Supreme Court is not a court. It's a legislature composed of 9 people. It is the highest authority in the land. Our entire system of government, the elections, and the entire farce is about who gets to sit on it. Our only concern is if the person will vote the right way.
1308174873022275584 2020-09-22 06:42:49 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Yes, but it would ensure conservatives take another L. Which is the objective. Really, the whole point of the "movement."

1308166976716627969 2020-09-22 06:11:26 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PaulFor86 There will absolutely be a push to outlaw homeschooling. You can't have children who are learning real history, science, and math. The fact it outperforms public schools is why it must be banned. No escape must be allowed.
1308166444174258178 2020-09-22 06:09:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> These idiots are willing to go down with the ship for "limited government" rather than provide Americans stimulus payments.   Trump delivers for white working class, he wins. He sticks with oligarchs who hate him anyway, he loses. This isn't hard.
1308164747892854784 2020-09-22 06:02:35 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Maybe I'm being too conspiratorial, but this feels like a tactic to get TV addicted AWFL's to regard homeschooling as low status.   Homeschooled students outperform public school students on standardized tests. One wonders if that's a reason why they want to scrap the tests.
1308125058481741829 2020-09-22 03:24:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This collaborator wants to make sure that you have no escape from the System, no power, no sovereignty, nothing. And when it's all said and done, no matter how much he grovels, no matter how eagerly he betrays, he'll just be remembered (if at all) as another racist white male.

1308116121271316480 2020-09-22 02:49:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "RBG" was a progressive hero because she wasn't a judge. She was a reliable vote. She knew the desired outcome she wanted and rationalized backwards to justify it.   Conservatives should demand the same. The Court is a political body, a small legislature, nothing more.
1308108002801651716 2020-09-22 02:17:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This didn't just "happen." A vast alliance between Big Business, academia, nonprofits, and journos encourages and justifies this.  I don't want to hear a single thing about the Uyghurs from Republicans. Yes, they are oppressed and it's sad. But we are under tyranny, here, now.

1308073426394001416 2020-09-21 23:59:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Notice how few conservatives will mention Jake Gardner. Instead, they are playing footsie with liberals who want to promote their books.   Entirely controlled opposition. It's designed to lose.
1308073160475058176 2020-09-21 23:58:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @mhdksafa Well, yes, they get government privileges in jobs and education and congressional districts are drawn to ensure that they have their own representatives to speak specifically for their community.   Somehow, I don't think whites will enjoy the same privileges if we are a minority.
1308071237902630914 2020-09-21 23:51:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Yes, they want you dead. They will celebrate it. Conservatives, I don't want to hear one word about China, or Russia, or Iran. The people who want you dead are here, now, in office.

Look at the global wailing over Orania in South Africa. One tiny town. And they can't let it exist. It works too well.    https://t.co/xmJ34Lv4Vr
1307881265618714626 2020-09-21 11:16:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @katnandu @glennbeck If you import 600 million foreigners into America, America becomes something else, not "our country." When Han Chinese become the majority in Tibet, or Hindus in Kashmir, or when European settlers outnumbered American Indians, it was demographic conquest. This would be too.
1307877525146738694 2020-09-21 11:01:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Jack's fine. It's a "virtual public square" when it's time to own DRUMPF, otherwise it's a private company. California has a law that prohibits discrimination on political grounds, didn't do any good. Law, like all political questions, is just who/whom? Nothing else matters.

They understand that a majority Third World America is a different country, a conquered territory. It's a South African style one party "democracy."
1307868240765423616 2020-09-21 10:24:22 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Journalists understand that population replacement in Tibet or Xinjiang has political consequences. They understand that it means the dispossession of those who live there.   They pretend this doesn't hold true in America. Indeed, being replaced means you are somehow "stronger."

That's not their highest goal. I don't think they even care one way or the other. They lose, it's off to the lobbying job.

Main differences this time are Biden is not nearly as unpopular as Hillary, and the media is guarding him like a fanatic Praetorian Guard. Didn't do same for Hillary. Also less independent media.
1307828138181824512 2020-09-21 07:45:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It infuriates me beyond words that we are going to lose our country because, in the aftermath of the most unlikely victory in political history, the GOP went for one last round of tax cuts for George Soros and Jeff Bezos before it was demographically overwhelmed.

Can you imagine living in a society where dissidents can't use basic services, or there's selective law enforcement, or mass migration is used as a tool to dispossess citizens? What a nightmare.
1307821156708347904 2020-09-21 07:17:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Recognizing that we are occupied, that we are oppressed, that all the slogans about "white privilege" are simply the propaganda our rulers use to justify their actual, concrete power, is the first step to doing something about it.   Chest beating or comforting lies don't help.

But if you go to a protest, try to argue with BLM rioters, defend your property (rather than a direct, imminent threat to your life), you are done. The state is on the other side.

Once it becomes a true story and actual news, it is no longer worthy of coverage by the mainstream media. It is relegated to conservative outlets which will be deplatformed soon anyway.

The "human rights" I want are those of speech, self-defense, and association, which, I'm increasingly told by "civil rights groups," I can't have.

That's why progressives opposed it until "I hate whites" became their entire worldview. You can't be pro-worker and pro-immigration. They don't "co-opt" the movements. They fund them. Chamber of Commerce consistently pushes for more immigration.

1307755658880712706 2020-09-21 02:57:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Anthony__Koch Given that the "democratically elected government" allows no actual sovereignty or control over your own life, the authoritarian choice is obvious.   Democracy is a tool, not an end in itself. If you are in a society where people who hate you can outvote you, how are you free?

The real crisis is that the Judicial Branch is far more powerful than any other branch, even though it was supposed to be the weakest.

Unfortunately, you can't have both most of the time. Look at divorce, depression rates, alcoholism, etc.   Affordable family formation should be a goal of state policy.

The "satire" created by the movie failed and inadvertently made the system look even better.   Many such cases in art.

1307550226539057154 2020-09-20 13:20:41 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It's remarkable how "women's rights" has ultimately just been reduced to "abortion."

1306405502092443649 2020-09-17 09:31:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Tuckerfan3 That is very true. However, the Republicans also pulled direct stimulus payments from their version of the bill. Certainly not defending the Democrats on that one though.
1306405072151236615 2020-09-17 09:30:15 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> That business about it being a social construct goes right out the window when it comes to divvying up the gibs.
1306337369143074820 2020-09-17 05:01:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> He could win it in a day. Direct stimulus payments, UBI for duration of the pandemic. Redirect bailouts from big business to ordinary Americans.   But remember, the GOP Senate specifically stepped in to make sure there would be no more stimulus. Why, unless they wanted to lose?

1306336086743019521 2020-09-17 04:56:08 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> However, the entire purpose of Conservatism Inc. is to make sure economic populism is suppressed. Instead we get vague culture war talk with no follow up.   Movement conservatives can't wait to get back to quibbling over budget deficits in the post-Trump era.
1306300425474318340 2020-09-17 02:34:25 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Even National Review, which I'm sure wanted to believe this story was true, dismisses it.   Yet the lie has been told, tens of millions will believe it, and disinformation about "Russia killing American soldiers" will remain on every social media platform forever.

This bizarre complacency among Trump supporters reminds me of 2018. Evidence showing he is losing in just about every state he needs to win is just hand waved away.
1306091712897576960 2020-09-16 12:45:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Biden is outperforming Trump nationally and in swing states compared to Hillary Clinton in 2016.

You can bash Russia safely because Russia has so little influence. You will face no consequences for it.

UBI may be a means to free people by removing the economic weapon the System uses to punish dissidents.
1305696894795030531 2020-09-15 10:36:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PaulFor86 @emeriticus I don't disagree, but I think (and have been saying since 2013) that Universal Basic Income would be the best way to win over working class voters whose jobs have been shipped overseas. Can't just give them nothing but free market slogans.

1305376265373974528 2020-09-14 13:22:09 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The problem here is pretending that Martin Luther King wanted something fundamentally different. It's not an insult or an argument or a distortion to say he was a democratic socialist. That's what he was. You can say that's good or bad, but you can't say he was conservative.

Furthermore, we must spread this way of life across the globe. No one can be allowed to escape "Our Democracy."
1305272065222639616 2020-09-14 06:28:05 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I'd like to believe this is true. But at the end of Trump's first term, Steve King is gone, Jeff Sessions was driven out of public life (by Trump), Kobach not nominated. Are there any "America First" politicians left in Congress?
1305271263431217155 2020-09-14 06:24:54 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> I've always thought the Bay of Pigs was a good metaphor for the American conservative movement's m.o. Send a bunch of people into hostile territory, let the Reds blow them apart, refuse to send the promised support, and then blame them for the whole mess when it's over.
1305241524318461952 2020-09-14 04:26:44 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Remember, it's those who question this who are being "divisive." Having separate racial anthems is what it means to be "united."   Also, whites don't get one. Shut up and keep paying your taxes and buying football tickets, simps. This system won't pay for itself.

Suburban voters, "moderate" Republicans, non-socialist Dems, progressives who hold their nose and pull the lever for neoliberalism because they hate Trump (or what he represented).
1305237934510149634 2020-09-14 04:12:28 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PaulFor86 Same as in Europe. There are nationalists and New Left types, with various subgroups within those larger categories. Everyone wants systemic change. Few want to vote for existing system, let alone fight to expand it to the rest of the world.
1305237592556871684 2020-09-14 04:11:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Notice the over 65's breaking for Biden. Biden is the "return to normality" candidate, where we can all go back to pretending things will be fine. And, given Left's platform control, that illusion can be sustained for a very long time.   COVID also a factor.

1305185463096029184 2020-09-14 00:43:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Optics check, aisle three.   Remember, "we hope they die" is the mainstream journo position. These are the people the System protects.
1304833982249545728 2020-09-13 01:27:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> *People shaking hands, dancing, and celebrating*  &gt;"Never in my life have I seen anything this disgusting."  Perfectly normal reaction. Remember, we're the "haters."
1304629565382422530 2020-09-12 11:55:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If you resist it, that's racist. If you acknowledge it, that is also racist and now you have to "do the work." If you say "shut up and leave me alone, I don't care about your jargon" that's the most racist thing of all, because being "colorblind" is white privilege defined.
1304627409401131008 2020-09-12 11:46:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @AmericanRighty No, I save that kind of talk for Irish people like me.
1304627028390445058 2020-09-12 11:44:57 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @GlennLittle5 Can't argue with that.
1304625694069194752 2020-09-12 11:39:38 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> And the journos want war not because of any "national security" or even economic reasons. It's just sheer ethnic hatred of Russians as such, which for some reason is celebrated in "American" media -  https://t.co/PVh457dhGa  2/2
1304625482072297475 2020-09-12 11:38:48 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The Union State won't happen (I don't think it serves Russian interests at this point) but if the upcoming Lukashenko-Putin talks even suggest it, the journos are going to be screaming for World War III. 1/2   https://t.co/QouSie6dFL

1304596205385768960 2020-09-12 09:42:28 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Boris41552570 @PhilippusArabus You lose efficiency either way. But if you simply redistribute wealth, you aren't breaking the price system or creating flawed incentives the same way you do with our current health care policies. A direct UBI is more efficient than gov't directly running health care, for example
1304593626182361088 2020-09-12 09:32:13 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Boris41552570 @PhilippusArabus It's a separate question as to whether the money should be spent. It's a fait accompli that it will. So where will it do the most good politically? Generally speaking, if you have to redistribute income, the most efficient way to do it is simply send cash, not muddle with prices.
1304591131527843840 2020-09-12 09:22:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Boris41552570 @PhilippusArabus The GOP Senate has already endorsed a "skinny" bill which will cost an outrageous amount of money. I'm suggesting that money is best spent with direct stimulus payments, rather than the other ends it will be directed to.
1304590705927630849 2020-09-12 09:20:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Boris41552570 I think it would be far more efficient to send checks to citizens directly instead of the ridiculous bailouts that the last stimulus bill contained. It's less a question of "how much" and more a question of the best way to spend money that's being spent anyway.
1304586531802419201 2020-09-12 09:04:01 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The surprising thing is not that Biden is winning. It's that it is still close and that POTUS might still win unless journos can shove him over the finish line.
1304584841107779584 2020-09-12 08:57:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @RichardHanania Yeah, it's not shocking. It's just the same old absurdity. Just vaguely thought that maybe a crisis would spark some new thinking.   Nope.
1304583341300166657 2020-09-12 08:51:21 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "What is to be done" is basically the same regardless of who wins election (which at this point I still think will be Biden, though a lot can change). POTUS was valuable in removing illusions and forcing media to be openly partisan.
1304583034700738562 2020-09-12 08:50:08 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PhilippusArabus I mean, just do it. If it goes to the courts, it goes to the courts. But at least fight on that issue.
1304582120652890114 2020-09-12 08:46:30 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PhilippusArabus Don't know. He's broached using unreleased coronavirus program funds to provide stimulus. Constitutionality is in question. Of course, the problem is with Senate GOP leadership, which I'm convinced seriously wants to lose so they can go back to being "fiscal conservatives"
1304581577683480576 2020-09-12 08:44:20 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Look what you've done @stone_toss
1304580463500165121 2020-09-12 08:39:55 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @PhilippusArabus I just wish he actually was the the uber-nationalist, power-crazed guy the Left imagines. I mean, why wouldn't you push for more direct payments to Americans? Why not challenge Senate GOP leadership?
1304578999817994241 2020-09-12 08:34:06 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Shocking that POTUS hasn't pushed harder for Universal Basic Income at least until pandemic recedes. Haven't heard much from Kamala Harris about her UBI plan since she got VP nominee.  The two parties seem to be in competition about who is most willing to defend neoliberalism.

America can count on India, Japan, Taiwan, the Sunni Arab states. Not sure what Turkey, our brave NATO "ally" would do. Probably go all out into Syria while Russia is tied down.

1303442230074650624 2020-09-09 05:16:59 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> The GOP bill should be nothing but stimulus checks at far higher amounts, given directly to citizens.   This is what I mean when I say that it's not true to say "the Republicans will do anything to stay in power." They go to the mat for stupid and unpopular causes.

1303403888725368833 2020-09-09 02:44:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Interesting the president RT'd this. Of course, we need action (use of state power), not just signal boosting and faux outrage.
1303339182618746887 2020-09-08 22:27:30 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If I had to place a bet on the next war between great powers, it's going to be between India and China. Neither government has any interest to back down in the latest border clash. Don't think it's likely, but certainly not unthinkable.
1303322093619220486 2020-09-08 21:19:36 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "Trust the science." "Actually, don't."  It's not like President Trump is the one making the vaccines. There are reasons to not get it right away, but blaming POTUS is not one.

1303201869309804544 2020-09-08 13:21:52 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @Heinric92296607 Very possible. Very possible Biden would too.   The War Party rules all.
1303201241338720258 2020-09-08 13:19:22 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @dpinsen I do give him credit for other things. This is just one of them.   He's disappointed me and made some catastrophic decisions. But he's basically got the entire media against him as a bloc. Even Nixon never faced this.
1303197915150798849 2020-09-08 13:06:09 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> One thing I will give President Trump credit for is that he has not started another war. (Yes, he bombed Syria, but at least he didn't totally invade as many insisted.)  It's sad that this is such a low bar, but few recent presidents have managed to clear it.
1303195247938285571 2020-09-08 12:55:33 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @CountryGuy_1 Really need to bring back the Bull Moose Party.

1301949496176279553 2020-09-05 02:25:23 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Journos treat President Trump unfairly. They lie. He faces obstacles like no other POTUS. We know this.   However, he hired those who betrayed him, didn't defend his supporters online, and handed over his agenda to the GOP he had just beaten. Buck stops with him, not Kushner.
1301948253970337794 2020-09-05 02:20:27 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Of course, this is why it was so critically important for @realDonaldTrump to defend independent media online. However, the conservative movement also benefits from censorship and keeping debate tightly controlled. So there's nothing to push back against the Narrative. 2/2
1301947938466394114 2020-09-05 02:19:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> He never will be . Platform control is all. Journos could report "from anonymous sources" that Trump personally unleashed COVID-19 from a secret weapons lab and 51% of the public would believe. Meanwhile, you could have Biden caught doing anything, and they will protect him. 1/2

1301767895576383488 2020-09-04 14:23:46 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> If President Trump wants to win the election, it has nothing to do with antifa or fake news.   Stimulus checks for the duration. Pay Americans, crush the virus, take credit for economic recovery.   This should have been done months ago.

Also, still need to review your book.

I was basically at 60/40 Election Night because I was getting phone calls from friends in the Rust Belt that he was going to flip them. And there was just that feeling that he had destiny on his side.

1300963653349519361 2020-09-02 09:08:00 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Joy Reid should blame Russian hackers and say it's all a deepfake.   It worked for her before, it should work again.
1300962822403371008 2020-09-02 09:04:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @groyper_boston That's more a question of faith than anything. Put it this way. In 2015, I never would have predicted things would be this bad if Trump won. But I don't think the "worse is better" theory always works. What I think needs to be done is the same regardless of who wins.
1300957496266362880 2020-09-02 08:43:32 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @theistinthought If the media was even remotely balanced, even 25/75, no question. But it's not. I just don't think one guy can take on the entire media sans a few hosts on Fox News and OANN.   And frankly, it's on Trump for not doing more to defend free speech online.
1300957231211524098 2020-09-02 08:42:29 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @groyper_boston I'm just calling it as I see it. As Peter Brimelow will confirm, I'm a (short-term) pessimist by nature. I won't deny that Trump is fighting an insane battle against outrageous opposition. But he made it worse for himself with certain policy and personnel choices. That's on him.
1300956304769417217 2020-09-02 08:38:48 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @OtakuCarnival The CCP funded "Midway," one of the few pro-American movies in recent years. Hollywood refused.
1300953327669260288 2020-09-02 08:26:58 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Very critical of President Trump and think he'll lose. But he's out there talking with people, doing constant press conferences, handling back and forth with hostile journos.   Biden is nowhere and will never face a hostile question.  "Trump had a stroke!"  Seems like projection.

1300938058485903360 2020-09-02 07:26:18 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @ejamion Would you agree that small businesses in American cities downtown are suffering because of the riots and protests? And does Amazon have the right to determine what can and cannot be sold, given its control over bookselling and de facto state subsides?
1300936206373605378 2020-09-02 07:18:56 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @MichaelMcl1970 We all do. The Romans had it right when it came to the social status of entertainers.
1300933482919743488 2020-09-02 07:08:07 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @ejamion It receives public subsidies via government contracts and below-rate postage from the USPS. Amazon censors what can be sold. With small business destroyed via the 1-2 punch of lockdowns and BLM, it is a de facto monopoly. Break it up or use state power to enforce free speech.
1300928218711678980 2020-09-02 06:47:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Who would you prefer runs Hollywood?
1300927985248350209 2020-09-02 06:46:16 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> @ejamion Neither. Big Tech, which is why I favor regulating Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and other companies as public utilities, breaking them up, or outright nationalizing them.

1300878108632002561 2020-09-02 03:28:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Counterpoint: this is journalism and what it always has been. There was never a time where there were "good" journalists. It's always been a tactic, a form of activism.   We just didn't have as many ways to fact check journos' in the 60s and 70s. They were lying then too. #AJAB
1300873860238147584 2020-09-02 03:11:12 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> 2016 happened because liberals were complacent, journos at least pretended to be even-handed, and speech was relatively free. None of that is true now. There is absolutely no way you won't get record turnout from Dem base. Complacency by Trump is worst possible attitude. 2/2
1300873211035504641 2020-09-02 03:08:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> This sudden complacency among Trump voters is baffling. You have Drudge 24/7 anti-Trump, independent media censored, Biden still leading in almost every poll, winning in fundraising, and journos protecting him at all costs. Trump is losing right now. This is 2018, not 2016. 1/2
1300872507910750208 2020-09-02 03:05:49 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "These are peaceful protests, not riots." "Actually, riots are good." "Riots are actually bad and right-wingers are doing it." "Right-wingers are rioting based on Trump's rhetoric."  There's no problem as they transition from one narrative to the next. It could be anything.
1300871198633611264 2020-09-02 03:00:37 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> "People won't believe these ridiculous lies from the media!"  Yes, they will. If CNN said, "Russian Spetsnaz are burning down cities on Trump's orders," millions would just roll with it and it would be trending within seconds. Facts don't matter. Platform control does.
1300867578944987141 2020-09-02 02:46:14 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Reaching levels of gaslighting that shouldn't even be possible.

1300814750360784899 2020-09-01 23:16:19 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Birthright citizenship should be abolished and the franchise should be earned, not given as a right.   Beyond that, American citizens who move to new states should not be allowed to vote in state or local elections for at least five years. Federalism is meaningless otherwise.
1300813088359362562 2020-09-01 23:09:42 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Conservatism Inc: "We have to save capitalists from socialism!" Capitalists:

1300805805839654919 2020-09-01 22:40:46 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> When conservatives are celebrating that liberals are leaving the cities, they're cheering political colonization. Few will vote differently or connect their actions to their beliefs. They'll go to the South, Appalachia, or Idaho and think, "Well we need some changes here."
1300805120595197953 2020-09-01 22:38:03 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> It's dangerous to think people will respond to things getting worse by switching to the Right. Instead, I think we'll just enter a post-partisan age, with the Democrats running America the way the ANC runs South Africa. There will be elections, but it won't mean much.

1300795419421798408 2020-09-01 21:59:30 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Told you it would work. All Biden needs to do is just mutter something vague about violence being bad and blame Trump. Journos will do the rest. The facts are completely irrelevant. Most people will believe what they are told, no matter how absurd.
1300643815116673044 2020-09-01 11:57:04 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Pretty revealing that the only anti-looting argument that seems to get through to lefties is, "Stop doing that, you'll scare naive white people into voting for Trump, and we need to make sure we have total power first before we destroy them."
1300642240503705600 2020-09-01 11:50:49 +0800 <VDAREJamesK> Biden's speech was basically, "Look, I'm the hapless goofy guy that you love from those Onion parodies, I'm no threat." It will prove effective. One question from any reporter would detonate the entire Narrative, but journos see their job as getting him in. They will guard him.
