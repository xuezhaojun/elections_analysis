1344064154987094016 2020-12-30 07:34:00 +0800 <MichiganWave> @KMGVictoria Esp ironic given that Pfizer delayed announcing the October completion of the vaccine...obviously to hinder Trump &amp; help Biden-Kampala.  Kampala should know that BigPharma is fully on her team.
1344062674674589711 2020-12-30 07:28:07 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NoTatsClassy Living with parents after age 22 has an insidious, emasculating &amp; demoralizing effect on men. It exacerbates the infantilization of society.
1344061527909920770 2020-12-30 07:23:34 +0800 <MichiganWave> It makes perfect sense that the Hive-assimilated Jimmy Wales of wikipedia married a former aide to Tony Blair &amp; Neil Kinnock.  A parasitic power couple of the technocratic, globohomo Anti-White Davoisie.
1343819484621135872 2020-12-29 15:21:46 +0800 <MichiganWave> The Trump campaign ended the Nov 3 cycle w/ a 7 Million surplus. But they're still - almost daily since Nov 6th - relentlessly texting &amp; emailing for more donations. Who is running this fundraiser &amp; why don't Trump-Pence put a halt to it? They're going to sour then anger the Base
1343792588827074560 2020-12-29 13:34:54 +0800 <MichiganWave> @VDAREJamesK Sure hope he's got some good cards to play in the next 10 days.  There's a worst case scenario he'll be tempted towards by Ronna McDaniel types. It would see him do nothing but abide more Jared Kushner vampire antics till Jan 20th. It would scuttle his legacy &amp; scatter the Base
1343788004071108616 2020-12-29 13:16:41 +0800 <MichiganWave> @chrissyclark_ He's relevant because he speaks uncomfortable truths &amp; challenges corrupt globalist politicians. Looking at your t/l, it seems to be yet more CON Inc shilling &amp; enforcing taboos against criticism of protected classes
1343725384261644288 2020-12-29 09:07:51 +0800 <MichiganWave> Suppose the GOPe worldview is complementary to the paradigm of Anarcho-Tyranny:  Austerity ("fiscal prudence"), Atomisation &amp; Misery for locked-down, unemployed Citizens, +  Largesse, favors &amp; infinite debt-financed goodies for lobbyists, foreign govts &amp; Oligarchs

1343640841219428360 2020-12-29 03:31:54 +0800 <MichiganWave> A 40+ year legal culture is in place that enables fraud. Only in the US is there Lefty/NAACP talk of fighting "voter suppression" which really means fighting voter ID &amp; proof of citizenship, proof of local residence.

They didn't recall how the system drove Pat Buchanan, Pete Wilson, Tom Tancredo, Ron Paul, even Dana Rohrabacher out of the public square.   They/We forgot that the msm is Enemy #1.

1343482290391887872 2020-12-28 17:01:53 +0800 <MichiganWave> @KulakAmerican72 @ramzpaul Uh no. Eventually ppl get bored, impatient &amp; move onto something else. At this rate, he's going to be remembered for letting his rotten son-in-law hijack the WH.
1343481565549092865 2020-12-28 16:59:00 +0800 <MichiganWave> @HbdNrx The time to have upended those parameters of subversion was way back in Sept-Oct 2016 when the GOPe was already planning to stymie his agenda in the unlikely event of a win.  There's a huge lesson there.

1343477071264284677 2020-12-28 16:41:09 +0800 <MichiganWave> Tweet of the Day.  Thank you Pedro!
1343476628656173057 2020-12-28 16:39:23 +0800 <MichiganWave> It says as much about the ppl the who captured the WH staff/GOPe &amp; cabinet as anything. Trump's not ideological at all. He's somebody who likes campaigning &amp; who spent most of his 4 yrs in a futile quest to woo Blacks, the White left, soccer moms, &amp; naifs. He craves popularity
1343457781693747201 2020-12-28 15:24:30 +0800 <MichiganWave> @KingofShirgar is on point in his latest, re: Mitch McConnell,  "He is a small, turtle man who takes no risks. He likes his life...wading in the swamp with all the other disgusting creatures of Washington DC.."

1343446483014725633 2020-12-28 14:39:36 +0800 <MichiganWave> Correct. The foreign threats are trivial in the short term. Right now we're ruled by parasites &amp; morons. It's all domestic. Aided &amp; abetted by an Alienist media-edu-govt complex
1343443995242999809 2020-12-28 14:29:43 +0800 <MichiganWave> More demaskings to come thru late-Jan. We'll get to see the final group of fake Nationalists decamp as their jockeying begins for 2024. The conundrum they face is that there won't an election at all on current (looting) trends. USA social capital will be all picked from the bones
1343441482469027841 2020-12-28 14:19:44 +0800 <MichiganWave> Trump may have a high card to play in the next 2 weeks, but he won't help himself by demoralizing the Base. FWIW, he may be incapable of fighting the fraud when he's surrounded by subversives. The staffing damage &amp; WH capture by CON Inc gatekeepers in 2017 may have been fatal.
1343428326908686336 2020-12-28 13:27:27 +0800 <MichiganWave> @HeritageAmeric6 @TuckersCokeDen It's hugely incentivized to align with the Anti-White coalition. Even Megan Markle who's only 1/4 or 1/8 Black uses Anti-White, Anti-Formality grievances to animate her quest.
1343425449158987776 2020-12-28 13:16:01 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Azrael556_Fet Always b grateful 4 the Trump of June 2015 to April 2017. And for him not starting any new wars, sharply reducing refugee &amp; other immigr flows. And for his attacks on media scum &amp; then exposing Swamp corruption. But mayb in the end, his achilles was surrounding himself w/ weasels
1343423332289568768 2020-12-28 13:07:36 +0800 <MichiganWave> &amp; remembered only as a weak, approval seeking shell of a person. Someone who was undone by trying to win over ppl who will always despise him &amp; despise the historic American nation. Trump must remain loyal to, &amp; fight for those who supported him. If not, he risks jello-man status
1343420704788774912 2020-12-28 12:57:10 +0800 <MichiganWave> There's a justified widespread anger at obvious vote fraud in at least 6 states. Compounded by arrogant Uniparty-media moves to conceal it &amp; resume Swamp politics as usual. If Trump is seen as just blustering &amp; insincere in his attempts to stop the steal, he'll end up isolated...
1343415558319038464 2020-12-28 12:36:43 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JOttoPohl1 Wonder if Soros orgs are active in China. Tend to think of the biggest US connections there being supply chain types who feed Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Lowe's, Apple, ToysRUs, Walgreens &amp; CVS etc.
1343413691534995456 2020-12-28 12:29:18 +0800 <MichiganWave> @ramzpaul Gonna wait a bit b4 concluding, but there's a risk Trump is simply following the advice of GOPe snakes in his inner circle. Real chance he will throw away America First &amp; Anti-Fraud energies in these last few weeks simply cuz of Kushnerian, Neocon sabotage &amp; misplaced trust  Sad.
1343400143954059266 2020-12-28 11:35:28 +0800 <MichiganWave> @peterbrimelow @AnnCoulter Ivanka would have no natural base of support. She's just abt her brand &amp; the uniparty status quo, with a token glaze of populism. It's pitiful that she imagines she has any political future.

1343370576820400128 2020-12-28 09:37:58 +0800 <MichiganWave> Just so long as they can keep out the ADL &amp; various Barbara Lerner-Spectre, Tim Wise types.
1343369962505854976 2020-12-28 09:35:32 +0800 <MichiganWave> @VDAREJamesK Trump risks frittering away all the Base's energy with demoralizing compromises like this, esp when combined w/ Jared Kushner's vampiric exploitation of MAGA
1343367693815177216 2020-12-28 09:26:31 +0800 <MichiganWave> Schumer wants to mimic Sen Feinstein &amp; stay in power till he's in his 90s. Tikkun olam is his raison d'Ãªtre.
1343367082054983682 2020-12-28 09:24:05 +0800 <MichiganWave> Absolutely correct. The Uniparty feigned tolerance for Trump where they were compelled to but were yearning for him to disappear. They wanted so badly to resume the pre-2016 Donor class game

1342984250329620481 2020-12-27 08:02:51 +0800 <MichiganWave> A huge eg of Alienism &amp; Anti-White predation being allowed to preempt feminism is the spate of gang rapes of English girls by mostly MENA,  Pakistani perps ~1995-2015. This has spread to other N European countries.  Feminism simply leaves White families more fragile &amp; vulnerable
1342981272134688768 2020-12-27 07:51:01 +0800 <MichiganWave> @quindle A harbinger of the disposibility of feminism, (esp for Whites) was how Nicole Brown's memory &amp; suffering was treated after she was murdered by OJ Simpson. Feminism's mostly a tactical ploy to subvert majority White societies for the sake of Corporatism &amp; the Great Replacement
1342969080735805445 2020-12-27 07:02:34 +0800 <MichiganWave> &amp; matriarchal culture of the Hindu Indian diaspora. Similar to the Reform/Secular Jewish culture, &amp; the SJWism in Pozzed Protestant, Nordcuck groups. Ultimately, feminism is disposable for these groups. It'll take a back seat to Anti-White tribalism &amp; Surveillance Corporatism
1342967423520137221 2020-12-27 06:55:59 +0800 <MichiganWave> There's a notion from the Manosphere that the rise of Kampala is confirmation of the feminine imperative; a looming feminist power grab.

1342253803861647366 2020-12-25 07:40:19 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JOttoPohl1 @Semiogogue The assumption embedded in this lawfare &amp; defamation is that majority non-White precincts cannot be scrutinized cause to do so would be on par with attacks by the KKK. The SPLC/ADL/NAACP(Legal Dept) simply insist that White Gentiles remain docile &amp; accept the new anarcho-tyranny
1342252448761716737 2020-12-25 07:34:56 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JOttoPohl1 @Semiogogue It's of a type.  The same milieu are pushing the narrative that challenging the results = racism. eg. this guy Sam Spital (yeah EST) from the NAACP.

1342174964858945537 2020-12-25 02:27:02 +0800 <MichiganWave> EMJ's worldview is actually quite dangerous for Whites in a World approaching 10 Billion.  It's his underlying Blank Slate Cornucopianism, and view of Christianity as a Globalist solvent which would doom us.  To a large extent (60-70%), culture is downstream from biology.

1341920115294679048 2020-12-24 09:34:21 +0800 <MichiganWave> A bigger prob is that the populist Left is too feminine, too consensus seeking. It fears being branded w/ X-ist labels by the establishment. As soon as any Lefties are merely neutral on Whites,  they get scolded back into line w/ Anti-White Progs. To maintain calm, they obey.
1341917075191832576 2020-12-24 09:22:16 +0800 <MichiganWave> Another eg of how BigTech's addiction to scale &amp; infinite growth is cancerous. When combined with a craven, lickspittle political class, it means there's no controls on Amazon's predatory or parasitic urges. Amazon is as one  w/ the thieves in China who steal Western inventions
1341903713343057920 2020-12-24 08:29:11 +0800 <MichiganWave> @VDAREJamesK Seems the ADL/SPLC/Soros have a veto on what forms of Leftism are allowed to have a voice. Anything that deviates will be tagged as "Russian disinfo" or another form of "hate". The structural prob is that independent minded Leftists, esp Whites, are a shrinking, powerless group.
1341902238395084800 2020-12-24 08:23:19 +0800 <MichiganWave> Being White sympatico (or even 1st World sympatico) is taboo within all platformed forms of Leftism. After Obama caved to the demands of Oligarchs in 2009-10, the Left's ringleaders have worked 24/7 to make Alienism &amp; CultMarx the only socially permitted opposition to CON Inc
1341783730764058629 2020-12-24 00:32:25 +0800 <MichiganWave> @VDAREJamesK McConnell would certainly prefer to lose the Senate than to support the average taxpayer &amp; the GOP Base over the Donor class. McConnell hates those who elected him that much. Shocking how he has internalized SwampThink.

1341589347691360258 2020-12-23 11:40:00 +0800 <MichiganWave> @LindseyGrahamSC It's a disgrace. Throw the whole thing into a Cogen incinerator &amp; start over. Just a 1 page bill with relief for citizens.
1341588673037529088 2020-12-23 11:37:19 +0800 <MichiganWave> BigTech sees its host countries as places to be pacified, dominated &amp; ultimately, to be transformed into holding pens for docile consumer units.
1341573694146170881 2020-12-23 10:37:48 +0800 <MichiganWave> @AugustusReditus @almightygenie OK, but the ulterior motive for creating the cartoon enemy is to sustain a kind of fake politics or politics of release valves &amp; blind alleys
1341559090007445504 2020-12-23 09:39:46 +0800 <MichiganWave> Amazing how the market dominant arrivistes are so eager to play the ShameWhitey Game that they don't even pause to get their backstory or vizmin cred watertight.  As tho our economic zones are just piÃ±atas for adolescents
1341557789290848256 2020-12-23 09:34:36 +0800 <MichiganWave> @KMGVictoria When you challenged the clichÃ© that "the road to hell is paved with good intentions", countering that it was the exact opposite of the truth, it seemed a bit of a straw man. That clichÃ© should be phrased, "the road to hell is paved with naivetÃ©, magical thinking, &amp; gullibility"
1341550813848735745 2020-12-23 09:06:53 +0800 <MichiganWave> @almightygenie @rbobbison Exactemente. Lol. Ari Shapiro, Gwen Ifill &amp; Robert Segal
1341550323148709888 2020-12-23 09:04:56 +0800 <MichiganWave> @almightygenie The prob w/ this thinking is that it leads to despair &amp; a futility mind. Sure, there's subversion aplenty. But we don't obsess over it; we fight it &amp; overcome it when needed.
1341547130335408128 2020-12-23 08:52:15 +0800 <MichiganWave> @almightygenie Haven't listened to those guys in ages, but that seemed to mean:  "colonize all political parties so a form of political theater can be crafted which keeps our tribe powerful always"
1341546143264759808 2020-12-23 08:48:19 +0800 <MichiganWave> The scam that Grahamnesty runs is to feign allegiance with the GOP Base in the 9 months before he needs re-election. Then he reverts to Donor class servility. He's an actor who wants GOP votes &amp; money, but his first loyalty is to Globalism &amp; the Plutocrats
1341543324956708865 2020-12-23 08:37:07 +0800 <MichiganWave> Agreed.  Floydtown.  Nest of the Clownocracy
1341485312854401025 2020-12-23 04:46:36 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JOttoPohl1 German &amp; Polish stock Illinois seem to be the rock of many White middle class, working class suburbs. Get the sense they are retiring out of state, moving to points south.
1341484146993016838 2020-12-23 04:41:58 +0800 <MichiganWave> Mass 3rd World immigration is very useful to corrupt Blue state politicians. It means they can replace their fleeing citizen residents w/ new residents who are more tolerant of corruption (cuz they have much lower standards &amp; deploy their own personal cheating to join the fiesta)
1341474221592088581 2020-12-23 04:02:32 +0800 <MichiganWave> Yeah most of the West has collapsed into a looting spree by various parasite groups &amp; lots of sadism, iconoclasm, erasure of the past.   Used to be a war on the symbols of the pre-1960 years, now it's most things pre-1990.
1341264953236484097 2020-12-22 14:10:59 +0800 <MichiganWave> If Loeffler &amp; Perdue are going to use Nimrata &amp; her CON Inc fluff as a ploy to win, then they damn well deserve to lose.   They're distracting the GOP Base from the real issues. They want votes from ppl who they won't stand up for &amp; are embarrassed to be in the same party with.
1341263089103228933 2020-12-22 14:03:34 +0800 <MichiganWave> @dcexaminer @NikkiHaley @KLoeffler Does Nikki Haley think it's still 1987 or maybe 2010 ? The real threat is not "socialism" but Neofeudalism &amp; the social credit system of BigTech, BigBank &amp; the Donor Class.  Nikki Haley is peddling conservatism for morons.

1341179062132338689 2020-12-22 08:29:40 +0800 <MichiganWave> Pols who sign off on these bills exist in their own circlejerk Donor class eco-system. Most of them need to be primaried &amp; be cast out of society. Too many in the GOP Base have dropped out w/ exhaustion &amp; cynicism. They should stay in the game &amp; channel the anger to purge CON Inc
1341175070950105088 2020-12-22 08:13:49 +0800 <MichiganWave> @WineUncle @KMGVictoria Same. But it now feels like an infantile corn syrup salutation. Something a tik tok dancing "frontline" health care worker would dispense.
1341173551768997888 2020-12-22 08:07:47 +0800 <MichiganWave> Pondering the padded room, hypersensitive, care-obsessed culture which the Covid response has locked in per @KMGVictoria   Default goodbyes of "Stay safe" &amp; "Take care" are so annoying now. Just leave it at "Have a nice day" or "Take it easy". Spare me the sticky-emo empathy
1341170451649802241 2020-12-22 07:55:28 +0800 <MichiganWave> Barr, the Slo-mo Release Valve. Protector of the Swamp &amp; Overall Dope. But pondering his eagerness to defend the FBI sniper who shot the pregnant Vicky Weaver, he may be as malevolent as craven &amp; slavishly Swampy
1341166396445700098 2020-12-22 07:39:21 +0800 <MichiganWave> In addition to Amazon, WalMart, &amp; couriers, some sectors will've bad their best year ever in 2020: -lexan &amp; glass makers -paper product, disinfectant, glove, mask, cleaning prod cos -take out food packaging makers.  Towards a sanitary world of plastic, surfactants &amp; pods.
1341164610934730754 2020-12-22 07:32:15 +0800 <MichiganWave> The moronic egalitarianism behind the Covid response is the most infuriating thing. If you're &lt;75 &amp; w/o co-morbidities, life should be normal w/ 2 caveats: -take extra care to give distance to the vulnerable -always covering your mouth if u cough, wash ur hands &amp; give ppl space

1340519371282759681 2020-12-20 12:48:18 +0800 <MichiganWave> @sailinggirl73 If Trump had sounded more alarms in the weeks before Nov 3rd &amp; told more ppl to be vigilant for fraud, would the DEMs still have done the fraud but more discretely?  The silver lining today is that the fraud was done sloppily &amp; now 50% of the country can see the rot.

Sometimes it's just adolescent machismo or pride for the fathers; sometimes it's just a primal spray n pray reproductive instinct
1340514323668623362 2020-12-20 12:28:14 +0800 <MichiganWave> @i_aver @NLJunior1 @ScottMGreer Austerity, Food scarcity is a form of contraception. But the Aid agencies, NGOs refuse to consider that much of Africa has adopted a cargo cult mindset - that food comes out of airplanes &amp; ships. And that different ppls have different degrees of foresight &amp; impulse control.
1340475452432011264 2020-12-20 09:53:47 +0800 <MichiganWave> @i_aver @ScottMGreer We're being compelled to subsidize a 3rd World Demographic overshoot &amp; then accept the upshots of a series of Camp of the Saints invasions, and needs for even more future aid.  Like a Doomsday machine fueled by suicidal altruism, delusion, willful blindness
1340474626451927044 2020-12-20 09:50:30 +0800 <MichiganWave> @i_aver @ScottMGreer The West is being compelled to subsidize both a massive demographic overshoot &amp; a continuing series Camp of the Saints invasions.

1339475387617841153 2020-12-17 15:39:53 +0800 <MichiganWave> @FoxworthFor14 @NoTatsClassy The "Conservative" brand is damaged beyond repair. It's too intertwined with the Donor class, &amp; decades of broken promises to the GOP Base.  Better to rebrand around Nationalism, Americanism, or Anti-Corruption

1339416510947856389 2020-12-17 11:45:56 +0800 <MichiganWave> The Left uses any &amp; every crisis, real or contrived, to expedite its various prepacked agendas. In this case, more erasure of the traditions &amp; rituals of mostly White, Western Civ.
1339415075128545280 2020-12-17 11:40:13 +0800 <MichiganWave> What alarms most abt Messing is that she sees Trump &amp; Trump supporters as the same.

1339101140655484928 2020-12-16 14:52:45 +0800 <MichiganWave> @KMGVictoria These Lockdown &amp; Mandatory Mask measures are analogous to the surveillance &amp; invasive airport security measures which became the new normal after 9/11. Anarcho-Tyranny Bugmanism means all must suffer. Restricting immigration was deemed too costly for Woke capital &amp; too Nativist

1338373463992532997 2020-12-14 14:41:14 +0800 <MichiganWave> @CottoGottfried It's a form of virtue signalling. They'd have more cred if they signed to pay for the welfare &amp; health care of the kids of chronically unemployed single moms.
1338372601199042561 2020-12-14 14:37:48 +0800 <MichiganWave> The immigration &amp; abortion issues cannot be addressed honestly w/o factoring in the post-65 welfare state.

1338365210692763650 2020-12-14 14:08:26 +0800 <MichiganWave> Rove is the most serpent like of all the GOPe campaign consultants. He's treacherous &amp; at core very Globalist, parasitic, anti-citizen, &amp; anti-White
1338363778497269760 2020-12-14 14:02:45 +0800 <MichiganWave> @CottoGottfried I oppose abortion after the the 3rd month, but many of the most hardcore pro-life advocates are wedded to a Blank Slate vision. When you mix that with a welfare state, it's just cheerleading for dysgenics. Imagine thinking it wise for ppl w/ IQs &lt;80 to be fruitful &amp; multiply
1338329426807951362 2020-12-14 11:46:14 +0800 <MichiganWave> Soldier on. Time to devise more ways to become anti-fragile. The Anti-Whites will try to have more Dissident bank accounts shuttered soon.

1338313167743688704 2020-12-14 10:41:38 +0800 <MichiganWave> Any org that is not girding itself against Anti-White Subversion will be converged to Leftist Lerner-Spectre-esque norms.

1337970837614436359 2020-12-13 12:01:20 +0800 <MichiganWave> Quite right. If someone had a PhD in a hard science it would be slightly pretentious, but in a social science, such a title is just graspy status seeking of the worst kind

There were no downsides for the subversives who pushed the Iraq WMD fiasco, the TARP/Subprime bailout, the Arab spring chaos, the Perdue pharma/oxycontin suicide epidemic &amp; China-Mart / BigTech Feudalism
1337633320449024005 2020-12-12 13:40:10 +0800 <MichiganWave> @SelimSeesYou We see that 90% of the legal/judicial milieu is terrified of the Globalist Ruling Class. The Federalist Society allies with the ABA &amp; ACLU when it really matters. The peer pressure to conform Leftward is relentless. Roberts, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh &amp; Barrett fear pariah status
1337285909067206656 2020-12-11 14:39:40 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JayFiveK Had a dream that Trump declared martial law, and locked up Michael Beschloss, Jennifer Rubin, Kampala Desi, &amp; members of the Lincoln Project on Alcatraz Island.   The nation breathed a collective sigh of relief.
1337248652142768131 2020-12-11 12:11:38 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Semiogogue Sure China is burrowed into many parts of the Anglosphere. But it seems they're willing to divvy up &amp; share the realm with India, Israel, Sub-Saharan Africa, &amp; Central America. The ruthless &amp; fecund exploiting the tolerance, atomisation &amp; confusion of Euros.
1337246406202056705 2020-12-11 12:02:42 +0800 <MichiganWave> @PhilippusArabus @VDAREJamesK IMO International Banks would try to treat any cluster of newly independent Red States like pariahs on par with North Korea. Such is the hatred of Whites or at least uncucked Whites by the Davos crowd.

Prob is that DEMs were abt Nonwhite, even Anti-White identity politics at least as far back as '88, but they were more subtle abt it.

1336057816445038593 2020-12-08 05:19:40 +0800 <MichiganWave> From 1990 to 2015 it was Cucks+Neocons who shamed Whites out of asserting their own interests even when for simple fairness or Citizenism. But the Media-Edu-NGO leviathan is all about advancing Nonwhite power now. Been so since the 60s. An uneven playing field that is our reality
1336055028172398598 2020-12-08 05:08:36 +0800 <MichiganWave> ZMan on point today wrt Tucker's silly call 4ppl to avoid identity politics. Since ~90% of Tucker's audience is White, this amounts to a suicidal call for the shrinking White population to unilaterally disarm in the culture war.   Billions are spent to advance Nonwhite interests

1335359647453126657 2020-12-06 07:05:24 +0800 <MichiganWave> @AnnKSterzinger It's more systemic still. The Uniparty &amp; media complex colluded to foist the Iraq WMD + Arab spring nonsense, plus Glass-Steagall, then the 2008-09 TARP bailout w/ 99% of Subprime ponzi perps getting off, even benefitting. Most haven't  a clue that the Ruling Class is parasitic
1335354958523162624 2020-12-06 06:46:46 +0800 <MichiganWave> @ungern_baron @DarrenJBeattie Sure the Coalition of the Fringes is a loose alliance bent on looting Legacy America. They monetize &amp; fritter away social capital but they're turning to resource &amp; land grabs too. But of the C of F is rooted in the Oikophobes of NE &amp; Cal coastal cities.

1335105756635467776 2020-12-05 14:16:32 +0800 <MichiganWave> @sailinggirl73 WRT CON Inc types Emerald listed, they seek approval within the milieu of "experts" who are always looking to justify more power for themselves. There's also their insulation from accountability &amp; an eagerness to exploit the situation to advance a Plutocrat &amp; surveillance agenda
1335102421530533891 2020-12-05 14:03:16 +0800 <MichiganWave> @sailinggirl73 Egalitarian thinking and lost social capital renders many Western countries incapable of efficient responses based on risk level. Instead of focussed protections for the elderly, the morbidly obese &amp; similar, we did either the opposite or draconian one size fits all.
1335100060082823168 2020-12-05 13:53:53 +0800 <MichiganWave> @mosasaurgirl2 Hoping we can devise faster ways to capture more of the pythons so they don't take over all of S. FL.  Another invasive, the Emerald Ash Borer has done massive damage to forests in the midwest. Tho it looks like some trees can be saved at a high cost.
1335094025376964608 2020-12-05 13:29:55 +0800 <MichiganWave> Another downside of Globalism &amp; the exotic pet craze of the 90s. A scourge of pythons is still wrecking Florida's eco-system. Python hunters needed!

They're trying to avenge ancestral grievances by preventing White Gentiles from having any self determination.  Freedoms of speech, assembly &amp; association are completely alien to them.
1335075021706944514 2020-12-05 12:14:24 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Inductivist It's beyond Govt per se. There are prob 100s of 1000s of administrative, middle class pseudo-jobs across the education sector, even at nominally private colleges. Then jobs in HR &amp; other parts of bloated Woke Capital.
1335021199441735680 2020-12-05 08:40:32 +0800 <MichiganWave>  https://t.co/smSSVARWH6  @CottoGottfried also discussed how Chomsky scurried away from the theory in recent years since it exposed the fraud of Neoliberalism, Globalism &amp; the Anti-White networks controlling Legacy media. In the end Leftists close ranks w/ Antifa
1335020018384449538 2020-12-05 08:35:50 +0800 <MichiganWave> Tho Manufacturing Consent focussed mostly on the period 1960-85, the Bipartisan nature of the phenom became far more explicit after 2001. Glaringly so after 2008, then Blindingly so after 2015. Yet the more his theory was affirmed, the more Chomsky pivoted away from it.  Awkward!

1335008391002017793 2020-12-05 07:49:38 +0800 <MichiganWave> @PackerAlfred @emeriticus Reason shares w/ Bolsheviks the tactic of "it's never enough - always demand more.."  So if a GOP pol cucks, no matter what happens he didn't cuck hard enough. Reason just hates nation states, borders &amp; White ppl. Simple as.
1335007256107225089 2020-12-05 07:45:07 +0800 <MichiganWave> @emeriticus ZMan refers Reason &amp; Libertarianism as astrology for suburban white nerds. But it's far worse. Reason's Virginia Postrel, Cathy Young &amp; Steven Greenhutt spent 1994-97 helping the GOPe make immigration restrictionism into a taboo. But they concealed their anti-White reasons.

The Pro-Life &amp; Prayer in School stuff is a carrot dangled on a string by Con Inc to motivate SoCons. But the carrot is always just out of reach...then hidden till the next election. Border control ploys are similar but often more vague
1334926474554568709 2020-12-05 02:24:07 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Inductivist Every hour that they stall on a Real Audit is more time for the Left to destroy or doctor evidence. An Audit delayed may be an Audit that's worthless (or only reveals lost evidence).  IOW, an Audit delayed long enough is equivalent to fraud concealed

Then to elevate these ppl to platforms where they alternate betw scolding the Base &amp; encouraging the Base to appease the Left.
1334914065794289664 2020-12-05 01:34:49 +0800 <MichiganWave> Murray's charade is to pretend that Leftist leadership isn't just Antifa in suits, exemplified by hate-filled anti-Whites like Jennifer Rubin, Max Boot &amp; Michelle Goldberg.

1334901371116646400 2020-12-05 00:44:22 +0800 <MichiganWave> @EuropeanRevolt Media (Narrative control, gatekeeping) is tacitly acknowledged by most Leftists or Globalists to be a means of social engineering. Similar to control of teachers unions, schools &amp; universities. The Leftist or Subversive nature of these institutions is self reinforcing.
1334732157043036160 2020-12-04 13:31:59 +0800 <MichiganWave> @VDAREJamesK There was a lot of back room subversion of the GOP from Nov 94 to early 96. Newt got beguiled by some Neocons &amp; donors. Trent Lott &amp; Haley Barbour probably know how it went down.

1334705281075437569 2020-12-04 11:45:11 +0800 <MichiganWave> The Left internalized the Donor Class guidelines that it's "anti-semitic" or racist to oppose any of: -Globalism &amp; "Free" trade -Control by Plutocrats, Oligarchs -Open Borders &amp; Wage stagnation -Endless Wars &amp; subservience to AIPAC  IOW the Left has retreated to infantile SJWism

The Left embraced Anti-White &amp; Anti-Trad stuff cuz the Oligarchs &amp; Warmongers are a protected class
1334697151146897408 2020-12-04 11:12:52 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NickJFuentes @quindle Keeping a GOP Sen majority makes more sense if Trump can hold on &amp; expose the fraud. It would mean 1 or 2 more Scotus picks, maybe a Trumpian cabinet. If Buyden gets a steal, then the GOP cucks will do his bidding, Sen majority or not.

1334640415732101120 2020-12-04 07:27:26 +0800 <MichiganWave> Imagine thinking a party broadly in agreement with Barbara Lerner-Spectre, Barbara Roche, Jon Greenblatt &amp; Mariana Pfaelzer would somehow resist stealing an election w/ massive fraud. Respect for Dutton &amp; Sailer, but here they demonstrate why Western Civ was so easily hacked
1334638844147363840 2020-12-04 07:21:11 +0800 <MichiganWave> There's a 'Category Error - Does Not Compute' moment in today's Dutton/Jolly Heretic - SteveSailer podcast. Neither think the DEMs stole the election or at least did enough fraud to win the EC. Quaint thinking. Old school. Imagine thinking the Party of Antifa+BLM would play fair
1334569718867439617 2020-12-04 02:46:30 +0800 <MichiganWave> Much respect to @LaurenWitzkeDE for drawing out/exposing a new wave of Anti-White, Anti-Christian Globalists.

1334562953266409478 2020-12-04 02:19:37 +0800 <MichiganWave> More on point to say the Grifters are drunk with hubris, greed &amp; contempt for Middle America. They are almost feral in their ache to return the Overton window to exclude Nationalism &amp; make the GOP strictly a Looting platform. A means of monetizing plunder by Alienist Plutocrats
1334554234927394820 2020-12-04 01:44:59 +0800 <MichiganWave> If GOPe Grifters were smart, they'd pretend to be pro-Trump, pro-Nationalist for another 2+ weeks. They'd go thru the motions of exposing fraud till late Dec. There's no rush to betray the GOP Base &amp; cajole support for Perdue/Loeffler.  But Grifters are so dumb &amp; easily demasked

1334514673924919297 2020-12-03 23:07:47 +0800 <MichiganWave> Was Tucker sincere in hearing you out?

So they'll come out on top w/ their own crypto-tribalism. Not unlike the worldview of many Reform Jews. For some Mormons, there's also a Blank Slate voodoo aspect
1334385874486890496 2020-12-03 14:35:58 +0800 <MichiganWave> @i_aver @ScottMGreer Is an alienation mindset within some Mormons wrt Non-Mormon America.

A form of revenge against descendents of those who rejected or persecuted Mormons pre-1900.

1333980702614970369 2020-12-02 11:45:58 +0800 <MichiganWave> Some of my Natty frens argue that the Post WW2  Lib Elites are/were obsessed with sacralizing an exact narrative regarding 1933-45. IMO this is an oversimplification. The Lib Elites despise Teddy Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Patton &amp; Macarthur as much as Franco. Just not overtly
1333978866474479616 2020-12-02 11:38:40 +0800 <MichiganWave> Per @KingofShirgar our world makes more sense once u realize that Elites of 1951-2020 spent their careers trying to retcon or smear most Ppl &amp; worldviews of 1880-1950. The trial &amp; execution of Julius &amp; Ethel Rosenbergs &amp; Operation Wetback were last gasps of the pre-1951 forces.

1331278127390224388 2020-11-25 00:46:54 +0800 <MichiganWave> @onewalleee It's at 10/10 for propaganda now. They're trying to rewire brains at this point. They want sheeple who will submit to the Zuck-Borg
1331270904555450375 2020-11-25 00:18:12 +0800 <MichiganWave> @McAllisterDen Now's a good time to call for courage &amp; resolve Denise. To support witnesses of fraud who will be facing intense hate from the Left. And to give praise to those lawyers &amp; activists working to expose corruption.
1331266441228791808 2020-11-25 00:00:27 +0800 <MichiganWave> Reminder: Murdoch's News Corp was an early propagandist, starting in the mid-90s, for Neocon foreign policy &amp; cheap labor immigration policy. Most shocklingly they were servile supporters of the subversive, anti-White "New Labour" Govt of Tony Blair &amp; Barbara Roche.
1331264546791710730 2020-11-24 23:52:56 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JillColtonFree @ramzpaul There have been many retcons, conceals, &amp; mass smears by "respected" historians in the past century. The period 1929-36 is particularly bad. The NYT helped conceal the Holodomor but also gave cover to the Stalin sympathists infiltrating the FDR admin.
1331112495982006274 2020-11-24 13:48:44 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Indian_Bronson @KMGVictoria Rollin their sleeves up like a hands on, everday Joe. Except with focus group-tested buzzwords &amp; cadence. Sure to win over the Naifs.

It's like they're trying to colonize every part of the political spectrum as a hedge against all possible outcomes. No matter the election result, they'll have some veto power or leverage.  Creepy &amp; Subversive.
1331102939042209792 2020-11-24 13:10:46 +0800 <MichiganWave> @DonaldR77391518 @JOttoPohl1 Noticed that he's manic in his gatekeeping. He tries to get Luke to join in to marginalise ppl. Funny thing is that he &amp; Will Chamberlain totally failed to prevent criticism of AIPAC back in 2017 by many content creators who are now influential.
1331101030369660928 2020-11-24 13:03:10 +0800 <MichiganWave> @UntetheredDale Whatever the final exit data turns out to be, the ppl &amp; places swinging hardest to the DEMs will've been the ones with the inner dialog of, "Pls CNN, MSNBC &amp; NPR, make it stop!"  The jellies craving decorum by appeasing the AWFLs &amp; tikkun olam crowd.

1331030688817143809 2020-11-24 08:23:40 +0800 <MichiganWave> It's time to abandon DuckDuckGo. Too likely they are in bed w/ Google, selling private user data.  Going to try these instead: -SearchEncrypt -Yippy -Gibiru  Gotta stay alert to avoid BigTech &amp; its totalitarian, social credit maw

1330997229361000448 2020-11-24 06:10:42 +0800 <MichiganWave> @TOOEdit A theoretical Biden cabinet would be a dream scenario for the ADL &amp; HIAS. It would be guided by an agenda of sacrificing WesternCiv to avenge Jewish suffering before 1946. While further strengthening, expanding Israel. For White Gentiles, it would be rule by an Alien overclass.

The fraudsters will be working to destroy  ballots, envelopes, even voting machines. Or doctoring the evidence to make it more congruent with their scheme. They want to leave either a debris field+ashes Or doctored, "cured" evidence.  Beware BAMN
1330973167968538625 2020-11-24 04:35:06 +0800 <MichiganWave> @ScottMGreer Homeland Security to be inclusive of an ongoing Camp of the Saints,  creation of favellas, &amp; reinstating mass immigration for Ruling class, arriviste psychotherapy
1330969669411479553 2020-11-24 04:21:12 +0800 <MichiganWave> @3502zippo Sarah Cooper may be tri-racial like Kampala. Jamaica had maybe 30k Indo/Hindu-Jamaicans, &amp; many of the colonial managerial class there were part White.  Kalergi Cooper, comin at ya, w/ animus aplenty
1330968612845318149 2020-11-24 04:17:00 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JOttoPohl1 Maybe like w/ Stalin's speeches, their audience will be req'd to applaud not too much, &amp; not too little lest they be put on a list.
1330967211318587396 2020-11-24 04:11:26 +0800 <MichiganWave> Guess these two are intended to function as the choirmasters for the rage-filled anti-White Bindis, AWFLs, &amp; the part of the coalition of the Fringes working in NGOs &amp; media-edu.
1330965543818498062 2020-11-24 04:04:48 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JOttoPohl1 @KMGVictoria has discussed them both. They are angry Nonwhite Wokesters being forced into Legacy media slots to replace stale, pale males. Female 'comediennes' are rarely funny but these two are just effing nasty. Like sadism w/ pauses for mandatory audience clapping.
1330963825013760007 2020-11-24 03:57:58 +0800 <MichiganWave> Has there ever been an astroturfed comedy-bot less funny than Sarah Cooper? Maybe Lily Singh. Both have the repulsive snark &amp; smarm of Kampala the striver. Both root their routines in alienation from Legacy America &amp; a desire for censorship, domination   https://t.co/82UJKRNX6j

1330763883552845825 2020-11-23 14:43:28 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JamesTrejo1945 @GOP Conservatism was a big tent coalition to fight the Cold War. In retrospect, the need for it ended April-86 w/ the Chernobyl disaster. The USSR began to unravel fast then. By '89, the CON coalition should've been disbanded. But it became a racket for Neocons, SoCons &amp; Predator$

It is just a brand for extracting resources out of Trad Whites, then betraying them to Globalist, Ponzi Scheme vampires.  The brand will reach a tipping point v soon of becoming a total embarrassment. Esp in the UK, CAN &amp; Rocky Mntn West.

1330670464923037696 2020-11-23 08:32:16 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Semiogogue The winning coalition to oppose Re-intro of Affirmative Action in Cal prob had some coattails this year. Helped to flip many Cal House seats back to GOP. Getting still more would be very hard.
1330669595741532161 2020-11-23 08:28:48 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Semiogogue Possible to win Blue States but more likely when a Big ballot measure has coattails. Mitt Romney won the 2003 Mass Gov race on the coattails of Ron Unz's Anti-Bilingual education prop. It forced the DEM to defend automatic teaching of Spanish to Latinos. That pushed WWC to GOP
1330662891792502786 2020-11-23 08:02:10 +0800 <MichiganWave> @AboveIvan @joe_norte @entreprenoober @SelimSeesYou For a big fraud to defy scrutiny they'd have to cure their steal with ballot destruction &amp; creation. Wouldn't have to be precise but close enough to be plausible. So let's get rolling on some Audits with teeth.
1330661078531977219 2020-11-23 07:54:58 +0800 <MichiganWave> @CottoGottfried Was Powell acting as an interested party, attorney for other candidates in swing states or more as a general anti-corruption, pro-transparency reformer? Is it just her connection to Flynn that kept her close to WH lawyers? Looking forward to Monday clarity.
1330657829548658689 2020-11-23 07:42:03 +0800 <MichiganWave> @AboveIvan @joe_norte @entreprenoober @SelimSeesYou This will be settled with a Real Audit. Where observers than see everything clearly.
1330612007180103681 2020-11-23 04:39:58 +0800 <MichiganWave> The Libjudges Hivemind:  "We must set the bar as low as possible for vote qualification. As low as we can justify per ACLU narratives on Nonwhite voter suppression. Then we set the bar as high as possible to prove fraud.  Whatever we must do for Leftism, we will do"
1330609336599646211 2020-11-23 04:29:22 +0800 <MichiganWave> The notion that you couldn't pull off a conspiracy involving 1000s of perps is silly.  Only a handful need to know the wider scheme. 95%+ would only have to play a bit-part, self-soothed by ACLU or Antifa rationales. They'd be an eager fruit fly.
1330605447162843141 2020-11-23 04:13:54 +0800 <MichiganWave> @AndrewSmithClub Tucker gave a reasonably respectful treatment of the Rittenhouse situation.  Guns, Gun culture &amp; the right to self defense are this )( close to Kyle's status.
1330604275446255616 2020-11-23 04:09:15 +0800 <MichiganWave> @CottoGottfried Speak more to the fact that a few libs can be independent based on accumulated personal wealth, while CON Inc pols depend on the Donor class.   CON Inc pols are best seen as TalkingPoints-bots for their paymasters.
1330600830848946176 2020-11-23 03:55:34 +0800 <MichiganWave> @AndrewSmithClub Not clear. Tucker Carlson has not lost all advertisers. Some but not all.  Gun shops still exist. Gun magazines still exist &amp; they're still sold in Wal-mart.
1330600111907418121 2020-11-23 03:52:42 +0800 <MichiganWave> The only "legacies of Trump" the CON Inc jellyfish would endorse:   -Jarvanka's Platinum plan -TPUSA's Blexit -"Monitoring the situation" on BigTech &amp; Woke capital deplatforming of dissidents.  CON Inc exists to soft sell the dissolution of Legacy America, to Legacy Americans.
1330597734475304964 2020-11-23 03:43:15 +0800 <MichiganWave> @AndrewSmithClub What if they simply said, "No comment"
1330593845810253827 2020-11-23 03:27:48 +0800 <MichiganWave> Similar conformity from Paleo remnant at TAC, CIS. Their spirit of defiance of 12-18 yrs ago is replaced w/ docility &amp; wishful thinking. No grasp of what the stakes are &amp; the extent of rot in the system. They just want comfort while the Ruling Class crushes all remaining dissent.
1330573758994722818 2020-11-23 02:07:59 +0800 <MichiganWave> @ScottMcConnell9 @TheNewRight The Uniparty wants to return the GOP node to a Neocon hegemony status regardless of what Trump does. Just like Jon Basil Utley took the Buchananite TAC mag &amp; made it a platform for Emma Lazarus-tier Nation of Immigrants pablum.
1330360028407230464 2020-11-22 11:58:42 +0800 <MichiganWave> @jSinSaTx @wasphyxiation A degree of fraud is assumed in Minneapolis, Las Vegas. Expect some in VA &amp; NH too. So 4 states Clinton won narrowly. She was too arrogant to think she'd need much more than the usual fraud to win PA, MI &amp; WI.
1330356505183481864 2020-11-22 11:44:42 +0800 <MichiganWave> @BotCordial @notorious_groyp Everybody happy happy.  Drink liberally of the Sedative potion.

1330301717070688257 2020-11-22 08:06:59 +0800 <MichiganWave> @AndrewSmithClub The GOPe allows any position on abortion because they don't actually care abt the issue at all. It's just a distraction toy so the Base won't oppose them on outsourcing, offshoring, open borders &amp; CronyCap monopolism
1330295815894691844 2020-11-22 07:43:32 +0800 <MichiganWave> @AndrewSmithClub The GOP worked to exclude immigration restrictionists by gatekeeping at the local &amp; national level. They weren't "imbecilic morons" - they'd been conditioned into an Emma Lazarus &amp; Christian Zionist worldview by a media-edu-churchianity cartel
1330261124156174351 2020-11-22 05:25:41 +0800 <MichiganWave> @DaniDailydose @SelimSeesYou Governor Shiny Face is omnipresent.

1330255752355852291 2020-11-22 05:04:20 +0800 <MichiganWave> @KMGVictoria 19th Century Presbyterianism &amp; turf wars in Ulster &amp; Glasgow really drove a wedge betw the Scots &amp; the Irish.
1330254623815426053 2020-11-22 04:59:51 +0800 <MichiganWave> @KMGVictoria A bit odd given the Auld Alliance of 1295-1560. Many Scots 2day still seem to prefer the French to the English tho i can't be sure if that's an astroturf thing. Maybe they've been inculcated to admire the cosmo France of Mitterand, Sarkozy, Macron, rather than of DeGaulle &amp; LePen
1330252051176181760 2020-11-22 04:49:38 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Johnan46818253 Referrin to accts who push Neolibbery, nihilism or Hindu bots shilling for more H1-B visas (per their Seattle to Calcutta annexation proj). Not excellent frens like urself &amp; @UntetheredDale   Welcome back from the banned zone.
1330225244272005128 2020-11-22 03:03:07 +0800 <MichiganWave> Is it worth engaging w/ accts that have &lt;50 followers?  Probably not. &lt;20 followers? Certainly not. Esp if those accts are less than a year old &amp; get no engagement, w/ most of their posts having 0 likes. Either bots or Antifa-tier.
1330223425454026752 2020-11-22 02:55:53 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Semiogogue See ZMan's gab TL now on Tucker. Chillingly prescient in light of how he threw one of his best writers under the bus in Aug, at the behest of the Progs.    https://t.co/F0XH7YbC2W
1330221854515224584 2020-11-22 02:49:39 +0800 <MichiganWave> @emeriticus Part of the post-'85 Neocon-Neolib proj was to inflame Latino grievance vs older stock natives in order to maintain high legal/illegal immigration. Could see this dynamic clearly in 1994 Cal: Neolib Sid Blumenthal implying GOP naziism; Neocon Mona Charen warning/shaming GOP Base
1330219109892710402 2020-11-22 02:38:44 +0800 <MichiganWave> @emeriticus What states do u figure best represent averaged Latino voting patterns?Guessing MO, IA, NC &amp; OH. Latinos are most Lefty in OR, CO &amp; New England. Maybe due to local Prog culture, job types or cost of living.  They're more centrist in lower cost of living states. Cubans&amp;Tejanos esp
1330201085856911361 2020-11-22 01:27:07 +0800 <MichiganWave> V Good.  Communism with *Apparent* Free Markets. Potemkin Village Capitalism w/ Spiteful mutants periodically unleashed.  The cultural &amp; demographic aims of Bolshevism facilitated by a hostile overclass, an Antifa social credit scheme &amp; a few dozen nodes of Woke Crony Capitalism.
1330098251127779332 2020-11-21 18:38:29 +0800 <MichiganWave> @TheMadDimension @_khaaan Fuentes was prob rattled from the fallout of UTR. Maybe figured any repeat would be a trap.
1330096871663161344 2020-11-21 18:33:00 +0800 <MichiganWave> @TheMadDimension @_khaaan Could stop it by insisting on strictly American branding. Would stymie agitators &amp; other callows who think it's cool to be provocative.  Can understand being pro-White, pro-self determination as an act of self preservation when confronted w/ BLM &amp; anti-White media-edu action, tho
1330089345479548930 2020-11-21 18:03:06 +0800 <MichiganWave> @_khaaan @TheMadDimension Rallies w/o rules for allowed ranges of banners&amp;slogan = a recipe for a disaster. U cud have nutz or SPLC plants creating photo-ops to frame &amp; villify every participant. The idea that Fuentes "rants" abt the JQ is unfair. Even many Jews criticise the bad influence of the J-Left
1330085030878715904 2020-11-21 17:45:57 +0800 <MichiganWave> @emeriticus You're probably right but somebody running on economic centrism, &amp; nationalism on trade, immigration &amp; patriarchal cultural stances could get ~45% The measure to re-intro aff action was defeated by Repubs &amp; some Dems: the basis of an anti-Woke coalition perhaps
1330041628820709376 2020-11-21 14:53:29 +0800 <MichiganWave> @ramzpaul Fox is a release valve staffed by ppl who mostly despise Trump &amp; Trump voters. Tucker is probably surrounded by subversives. Perhaps Tucker is a sincere person but he's in a Neocon org.
1330009845559386114 2020-11-21 12:47:12 +0800 <MichiganWave> @TheMadDimension Anyone who has studied the ethnic composition of the Donor class, the legacy media &amp; the Neocons will be aware of the JQ. That doesn't mean you should broach the topic in a way that freaks out Naifs. Often Naifs will realize the JQ by seeing the power of ADL, AIPAC, SPLC, Antifa
1330003840448532480 2020-11-21 12:23:20 +0800 <MichiganWave> @TheMadDimension That's a gross oversimplification. ZMan has summarized the need to maintain discipline &amp; high standards on the Right per UTR. Lest the media frame everyone by the optics of the most extreme fringe. Including a fed who shows up w/ freshly unpackaged, still creased Swastika flag
1329940645264363521 2020-11-21 08:12:13 +0800 <MichiganWave> Excellent summary of what the stakes are for Tucker right now. If he wants to remain loftily above the fray... Nick F nails it.   https://t.co/GiEHCkmWUa
1329887576031981571 2020-11-21 04:41:20 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Blair_A_Nathan Yeah. Britain, or at least Churchill, got wise to the Soviet threat way before Truman. FDR even more gullible. The Truman admin was pissed that Churchill made his late '45 Iron curtain speech.
1329886018925891592 2020-11-21 04:35:09 +0800 <MichiganWave> @doomsdayeschat1 @KMGVictoria The consequences of understanding that, 'Demographics is Destiny' creates an inner turmoil in those who want to work w/in approved channels.  Suppose some will gaslight themselves &amp; self-soothe while they run out the clock.
1329873783080017925 2020-11-21 03:46:32 +0800 <MichiganWave> @quindle @NewAtlantisSun @jeffgiesea @jeffsessions Eventually the genteel efforts of immigration hawks will be pointless. We're in a quasi-amnesty situation already if voter ID isn't req'd. By 2028, democratic &amp; legal options will be closed off. Mass Immigration is like a snowball rolling downhill gathering size. Gets unstoppable
1329871444986228737 2020-11-21 03:37:14 +0800 <MichiganWave> Western Civ, harmonious traditional White communities &amp; hierarchies of excellence.  The open borders milieu wants America to be a multicultural police state &amp; CronyCap empire.   Sure cheap labor will be the norm but it's Power for a rootless Overclass that they most want.
1329868739282690048 2020-11-21 03:26:29 +0800 <MichiganWave> W/ all due respect to FAIR, Numbers USA &amp; CIS, the Elite who foisted the post-1965, &amp; especially the post-1985 immigration norms upon us don't primarily want cheap labor. That's a side benefit. What that milieu is most driven by is Power &amp; a docile voting block. And a hatred of&gt;
1329867053998755841 2020-11-21 03:19:48 +0800 <MichiganWave> Too jarring for many who played the bland bargain-CON Inc game to actually look under the hood &amp; examine the corrupt Ruling Class. The Ruling Class that lied us into Iraq, bailed out the Too Big to Fail banks &amp; gave BigTech monstrous powers.  Bland Bargain types just want comfort
1329864278346706945 2020-11-21 03:08:46 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NewAtlantisSun Now's the time when that slice of the GOPe &amp; punditariat who were quietly anti-Trump or agnostic in Mar-2016, go back to their Uniparty default. They'd rather run out the clock w/ the bland bargain 2014 Globalist paradigm. The fight to overturn that paradigm makes them queasy.
1329856143481593856 2020-11-21 02:36:26 +0800 <MichiganWave> @AndrewSmithClub A lot of the subversive eroding of basic standards &amp; common sense spreads out from the ACLU/USMedia to other countries. The open borders Machiavellianism of Tony Blair was informed in part by US Journofa &amp; Clinton spiv Sidney Blumenthal
1329851625591238661 2020-11-21 02:18:29 +0800 <MichiganWave> @indocon1111 Sure let's look at KY. Let's look at every state.
1329843833643933698 2020-11-21 01:47:31 +0800 <MichiganWave> @KMGVictoria One wonders whether Tucker is nervously looking for a way to exit the Trump train for reasons of money, status, career advancement. Or if he's surrounded by CON Inc subversives eager to reinstall a pre-2015 Uniparty hegemony. Maybe both.
1329836537262067713 2020-11-21 01:18:32 +0800 <MichiganWave> Correction: Tucker did support Ron Paul in 2008. Credit where it's due.  The bigger worry is his likely connivance in The Daily Caller scheme to promote an Amnesty by concealing Marco Rubio's betrayal to FL voters in 2012.
1329834599514574848 2020-11-21 01:10:50 +0800 <MichiganWave> @PrimetimePurity You're right about Tucker supporting Ron Paul in 2008. Not so much afterwards. The only reason the establishment opposed Tom Tancredo is that Tancredo wanted immigration controlled. Any comments he made abt the Middle East are fluff compared to the Frum-Kristol-Deep State agenda
1329821168069730305 2020-11-21 00:17:28 +0800 <MichiganWave> Tucker reinvented himself on the 2016 coattails of Trump, Brexit, even Salvini. Tucker never went to bat for Pat Buchanan, Tom Tancredo or Ron Paul. Tucker lets others take risks while he retains his cozy legacy media salary.
1329815338331025408 2020-11-20 23:54:18 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NRO @jimgeraghty It's always a safe bet that CON Inc will shill for the Likud Party &amp; M.E. Interventionism. A form of "bravery" that pays well.
1329810854016131072 2020-11-20 23:36:28 +0800 <MichiganWave> @wayotworld His hatred of White Gentiles is amazingly explicit. Like a vampire drinking down social capital of the few safe places left for Whites in SA.
1329809481379835912 2020-11-20 23:31:01 +0800 <MichiganWave> @indocon1111 Tucker has a staff. Let him challege the Dominion/Smartmatic narrative on his own. No origins or ties to Venezuela? Show us. No servers or routers in Spain &amp; Germany? Where are the servers in the US? It would be insane for Powell to disclose evidence before going to court.
1329785439650258955 2020-11-20 21:55:29 +0800 <MichiganWave> Some put Tucker on a bravery pedestal of which he's undeserving. Has he ever mentioned the Great Replacement? Has he ever mentioned that Legacy media, including Fox, is owned &amp; run by rootless ppl w/o national loyalties? Has he ever defied the Fox ban on Ann Coulter &amp; M Malkin?
1329780445471535104 2020-11-20 21:35:38 +0800 <MichiganWave> Worth remembering that before 2015, Tucker was still CON Inc quisling status. Any daring challenge he made to the status quo afterwards was 100% thanks to Trump &amp; the Leftist demaskings caused by Trump. Tucker remains guided by a desire not to rock the boat too much.

1329551611895697416 2020-11-20 06:26:20 +0800 <MichiganWave> @doomsdayeschat1 After Prop187 passed in 1994, there was a pervasive effort made to neuter Nationalist advocates on immigration &amp; trade. Bill Kristol &amp; the Podhoretzes were part of that but a lot happened in the shadows.
1329546945929629696 2020-11-20 06:07:48 +0800 <MichiganWave> Wondering whether a few  "clean" elections before 2010 were also hijacked by fraud. In particular, the 1996 GOP Primaries in AZ, GA, Cal, &amp; MI.
1329535533165531139 2020-11-20 05:22:27 +0800 <MichiganWave> @bronzeagemantis The Demaskings just keep rolling in. All the Quislings &amp; bootlickers caught. The tide's going out &amp; they've got nowhere to hide.
1329534807374770177 2020-11-20 05:19:34 +0800 <MichiganWave> They're trying to help CON Inc close ranks with the Uniparty to repel populism, giving power back to the Chamber of Commerce et al.
1329533078906286088 2020-11-20 05:12:42 +0800 <MichiganWave> @SelimSeesYou Well his role is to create a certain expectation which proceeds by demoralizing the GOP &amp; gives the vote fraudsters a narrative to fulfill.  He'll never be held accountable because nobody he works for cares abt the truth. Just abt crafting narratives &amp; wielding power.

1329234006504841216 2020-11-19 09:24:17 +0800 <MichiganWave> Meddling in the Middle East &amp; N Africa gives a windfall to the military industrial complex &amp; creates refugees/migrants who then come over to bolster the DEM Party. Think Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib &amp; Abraham Aiyash. The Likud party likes the meddling; ADL &amp; SPLC like the migration

A way it could happen is by an economic populist riding the coattails of opposition to Race Quotas. And that opposition was of a winning size this year. A bit of an echo to Prop187+Pete Wilson in '94

The urge to meddle in other countries' affairs to impose some kind of SJW utopia. Or to make these countries more compliant w/ UN busybodies. Ultimately, to equalize world misery.

Depending on the extent of the fraud &amp; its flexibility, millions more White male votes would still be possible to overcome. Even if the fraud was at the low end, if the White male votes came in mostly in the 43 states not now in contention, it would be a moot point

1328007823616315398 2020-11-16 00:11:52 +0800 <MichiganWave> @LDF120 Dream scenario would be to lure Antifa out into a donnybrook where they assume the game is still rigged in their favor. Then cast a wide net &amp; get 100s of them on terrorism charges w/ max penalties. Antifa's cowardice means they only step out if they feel a SorosDA's protectin em

1327994957651701768 2020-11-15 23:20:45 +0800 <MichiganWave> @CottoGottfried Antifa will continue to attack law abiding traditionalists. Subverted local govt &amp; police are still subverted. The FBI's still subverted. If blame's being apportioned for Antifa's violent spree last night, then some should go to rally organizer(s): Vulnerables needed an exit plan
1327993075310931969 2020-11-15 23:13:16 +0800 <MichiganWave> @CottoGottfried Washington DC ceased to be the capital of the historical American nation decades ago. The residential areas are home to the most pro-Globalism, pro-NWO ppl in the country, indeed the entire world. It's the capital of the post-Cold War project for Neoliberal Empire.

All 3 are drifting away to a status of Anti-American Islands. The remaining Whites there have decided to submit to Alienism &amp; hope for the best.
1327776725380591616 2020-11-15 08:53:34 +0800 <MichiganWave> And it makes sense that Antifa is going to fight like hell to prevent a mobilisation for state vote audits, investigation of vote machine rigging &amp; pressure on state govts to #StopTheSteaI  Antifa &amp; BLM will be Biden's shock troops in the coming days.  2/2

1327602550657462273 2020-11-14 21:21:28 +0800 <MichiganWave> Happiness can easily be faked, used as a marketing glaze &amp; used to psychologically disarm a ppl. You could smoke a lotta weed &amp; be happy.  When happiness becomes pollyanna-ism it'll be maladaptive. It'll make ppl overlook potential predators, subversives; lull you into docility/
1327600307795337218 2020-11-14 21:12:33 +0800 <MichiganWave> WRT happiness, i'd say these attributes are more important &amp; prereqs for peace of mind:    resilience, courage, gratitude (esp for the sacrifices of ancestors), maturity, vigilance &amp; humility. Happiness in a modern sense is often just the equiv of a sugar high or wishful thinking

1327353956004139009 2020-11-14 04:53:38 +0800 <MichiganWave> Ted Kennedy made common cause w/ the ADL &amp; E Celler in pushing the 1965 Immigration Act. Then found allies in Chuck Schumer, H.

1327346806154465280 2020-11-14 04:25:14 +0800 <MichiganWave> A recurring theme across the declining Anglosphere since 1960 is that media has inflammed &amp; weaponized the fading tensions between Protestants &amp; Catholics, between NW Europeans &amp; Central, Southern &amp; Eastern Europeans in order to make WesternCiv into a Non-European Economic Zone..

1326849255634595840 2020-11-12 19:28:08 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JayFiveK In the chaos ahead, we need to prioritise the aspects of fraud or intent to conceal which are strongest, best substantiated. Some of the dead voter #s thrown abt look premature. It's the voting machines, statistical red flags, ppl voting in multiple states, #maidengate &amp; ballot

1326704783659503616 2020-11-12 09:54:04 +0800 <MichiganWave> @CMynym The phrase "America First" was enough to drive most Neocons into end times paroxysms in 2016. Drudge had a whiff of controlled oppo long ago &amp; may be getting more ethnocentric as he ages. Like Noam Chomsky.
1326700077952471041 2020-11-12 09:35:22 +0800 <MichiganWave> Drudge probably only ever wanted to be a court jester Release valve.  Once the populist Right was actually in reach of real power he decided to demask &amp; protect the Globalist Ruling Class.   Too much money is made by Oligarchs using America as an empire &amp; haven for CronyCapital

A few yrs ago there was a piece in the AA mag on celebrating diversity in the USA w/ 'somos todos illegales' tier sauce.  Given how laden the pages are w/ bacteria it seemed well placed
1326670334695759873 2020-11-12 07:37:10 +0800 <MichiganWave> @CMynym @HbdNrx The system sets the voting access bar incredibly low to allow anarchy (no photo id, no signature match etc) then it sets the bar very high to prove the fraud.  The system is obviously designed to allow, then protect fraud.
1326663963518656514 2020-11-12 07:11:51 +0800 <MichiganWave> @HbdNrx Given ruling class subversion, contempt &amp; malfeasance of the past 50 yrs (esp past 20), i'm amazed at your faith in an msm narrative. A big steal is consistent w/ the anarcho-tyranny of Neoliberalism just as much as Increasing Muslim immigration After 9/11

But the 2 key areas of focus must be the machines &amp; the broken chains of custody, stopping of proper scrutineering. Biggest prob is that they're going 2 attempt to make the process impossible to audit / destroy as much evidence as possible

1326516080391696386 2020-11-11 21:24:13 +0800 <MichiganWave> @KingofShirgar One point they're wheeling out is that it's standard practice to enter "01-01-1900" on ballot papers lacking a DoB. Yet that's a form of ballot curing which was only pushed in DEM districts, &amp; it could be used on papers of those who didn't intend to vote at all.

They're going to further rig the game so that even an optimized Sailer Strategy in 2022-24 won't be allowed to win.    We've no choice but to fight now &amp; expose Mugabe -tier ballot fraud. If not, the window closes
1326483154107060225 2020-11-11 19:13:23 +0800 <MichiganWave> OK @DavidColeStein the case is persuasive but we've entered a BAMN - Ballot Harvesting phase of Amerikwa. If a more Sailer-ish strategy had been used  to net 4 Million more White votes, would that have been enough? What if they were disproportionately cast outside swing states?
1326439406329360386 2020-11-11 16:19:33 +0800 <MichiganWave> The evolution of the ACLU mirrors the transformation of the DEM party into one of soft &amp; hard Totalitarianism.

1325815160427130880 2020-11-09 22:59:01 +0800 <MichiganWave> @AndrewSmithClub Trump's raising Black employment &amp; wages with a tighter labor market, lower immigration. But the media parrots HateHoaxes &amp; Jennifer Rubin tier Anti-White bile. It's cause they want Legacy Blacks to vote against their own self interest in order to smash Legacy America as a whole
1325813989239123969 2020-11-09 22:54:22 +0800 <MichiganWave> @AndrewSmithClub Barbara Jordan did so in 1994. But the gatekeepers for official Black leadership are compliant with the ADL &amp; SPLC. This is also why Cynthia McKinney was unpersoned after opposing AIPAC.
1325813277084016641 2020-11-09 22:51:32 +0800 <MichiganWave> 1994 Pete Wilson &amp; Prop 187 were a much more muscular form of Civic Nationalism or Citizenism than what Trump offered. Blacks have been goaded into conflating their own self interest with the demographic swamping of 1990 America.  The media did this - it's Alienism &amp; tikkun olam
1325811680249573378 2020-11-09 22:45:11 +0800 <MichiganWave> @AndrewSmithClub Projection by the media cajoled Blacks into hating Whites more than they like themselves. The media crafted an inverted identity for Blacks based on Envy of Whites. Blacks voted for Prop187 &amp; Pete Wilson in 1994 at higher %s than they gave Trump. Thus the propaganda of 1995-2015

1325757829739909120 2020-11-09 19:11:12 +0800 <MichiganWave> What's jarring abt this: the Murdochs owe 90%+ of their 45 year media empire success to the hopes &amp; resources of Trad Whites. They now show such a disdain for their supporters - almost a sadistic lust to see their supporters swept away by Anti-White  Neoliberalism &amp; Open Borders
1325750716204527616 2020-11-09 18:42:56 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NewRightAmerica Totally agree. But contra Mark Weber, it's not clear that the system will allow an unapologetic Nationalist to win cleanly. If he got 5% more of the White vote by being less cucky, how do we know they won't just Quadruple the scale of the DEM fraud, w/ media connivance?
1325747582556057600 2020-11-09 18:30:29 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NewRightAmerica Sure, but that ethnomasochist mindset is strongest among SWPLs. Single White urban women. Because they're entranced by Legacy media, the diminishing returns of DR3 come fast.

1325192945482522624 2020-11-08 05:46:33 +0800 <MichiganWave> @TheMadDimension Let's see what happens. At worst, it will reveal to old timers that SCOTUS justices face immense pressure to "grow into" their roles in a way that appeases the Libmedia. It will demonstrate the need for something new: devolution, separation, etc
1325190873705979906 2020-11-08 05:38:19 +0800 <MichiganWave> @SidPolitics Biden's an Anglophobe like Obama &amp; Teddy Kennedy. He was lending support to the Globalist Govt in Dublin to meddle with Brexit terms per N. Ireland. Kamala will be even more of an Anglophobe for ethnic &amp; anti-colonial reasons.  They're Sorosian Bugmen
1325188716432908288 2020-11-08 05:29:45 +0800 <MichiganWave> @SidPolitics Biden will want the UK onboard for more wars in the Middle East. And to put sanctions on Hungary &amp; Poland, forcing them to share Merkels migrants.
1325181127770992641 2020-11-08 04:59:36 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JOttoPohl1 There's a 3rd type: -the Naifs. Those who have no understanding of Neocon subversion &amp; malevolence from 1980 to 2008. They've no awareness that the DEMs &amp; Neocons / NeverTrumpers are a Uniparty  A 4th type might be the Chameleon weaklings like Dan Crenshaw
1325167214123692032 2020-11-08 04:04:18 +0800 <MichiganWave> @quindle Haven't thought that far ahead. Tucker would be better than Trump in certain states. But the situation is so fluid that 1 month feels like 1 year's worth of intensity &amp; change
1325165793663971329 2020-11-08 03:58:40 +0800 <MichiganWave> @thehangingchads Today has a surreal vibe but we keep on fighting &amp; work to grow our forces. We need to support Alt-Tech &amp; become more Anti-Fragile.  Strangest year of my life tbh.  Let's keep supporting Trump.  Good chance of victory; better than 50/50. Brave witnesses are stepping forward.
1325162148071403521 2020-11-08 03:44:11 +0800 <MichiganWave> GLOBOHOMO PROPAGANDA WAVE IN PROGRESS  SHIELDS  BRACE
1325159481936924673 2020-11-08 03:33:35 +0800 <MichiganWave> The Sorosian Globalists are really salivating today for a return to 2014. They want to increase mass immigration ASAP so the events of 2015-16 can be prevented from recurring &amp; populations of the West deluged w/ perma-Left voters.
1325157598488834049 2020-11-08 03:26:06 +0800 <MichiganWave> Reminder that Spiked Online was started by Marxists &amp; remains a Controlled Oppo propaganda organ for a Globalist Oligarch It is Intellectual Dork Web tier   https://t.co/IQXTqY447O
1325156158173114370 2020-11-08 03:20:22 +0800 <MichiganWave> Reminder that Fox helped marginalise Pat Buchanan, Tom Tancredo, &amp; Ron Paul. Fox News was the plaything of Neocons Bill Kristol &amp; Morton Kondracke in its first 15 years. Fox also tried to push the Gang of 8 Amnesty in 2006. They've always had contempt 4 the GOP Base  #goodbyefox
1325154225177899008 2020-11-08 03:12:42 +0800 <MichiganWave> A lot of MAGA &amp; GOP Loyalists getting Red pilled abt FOX News this week. FOX is returning to their Pro-War Neocon origins, following Drudge Report. Senior FOX management tolerated Trump but wanted him gone since 2015. Esp Paul Ryan &amp; Lachlan Murdoch. #goodbyefox
1325150871060176896 2020-11-08 02:59:22 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JayFiveK Feels good. But also weird to be into uncharted territory. The high profile electoral battles over fraud in the past 20 yrs occurred in one location at a time. This time it feels like it is 8 to 10 states. And the stakes are once in a century epic level.  Buckle up.
1325147364085043201 2020-11-08 02:45:26 +0800 <MichiganWave> No doubt Kamala Harris is eager to meet with Pritti Patel &amp; Rishi Sunak to share ideas to promote Diversity, Sensitivity Training, Hate Speech laws &amp; even higher immigration. This is the ClownWorld we must prevent.  #Alienism
1325146027159138304 2020-11-08 02:40:07 +0800 <MichiganWave> Tip of the hat to @KMGVictoria who predicted over a year ago that Boris Johnson was a total phoney. Just a Globalist w/ a buffoonish yob persona. Maybe he's pro-Brexit, but it's meaningless when he keeps immigration Maxed Out &amp; sucks up to Globalist media  https://t.co/ghhLnaQmFQ
1325137157330259969 2020-11-08 02:04:52 +0800 <MichiganWave> @PsiloSD @MaybeAmes Type "Tucker Carlson Full Show" &amp; limit the search to the last 24 hrs. Usually several channels have it fresh. Somebody's putting it on Bitchute too within a few hours of the live slot.
1325134792137072642 2020-11-08 01:55:28 +0800 <MichiganWave> @PsiloSD @MaybeAmes Tucker's solid. Usually Dobbs, Ingraham, &amp; Bartiromo are ok. The rest of the network is just Neocon Globalist propaganda. Hannity just shapeshifts to follow power.  Best to cut the cable &amp; just watch Tucker on youtube
1325133071109267458 2020-11-08 01:48:38 +0800 <MichiganWave> @kingvukan @TheMarkPantano In a saner time David Frum would be working as a janitor. He was one the biggest propagandists for the Iraq War &amp; he worked to purge Anti-War conservatives w/ a cover piece in National Review. But there's so much nepotism in the Ruling Class that he just recirculates.
1325121117808431105 2020-11-08 01:01:08 +0800 <MichiganWave> @TheMarkPantano Sure. Drudge wants an Amnesty &amp; more Forever Wars. Just like David Frum
1325091417392357381 2020-11-07 23:03:07 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JayFiveK 2/3rds of the Fraud was Pre-loaded. Maybe another 3% was the usual fraud they'd use to steal a seat by 0.2%. The Final 30% they had to concoct at midnight. Was that Midnight Special that's the smoking gun &amp; has lead to all the ludicrous down ballot discrepancies. "Biden only" lol
1325088216521842689 2020-11-07 22:50:24 +0800 <MichiganWave> @HarmlessYardDog @RealMelcolmX @Hello31883622 @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @Styx666Official @ScottAdamsSays @ScottMGreer @TimRunsHisMouth @AnnCoulter @TrumpWarRoom Huge glitch in the matrix.  Surely pre-recorded after multiple rehearsals and getting the makeup &amp; meds just right.  He was probably comatose when the networks ran it.
1325082694070497281 2020-11-07 22:28:27 +0800 <MichiganWave> @sailinggirl73 @senatemajldr Ben Sasse's is also a reason why the DEMs got one EC vote in Eastern Nebraska this time. He's a rotten egg.
1325082037464817668 2020-11-07 22:25:51 +0800 <MichiganWave> @ramzpaul She seems like a clone of Saira Rao or Pramila Jayapal. A Hindu or Sikh who fckn hates Whites. Her name's Devina Singh. Devina not so Devine.
1325068814564929538 2020-11-07 21:33:18 +0800 <MichiganWave> @BoggJoe There was such an industrial scale to this fraud that there should be turnout comparisons of 2012, 2016 &amp; 2020 of every precinct in 10 states. Also get %s of mail-in votes, &amp; early votes out of total votes cast. Gonna chip away at it for a few days.
1325067221626990593 2020-11-07 21:26:58 +0800 <MichiganWave> @BoggJoe I'll ponder it. That list prob covers 99% of how it would play out tho.
1325066455780560897 2020-11-07 21:23:56 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NewRightAmerica There's such an astroturf nature to his support, that they don't dare risk letting actual people attend an event.
1325065515790962694 2020-11-07 21:20:12 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NewRightAmerica Deep State puppets hold Potemkin Rallies.  Everything's a sloppy simulation
1325049953841008646 2020-11-07 20:18:21 +0800 <MichiganWave> @sailinggirl73 Lol. There's the 7th slice of fraud too. Mail-in ballots with bogus back-dated post marks.
1325046517682614272 2020-11-07 20:04:42 +0800 <MichiganWave> @sailinggirl73 A 5th fraud wave too:  the rigged counting machines which flip Trump to Biden.  A 6th one would be transcription "errors" where digits are dropped in the final collating of the Trump total.
1325045620596477952 2020-11-07 20:01:08 +0800 <MichiganWave> @sailinggirl73 The fraud was surely in 3 or 4 big waves: -Bogus mail-in ballots counted by midnight -Ppl who voted in person multiple times, since no ID's req'd -Bogus mail-in ballots filled-in betw midnight &amp; 3 am -Trump votes thrown into dumpsters or burned
1325043062482100224 2020-11-07 19:50:58 +0800 <MichiganWave> @SwanOfTuonela @Henrik_Palmgren Maybe they imagine it creates a look of authority, excitement, &amp; leadership.  At this point, they're just desperately trying to slow down Biden's senility. If he appears too zombie-like, it will make their steal attempt both a farce &amp; a crime
1325039056514904065 2020-11-07 19:35:03 +0800 <MichiganWave> @W4nk_3ngine Yeah another reason to fight Biden-Kampala is that they'd form a subversive open borders alliance w/ Boris Johnson to foist a UN migration agenda onto Europe. And undermine Salvini, AfD, Orban.  Kampala might as well be Ash Sarkar.
1325036684229173249 2020-11-07 19:25:38 +0800 <MichiganWave> This is an example of why Boris Johnson's Govt has almost nothing in common with the spirit of Brexit, Salvini, Orban &amp; Trump. They just happened to be less flagrantly Globalist &amp; Cult-Marx than the Labour Party of both Starmer &amp; Corbyn.   https://t.co/YNYtSNIlv7
1325034542990827520 2020-11-07 19:17:07 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JordanBPeterman @oak_wulf @Blair_A_Nathan @1776_scott Yeah. One wonders if they think, "well we've not had much luck growing our church in Nigeria, Haiti, &amp; El Salvador. How bout we just bring millions of them here &amp; we can knock on their doors on a weekly basis.."
1325030543780679686 2020-11-07 19:01:14 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JordanBPeterman @oak_wulf @Blair_A_Nathan @1776_scott It's kinda like Rocky Mountain tikkun olam but at least they've many prudent life habits. eg. treating the body like a temple &amp; being prepared for natural disasters.
1325029692873773056 2020-11-07 18:57:51 +0800 <MichiganWave> Wow. Thomas Wictor's back on youtube. Good vid today on the pending Trump counter-offensive. Not posting here but seek it out. He's very articulate &amp; persuasive.
1325028988113334272 2020-11-07 18:55:03 +0800 <MichiganWave> @oak_wulf @Blair_A_Nathan @1776_scott The Mormon "leadearship" will be dearly mistaken by their Blank slate delusions. Sure to be deer in the headlights as Ilhan Omar's caravans come barreling into town looking for gibs.
1325010712347938817 2020-11-07 17:42:25 +0800 <MichiganWave> @TanyaCornfield @NoGuiltStoic Yeah he's fragile &amp; declining fast. Wouldn't surprise if they had lots of pre-recorded Biden mini speeches to respond various circumstances as needed.   It's the Videodrome back-up plan
1325008375160172545 2020-11-07 17:33:08 +0800 <MichiganWave> @oak_wulf @Blair_A_Nathan @1776_scott Some Mormon leadearship see these arrivals as future Mormons. It's a conflict of interest &amp; gamble. They're willing to risk frittering away Utah's quality of life in return for growing the LDS.
1325007262805598209 2020-11-07 17:28:43 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Blair_A_Nathan @williampotterwp The lefty Bobo interlopers see SLC like an unexplored Garden of Eden. But the pristine apples &amp; oranges are things low crime, clean parks, polite neighbors, &amp; great scenery. Then Bobos' xenophilia &amp; aversion for demographic-Quality of life patterns ends up denuding the garden
1324927427487936513 2020-11-07 12:11:29 +0800 <MichiganWave> @FosSerra @CptGroyper He's addicted to striking contrarian poses in a desperate bid to stay relevent. He's become known as a radioactive clown across the entire political Right. He won't even go on Gab because there are smarter ppl there who crush him in debate. He blocks &amp; reports foes here so beware
1324912610278596614 2020-11-07 11:12:36 +0800 <MichiganWave> Feels Great to be living in these Interesting Times.  So many Demaskings of subversives. We're rallying to expose the fraud, stop the steal &amp; discredit our rotten Ruling Class.  Onwards!
1324911311210295296 2020-11-07 11:07:26 +0800 <MichiganWave> Well Rick Santorum was a generic Neocon &amp; wants to keep a place at the msm trough. Not surprising he'd defend the fraud of Philly. Gotta pacify Joe Normie.   https://t.co/3Ax9kDZRtJ
1324909628472352769 2020-11-07 11:00:45 +0800 <MichiganWave> @HbdNrx The IDW &amp; New Atheist goofs are complicit in trying to conflate mild Race Realism &amp; Immigr Restrictionism w/ Naziism etc. The media dominance of their Blank Slate, Open Borders allies helped create paranoid nutcases like AOC.  This is the mess they helped create.  So meh.
1324907775768588288 2020-11-07 10:53:23 +0800 <MichiganWave> @HbdNrx Worth checking TLs of Bret &amp; EricWeinstein, Sam Harris. Lol at neurotic tug of war betw: -No don't make these blacklists of Trump supporters! We must keep the empire together. If we radicalize Joe Normie, we won't able to return to slo-boil 2015 Neolibbery, and,  -Trumpists Evil.
1324894601283575810 2020-11-07 10:01:02 +0800 <MichiganWave> This is the game they play: Feign sympathy with the concerns of Middle America but quietly work to demoralise their own Base &amp; sabotage, hollow out the job market &amp; quality of life for Trads. These poltical scumbags just want doggie biscuits from the DC Lobbyists.
1324893044156600323 2020-11-07 09:54:51 +0800 <MichiganWave> In the '94-96 period when populism &amp; legit Nationalism had surged (Prop 187, Buchanan), puppets like Crenshaw would mouth token sympathy but were quietly seething w/ contempt for the GOP Base. By 1999, they'd let the Kritarchy &amp; Con Inc consultants sabotage the party.
1324890342831874048 2020-11-07 09:44:07 +0800 <MichiganWave> @SelimSeesYou There seemed to be a pause for the count of many California seats in 2018 when they took a while to prep the ballot harvesting. The counts stalled around 1 am CST &amp; then 8 hrs later the leads would start to flip.
1324879121206349825 2020-11-07 08:59:32 +0800 <MichiganWave> @HbdNrx The violent attacks on supporters of the Center Right by supporters of Salvador Allende in 1971-72 Chile is a more timely example. The reaction to that lasted 18 years.
1324878221268185091 2020-11-07 08:55:57 +0800 <MichiganWave> @HbdNrx They can't restrain their inner Lazar Kaganoviches
1324865996713316352 2020-11-07 08:07:23 +0800 <MichiganWave> @onewalleee Looked at Mr Hail Victory's t-l &amp; he seems bent on total nihilism. He made so many bad, reckless choices &amp; made himself so radioactive, that his last recourse is to invite total destruction &amp; sit back to snicker.  He's like a spoiled child angry at being ostracised.
1324861312451620867 2020-11-07 07:48:46 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Blair_A_Nathan @echo_chamberz The evidence needs to be accrued discretely. A few whistleblowers &amp; witnesses will help. The Left is going to be working overtime to destroy, retcon or falsify voter registration data, massage out the statistical red flags or create a mess that's hard to use as evidence.
1324859576689287173 2020-11-07 07:41:52 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NewRightAmerica FWIW in the ongoing battle with BigTech &amp; the ADL: it's more important that we have audio streams than both audio &amp; video. A big % only listen since there's no need to watch (not like a formal lecture or power point presentation). Let's just get the Audio reliable for now.
1324854376993873920 2020-11-07 07:21:12 +0800 <MichiganWave> @RichardBSpencer @heraclitean11 Uh no. Drudge wants Amnesty &amp; more Neocon wars. He's becoming more ethnocentric, more tikkun olam as he ages. So soon he'll be no different than Jennifer Rubin or Max Boot.
1324850539675475972 2020-11-07 07:05:57 +0800 <MichiganWave> @PALE_Primate If Libertarians really were a threat to the soft Totalitarianism of the Ruling Class, they'd be villified relentlessly. But they were welcomed on the ballot in swing states as useful idiots while the Green party is blocked to protect Biden-Harris from erosion
1324849514482700291 2020-11-07 07:01:53 +0800 <MichiganWave> @PALE_Primate This one here looks like a Cult Marx heir to the Totalitarian, Tikkun olam version of "Libertarianism". They want to enable the Woke capital Monopolists to prevent self determination of Legacy America.  https://t.co/AFGISDvElO
1324847178234429444 2020-11-07 06:52:36 +0800 <MichiganWave> @PALE_Primate Most remaining Libertarians are Kochtopus rubes or SJWs who want low taxes, consumerism &amp; weed. They're mysteriously MIA when Woke Capital is working to erase 1a, 2a &amp; freedoms of assembly &amp; association. Or when Neocons start wars. eg. Virginia Postrel &amp; Cathy Young. Just Poseurs
1324830326670168064 2020-11-07 05:45:38 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NRxAuthors @SelimSeesYou Social media deplatforms Nationalists increasingly. It will be rigged to favor Cucks
1324825421003849728 2020-11-07 05:26:09 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NRxAuthors @SelimSeesYou Uh. If Trump is gone, they'd be "showing their disgust" by voting for a Globalist, pro-Amnesty, pro-Oligarchy GOP of Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham &amp; Dan Crenshaw.  More likely there'd be record low turnout or a boom for 3rd parties like the Constitution Party.
1324820974446010368 2020-11-07 05:08:28 +0800 <MichiganWave> The Left is showing their Totalitarian end game here. Again, they don't want just Trump gone, they want to litigate against &amp; unperson all Trump supporters.    https://t.co/TYRFRTeryy
1324813338749083657 2020-11-07 04:38:08 +0800 <MichiganWave> saying 'is that' 2x is my salute to freewheeling Trump. Must be internalizing his ways..
1324807322632359941 2020-11-07 04:14:14 +0800 <MichiganWave> The most obvious perps here are Ben Shapiro, Nikki Haley, Dan Crenshaw &amp; Marco Rubio. And the dwindling shills for the Libertarian Party release valve.
1324806384504971265 2020-11-07 04:10:30 +0800 <MichiganWave> ..directed at Trump, &amp; Trump supporters, now they want us to be calm &amp; trusting of a corrupt Ruling class. Invariably these decorum shills are closet Neocons. They want a return to fake politics, &amp; more slo-boil destruction of Middle America. More bloated corrupt Empire &amp; Scale
1324805191095431171 2020-11-07 04:05:45 +0800 <MichiganWave> One theme that's great now is the Demasking of all the "Trust the System, Be polite, maintain decorum" shills who lecture the GOP Base. They want to admin sedative on the Right &amp; allow the corrupt DNC machine to escape the scene of the crime. After 5 yrs of hate filled hysterics&gt;
1324801740819042307 2020-11-07 03:52:03 +0800 <MichiganWave> @peterbrimelow Maine voting patterns deserve much study. They had the good sense to reject the carpetbagger Kamala clone Sara Gideon for Senate. Trump hung onto Inland Maine but his vote sagged badly along the Maine coast even well outside Portland. Similar patterns in New Hampshire &amp; Mass.
1324694193831317505 2020-11-06 20:44:42 +0800 <MichiganWave> @ScottMGreer The system is broken. The fraud will just get more flagrant w/o voter ID laws &amp; w/ normative mail-in ballot use. System Trusting is just sedative for Naifs. The Uniparty wants to resume a slo-boil destruction of Middle America.
1324692051078877184 2020-11-06 20:36:11 +0800 <MichiganWave> You may not be interested in Saira Rao &amp; Shree Paradkar, but they're both interested in you.  And they're pissed.
1324688700530397191 2020-11-06 20:22:52 +0800 <MichiganWave> This is why Ash Sarkar, Kampala Harris, Pramila Jayapal &amp; Neera Tanden are harbingers of Anti-White rage politics.  And why we'd be wise not to trust Nimrata Randhawa. They feel an elemental alienation from Western Civ &amp; Legacy America.
1324687064940613632 2020-11-06 20:16:22 +0800 <MichiganWave> This woman was later identified as 'Devina Singh, 24' One senses that unmarried Hindu &amp; Sikh women will be eager recruits to Antifa &amp; will bloc-vote for the Left in %s similar to Black &amp; Secular Jewish women. See similar examples of rage-filled Bindis around the Anglosphere.
1324658967700770816 2020-11-06 18:24:43 +0800 <MichiganWave> The fractures within Oregon, Colorado, California, Texas, Georgia &amp; even Maine seem more stark than macro divisions betw say FL &amp; GA or OH &amp; MI.  eg. Portland, Maine is a hotbed of xenophilia &amp; ethnomasochism. Inland Maine not at all.
1324657771002896385 2020-11-06 18:19:58 +0800 <MichiganWave> @CottoGottfried He'll win GA eventually. But it will probably require federal forces reversing some of the recent ballot fraud. At this point, one gets the impression Atlanta vote counters are willing just to make shit up.  Full on Antifa mindset.
1324656330771255298 2020-11-06 18:14:14 +0800 <MichiganWave> There are big differences Within States such that Red waves in certain Texas counties were partly neutralized by small Blue counterwaves in certain TX suburbs. A bigger issue is diffs in voting security between states. Clearly PA, MI, GA &amp; WI allow more corruption than OH &amp; FL
1324642899783421952 2020-11-06 17:20:52 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NewRightAmerica Not clear that any devolution, reorganization, separation, or self-determination is possible for Middle America if the Uniparty holds DC. The Uniparty exists for Scale, Empire, Domination &amp; Social Engineering. It hates Whites &amp; any 1st World place of harmony &amp; trust
1324638048059973634 2020-11-06 17:01:35 +0800 <MichiganWave> The current attempted steal is only made possible by decades of GOP fliching when DEMs screech, "But Voter ID is racist".  Unless the GOP uncucks on this point, the stage is set for even deeper fraud going forward.
1324635306255998981 2020-11-06 16:50:42 +0800 <MichiganWave> @raysawhill If the DEMs are allowed to get away w/ stealing the Presidency, how would they be stopped from stealing the 2 Sen seats in GA &amp; 1 in NC, still in limbo? Biden could do a huge amount of damage w/ executive orders alone. And at least 5 current GOP Senators are totally RINO
1324519113277034497 2020-11-06 09:08:59 +0800 <MichiganWave> Key point by Glibb Medley,  "Without Voter ID, every election is illegitimate"
1324511588238372871 2020-11-06 08:39:05 +0800 <MichiganWave> @s_decatur True. Ppl forget that 35-40% of Hispanics voted for Immigr-Restricting Prop187.  This 35-40% of Hispanics is prob a Best Case Scenario/Ceiling for a Nationalist. They tend to be the older stock (Tejano) or quasi-White fraction of Hispanics also. They're drawn to Law &amp; Order.
1324497237196574723 2020-11-06 07:42:03 +0800 <MichiganWave> Youtube just culled this stream with Steve Bannon. BigTech is going to be futher tightening the vice now as it tries to force a narrative that discussing fraud is a "conspiracy theory". Best get ready to fall back to Minds, Gab, Parler &amp; Telegram.
1324489286213926914 2020-11-06 07:10:28 +0800 <MichiganWave> @ColumbiaBugle FOX News was a Neocon, "Invade the World, Invite the World" outlet from its 1995 start They blacklisted Pat Buchanan &amp; Tom Tancredo 4 over a decade &amp; treated Ron Paul w/ contempt.  So this week isn't a big surprise. They only pretended to be Trump friendly b4 to retain viewers
1324479677830959105 2020-11-06 06:32:17 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Seven_Crimes It's worse still. Trump &amp; major Trump supporters would be Unpersoned, subject to lawfare &amp; even frame-ups by the FBI, DOJ. They intend to put a cordon sanitaire around any expressions of US Nationalism then set about attacking Hungary, Poland etc.
1324478425722163200 2020-11-06 06:27:18 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Blair_A_Nathan Mr Hail Victory was peeved that his brand of kabuki theatre/Trig the Libs politics was deemed cringe &amp; insane So in casting his lot w/ Dementia Joe he gets revenge by seeing things accelerate further into the abyss.
1324471032833548289 2020-11-06 05:57:56 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NickJFuentes Nikki Haley is feeding sedative to the GOP Base with such bilge. Ignore her. She's another Paul Ryan-tier Quisling for the Donor Class.
1324469601078513665 2020-11-06 05:52:15 +0800 <MichiganWave> @ramzpaul There was a pity party vibe to that stream Ramz.  Just because the electoral fraud was predictable doesn't mean it's time to cry for mommy. Yes 1980s America is gone but we must fight to avoid becoming a hellish hybrid of S Africa &amp; Brazil.
1324461163875323904 2020-11-06 05:18:43 +0800 <MichiganWave> @emeriticus These Senators are nervously looking to see if Trump will be the Strong Horse. They seek comfort not risk.
1324456108149379078 2020-11-06 04:58:38 +0800 <MichiganWave> @VDAREJamesK @ArriasMaximus @ThorinReynolds A pop psychology cliche popular w/ Boomers, from Dorothea Brande,  "Act boldly and unseen forces will come to your aid"  Act Now Trump.
1324439809167970309 2020-11-06 03:53:52 +0800 <MichiganWave> You make a good point wrt Antifa. Their primary identity is rioting &amp; vandalism. If they ever got a Far Left Govt, they'd have no purpose.  They're programmed w/ hate-envy, entryism, subversion &amp; destruction. In a saner time, they'd be doing menial labor. Today, they're fire ants
1324432873861095426 2020-11-06 03:26:18 +0800 <MichiganWave> @BNONews BNO News has been converged into the SJW-sphere it seems. Your t/l mentions none of the big GOP gains in congress or the upset Senate win in Maine. You're just boosting NYT, CNN, AP stories.  Oh well, you had a brief moment of uniqueness during early Covid weeks
1324422072559374338 2020-11-06 02:43:23 +0800 <MichiganWave> @AndrewSmithClub There was something so plastic, so inauthentic abt Gideon. She was like a J-Left-NARAL-moveon dot org Candidate-bot. Plus no roots in Maine. Moved there in late 20s.
1324412883963432961 2020-11-06 02:06:52 +0800 <MichiganWave> Most GOP puppets in congress are cowards, but they're not suicidal. They'll follow a determined Base, they'll follow even one courageous insurgent. Deep down they know what's going on but they've been conditioned to not rock the boat.  They can break the conditioning.
1324404132028076034 2020-11-06 01:32:05 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Seven_Crimes The most pitiful take i saw was the one that "Repubs are just whining &amp; that they only ever lose elections due to fraud." It's dumb &amp; ahistorical as fraud is real &amp; 99% perpetrated by DEMs from 1960 Kennedy-Nixon, 1982 Illinois Gov race, 1996 Cal (steal from Bob Dornan).
1324402736960593921 2020-11-06 01:26:33 +0800 <MichiganWave> Confident most GOP Congress/Senate will see the light, giving Trump full support in the battle at hand. Most are going to realize this is an Existential moment. The Cult Marx Bugmen attempting to steal the election want total power; a perma-control sustained by Fraud.
1324398366948790277 2020-11-06 01:09:11 +0800 <MichiganWave> @sailinggirl73 The country was hijacked long ago. This week is part of the ongoing war to take it back. We're 4 &amp; 1/2 years into the current battle - this is just a different, more intense phase. Not sure there's any time to weep. There's too much to fight for.
1324389024832901120 2020-11-06 00:32:04 +0800 <MichiganWave> Ppl on the Right must realize:  -The FOX News of Paul Ryan &amp; Chris Wallace hates us. They see us as rubes, tax slaves, or consumer units to be replaced by Nigerians or Somalis  Say goodbye to FOX. Watch @OANN @newsmax @NickJFuentes &amp; @DeeElefans   Support Only Ppl who Support You
1324386534255140866 2020-11-06 00:22:10 +0800 <MichiganWave> The power of this week is that it serves as a Final Demasking of all the grifters, sleazy consultants, globalists &amp; Deep State parasites. Let the light shine in. Let their true colors present.
1324385787547471873 2020-11-06 00:19:12 +0800 <MichiganWave> habituated, like vampires, to sucking the resources &amp; social capital out of a mostly trad White voting base. In return for ego boosts &amp; status w/in the Lefty media milieu that Hates trad Whites. This is the same for FOX News.
1324384611397521410 2020-11-06 00:14:31 +0800 <MichiganWave> One sees the hatred of Legacy America in Bill Kristol's Barbara Lerner-Spectre-ish lines, re: the need to replace supposedly ungrateful &amp; unmotivated White Americans w/ more industrious 3rd World immigrants.  Yet this mindset is widespread in the GOPe consultant class. They're...
1324383038944481281 2020-11-06 00:08:16 +0800 <MichiganWave> Amazing to see just how much the parasitic Neocon GOPe Consultant class hates Legacy America.  They colluded in 1999 w/ the msm to silence oppo to Gray Davis's vacating a SCOTUS appeal of Prop 187. Neutering the Cal GOP to earn headpats from the Left    https://t.co/YL7o4vHFUF
1324358312670973952 2020-11-05 22:30:01 +0800 <MichiganWave> What do Bugmen behind the fraud tell themselves to rationalize their deeds? Probably,  "The ends justifies the means"  "If these voters knew what was best for themselves, this is how they'd vote"  "In order to correct for past injustices, we must do this complicated operation"
1324347154744434691 2020-11-05 21:45:41 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JayFiveK Yeah. The Ruling Class believes Orange Man must be defeated By Any Means Necessary. They probably have Fraud efforts going in 8 states.
1324291414730153984 2020-11-05 18:04:12 +0800 <MichiganWave> A reason FOX, Ben Shapiro, the Lincoln Proj et al want to force the GOP Base to be docile sheeple: -They all profit greatly from America as a bloated, corrupt Empire.  Fight their Forever Wars &amp; surrender Middle American towns to  mass immigration. They thrive on such chaos
1324227382866227200 2020-11-05 13:49:45 +0800 <MichiganWave> Excellent streams today Michelle. Key point @DarrenJBeattie makes wrt the bogus polling being integral to the Media-DNC framing of their current narrative. They want to pretend the bogus polls were legit &amp; use them as a shield to defend their fraud. #StopTheSteal
1324223675059589120 2020-11-05 13:35:01 +0800 <MichiganWave> @VDAREJamesK Your book Conservatism Inc is prescient yet again. FOX News showing itself more explicitly than ever as an organ 4 herding the GOP Base to serve the needs of a Globalist Uniparty. Apart from Tucker, Ingraham &amp; Dobbs, it's just a monetizing &amp; subversion scheme for Patriot energies
1324220138946781184 2020-11-05 13:20:58 +0800 <MichiganWave> Remember: -FOX pundits either silent or in favor of the massive Bush-McCain Amnesty ("Gang of 8") pushed in 2005-06 -FOX News blacklisted Pat Buchanan, his supporters &amp; all other Immigration Patriots from '95 to past 2010 -FOX News near unanimous in fav of Forever Wars, '95-2014
1324215474859745290 2020-11-05 13:02:26 +0800 <MichiganWave> @heywildrich @westland_will Things went Full Stop in at least 4 states between 1 am &amp; 5 am. The "% reporting" stayed frozen.

1324074805533040641 2020-11-05 03:43:28 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JayFiveK Defeating Gideon &amp; Ossoff is a sweet gift. And a reprieve from their Camp of the Saints agenda.
1324066617446277120 2020-11-05 03:10:56 +0800 <MichiganWave> @SebDurant_ @NewRightAmerica I'm a Nationalist.  Conservatism is a dead movement. It died in 2006, but it was mortally wounded as far back as 1998.
1324052623687823361 2020-11-05 02:15:19 +0800 <MichiganWave> @EmperorArilando @3rdWay4daWin @NewRightAmerica Wignats like defeat cuz it reinforces their sense of being hunkered down in a cave, privvy to secrets but under seige. It's a weird subculture
1324051247129939968 2020-11-05 02:09:51 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NewRightAmerica A minor abt the past 8 hours: Wignats seem to be joining libertarians &amp; much of the Intellectual Dork Web in a zone of total irrelevence. They're content to snicker &amp; spread nihilism, cowardice.  We fight because if we don't this fraud will be even worse next time.   We Fight Now
1324048465673048065 2020-11-05 01:58:48 +0800 <MichiganWave> @mannerbund see the Biden election youtube acct. Was 2 hrs ago
1324033262260543492 2020-11-05 00:58:23 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Blair_A_Nathan Pass the vodka &amp; boiled cabbage
1324031010770690048 2020-11-05 00:49:26 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Blair_A_Nathan They warned of activity throttling on the basis of fighting 'Disinformation Bots' or some such.
1324030479134240769 2020-11-05 00:47:20 +0800 <MichiganWave> It might give you fresh motivation to continue fighting for Trump if you watch this morning's press conf w/ Biden's campaign co-chairs, Bauer &amp; O'Malley Dillon. These ppl are ruthless, smilingly evil sociopaths. 'By Any Means Necessary' is the way of Antifa &amp; the DNC.
1324028852599988226 2020-11-05 00:40:52 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Blair_A_Nathan It may be hobbling your activity to suppress trends it opposes per its bogus anti-troll rationale. Sometimes restarting your device gives a fresh allowance of activity.
1324025322606632964 2020-11-05 00:26:50 +0800 <MichiganWave> @MaybeAmes @JayFiveK The tikkun olam Senate cands in GA &amp; ME got beat but they're prob hoping to piggyback on a Biden steal attempt w/ miraculous late returns.
1324023869469003779 2020-11-05 00:21:04 +0800 <MichiganWave> Biggest Deep State &amp; BigTech Demasking ever right now. They want to create a Perma-Globalist hegemony starting this week. This is it. This is the fight to decide the next 50+ years.
1324022753909972997 2020-11-05 00:16:38 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JayFiveK Yeah the steal attempt is so flagrant in WI, MI &amp; PA that it's a V strong case for us. PA in particular is allowing ballots not postmarked till Nov 6th. Total Twilight Zone
1323973188821389313 2020-11-04 20:59:41 +0800 <MichiganWave> Consistent projection of media-desired outcomes onto various races by Politico: -Maine CD2 - Trump 6.7% up w/ 81% in, but still "Toss-up" -Nevada to &lt;0.6% gap w/ only 67% in but  "lean" DEM -AZ called for Biden by 3.4% but 16% outstanding vote including many ED votes
1323922702944604160 2020-11-04 17:39:04 +0800 <MichiganWave> @vdare Hispanic outreach only paid off in FL, &amp; Black, 'Platinum Plan' pandering only yielded 13%.  Blexit RIP.  Trump's gotta fight for the needs of Forgotten Whites vis the Opioid crisis, wage stagnation &amp; health care costs. ASAP.
1323921315301072897 2020-11-04 17:33:33 +0800 <MichiganWave> @vdare The results are a resounding vindication of Vdare writers. Sure Trump looks to have won with 295 EC votes but he left a big chunk of the White vote on the table - prob 3-5% of the overall vote. That would've given him &gt;50% of the popular vote &amp; 6 more states
1323892861952249857 2020-11-04 15:40:29 +0800 <MichiganWave> FOX's atrocious attempt at Manufacturing Consent tonight gives another boost to cable cutters &amp; the decline of Legacy media.
1323891453555298305 2020-11-04 15:34:53 +0800 <MichiganWave> @VDAREJamesK Props to @DarrenJBeattie who warned us abt this Color Revolution trickery on @TuckerCarlson show. Everything since 1 am reeks of an attempted steal.
1323887845778612226 2020-11-04 15:20:33 +0800 <MichiganWave> @tonybalogna @Pozzidonius1 Stockholm Syndrome.  The urge to equalize status with Mogadishu.
1323883775806349316 2020-11-04 15:04:23 +0800 <MichiganWave> @VDAREJamesK FWIW there won't be any retarded Bipartisan cuckery for the next couple yrs. Trump won't sell out the Base cuz it'll be Battle mode after tonight.
1323877664684388354 2020-11-04 14:40:06 +0800 <MichiganWave> @echo_chamberz Yeah, and all the complexity is prefaced with appeals to fairness. It's how ppl with too much goodwill &amp; idealism get undermined by snakes.
1323872319236952064 2020-11-04 14:18:51 +0800 <MichiganWave> The Left's Banana Republic designs are clearer now. They load the system with loopholes, grace periods, clouds of complexity &amp; ambiguity. It exhausts Normie observers, but it is ideal for 'By Any Means Necessary' fraudsters.  Gotta Fight This Thru.
1323866969679007744 2020-11-04 13:57:36 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JayFiveK Twitter is now handcuffing Results &amp; Anti-Fraud posts - at least the last James Woods &amp; Trump posts
1323853411641688067 2020-11-04 13:03:43 +0800 <MichiganWave> @sailinggirl73 FOX (apart from Tucker, Ingraham &amp; Dobbs) is more subversive than CNN. It pretends to be the plucky, "we report, you decide". But its true agenda is curating a narrative that ensures the Donor class has a perma-hegemony. It regards GOP voters as rubes.
1323851990384988160 2020-11-04 12:58:05 +0800 <MichiganWave> The swings in Minnesota &amp; Maine have been wild in the past 20 minutes. As tho nothing can be predicted till at least 80-90% of the vote is in.
1323845076599115781 2020-11-04 12:30:36 +0800 <MichiganWave> Wondering what tricks the DEMs have up their sleeve now? -Holding back some city counts which will report late &amp; magically have just enough to make up a gap? -Contrive staffing or computer problems then cook some votes late? -Make some GOP votes mysteriously end up in dumpsters?
1323842740468273155 2020-11-04 12:21:19 +0800 <MichiganWave> The Coalition of the Fringes is unstable to the extent that the White sympatico part of Hispanic vote is repelled by BLM &amp; Antifa mobs. They prob don't like being lectured to by a striving feminist Bindi either

1323833453868175360 2020-11-04 11:44:25 +0800 <MichiganWave> Early going (30%) but Trump's leading in Maine by 4.7 He may drag Collins across the finish line which would piss off the Deep State which rained down megabucks on Gideon. All it took was Collins being a managerial gumby while also rejecting the Left's "Systemic racism" slur.

Also  there's a lot of French, &amp; old stock Anglos who find Machismo politics off putting. The future belongs to bulldogs like Salvini, Orban, Campaign mode Trump &amp; Farage.
1323814816599969792 2020-11-04 10:30:22 +0800 <MichiganWave> @peterbrimelow Curious 4 your takes on where ground will be most fertile for Nationalism after 2day. Agree w/ @Steve_Sailer case that Affordable Family formation, low cost of livng favors us. But Cubans, Italians, &amp; Scots-Irish seem way less ethnomasochistic than Germans, French &amp; Scandinavians
1323804852523249669 2020-11-04 09:50:46 +0800 <MichiganWave> @quindle @Str8Don @SelimSeesYou The GOP became a weak horse in Cal after 2005 when the state became majority-minority. The high cost of living in Cal tends to stifle upward mobility &amp; make everything a grab for spoils within the DEM party
1323800099508596737 2020-11-04 09:31:53 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JayFiveK Have been assuming that the DEMs need to lead in early returns to have ANY chance at all. Presumably they're reporting the advanced voters first which are laden w/ AWFLs, Bugmen
1323782635936714753 2020-11-04 08:22:29 +0800 <MichiganWave> @SelimSeesYou Always wonder why they call states with &lt;50% of votes counted.
1323738834807496710 2020-11-04 05:28:26 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Blair_A_Nathan True. The Globo-schemes of Victoria Nuland, Samantha Power, Susan Rice, Nils Gilman et al would be relentless.
1323730245803978759 2020-11-04 04:54:18 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JillColtonFree Makes sense that he'd prefer Kamala Devi Harris. Pan-Indian, curry loyalties you might say. Or, "Return to Blood" as Tom Wolfe predicted
1323579623364546565 2020-11-03 18:55:47 +0800 <MichiganWave> @ScottMGreer @quindle Such precious sensibilities he has. He'd rather remain loftily above the fray of icky politics. Even if the country risks tilting to favella status.
1323486820294864901 2020-11-03 12:47:01 +0800 <MichiganWave> @quindle @KarlRove The attacks on Whites, esp White men aren't just permitted; they're incentivized &amp; rewarded now. It helps explain The Flight from White. The Alienists in the Ruling Class hate White Men 4 the same reason they hate Western Civ. Machismo of Castizos wud b a welcome help to our side
1323469283062669312 2020-11-03 11:37:20 +0800 <MichiganWave> The Ruling Class intends to turn White Males into 2nd Class citizens in a more systematic way. They want us demoralised &amp; regarded as feeble minded "conspiracy theorists". Another part of the demoralisation, status downgrade are the pervasive mixed couple ads showing a WF &amp; BM
1323465379189084161 2020-11-03 11:21:49 +0800 <MichiganWave> Oh wow. So Gullible White Male Trump supporters is trending. Wonder if they'd ever let Anti-White Striver Bindis or Anti-Christian Ruling Class to trend?
1323461972650852352 2020-11-03 11:08:17 +0800 <MichiganWave> @ColumbiaBugle Tiffany Trump is more likeable than Ivanka.
1323459974647947264 2020-11-03 11:00:21 +0800 <MichiganWave> Notice now that Biden shills aren't attacking Trump on immigration, trade, interventionism, critical race theory or diversity. Cuz they know that Centrists support Trump on these issues. And the Biden camp would like to return to 1998-2014 when these issues were taboo to discuss
1323410648655683587 2020-11-03 07:44:21 +0800 <MichiganWave> Will Tucker Carlson, Lou Dobbs &amp; Laura Ingraham be locked away by FOX management starting tonight?
1323408979414888448 2020-11-03 07:37:43 +0800 <MichiganWave> @vdare @DissidentRight Even worse, it's likely that The Economist hates White Gentiles who are willing to collectivize to defend their communities. Their editor for Africa attacked Lauren Southern's thesis abt the persecution of Afrikaners. Suspect an Emma Lazarus / Barb Lerner-Spectre worldview.
1323407725619867649 2020-11-03 07:32:44 +0800 <MichiganWave> @vdare @DissidentRight Unsavory truth is that The Economist loathes homogenous 1st World countries. It would surely like to inundate Japan &amp; S Korea with African migrants too. The Economist sees middle class social capital as something to devour via wage cuts, sprawl &amp; wealth transfers to the Top 0.1%
1323404915985842177 2020-11-03 07:21:34 +0800 <MichiganWave> Africa is the African home continent. Europe is the home continent for Europeans. Europeans should remain an overwhelming super majority &amp; cultural hegemon in all parts of their homelands. Africans should learn how to fix their own countries.
1323382381194153987 2020-11-03 05:52:01 +0800 <MichiganWave> Did David Frum, Bill Kristol, Ann Applebaum &amp; Julia Ioffe ever see the GOP as anything other than a vehicle for Neocon Foreign Policy, enriching Transnational Oligarchs &amp; avenging their tribe's historical grievances?

1323376888681811971 2020-11-03 05:30:12 +0800 <MichiganWave> For at least the past 30 years, the immigration foisted on Europe by the Ruling Class has been a kind of war against the natives. Today's events are a tiny preview of what will be a daily occurence after 2030.
1323372230399660032 2020-11-03 05:11:41 +0800 <MichiganWave> As much as Sara Gideon's a sly carpetbagger &amp; mass immigration shill, it's hard to feel good for Maine's Susan Collins. A Trump surge may drag her across the finish line. But she's too genteel 2 fight Gideon on issues of Anti-White media-edu conditioning, Gun Rights &amp; Immigration
1323367760081096704 2020-11-03 04:53:55 +0800 <MichiganWave> Wildcard factor is the college vote in Maine, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, N Carolina &amp; Arizona. Will they turnout as much as in 2016? Are their motivations &amp; worldview different after Sportsball went full SJW? Are the women exhausted &amp; numb from 4 yrs of Orange Hitler hysteria?

1323228630428884993 2020-11-02 19:41:04 +0800 <MichiganWave> It's an eerie view into the Billion dollar, worldwide realm of Anti-White Social Engineering - both Govt &amp; Private sector. Focus tested to put well meaning Centrists (eg College educated White women) at ease with the idea of their White male relatives being discriminated against.

1323122516626448385 2020-11-02 12:39:25 +0800 <MichiganWave> Why defeating Kamala Harris so important. Harris surely agrees 100% w/ Trudeau &amp; the Associated Press that the response to terrorism should be more xenophilia, appeasement &amp; emasculation of the West. A Kamala admin would the equiv of electing Anti-Whites Robin DiAngelo &amp; Tim Wise
1323119400786997248 2020-11-02 12:27:02 +0800 <MichiganWave> @KamalaHarris Amazing lack of self awareness, lack of humility. Kamala is the child of well off academics &amp; immigrants. Yet she had the audacity to exploit an affirmative action slot which was intended for US descendants of former slaves - at Hasting School of Law. Talk about Fake Hardship.
1323107161329848322 2020-11-02 11:38:24 +0800 <MichiganWave> @VDAREJamesK Dream scenario is us get surprise wins in 2 Blue states where they're complacent &amp; are not ready with ballot harvesting tricks.
1323105876576788481 2020-11-02 11:33:17 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Steve_Sailer Imagine thinking "Systemic Racism" is a legit basis for institutional hiring Quotas to favor Nonwhites, when:  -Nonwhites have Already been given 45 years of Preferences  -The advantages given to Nonwhites are also offered to Nonwhite immigrants, who chose to come here.
1322965808759382025 2020-11-02 02:16:42 +0800 <MichiganWave> @AllisonLeeSolin The FBI might as well be an Antifa affiliate now.

The SoCon mvmnt was being subverted as far back as 1994 when they went silent on Illegal immigration &amp; Affirmative Action. Ralph Reed, Alan Keyes &amp; Lamar Alexander were big examples of SoCon Globalism

1322930043430014976 2020-11-01 23:54:35 +0800 <MichiganWave> Justin Trudeau's father Pierre is arguably the earliest post WW2 version of a Machiavellian, post-National "3rd Way" politician. He was a bilingual Tony Blair who knew how to exploit English Canada's genteel sensibililties to create a test tube nation for Cult Marx bureaucrats
1322928160544083974 2020-11-01 23:47:06 +0800 <MichiganWave> Ann Coulter tried to give a talk in CAN ~15 yrs ago &amp; was blocked by Antifa. CAN is at least a decade ahead of the rest of the Anglosphere wrt the Multicult Totalitarianism project &amp; the Hecklers' veto for Antifa.
1322926943826857984 2020-11-01 23:42:16 +0800 <MichiganWave> Lol at ppl who unironically ask why multiculturalism can't be made to work as well everywhere as it works in CanÃ£da. They started Multicult conditioning in CAN 55 yrs ago. They've "Human Rights" Kangaroo courts to punish those who criticize it + a media cartel to shame dissidents
1322920827642384384 2020-11-01 23:17:58 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Zvari72 Brenda Walker at @vdare has written some on Cal's crowding &amp; water rationing problems. Have sorta written off SoCal. It will probably bleed more ppl to other states as the scarcity bites deeper.
1322912264110956553 2020-11-01 22:43:56 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Zvari72 Guessing AUS will have a reckoning soonest. They, like S Africa, have water scarcity issues so the whole Bugman Globalist Infinity Growth project will feel a pinch there soon.
1322910947233669120 2020-11-01 22:38:42 +0800 <MichiganWave> English Canada was guilted into abandoning its Anglo culture decades ago. After subversives made appeals to "fairness" for Nonwhite immigrants who felt like outsiders. And to appease, bribe Quebec into staying. Peter Brimelow describes this in the "The Patriot Game"
1322910002374414338 2020-11-01 22:34:57 +0800 <MichiganWave> Ppl delay the day of reckoning with the downsides of diversity by moving - in a way that's less viable in France. French Canada still has a native culture so they've more of an immune system against Alienism. OTOH English Canada is a deracinated, post Year Zero Economic Zone
1322908970743402500 2020-11-01 22:30:51 +0800 <MichiganWave> In AUS, NZ, CAN, Minnesota, Texas &amp; other places where sprawl is integral to the economy, it is normal to escape diversity. But to do so in a polite way that couches the move in terms of avoiding traffic, housing prices, crowded schools. These moves = Societal Procrastination
1322720052874039296 2020-11-01 10:00:10 +0800 <MichiganWave> Imagine thinking Humza Yousef is as Scottish as Sean Connery. Connery has some Irish ancestry but clearly the differences were trivial and he ended up being a pillar of 1950s Scottish masculinity.

1322699442198323205 2020-11-01 08:38:16 +0800 <MichiganWave> One of the silver linings of a Trump Reelection is that it will discourage preachy Leftists from wanting to migrate. They'll esp regard Red States as Hate filled places &amp; be hesitant to barge in there with a snarky lecture abt diversity &amp; tolerance.   https://t.co/lqKBdTh9jG
1322686530561998849 2020-11-01 07:46:57 +0800 <MichiganWave> That End of an Era Feeling today with Sean Connery's passing. His un-PC, ZFG alpha archetype is increasingly rare. He had an amazing run over 4 decades; almost everything he did was at least a C+
1322682603502243846 2020-11-01 07:31:21 +0800 <MichiganWave> @FletchMatlock Yeah. Trick or Treaters are VIPs 2nt. Giving out 2-3x more than usual &amp; will still have a tons left.
1322673095283515395 2020-11-01 06:53:34 +0800 <MichiganWave> Should add that @VDAREJamesK has already done 5000% more than his fair share over the past decade. He's earned the right to kick back &amp; relax for a while.

1322668835951005699 2020-11-01 06:36:39 +0800 <MichiganWave> Best way to mitigate worry over Tuesday is to help the Trump campaign by working the phones on Monday &amp; till late afternoon Tuesday. Feel an inner calm when you know, come what may, that you did your small part to help.  Cautiously optimistic right now.

1322436921247883264 2020-10-31 15:15:06 +0800 <MichiganWave> The Left wants to boycott Home Depot now? HD isn't as harmful to Main Street as Amazon, Wal-Mart &amp; McDonalds. But Bernie Marcus's support of Trump should make the Left realize that Trump's hardly the demon of CNN narratives. Marcus just likes pro-Israel, low tax, pro-biz policy.

Those goofs clearly didn't study the 90s &amp; the attacks on Buchanan, Wilson &amp; Tancredo. They had no sense of what a rare &amp; precious window of opportunity we had in Nov-2016.
1322417202973298694 2020-10-31 13:56:45 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Blair_A_Nathan A Biden win would usher in a not-so-soft Totalitarianism that would relentlessly Unperson any candidate similar to a 2016 Trump. It doesn't matter that Trump see-sawed to Jarvanka mode since then. It's his 2015-17 stances that are on the ballot now. Those sins r unforgiven by msm

Germany+Scandinavia esp lap this up, seeing Obama as Saintly proof of Anti-Racist redemption
1321713486263652354 2020-10-29 15:20:26 +0800 <MichiganWave> There was a great divergence betw the US &amp; Europe acceletating in the early 70s.

1321678167816327169 2020-10-29 13:00:05 +0800 <MichiganWave> censorship is coming from ADL/SPLC liasons &amp; from Senior mngmnt who cycle betw the DEM Party &amp; BigTech. And from ppl in Zuck's orbit like his sister, shareholder Sean Parker &amp; the dozens of college indoctrinated SJW employees. There's a demoralised Hostage vibe coming from Dorsey

Alexa-microphones could be activated to constantly surveil/record the private speech of those deemed unreliably loyal to the Ruling Class. Then the ThoughtPolice dispatched when Hate Talk's detected
1321592910962397190 2020-10-29 07:21:18 +0800 <MichiganWave> @amber_athey He bravely steps forth to declare his allegiance to 95% of the msm, to the Tech Billionaires, &amp; the Deep State.  To call for a Return of,  &lt;Invade the World, Invite the World, Enrich the Oligarchs &amp; Surveil the Citizen&gt;
1321534028755947522 2020-10-29 03:27:20 +0800 <MichiganWave> @peterbrimelow He either internalized a Jarvanka/Schlapp worldview that it's grubby to appeal directly to White voters, OR, he sees himself as a savior to downtrodden Nonwhites, &amp; gets warm feelz from that. Maybe a combo of both.
1321510358738153475 2020-10-29 01:53:16 +0800 <MichiganWave> @LaurenWitzkeDE One wonders what his fate would be were he pro-free speech? Would the ADL &amp; MediaMatters collude with other forces to get him ousted? Not saying he has no agency but the pressures to conform to Prog Totalitarianism in Silicone Valley are immense.
1321507664279543808 2020-10-29 01:42:34 +0800 <MichiganWave> Similar deal in many other small polities which rely on subsidies from other nations or the mercies of a few Woke Oligarchs. These fake Elites sense their own imposter status - which is why they want to impose all the Totalitarianism to prevent the formation of a Patriotic Elite

1321350790783655936 2020-10-28 15:19:12 +0800 <MichiganWave> Why Anti-Racism conditioning is so corrosive &amp; deadly for the West. It invalidates natural &amp; healthy self-preservation &amp; community-preservation instincts. It makes Whites feel ashamed of pattern recognition w/in out-groups, leading to suicidal "Better Dead than Racist" scenarios.
1321334781477605378 2020-10-28 14:15:35 +0800 <MichiganWave> @W4nk_3ngine Genteel, Lib-appeasing Centrism relies on a supply of social capital from gullible, docile or brainwashed Whites.  Whites who are too ashamed to take their own side when faced with an invading horde.  It won't last much longer.  It's incompatible w/ Camp of the Saints scenarios
1321332695595651072 2020-10-28 14:07:18 +0800 <MichiganWave> @W4nk_3ngine Amazing how tepid Susan Collins' campaign is. Even if she was fighting someone as explicitly anti-White as Barbara Lerner-Spectre, she'd still be embarassed to fight 4 Whites to have self determination &amp; restrict immigration. Genteel Centrism is so easily hacked by subversives.

1321279665361866753 2020-10-28 10:36:35 +0800 <MichiganWave> Such a marriage has the markings of a Donor class PR stunt. Everything abt the Bidens reeks of being puppets for the Oligarchs while wanting to be richly rewarded in the process. WRT Donor Cl. Affinity Networks, here's a bit of pattern recognition 2 ponder  https://t.co/bnoss7Sef4
1321278228615647237 2020-10-28 10:30:52 +0800 <MichiganWave> Since we're waist deep into the muck of exposing the rot of the Ruling Class (mostly a subset of the Donor Class):  it's alarming that more media attn wasn't paid to Hunter Biden's bizarre insta-marriage to a S African Jew, shortly after he ended an affair with his sister-in-law.
1321272616687194113 2020-10-28 10:08:34 +0800 <MichiganWave> Carpetbagging &amp; anti-White alliance phenom that's behind the Ossoff campaign is similar to the forces propelling Sara Gideon (Rogoff) in Maine. There's a ruthless cunning in their presenting as Normie-friendly to White centrists while also quietly cheering the arrival of Somalis

RBG, Kagan &amp; Sotomayor are all quasi Bolsheviks. One fewer is cause to celebrate
1320955958596653057 2020-10-27 13:10:17 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JOttoPohl1 See that Ann Applebaum has decided to close ranks with the Neocons to help Biden.

But it presupposes a consensus that immigration policy not be used as a weapon against the natives, the founding stock, the trads. If you want to use immigration policy for revenge against schoolyard bullies&gt;

Translation: he'd prefer Western countries be treated as economic zones filled w/ interchangeable consumer units. And to serve as spillways for more of his co-ethnics from the Indian subcontinent
1319728368347189256 2020-10-24 03:52:17 +0800 <MichiganWave> A reminder that Center-Right parties elevating "model minorities" for Diversity points from the msm will get burned at least half the time.

1319727188548210699 2020-10-24 03:47:35 +0800 <MichiganWave> No Surprise here. An Anti-Brexit MP who helped the 2010 Tories lock in Barbara Roche's stealth 1997 3rd World Immigration mega-surge. Hardly a model minority, it's clear he'd be more comfortable if native Brits were reduced to minority status.   https://t.co/owLvL2XMnj
1319724757101826048 2020-10-24 03:37:56 +0800 <MichiganWave> Hard to believe the Ruling Class is pushing Borat2 so hard now. They think this garbage is going to win over swing voters who want to avoid association with an ADL approved archetypes of simpleton Trump voters. So tired. So lame.

Hopefully he sees how far gone 1-Party, Sanctuary states like Cal, IL, &amp; WA are. Coast to coast rule by Antifa &amp; the ADL's Prog mob awaits if there's amnesty
1319611110484475906 2020-10-23 20:06:20 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NYTDaniel @KMGVictoria @vdare He was pointing out Biden's fecklessness on policy promises.

It probably thrills him that he might get 40% of the Hispanic vote. We'll see, &amp; it's still a losing% anyway. Plus the V Low %s of Hindu Indian, Black Caribbean &amp; African immigrant vote he'll get. Prob &lt;18%
1319477800961675264 2020-10-23 11:16:37 +0800 <MichiganWave> @emeriticus Need Healthcare reforms that squeeze out the bloat costs of: Trial lawyers, BigPharma profiteering, Insurance co bureaucracy, &amp; Illegal Alien free riders on medicaid.

1319475384274960384 2020-10-23 11:07:00 +0800 <MichiganWave> Trump gives off the tone that he still believes there's a Bipartisan way out of this ClownWorld. There isn't. The DEM Base, msm &amp; the Deep state will always hate him &amp; us. He must lead with truth, courage, unshakeable resolve. Scatter the enemy till they're forced to submit
1319470967135952897 2020-10-23 10:49:27 +0800 <MichiganWave> Gets annoying. He gets him on the ropes but won't deliver a haymaker. He should have more killer instinct esp since we're in an existential bind.  Don't be merciful to vampires. Anyway still a good night for our side.

External: cost of payroll bloat passed on to customers Internal: Competent r&amp;d staff have to babysit, &amp; fix the errors made by Diversity hires. Resentment builds.
1319209323042668545 2020-10-22 17:29:46 +0800 <MichiganWave> To the extent that supporting Trump is a proxy for rejecting the Prog worldview of Ethnomasochism for Whites, the Left is incensed. They demand that all Whites be docile, submissive &amp; deferential to the Globhomo media-edu Blob. They'll try to send DIssidents to Re-education Camps
1319202395314937856 2020-10-22 17:02:15 +0800 <MichiganWave> This is an Enemies List for Antifa vandals &amp; an Unpersoning List for SJW-aligned HR Depts to disqualify job applicants. The Bolshevik Left wants Trump supporters cast out of society. They're playing with fire.

1319005356748689408 2020-10-22 03:59:17 +0800 <MichiganWave> @HarmlessYardDog TBF, the passenger rail network was even better, faster &amp; more reliable than this planning map way back in 1930. It declined in lockstep with the rise of Crony Capitalism, regulatory bloat, lawfare, &amp; the loss of social capital, 1955-1985
1318735126302543872 2020-10-21 10:05:29 +0800 <MichiganWave> @RichardHanania Masha Gessen reveals, w/ her premeditated lying &amp; gaslighting strategy, as a By Any Means Necessary type.  Journofa indeed.  She puts the S &amp; N in Subversion. And the Es in Weimerica &amp; Culture of Critique.
1318732469907214337 2020-10-21 09:54:56 +0800 <MichiganWave> @ScottMGreer Ponnuru is on the same wavelength as Ben Wattenberg &amp; Jonah Goldberg. He'd like to see Legacy Whites reduced to powerless minority status. It would make him feel more at ease, less of an outsider. Trumpism is too redolant of White awareness of Ruling class malevolence

Might be so if the media had a few key centrists or wobbly leftists in it. But it contains only hardcore Globalists, Sadists &amp; Subversives. They hate Middle America &amp; won't be, can't be, won over.
1318521615160889345 2020-10-20 19:57:04 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Lisette09280142 Was in @ChroniclesMag many yrs ago in an essay criticizing Jonah Goldberg's constant agit for GOP outreach/pandering to immigrant groups who vote DEM by big margins.

In terms of Bitchute staying Anti-fragile, isn't that a bad thing? If the content is v old or OOP, it may be moot. But if it makes em a target 4 Hollywood copyright lawsuits

1318473511661350912 2020-10-20 16:45:55 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Lisette09280142 Paul Gottfried accurately described most of the higher IQ model minorities like Indians as having a dual morality. They've a tight knit tribalism &amp; traditionalism for extended family. But they're fine letting the wider society become degenerate. A Ruthless merchant class mindset.
1318472475588657152 2020-10-20 16:41:48 +0800 <MichiganWave> Volunteerism, charity, &amp; conservation.  One massive Red Flag of Non-assimilation is the desire to use immigration as a weapon - a weapon to weaken the culture &amp; traditions of the host country. Or to import new voters to enable Alien ideologies like Bolshevism
1318469575797805056 2020-10-20 16:30:17 +0800 <MichiganWave> Coda: Probably only 2/3rds of the 1880-1924 immigrant-descended cohort had assimilated by 1988. By assimilated, i mean strongly identifying with American freedoms &amp; habits such as freedoms of speech, assembly &amp; association; gun rights, private property rights; Civic ideals of...&gt;

Then there's ppl who feel America has too much of a NW Euro culture, is too waspy etc. They want to bulldoze it to feel like less of an outsider. Assimilation is slow &amp; uncertain; prob stopped in the late 80s/
1318447760929181696 2020-10-20 15:03:36 +0800 <MichiganWave> ...opposition to socialism. The punishment they deserved was to be crowded out by hostile foreigners. Lastly, there's often a sexual &amp;/or ethnic basis for this anger against trad Whites. Low SMV Women who felt bitter at being relatively invisible to men &amp; wanted to smash society&gt;
1318446553426780160 2020-10-20 14:58:48 +0800 <MichiganWave> grievances. Anger over GOP domination of the presidency from 1968 to 92, &amp; esp at the landslides of '72 &amp; '84. Even tho trad Whites didn't get much from those big wins, they still deserved a comeuppance for having been so "simple" in their patriotism, desire for law &amp; order, &amp; &gt;
1318445191490117632 2020-10-20 14:53:23 +0800 <MichiganWave> ..response is the Flippant tactic, meant to make the Questioner defend even being concerned or aware of the changes.  A 2nd, more rare response was "Whites deserve to become a minority. They've been dominant for too long" This is the revenge response &amp; seemed to be rooted in 2..&gt;

1318413577552879616 2020-10-20 12:47:46 +0800 <MichiganWave> @JayFiveK Dream scenario is strong win for Trump, w/ some RINO incumbents gettin turfed but GOP making some surprise pick ups to hold the Senate &amp; gain ground in the House.
1318412670211600384 2020-10-20 12:44:10 +0800 <MichiganWave> Has Lindsey Graham has decided to forfeit his reelection bid?

Cheap Labor lobbies &amp; Alienist Oligarchs ftw

Less signif than a speed bump or mosquito bite. Real ways to stop collusion include jail time, trust busting
1318387325773250560 2020-10-20 11:03:27 +0800 <MichiganWave> IOW it would be the worst aspects of the responses in Britain, AUS, NY, Cal, MI plus Open Borders &amp; inculcating the public to accept a new set of lost liberties. Liberties that can be suspended on the whim of a few public health "experts" w/ the suspensions guided by BigTech
1318385092637675523 2020-10-20 10:54:35 +0800 <MichiganWave> Imagining a Clinton-Kaine response to Covid. -open borders &amp; much lecturing abt x-ism &amp; needing to be inclusive of all. -massive surveillance &amp; suppression, both petty &amp; demoralising -then Voila, we're told they've saved us all, after data is massaged, &amp; a new normal internalized
1318382471835246593 2020-10-20 10:44:10 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Barnes_Law @VDAREJamesK Roberts does seem weaker &amp; more Left-appeasing than Kennedy or O'Connor. His template is closer to Souter's
1318376658315939848 2020-10-20 10:21:04 +0800 <MichiganWave> @VDAREJamesK V Important post. The charade continues. GOPe pols harness populist &amp; trad energies for personal &amp; oligarch gains while betraying the GOP Base.
1318078486762971137 2020-10-19 14:36:14 +0800 <MichiganWave> Diversity is cool when it's the 6 Nations Rugby tournament betw England, Ireland, France, Scotland, Wales &amp; Italy. Or a cheap package vacation in the Canary Islands. But it's a suicidal indulgence if it's a surrender to a Camp of the Saints flotilla
1318076726438727680 2020-10-19 14:29:14 +0800 <MichiganWave> For ages, Euros have been conditioned to believe that American life is "dog eat dog", with poor minorities oppressed by cruel Whites. It's a cartoonish, Hollywood narrative, pushed by the BBC, DW, French &amp; Spanish state broadcasters. The Scandinavian broadcasters even worse.
1318075722787946496 2020-10-19 14:25:15 +0800 <MichiganWave> Sure Trump's speaking style is clumsy, declassÃ©, low brow. But given the urgency of the political &amp; demographic situation, the decision comes down to differences on substance. Europeans need to start standing on their own feet to fend off the threats from Africa, China, India.

However, there r prob some subversives working at lower levels. @redicetv showed a clip in 2018 of a Roche type from NY who was pushing White guilt &amp; diversity in NZL
1317736936061063169 2020-10-18 15:59:02 +0800 <MichiganWave> Good luck NZL!  Pay close attention to what is happening to other majority White nations. Don't let your Ruling Class exploit your goodwill or shame you into silence. There's no need for any immigration at all when native fertility can be incentivized./
1317736014828376064 2020-10-18 15:55:22 +0800 <MichiganWave> easily become a puppet of China v soon. They need to know that it's in the nature of Refugee NGOs &amp; BigTech to want to devour the social capital of nice places like NZL. It's insufficiently diverse in their view &amp; must be transformed to be more in line w/ 3rd World misery levels&gt;
1317734497694019586 2020-10-18 15:49:21 +0800 <MichiganWave> ...it's going to be harder, or take a lot more courage, for the Nationalist Right to push back against a higher "new normal" of immigration &amp; concommitant diversity propaganda. In a small media ecosytem, Prog conformity, internet surveillance will be easier to enforce. NZL could&gt;
1317732895344054272 2020-10-18 15:42:59 +0800 <MichiganWave> Response. Once Covid fears fade, expect Ardern to crank up immigration to unprecedented levels. She'll want to resume doing to NZL what Tony Blair &amp; Barbara Roche did to Britain, &amp; what Alan Shatter &amp; Leo Varadkar did to IRE. -Since there's already restrictions on free speech,&gt;
1317731013234094081 2020-10-18 15:35:30 +0800 <MichiganWave> -the mosque shooting in 2018 helped Ardern marginalize criticism of multiculturalism &amp; mass immigration. Almost as tho the shooter was a gift to the Left &amp; the Globalist project. -Immigration into NZL was running Very High, (Highest Ever?) in 2018-19, &amp; only shut down as a Covid&gt;
1317729580128509952 2020-10-18 15:29:48 +0800 <MichiganWave> -The Center-Right National Party was in disarray, w/ infighting &amp; the election turnout looks way lower than in 2017 -The New Zealand First party-which seems to have been Ardern's coalition lapdog- got crushed. Prob deserved to if they acquiesced to her clamp down on free speech..
1317728108552671232 2020-10-18 15:23:57 +0800 <MichiganWave> Scoured some news clips abt New Zealand's election results. Some quick takes: -Emo-faced Ardern seems to have temporarily taken the immigration issue off the table w/ her response to Covid. That prob put her opponents supporters at ease; made her a harder target for the Right...

Absimmilation  Also that MT has a DEM Senator is partly explained by the last MT GOP candidate being a cartoonishly short sighted real estate development shill.

1317674895552049152 2020-10-18 11:52:30 +0800 <MichiganWave> @FoxworthFor14 @Blair_A_Nathan Probably true. 75% of TX's leftward drift is due to 3rd World migration to Houston &amp; Dallas, not Cal to Austin flows of BoBos, Baristas or coders

Yet what of Right leaning Californians fleeing in search of others on the Right? Too few to make a splash? Are they only going to ID &amp; UT ?

There's still this segment of naifs in the DEM party who believe msm talking pts and just want to go along/get along. Call them the pollyanna gummy bear piece of the DEM coalition.
1316830446378983424 2020-10-16 03:56:58 +0800 <MichiganWave> Imagine thinking now that Bill Barr is any bolder or more diligent than Jeff Sessions. Sessions was clearly too timid in 2017 when the Russia nonsense was umfolding. But Barr is just stringing ppl along now, playing on residual hopes. He's either compromised or a coward

1316639270464114688 2020-10-15 15:17:18 +0800 <MichiganWave> When you read this, know that "Putin's bidding" really means White Gentiles who nominally resist Globalism &amp; subversion by Soros or similar orgs pushing open borders &amp; Tech monopolism. If you resist NeoBolshevism, you're doing "Putin's bidding"   https://t.co/p8O9e9MzeA
1316635770694897667 2020-10-15 15:03:24 +0800 <MichiganWave> Amazing how much of the Deep State despises Putin simply cause he rolled back the predatory monopolism of the mostly Jewish Oligarchs fleecing Russia in the 90s. Once you peel back the veneer &amp; expose the ethnic interests, u c why lawyers w/ names like "Goldman" are so prominent
1316508980244631554 2020-10-15 06:39:35 +0800 <MichiganWave> If 2016 was the Flight 93 election, what does that make this one? Eventually we have to actually be in command.

Hard to know pros &amp; cons since the Great Depression was probably less intense due to 6 yrs of restriction preceding it.

1315030884840603659 2020-10-11 04:46:09 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Hrothgar1066 Maybe. But a big catalyst for the 1924 Act was the anarcho-Bolshevism of often Jewish migrants from Russia &amp; Eastern Europe. There were noted acts of terrorism against Wall Street which is a reason even Corporate America at the time was supportive of the 1924 Act.
1315025038664491009 2020-10-11 04:22:55 +0800 <MichiganWave> One of the tired tactics of Mass immigration boosters is conflating Irish &amp; Italian migration of the 19th Century with the massive post-1985 wave.

1314048524376440837 2020-10-08 11:42:36 +0800 <MichiganWave> @peterbrimelow Same suppression of Re-tweets. I've never seen it this blatant
1314048175209029633 2020-10-08 11:41:13 +0800 <MichiganWave> @peterbrimelow Twitter is boosting their suppressing of your posts right now. It's auto-reversing the Likes a second after a Like is made.
1313949706121248768 2020-10-08 05:09:56 +0800 <MichiganWave> "Can't we all get along" says the Federal Govt. As it sends snipers to Ruby Ridge or fires tear gas into a Waco compound. Or as it allows mergers of Woke capital oligopolies which deny service to Nationalists.

U see this in how the media tries to stoke anti-White hate w/in Asian migrants w/ "Legacy of Colonialism" narratives. Or by noting 19th Cent immigration restrictions on Asians.  Invite + Incite
1313789621352964099 2020-10-07 18:33:49 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Steve_Sailer That data makes a strong case that skills/merit-based immigration from Asia will simply worsen inequality in the West. There's 3+ Billion Asians &amp; Western countries will be skimming the top 10-20%. An Overclass, but also a Woke Overclass absimmilated to hatred of Whites.

Her husband's last name is Rogoff Gideon so he was Rogoff before marrying, then adding his wife's name.  A power couple name rebranding for politics - just as Barry Sotero changed to Barack Obama.

1312632860650680321 2020-10-04 13:57:16 +0800 <MichiganWave> Gideon's religion is a complete mystery. Jewish husband, probably a Hindu father &amp; an Armenian (Orthodox Christian?) mother. Maybe she just presents, chameleon style, as whatever suits the moment. Maybe she identifies as "high caste Globalist"/
1312631669820657665 2020-10-04 13:52:32 +0800 <MichiganWave> A chilling thing abt Google &amp; Wikipedia being controlled by Globalists:  the info's increasingly curated to conceal or obscure inconvenient or awkward facts  Eg. How is Sara Gideon's father's last name the same as her husband's? The husband took the wife's last name?
1312628481461805058 2020-10-04 13:39:52 +0800 <MichiganWave> Coda: Gideon says very little abt immigration on her website or in her speeches. She surely knows it's a losing issue for her. But you get the gist in this article-   https://t.co/5laDDSUlMN
1312626698777751552 2020-10-04 13:32:47 +0800 <MichiganWave> Maybe Susan Collins is too weak &amp; pathetic to win this race. The refugee fiascos in Lewiston &amp; Portland are obvious talking pts.

1312620852735868928 2020-10-04 13:09:33 +0800 <MichiganWave> Everything about Sara Gideon screams: -Deep State -Globalism -White Presenting for Naifs but Alienist tool for the Monopolies &amp; Lobbies -Carpetbagger who moved to Maine in her late 20s but masquerades as a Mainer.

1312163395668377600 2020-10-03 06:51:47 +0800 <MichiganWave> @AwakenedSaxon6 @KMGVictoria You may be right. Excess intake of refined sugar is a huge problem. Ppl constantly on a blood sugar roller coaster &amp; getting close to insulin resistant.
1312159630194176003 2020-10-03 06:36:49 +0800 <MichiganWave> @RowdyRamzan Simple explanation is that Baron-Cohen is brimming with loathing &amp; contempt for White Goyim, esp farmers, hunters, proles, blue collar normies.

1312149504276131841 2020-10-03 05:56:35 +0800 <MichiganWave> Time to end the thread. Way into WrongThink territory. ADL algorithms closing in etc./
1312148988158590976 2020-10-03 05:54:31 +0800 <MichiganWave> The first time it seemed risky for Trump to have so many close NY Jewish associates was back in late 2015. His Jewish co-author of "Art of the Deal" attacked him in the press, saying he wished he'd never worked with him. Was an omen of J-friendships to be exposed as transactional
1312147552708435968 2020-10-03 05:48:49 +0800 <MichiganWave> Trump needs to understand Neolib Jewish mindsets. Many are driven by their paranoia to put Globalist designs &amp; tribal comfort above friendships. Don't test them - they're probably too weak to pass the test &amp; they'll betray you to appease pressure from coethnics. #Tribalism
1312146267993063425 2020-10-03 05:43:43 +0800 <MichiganWave> Clearly Bill Kristol &amp; David Frum were triggered this way. Kristol, by Trump's immigration restrictionism &amp; defiance of Emma Lazarus shibboleths. Frum, from the phrase, "America First" which conjured images of Charles Lindbergh. Others are triggered by reading too many NYT op-eds

And they swing into a By Any Means Necessary mode when triggered
1312144005870751745 2020-10-03 05:34:44 +0800 <MichiganWave> Winston Wolkoff is clearly a cold blooded sociopath, not unlike Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen. This is partly an upshot of their strand of secular, ultra political &amp; tribal Judaism. Not so much, "the filthy goyim must be put in their place"; More from a default paranoia abt..&gt;

1311817615912972288 2020-10-02 07:57:46 +0800 <MichiganWave> Did Trump really tell La Raza Blanco to "Stand back, Stand by.." (for further instructions)?  Wondering if the CelebLeft has simply lost all grip on reality. Like Brian O'Blivion, their brains have become fused with too many VCR tapes of Hollywood Persecution Porn
1311808106641469440 2020-10-02 07:19:59 +0800 <MichiganWave> Women strive to build consensus. Lately keeping a consensus means appeasing feelz of the Woke Left. To disrupt this, enough men on the Right need to hold frame &amp; let women calmly know that Woke-ists are liars &amp; Anti-Whites.

1311792662052249606 2020-10-02 06:18:37 +0800 <MichiganWave> Wow.  Another over the top smear of White Gentile Trump voters by the Anti-White Elite.  Baron Cohen took time out from working with the ADL to force more censorship of stubborn Kulaks by BigTech.  And voilÃ  2 hrs of dopey slapstick snearing at Middle America.
1311778199454523393 2020-10-02 05:21:09 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Seven_Crimes Yeah good point. Their game has long been as much about burying content which deviates from the Cult-Marx agenda as it is to advance explicit White guilt conditioning. TBH, the most insidious propaganda is the tangential stuff. Like often casting blonde hair Whites as villains
1311744847351623681 2020-10-02 03:08:37 +0800 <MichiganWave> Returns of this propaganda, it's what the Ruling Class is habituated to. They'll combine Demoralise, Surveil + Suppress tactics until no resistance is possible (or the country &amp; Ruling Class are broken up).
1311743641208094720 2020-10-02 03:03:49 +0800 <MichiganWave> The Media are finding, to their horror, that maybe 60% of Whites have a baseline of self respect &amp; self preservation instinct that will compel them to defy a Great Replacement future. Thus the frantic effort to Flood the Zone w/ Ethnomasochism conditioning. Despite Diminishing &gt;
1311742451804246018 2020-10-02 02:59:06 +0800 <MichiganWave> Media obsession w/ the KKK is a supplement to the White Guilt conditioning of Hollywood. Films like Mississippi Burning, A Time To Kill &amp; The Heat of the Night were Version 1.0 Films like Get Out, Django Unchained, &amp; Children of Men aren't working as well to inculcate White Guilt
1311506441040207873 2020-10-01 11:21:16 +0800 <MichiganWave> @VDAREJamesK We need to turn the linguistic tables on these Lib propagandists.  CRT is Anti-White. Particularly Anti-White Christian

Minds seemed a bit stale last year &amp; i've not joined Parler. Am quite happy with Bitchute, Telegram, Gab &amp; DLive. Wondering if Parler or Minds have a chance at taking signif traffic from Twitter, Fbook
1311477619322482694 2020-10-01 09:26:45 +0800 <MichiganWave> @FoxworthFor14 White tolerance, kindness &amp; altruism is being exploited by subversive Arrivistes. That's the main point of the past 60+ years of media-edu Anti-X-ism conditioning: to exploit the goodwill of Whites &amp; turn us into docile, powerless tax slaves.

1311313280145731584 2020-09-30 22:33:43 +0800 <MichiganWave> The mere fact that the Proud Boys have respect for Western Civ &amp; are not hostile to White people is, in the minds of the Hive, their unpardonable sin.  This exposes Jake Tapper &amp; the Hive as Alienists. They want a numb sea of consumers to rule over, all lobotomized at Year Zero
1311311932775858176 2020-09-30 22:28:22 +0800 <MichiganWave> The Hive is revealing its Intolerance for: -Freedoms of Speech, Association, &amp; Assembly -The Right to self defense when attacked by the Far Left Jake Tapper reveals an Anti-White bigotry in attacking the Proud Boys. He won't tolerate even mild, pro-Western Civic Nationalism
1311310397773930499 2020-09-30 22:22:16 +0800 <MichiganWave> When CNN &amp; the rest of the Hive attack the Proud Boys, they are attacking an early 80s tier Civic Nationalism. Is a reflection of the Hive's thirst for Totalitarianism that they object to a group that's White sympatico but not Whites only. Similar to their attacks on Prop187.
1311303437045428224 2020-09-30 21:54:36 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Progrockfarmer @Lana_Jordan Remember that video. It was fine. A bit of a lampoon of the Jewish lobbies. Nothing indefensible at all. Tapper just wants all Jewish orgs, issues, influence to be out of bounds for gentiles to discuss. He's trying to re-assert Jewish veto power over public discussions.
1311170416225013760 2020-09-30 13:06:02 +0800 <MichiganWave> @castlechs A real brawl. Which is good because the debates before 2016 were mostly just the genteel theatre of the Uniparty &amp; Manufacturing Consent.
1311165277183369217 2020-09-30 12:45:37 +0800 <MichiganWave> @HbdNrx John Rivers' Gab thread is solid tonight. More sober minded than avg rah rah MAGA threads.  OT but remember just how frickin weak &amp; dumb Bush2 was in 00 &amp; 04, &amp; how Controlled Oppo McCain was in '08 &amp; Romney in the last 2 debated of 2012.
1311157911545151488 2020-09-30 12:16:20 +0800 <MichiganWave> Great Night for Alt-Tech (or Escape from Big Tech) per @OfficialDLive   @redicetv stream w/ @JamesEdwardsTPC &amp; Jared Taylor, &amp;,  @NickJFuentes AmFirst stream.

1311151433270661120 2020-09-30 11:50:36 +0800 <MichiganWave> @ReactionaryIan @isabelsmother Having a deceased veteran son cannot be a reason for more Forever Wars or Neocon meddling, color revolutions. And it's clear Biden will relentlessly use his son as a diversion from justifying nonsense like more Arab springs.
1311150477577510912 2020-09-30 11:46:48 +0800 <MichiganWave> @ReactionaryIan @isabelsmother Insofar as the game is rigged for the Uniparty, Trump needs to go bulldog &amp; smash the china. But yeah, he could tweek his technique to land more distinctive punches.  Biden getting stymied from self righteously using his son as a policy shield was a good example of a hard jab.
1311145884483280896 2020-09-30 11:28:33 +0800 <MichiganWave> @HbdNrx Trump's Team is going to have to prep for more moderator bias in the next debate. I wish he would speak up more for working class Whites. Or just generic blue collar  voters in flyover country. There's still time.
1311144200470224898 2020-09-30 11:21:51 +0800 <MichiganWave> @j_bird53 Yeah. His pupils looked oddly dilated &amp; black.
1311143713368875009 2020-09-30 11:19:55 +0800 <MichiganWave> @HbdNrx Never liked Trump's speaking style (compared to Enoch Powell or Pat Buchanan it's too adolescent &amp; rambling). But all that matters is knocking Biden off balance. Wait till after debate #2 to make a verdict. Trump's all that stands betw us &amp; a Sorosian perma-hegemony. Fight on.
1311138119543029762 2020-09-30 10:57:42 +0800 <MichiganWave> @AkonFenty @latimes Quite certain Biden used the word "xenophobia" or "xenophobic" to scold Trump's early response to Covid.
1311135441370914816 2020-09-30 10:47:03 +0800 <MichiganWave> Good to see Trump on the attack with intensity. He should continue on this track to wear down dopey Biden. Once immigration is a topic, haymakers will land
1311132529580150784 2020-09-30 10:35:29 +0800 <MichiganWave> Trump is hammering away on the fact that his first term was sabotaged by the Deep State, the Russia Hoax &amp; the Fake News media.  He should keep hammering away at this. The GOP Base &amp; Independents need to get pissed that Uniparty/Deep State subverts election results.
1311130897949786117 2020-09-30 10:29:00 +0800 <MichiganWave> Three of the simplest ways to improve the environment: -Immigration Moratorium -Incentivize Working from Home -Popularize Air Drying of Laundry (Clotheslines)
1311094027882622976 2020-09-30 08:02:29 +0800 <MichiganWave> @PereGrimmer Am bracing for Biden to wheel out the ol Neolib smarm rhetoric of,  "This is not who we are", &amp; "As a nation, we are better than this"  .. to cast shame on Trump's mildly tough immigration policies.
1311092603782266880 2020-09-30 07:56:50 +0800 <MichiganWave> @LanaLokteff @JamesEdwardsTPC Is the debate being sponsored by BigPharma or the maker of Depends? Am hoping we'll see Biden do the Nadler Penguin walk.

1311062231254052865 2020-09-30 05:56:08 +0800 <MichiganWave> Also wondering when the Actual DEM nominee, Kampala Desi, will be debating Pence. Don't forget that Biden is just the decrepit, short term puppet for the Ruling Class. Kampala will be their real agent while Joe sleeps or takes meds.

1311021710662131713 2020-09-30 03:15:08 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Rich_Cooper For every Harrison Ford, Eric Clapton, Roger Waters, Michael Douglas &amp; Leo DiCaprio, there's a Ryan Gosling, Ashton Kutcher &amp; Prince Harry. Those who go for the drama free "safe harbor" of an older woman may be introverts, exhausted from the dating scene or want a Mommy/GF hybrid

1311019283632316416 2020-09-30 03:05:29 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Rich_Cooper Notice that Ryan Gosling is with Eva Mendes, who is 5 yrs older than him? Puzzling. Suspect that some Hollywood A listers want older women because in many cases the discrepancy in SMV is so acute that she's compelled to be sweet &amp; warm most of the time to keep him from straying

They'd cut the signal &amp; make up a lie to cover up the real reason. Biden represents so brutally the Globohomo Ruling Class; they wanna protect the puppet
1310990491874471936 2020-09-30 01:11:04 +0800 <MichiganWave> Ppl on the Right often conflate calls for Reparations to Nonwhites with "identity politics".  A better take is that it's an envy driven blood libel against Whites. And a grotesque violation of private property rights. They want White land &amp; assets because of jealousy. Simple as.
1310985150998761472 2020-09-30 00:49:51 +0800 <MichiganWave> Pace @KMGVictoria the West is just a convulsing economic zone. Filled with a demoralised Legacy population, &amp; atomised or rage-filled Anti-Whites. A grab for spoils, with money printer go brrrr &amp; debt mountains unto infinity.
1310983915147014147 2020-09-30 00:44:56 +0800 <MichiganWave> They do enjoy some of the residue of Western Civ. But have no appreciation of its vital function. This is why Freedoms of Speech, Association &amp; Assembly are being swept away. And why Gun Rights won't survive Whites falling below 58-60% of the population.
1310982968744308736 2020-09-30 00:41:11 +0800 <MichiganWave> When you mingle with the 'talented 10th' of 3rd World immigrants who arrived in the past 20-30 years, it truly is amazing how much Consumerism &amp; Neolib/Diversity shibboleths are the only "culture" they've glommed onto. They've Zero Fealty to pre-1920, even pre-1965 Western Civ.
1310980992182743043 2020-09-30 00:33:20 +0800 <MichiganWave> @ASavageNation Biden's been a Govt / Donor Class parasite since 1970. Always worked ostensibly for the taxpayer yet became a multimillionaire due to corrupt practices.
1310980332414545924 2020-09-30 00:30:42 +0800 <MichiganWave> @VDAREJamesK If Trump is seen as being pro-Armenia &amp; not pro-Islam, pro-Turkey, the media will frame it as more "Putin's puppet" fluff. Amazing how Anti-Christian the Deep State &amp; MSM have been since the mid-90s.

Relies on mass over-consumption of corn syrup, junk food, fast food &amp; dairy to survive
1310788217168330757 2020-09-29 11:47:18 +0800 <MichiganWave> @CottoGottfried Pushing the results of flawed polls is a way to demoralise one side &amp; to Manufacture Consent.

1310476788724895745 2020-09-28 15:09:48 +0800 <MichiganWave> @douglasmercer33 Moreover, as Nonwhite immigrants they should've been grateful to the supermajority White host country. Instead, their origin story is one of Absimmilation, Flight from White, Alienism.  Interestingly, Kamala's father seems more realist now, probably less Alienist than Kamal's mom
1310475197452038146 2020-09-28 15:03:29 +0800 <MichiganWave> @douglasmercer33 Not sure degenerate is the right tag here. It's more that Kamala's immigrant parents met &amp; were initially united by their opposition to White self determination &amp; their affinity (&amp; gullibility) for msm narratives abt Nonwhites being oppressed. In 1960s Cal, that was silly.

Despite the fact that all western countries are fully explored, settled &amp; with high unemployment rates; natives needing help. Yet still they want to impose relentless immigration

1310123393295867905 2020-09-27 15:45:32 +0800 <MichiganWave> fervor for growth by high immigration was also voiced in the early 1920s by Jewish business leaders such as Louis Marshall (as noted by @TOOEdit in a recent stream w/ @real_gtk ).

1310108022660763648 2020-09-27 14:44:27 +0800 <MichiganWave> Good article.

1309993925848043525 2020-09-27 07:11:05 +0800 <MichiganWave> The archetype of the pro-life SoCon who was also totally co-opted into Globalism &amp; Neoliberalism is the main reason the Right went nowhere from 1985 to 2015.

1309922215358586882 2020-09-27 02:26:07 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NYTDaniel Haiti is who we'll become. If we resist, more Anti-Racism lectures incoming.
1309921058607300612 2020-09-27 02:21:32 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NYTDaniel Problem is that Churchianity (post-1960 Christianity) has become a debilitating, universalist solvent. As global population surges towards 10 Billion, it will spell doom for the West - as Churchian mindset leaves us open to exploitation &amp; colonisation by 3rd World migrant waves.

Nordcuck plague rats should be forced to stay in the nests they fouled.  Damage contained.

1309206412879425536 2020-09-25 03:01:47 +0800 <MichiganWave> *correction. It was a 2006 film set in 2027.

1309190864976175104 2020-09-25 02:00:00 +0800 <MichiganWave> Solid Blackpilled film analysis. The 2004 film "Children of Men" was an eerie propaganda piece to introduce naifs to White Erasure &amp; the surrender of the West to a 3rd World, Camp of the Saints invasion. It debuted while Blair &amp; Roche were stealthily tripling immigration into GB

1308877743443136512 2020-09-24 05:15:46 +0800 <MichiganWave> RBG wielded direct power on Scotus so she needed a media cult of personality to smooth out her sharp edged, often cruel Leftism. It will be interesting to see how Zuckerberg, Brin &amp; Page manage their personas. All powerful &amp; clearly Globalist, ethnocentric but cold &amp; robotic
1308876407196577799 2020-09-24 05:10:27 +0800 <MichiganWave> Leftist &amp; Globalist Jews like Soros, the Milliband bros, Mike Bloomberg, Tom Steyer &amp; Paul Singer would like to forbid criticism of themselves. They want to exert control using stooges like Biden &amp; Harris, but remain above the fray.
1308873556894404610 2020-09-24 04:59:08 +0800 <MichiganWave> Would RBG b revered even 1/10th as much by the Ruling Class if she wasn't a Left Wing Secular Jew? If she was Rt Wing, Nationalist, Libertarian, she'd have been dismissed by Jews as a traitor to her tribe. If she was a Leftist Gentile, she'd b regarded as another child of the 60s

1308833988048551937 2020-09-24 02:21:54 +0800 <MichiganWave> @douglasmercer33 Was the 1924 Immigration Restriction law a rallying point for the J-Left to further tighten their control of media &amp; cut off discussion of taboos inconvenient for them?  Seems so.  E Celler was apparently simmering with a desire for revenge after the 1924 act passed.
1308639102045216768 2020-09-23 13:27:29 +0800 <MichiganWave> @SelimSeesYou When Castro emptied Cuba's jails onto the shores of Florida in 1980, it wasn't out of altruism. Like Bloomberg, he surely knew that this cohort would harm his political adversary Uncle Sam. Just a Bio-warfare chess move.

It has whiffs of Judeo-Bolshevism but mostly it's abt clearing the way for a Soft Totalitarianism of NGOs, the Kritarchy &amp; Blank Slate-peddling Oligarchs like Soros. They package it to themselves &amp; others as "progress"
1308633369761243136 2020-09-23 13:04:43 +0800 <MichiganWave> @michellemalkin After 1984, John McCain's motto became: Donor Class First.  He then spent the last 20+ years of his life lecturing the GOP Base on the need to obey the Deep State, the Globalist Oligarchs &amp; the Media.  It's all so tiresome.
1308632208639438849 2020-09-23 13:00:06 +0800 <MichiganWave> @SelimSeesYou There's at least as much, probably more evidence of Clinton, Gore &amp; Dubya evading Vietnam service by fiendish methods. The Lincoln Proj wouldn't touch that tho. Cuz muh Bipartisanship &amp; need for National unity.
1308623843326599176 2020-09-23 12:26:51 +0800 <MichiganWave> Quite a good show. Savage discusses the real Alienist RBG ideology, from her preference for the constitution of ANC South Africa over the USA's to her radical positions on gender, &amp; age of consent. Notes that Reform Judaism is usually just a religion of Leftist politics.

1308594895226052609 2020-09-23 10:31:50 +0800 <MichiganWave> @HarmlessYardDog Alarming how focussed our ruling class is on unleashing criminals &amp; illegal aliens upon the law abiding citizenry. It reeks of Sadism, Bio-Warfare, Bio-Leninism. Like they want to terrorize Trads into submission - to an unfettered domination by this Ruling Class.
1308385949647343618 2020-09-22 20:41:33 +0800 <MichiganWave> @emeriticus There was a Senator who ran on this in 1996. Name was Phil Gramm. He went nowhere &amp; he's largely been forgotten except when Clinton era trade &amp; deregulation (pandering to BigBank Monopolism) are recalled - then his contributions are remembered with disdain.
1308277974437945345 2020-09-22 13:32:30 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Steve_Sailer @BWLH_ It doesn't help that many on the GOP Side refer to the rioters as "fascists".  They're just a hodgepodge of: -mentally unstable envious misfits -Nonwhite criminals in the looting vanguard -Bolsheviks -feeble minded products of the Leftist media-edu indoctrination complex

1308170715947053059 2020-09-22 06:26:17 +0800 <MichiganWave> Would you consider a position of Assistant Lecturer in White Erasure studies in the EU's Coudenhove-Kalergi Institute?  There may also be a new Lerner-Spectre professorship in a Soros/Open Society college. Mostly Tikkun olam, critical race theory.
1308127338580922372 2020-09-22 03:33:56 +0800 <MichiganWave> @BenWinegard Of course he is. Just like for Ben Wattenberg, it would soothe Yglesias's paranoia if White Gentiles became a powerless minority in the country they founded. As the US has become a Ponzi scheme run by a hostile overclass, more Biomass must be fed into the system to prop it up.

1308124671301357568 2020-09-22 03:23:20 +0800 <MichiganWave> "Anti-Racist" Virtue Signalling is a form of parasitism or societal cannibalism.  These acts of signalling reinforce the lie of the Blank Slate &amp; reinforce the media's mind virus that Non-White criminality, sloth or underachievement is caused by White cruelty.
1308119544515514369 2020-09-22 03:02:57 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NYTDaniel @NationalistTV Are surely many African &amp; Middle Eastern countries where abortion is much less common than here. But they're far worse places to live for cultural &amp; demographic reasons. Abortion issue is boob bait for SoCons who are too cowed to talk abt immigration &amp; Anti-White hiring quotas.
1308118247028535296 2020-09-22 02:57:48 +0800 <MichiganWave> @NYTDaniel @NationalistTV Stances on Birthrite Citizenship, Border Control/Refugee law, Racial Quotas, Gun Rights &amp; Actual Freedom of Association are all that matter for the next decade. Insofar as Demography is Destiny, Abortion is way downstream from these issues. It's a pointless distraction now.

There's also too little traffic in most cities &amp; too much cheap, reliable electricity in California. But worst of all, the country's too White. It needs to be Brown &amp; Crowded.

1307860431957094400 2020-09-21 09:53:20 +0800 <MichiganWave> @RupertVonRipp She's an Alienist for sure. But on her way to top she's fooling the rubes with some token health care goodies. Will do a proper thread tomorrow. There's overlapping themes w/ similar Hindu Indian politicians across the English speaking world.
1307858034136416258 2020-09-21 09:43:48 +0800 <MichiganWave> Gideon's story captures so much of 2020 Amerikwa that it deserves a special thread to cover: -Carpetbagging &amp; Globohomo Career Pols -Absimmilation to Anti-White Woke culture -Marrying The Strong Horse (Jewish power couples, access to the Donor Class) -Dual Morality &amp; Subversion
1307853372922494978 2020-09-21 09:25:17 +0800 <MichiganWave> Kamala Harris, Pramila Jayapal &amp; Saira Rao are the harbinger of this ethnic block's agenda. Lots of animus against Whites &amp; eager to use immigration as a weapon against the founding stock. eg.  https://t.co/3LXgolpb1L
1307852285255528449 2020-09-21 09:20:58 +0800 <MichiganWave> Time for more on our side to raise awareness of growing Hindu Indian electoral ambitions within the Coalition of the Fringes. They clearly see the West as a migratory spillway for their co-ethnics &amp; are mastering the art of sleazy, Anti-White Globohomo Deep State politics.

1307177906318254081 2020-09-19 12:41:13 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Semiogogue Roberts votes Right mostly when his vote is inconsequential (when even Breyer swings Right). So RBG's absence drastically increases the pressure on him (&amp; Kavanaugh) to swing left in key votes, for the sake of "national unity" &amp; other WaPo talking pts
1307176507568259072 2020-09-19 12:35:40 +0800 <MichiganWave> @Semiogogue Jello-ish members like John Roberts slide left in key votes if the MSM applies enough pressure. So it's really a 4-1-3 (Right-Jello-Left) court with RBG gone.  Roberts saved Obama care in a key 2010 vote after the MSM applied veiled editorial threats
1307174689568100354 2020-09-19 12:28:26 +0800 <MichiganWave> @vdare What if there's litigation surrounding ballot fraud &amp; it goes to an 8 member SCOTUS where there's 4-4 tie vote?  Hopefully Trump hangs tough and doesn't do a wimpy "bipartisan" nomination w/ another Lefty.  Will to Power Now.  The DEMs hate us &amp; want to replace us &amp; our culture.
1307149619751792640 2020-09-19 10:48:49 +0800 <MichiganWave> TBF she was certainly the Leftmost justice till 2005. But Kagan &amp; Sotomayor are likely just as far Left. RBG helped make Globalist Leftism more normative. Now Kagan &amp; Sotomayor seem unremarkable by comparison.
1307148209916121089 2020-09-19 10:43:13 +0800 <MichiganWave> Was RBG the most Left wing justice to ever serve on SCOTUS? Probably. Certainly on racial quotas, abortion, &amp; immigration. Looking fwd to an honest assessment in an obit.
1307120321779163136 2020-09-19 08:52:24 +0800 <MichiganWave> @SelimSeesYou One wonders how long she was on life support or how often she was mentally competent over the past 2 yrs.

Melissa's in yellow at the beginning. Then Harris in red. But at the end the smarmy women in black with big glasses &amp; dark roots. She's the one cutting in &amp; cutting off discussion. Who is she? Melissa w/o the makeup or a Deep State snitch?
1306415625225502721 2020-09-17 10:12:11 +0800 <MichiganWave> Ominous how many parallels there are betw the US Deep State &amp; the pre-1925 Bolsheviks of the 'Internationale' variety. Making the US military into an enforcement arm of Globalist, Anti-White, Anti-Western ideology is the grim end game of the Oligarchs &amp; Neocon/Neolib Uniparty.

Ppl like Harris Faulkner aren't really on the Right at all. They're just happy to be diversity window dressing while subverting &amp; undermining those who empowered them.

1306367895014965249 2020-09-17 07:02:31 +0800 <MichiganWave> Why protect Soros?

1304533474129457152 2020-09-12 05:33:11 +0800 <MichiganWave> IOW White Gentile self determination in the West must be stymied to avenge the Tsar.

They were probably getting nuclear energy &amp; weapons expertise, materials from the White Govt, 1965-85. But they also trained Mandela &amp; other ANCers in guerilla warfare, terrorism in the same period.

1300921201905283072 2020-09-02 06:19:19 +0800 <MichiganWave> The way it used to work is that the media would purge any pundits who were supportive of the dissident politician. Then that politician &amp; the voters who supported him would feel more isolated, voiceless, demoralised.

1300835948578721792 2020-09-02 00:40:33 +0800 <MichiganWave> In the 90s, the most conspicuous agents of this pacification of the White GOP Base were Jack Kemp, Fred Barnes, Morton Kondracke, Bill Kristol, &amp; pundits connected to the Kochtopus (Reason mag, CATO).

1300834286413770752 2020-09-02 00:33:56 +0800 <MichiganWave> Most Neocons do this gaslighting &amp; pattern avoidance since they personally benefit from America being a bloated multicultural, multiracial Empire. They want Whites to remain docile, &amp; serve as the patient, shock-absorbing, law abiding glue holding the American Empire together.
1300833013450919936 2020-09-02 00:28:53 +0800 <MichiganWave> A tactic of CON Inc since the mid 80s has been to obfuscate abt race &amp; crime patterns to the GOP Base.
