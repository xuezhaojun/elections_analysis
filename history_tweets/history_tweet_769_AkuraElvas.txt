Ofc, since they like to pool all the other groups into common-interest collectives like BAME or BIPOC, defined by not being white, then minority is a fair term.

If we weren't in competition, white people could act in their group interests without those interests being pathologised as "racism", since they'd be common to everyone.

Plenty of credentialed people out there who are absolutely clueless, even more who are dishonest.
1332430410291290112 2020-11-28 05:05:39 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @TasteFloor @YesThatAnna Proof? That's whatever the individual with the credentials says it is. If enough credentialed people agree, it's the truth.  Like I said, a breathtaking lack of awareness.

1331563231102574593 2020-11-25 19:39:48 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @HumanRi56 And there you go again: "sorry if you were hurt". How fucking snide. Maybe I have no time but plenty of contempt for sewer sludge like you?

1331562044642955265 2020-11-25 19:35:05 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @HumanRi56 @winsofbrits Sure you're referring to me. That's why you're here. Elsewise, you'd have gone talk to some actual "haters".

They'll tell you that Africans colonised us under the Roman empire to establish a black presence here, then deny Africans colonised us when you point out it's colonialism. You're dealing with a Hatchling.
1331560873614307328 2020-11-25 19:30:26 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @HumanRi56 It's relevant because it shows who you are.

1328844833545478144 2020-11-18 07:37:51 +0800 <AkuraElvas> Isn't it interesting how, to lefties, British people can't be indigenous because of invaders that they weren't able to fight off. Whereas non-whites have their indigenous status *defined* by being unable to fight off invaders and thus being colonised by them.
1328843754002915335 2020-11-18 07:33:34 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @dicksblackbess Tbf, I wonder how much of this is the result of liberal gaslighting. Telling them they're exactly the same as us, except for their skin colour. Well, then the only reason they can't get ahead must be because of that. Obviously, we're just jealous, so it must also be special.

The entitlement and conceit are breathtaking.

"I don't like to be burned, so I stay away from fire"  "I don't like to be racismed, so I stay away from white people"

Those who are affected by it can solve their problem for themselves, without dragging in the unaffected.

The next time it appeared after that was during the big push to open US borders in the mid 1950s and up to the 1965 Act, where it was used to attack existing US immigration policy.

Your solution is bringing in migrants to keep the economy going long enough to pass it on to migrants, who will then face the same problems.

Surely you know what'll happen to the British people who if their population continues to decline? You say help, but they're going to be helping an ever decreasing number of Brits. And yes, replacement of the children we aren't having.

That's why we've been on this eternal slide to the left, progressives (or left-liberals) get in and push social liberalism. Then conservatives get in and push economic liberalism.  Both just become more left wing along the way.

1311288395889610752 2020-09-30 20:54:50 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @Stinkhorn11 @nemesis3781 @PatAlternative @davidkurten @LozzaFox Maybe you need to read it. Their definition neither includes nor excludes on race, but on ethnicity. Not all white people are English, but all English people are white.
1311287016995409922 2020-09-30 20:49:22 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @Stinkhorn11 @nemesis3781 @PatAlternative @davidkurten @LozzaFox You are disingenuous though. You could have avoided wasting everyone's time by just crying "racist", but instead tried the tired approach of "who even are the British". That's why I'm dropping on you, because people like you need to be dropped on at every opportunity.

Finally you made the point you could have done originally instead of trying a gotcha via immense verbosity.  What would I call it? Sensible, since I'm not a liberal and don't recognise liberal concepts as valid.

Unless you're confused about who belongs to which race.

1302666290033758209 2020-09-07 01:53:40 +0800 <AkuraElvas> Nah, it's not funny but it's also not "offensive".  Those "nation of sanctuary" plans, on the other hand...
1302620487336570880 2020-09-06 22:51:40 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @redscarf76 Good morning!
1302620236563255298 2020-09-06 22:50:40 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @ClimateWarrior7 Poirot, think about all those poor people he threw out of helicopters.
1302618860558995461 2020-09-06 22:45:12 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @IanMCohen @JournoRespekker So first it's "white", now it's "Caucasian", a group of which white is a subset, but which also includes non-whites like Arabs, Turks and Indians.
1302602195762843649 2020-09-06 21:38:59 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @GilinaPk Who could have seen that coming?

1302463084653576193 2020-09-06 12:26:12 +0800 <AkuraElvas> And they'd reply, "no we never went through race denial, we recognised it was real a long time ago and acted accordingly. That's why we're all of the same stock, as you can see."
1302462020978184192 2020-09-06 12:21:59 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @OrwellNGoode Be really unfortunate if people started applying this thinking to things like "racism", which we're also told "has no place".
1302461422589415425 2020-09-06 12:19:36 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @redscarf76 Fair. I don't even know who it's referring to, but it's relevant to any pol or pol adjacent I can think of. üòÇ

1302363137069457408 2020-09-06 05:49:03 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @DSCforCongress &gt;you can't relate to that if you're white  Exactly, there's no frame of reference. Which is why demands for empathy, which requires a frame of reference, are just stupid.  There's no good reason for white people to care in the slightest about this brown people's problem.
1302360543710326784 2020-09-06 05:38:44 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @nastymutant It's funny because these people are basically preaching ensoulment, yet we already know what their position on that is from the abortion "debate".

1302320427197509632 2020-09-06 02:59:20 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @bad_tits Communism is international socialism. All of the positive things that people generally associate with socialism are really just things that nations used to do through means other than govt. But that requires a healthy nation.

1302076590004809734 2020-09-05 10:50:25 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @somefellow6 The entire ideology of individual autonomy (aka liberalism) revolves around loosening all social bonds as being restrictive to the individual. It's inherently subversive to nationalism, religion and really, society as a whole.
1302075494020583424 2020-09-05 10:46:03 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @DianaWintah Yo why is your pfp different to how you look in the op here???

1302059848419467265 2020-09-05 09:43:53 +0800 <AkuraElvas> @ArtTheDogSays @thisislaurat Probably because most nationalists (the ethno is redundant) aren't liberals, and so don't spout liberal talking points.

Couldn't quite get him to grasp that labour is a commodity in itself, and that therefore in the context of "free movement" so are labour providers ie workers.
