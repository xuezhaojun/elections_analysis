I'm not sure either are the case, as the government have repeatedly locked down where rates were perceived to be high even when they fell by the time the lockdown was enacted

What makes you think the vaccine will change that and allow people to carry on normal life if the virus can still spread?

If the virus is that much more infectious than the flu, which is one argument, why are there so many households where one member has tested positive and failed to transmit it even to the partner they share a bed with?

1341720233212588037 2020-12-23 20:20:06 +0800 <johnfirewall> @LoftusSteve I was wondering, in light of the the public blaming lockdowns on rule breakers, and front page pictures of crowds and those without masks, why there'd not been such a story already.

1341716996619202561 2020-12-23 20:07:14 +0800 <johnfirewall> @mrmarkdolan Why not have people you don't know or care about sit indoors indefinitely out of a job while you're paid? It would be interesting to see the currently employment status and sector of those who support lockdown at all costs.

1339589576822669318 2020-12-17 23:13:38 +0800 <johnfirewall> @MattHancock This implies that rising infection rates are due to breaches of rules rather than increased testing. If this is the best that SPI-B could come up with to encourage compliance sack the lot and get some actual biologists. They'll be hung out to dry when you're in the dock anyway.

Don't see your friends and family at all, and the only difference a test result makes is that you can't leave the house if you're positive, and she's still not infecting anyone.

1333727072011898882 2020-12-01 18:58:08 +0800 <johnfirewall> @Peston Of course the logic of these rules is flawless without such an ingenious loophole.
1330618579797102595 2020-11-23 05:06:05 +0800 <johnfirewall> @EssexPR @DHSCgovuk Sounds like they just called 'Fake news' with 'Fake news'. And we know what happens to posts that don't meet the fact check...
1328345881192566784 2020-11-16 22:35:12 +0800 <johnfirewall> @afneil But they banned king size Mars Bars
1326108648297394176 2020-11-10 18:25:14 +0800 <johnfirewall> @Peston @JewishNewsUK Was a Jewish son-in-law of the President not a closer link to the White House?
1326107983785455616 2020-11-10 18:22:35 +0800 <johnfirewall> @peterajackson @kelvmackenzie And you either want to be vaccinated or you don't. If the government want to legislate to encourage it, again not a PR matter.
1326107605194985472 2020-11-10 18:21:05 +0800 <johnfirewall> @peterajackson @kelvmackenzie It's not a 6 person job even with the battle against the fake news.
1326105506759512064 2020-11-10 18:12:45 +0800 <johnfirewall> @kelvmackenzie Not sure about the need for her to employ PR people at tax payer's expense though. If that is to ensure uptake, the science should speak for itself. But then the government have allowed Whitty and Vallance to undermine the public's respect for scientists.
1325817543311896576 2020-11-09 23:08:29 +0800 <johnfirewall> @GuidoFawkes He wanted lockdown to highlight Boris' inaction. He can't undermine his poor decision to enact it. Not sure what his game is here. By all means play it on the 2nd of December when lockdown is extended but this is just arbitrarily contrarian.
1325723008414195712 2020-11-09 16:52:50 +0800 <johnfirewall> @ArchRose90 I had this explained to me as a way to make other people comfortable expressing their pronouns. But surely it's what the individual identifies as, not how they're referred to, and if that's important then they'll make it known. I can't see how telling people I'm a male helps.
1325508963216072704 2020-11-09 02:42:18 +0800 <johnfirewall> @Gabriel_Pogrund So the vaccine needs good PR to ensure uptake? Isn't this more a matter for scientists? Having said that the government still needs to find suitable ones to advise on lockdowns because Whitty and Vallance have lost all credibility.
1325508108408524801 2020-11-09 02:38:54 +0800 <johnfirewall> @properhopper @Gabriel_Pogrund Well that qualifies her then!
1323576392911564801 2020-11-03 18:42:57 +0800 <johnfirewall> @simondolan @JohnGlenUK Ah, the old 'safer at home', which isn't a guarantee. Remember, 3 people a year die while falling putting trousers on.
1323575840991514625 2020-11-03 18:40:45 +0800 <johnfirewall> @10DowningStreet What's the point if they're staying at home regardless of symptoms? There's already non random testing in schools where the whole family need to be negative for a child to return to class.
1323385578298159105 2020-11-03 06:04:43 +0800 <johnfirewall> @Peston And the false positives/ alerts. 2 weeks under house arrest for a software glitch or inaccurate test result

1322970022755651584 2020-11-02 02:33:27 +0800 <johnfirewall> @ArchRose90 That probably relates to schools staying open
1322568492013551618 2020-10-31 23:57:55 +0800 <johnfirewall> @Peston It's OK. The 'leak' was just to gauge the massive public opposition to a 2nd Lockdown (except where Starmer was right and Boris was wrong). It will be business as usual.
1322545652010725377 2020-10-31 22:27:09 +0800 <johnfirewall> @liligrowls @laudiagee @sunny_jay_jay @BorisJohnson Infection rates are growing fastest among 11-16 year olds. Where did they get it, the pub?

1319730902210125826 2020-10-24 04:02:21 +0800 <johnfirewall> @Sparkes @damienegan To think, we've had to make do with pavements for a century. It's been a real struggle.
1319729517523570689 2020-10-24 03:56:51 +0800 <johnfirewall> @damienegan Apparently the only reason you're not implementing more LTNs is because you can't get hold of enough cameras. I wonder if @JeremyClarkson  or other wealthy motoring enthusiastic could crowdfund keeping these out of your grubby mitts.
1315230408322117632 2020-10-11 17:58:59 +0800 <johnfirewall> @Tippademus I can't see what race they are but I saw Asian lads playing in the same place before the curfew
1315229946072137737 2020-10-11 17:57:09 +0800 <johnfirewall> @LBC I saw one of these cricket matches in Peckham a couple of months ago so it's more to do with the council having closed the road than something that has now popped up due to the curfew
