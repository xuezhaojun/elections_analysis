Do these laws creating higher penalties for animal abuse, forbid any one from eating meat?  Do they even seek to outlaw some religious practice related to beef?

1343633373579726849 2020-12-29 03:02:14 +0800 <Mikanojo> @drpiyushkr @_Pehicc @ChangeItalia That is sadly true.  The current govt. of India is made up of squabbling religious zealots of questionable ability to govern.  Just like that cow vigilante situation, there are SOME in the govt. that supported them, even though the laws do not.

And, very often, it only takes a few moments at most to dismantle most conspiracy theories with just a few facts.  Education is crucial for "critical thinking", but education just seems to get in the way of dogmatic and presumptive thinking.  Liars prey on the ignorant.

Just to compare, because some in the congregation are unable to attend due to age or health concerns, our church broadcasts on AM radio.
1342574996367896576 2020-12-26 04:56:37 +0800 <Mikanojo> @AymanM i think it is simply a safer way of describing what happened, without imposing any political bias regarding the bomber, their targets, and their motivation, while those aspects remain unknown.

1342497215575552000 2020-12-25 23:47:33 +0800 <Mikanojo> @stuepperson That is the point, repeated again and again in scripture, that far too many people choose to overlook, and that far too much man-made church dogma denies ‚Äî Christ fulfilled the law to END it for all who accept Him as Lord.  There is no more 603 laws of Moses for we who are saved!

Today the weather station is predicting rain and snow mixed up together... and a high temperature of 6¬≠¬∫C so.. even if snow falls it will melt.  But i like rain too!

Yes, absolutely ALL religions have been abused, by those who pervert it for power, for wealth, and for politics.  That is what dogma is; the man-made doctrines that separate each religion from the next, and that may or may not be supported by scripture.

What we are "saved" from in the Bible are the 603 abstract, carnal, cursed laws that Moses added to the 10 commandments from GOD.  Christ fulfilled and ended that covenant for all who accept Him as Lord.  He died for us, rather than let us be cursed.

1340857085035073537 2020-12-21 11:10:15 +0800 <Mikanojo> @WaldenHoddie @johnpavlovitz You are welcome.  It comes to this:  Conservative man-made carnal dogma has twisted bits of scripture out of context to falsely declare homosexuality as sin.  The King James Bible never says this.  There WAS a Moses-made law against it, that Christ ended, and Paul was anti-sex.  https://t.co/Bx6FKj0JbM
1340833876231376896 2020-12-21 09:38:02 +0800 <Mikanojo> @WaldenHoddie @johnpavlovitz Just for the sake of clarity, Moses' first wife was Zipporah, and you can read about her in Exodus 18:1-27.  As for the Ethiopian woman, she is not named; again the upset was over the fact that she was Ethiopian.  From a separate tribe than Moses, and Black.
1340831695826636802 2020-12-21 09:29:22 +0800 <Mikanojo> @WaldenHoddie @johnpavlovitz Read the story in Numbers 12:1-16, where Miriam and Aaron oppose Moses.  They mention their anger about Moses taking a second wife, not because she was second but because she was Ethiopian; she was Black.  GOD did not care at all about Moses having two wives.
1340830760471732225 2020-12-21 09:25:39 +0800 <Mikanojo> @WaldenHoddie @johnpavlovitz But it is NOT a sin, and your dogma is what you are looking at.  You repeating the dogma does not make it correct.
1340830451867426816 2020-12-21 09:24:25 +0800 <Mikanojo> @WaldenHoddie @johnpavlovitz Yes that is often referred to as "trinity".  GOD the father appeared as a man on occasion, as a fire, as a pillar of cloud... Jesus was GOD in the flesh, He had to be human in order to fulfill the law that Moses had written for humanity.  The Holy Ghost is GOD the spirit.
1340829916275691520 2020-12-21 09:22:18 +0800 <Mikanojo> @WaldenHoddie @johnpavlovitz Marriage is NOT defined as only being between man and woman, nor one man, one woman, as the common #RightWing dogma claims. Moses had two wives, Solomon had hundreds, as well as also concubines.  https://t.co/HIqnVRHC9S
1340829376066117634 2020-12-21 09:20:09 +0800 <Mikanojo> @WaldenHoddie @johnpavlovitz GOD never discusses homosexuality.  Moses made a law against it, and Paul thought that it was vile, unseemly, and in one verse he called it inconvenient(!)  But it is never called sin, only GOD defines sin.  And Paul also hated sex, twice preaching celibacy for all Christians.
1340828856148582405 2020-12-21 09:18:05 +0800 <Mikanojo> @WaldenHoddie @johnpavlovitz Accepting Christ means that none of the law of Moses has any power of you.  Moses had condemned every one with the 603 laws he added to the 10 commandments.  the point of Christ coming was to fulfill and end that covenant.  that condemnation is what Christ SAVES us from.  https://t.co/7buVO9TZNb
1340828263145304064 2020-12-21 09:15:43 +0800 <Mikanojo> @WaldenHoddie @johnpavlovitz Regarding marriage, it is a man-made concept that predates the writing of the Bible.  What GOD / Christ said about it is that He likes it, that He does NOT want you to break the oaths you take, and that there is no marriage at all in Heaven.
1340827800467427329 2020-12-21 09:13:53 +0800 <Mikanojo> @WaldenHoddie @johnpavlovitz Jesus is not being asked if men can marry men or women marry women.  He is being asked about the practice of divorce that Moses created, one of his carnal laws.  The pharisees were attempting to get Jesus to denounce the law while He was still in the act of fulfilling it.

1340825855451230208 2020-12-21 09:06:09 +0800 <Mikanojo> @WaldenHoddie @johnpavlovitz In Matthew 19:5 when the pharisees question Jesus about the practice of DIVORCE, Jesus points them back to their own law, and quotes ADAM from Genesis 2:24.  And note that the SAME WORD translated as woman in verse 23 is translated as wife in verse 24?  https://t.co/OOeRhU2f0b

George Frederick Watts painted Mammon in 1885 ‚Äî having never known Donald Trump ‚Äî who would not be born until 1946.  A curious coincidence i think ü§î

The most important sacrifice?  Absolutely; but how many people bother to read the story and learn WHY?  Too many people who want to talk about the Bible, never read it.
1340660033407762432 2020-12-20 22:07:14 +0800 <Mikanojo> @TweetLaVeta @johnpavlovitz Did you know that the Bible is a compilation of more than 30 authors, spanning 1500 years, discussing multiple religions, and that Christianity, which starts in the book of Matthew, is about ENDING all of that in favor of salvation through faith and brotherly love?
1340659502870196225 2020-12-20 22:05:08 +0800 <Mikanojo> @WaldenHoddie @johnpavlovitz No.  Actually it is not.  There are only 10 sins, defined by GOD in 10 commandments.  None of the 603 carnal, cursed laws that Moses added are sins.  And most importantly, Jesus fulfilled and ENDED that entire covenant for those who accept Him as Lord.

He should have gone to the media, they could have investigated his claims, made him an anonymous source, protected him that way...  instead he chose to break a very serious law.
1338440289313202176 2020-12-14 19:06:46 +0800 <Mikanojo> @Rahmadalee @ACLU Again IF Mr. Snowden had followed the procedures for being a whistle blower, and had NOT violated the espionage act, TWICE, and had NOT fled to Russia, then he would not be guilty.  But he did break the law, and he did flee.
1338439804078284801 2020-12-14 19:04:50 +0800 <Mikanojo> @Rahmadalee @ACLU Mr. Snowden is NOT eligible for political asylum.  He violated the Espionage act.  Ecuador shielded Assange from the trial for the two RAPES he was wanted for in Sweden.  But they GAVE him to USA when they charged him with conspiracy to commit espionage.
1338438651483574272 2020-12-14 19:00:16 +0800 <Mikanojo> @Rahmadalee @ACLU His illegal communication was NOT whistle blowing, it was sharing confidential data.  This was another mistake he made.  He is guilty as charged.  https://t.co/dU16BEPm4J

1338437284098555905 2020-12-14 18:54:50 +0800 <Mikanojo> @Rahmadalee @ACLU If he would have gone to Ecuador, they have an extradition treaty with USA; they would have arrested him and sent him back to USA.  Instead Mr. Snowden chose Russia, with no extradition.  He is not an innocent person.  And he has not acted like an innocent person.
1338436445862645767 2020-12-14 18:51:30 +0800 <Mikanojo> @lt4agreements i have always tried carefully to attack what he DOES, the lies he tells, his ideology, his rhetoric..  The man is an antichrist.  But i have never personally referred to him by any other name than #Trump Mr. #DonaldTrump or by the title he earned for him self, #FascistTrump .
1338435224175140866 2020-12-14 18:46:39 +0800 <Mikanojo> @Rahmadalee @ACLU And you have explained why Mr. Snowden is considered to be a criminal and why he defected to Russia, because he was afraid he would face serious charges for his criminal actions.  Whistle blowers ARE protected by law in USA IF they follow the correct process.  He did not.
1338433615537979393 2020-12-14 18:40:15 +0800 <Mikanojo> @AnnieGabstonH i was brought to USA by William, he is mai gifu.  You would maybe say step-father.  But i still have trouble actually speaking his name.  i can write it:  William.  But i say it as Weeam.  Wee yee am.  So i still just call him gifu.

1338430286288224257 2020-12-14 18:27:01 +0800 <Mikanojo> @ACLU If Mr. Snowden would have acted as a whistle blower, then gone into a witness protection program, i would agree with you.  Instead he took classified information and fled to Russia.  There is a very big difference between a whistle blower and a defector.

You just want your dogma.
1338347475732590592 2020-12-14 12:57:58 +0800 <Mikanojo> @CheapPhilosoph1 @johnpavlovitz Paul was also a sexist.  In fact before Christ appeared to him and started turning his life around, Paul was a murderer.  If you only had some idea what you were ranting about.  It really would help you.  That again, is your own evil, blinding you.
1338347092650065921 2020-12-14 12:56:26 +0800 <Mikanojo> @CheapPhilosoph1 @johnpavlovitz As for Paul, Paul actually hated all sex, and TWICE suggested abstinence for all Christians.  If people had followed all of Paul's suggesting, Christianity would have died out in one generation, with no heirs.
1338346715036807173 2020-12-14 12:54:56 +0800 <Mikanojo> @CheapPhilosoph1 @johnpavlovitz Moses had homosexuals put to death.  GOD took the form of Christ, since the law was made for humanity, fulfilled that law and ENDED it for all who accept Him as Lord.  So when you claim "god said nothing against it, never" this is a lie you are telling your self.
1338346255664103427 2020-12-14 12:53:07 +0800 <Mikanojo> @CheapPhilosoph1 @johnpavlovitz i am spinning no thing.  i am telling you Bible scripture.  i did not write the book.  It is you who are wanting to blame GOD for the acts of flawed humanity, AND seeming to want GOD to treat you like a helpless baby, do all for you, in order to win your love?!
1338345764687290368 2020-12-14 12:51:10 +0800 <Mikanojo> @CheapPhilosoph1 @johnpavlovitz There was a time in the past when GOD did every thing for humanity.  There was not scarcity, no hunger, no sin, happy naked animals rutting in the wilderness.  Then people started choosing to ignore GOD's wishes.  Bad things started happening.  They have not stopped yet.
1338345223735275522 2020-12-14 12:49:01 +0800 <Mikanojo> @CheapPhilosoph1 @johnpavlovitz According to the Bible, GOD CREATED evil, by establishing what was good and permitting others free will to choose other wise.  Like any other father, the time came when humanity had to grow up.  GOD gave us advice, and left us to live and grow on our own.  Is that your evil?  https://t.co/m8z9QkRCzz
1338344168066670594 2020-12-14 12:44:49 +0800 <Mikanojo> @CheapPhilosoph1 @johnpavlovitz What you are attempting to do is blame GOD for the horrid evil acts of humans who used GOD as their excuse to commit atrocity.  They have free will too.  GOD does not care about your body; GOD cares about your soul.  All of us will die here, mostly due to the fault of another.

1338341427244199936 2020-12-14 12:33:56 +0800 <Mikanojo> @CheapPhilosoph1 @johnpavlovitz There are TEN sins in the Bible, (Hebrew: chatta-ah, an offense to GOD).  Homosexuality is not among them.  The carnal laws of Moses (Hebrew to-ebah, some thing disgusting to the writer or speaker) do not define sin.  Neither do Evangelicals; do not let them fool you.
1338340847566217217 2020-12-14 12:31:37 +0800 <Mikanojo> @CheapPhilosoph1 @johnpavlovitz GOD cared enough about those carnal laws to DIE in order to end them for you.  Unless you want to keep them alive for your political agenda?  You have free will; GOD will not stop you.  Evil is a choice you can make here.  Is that what you wish to continue doing?

1338271471185973248 2020-12-14 07:55:57 +0800 <Mikanojo> @CheapPhilosoph1 @johnpavlovitz No.  The Bible NEVER calls homosexuality a sin.  Ever.  Moses made a law against it.  Christ fulfilled and ended that law, along with that entire covenant.  Paul called it vile, unseemly, in one verse inconvenient, but Paul never called it sin either.  Only GOD defines sin.

Or even come close.  https://t.co/m2DL0OERXX

To restore humanity back to the commandments, and to offer a new covenant of salvation through faith.  The law of Moses does NOT define sins.

1337828439701667840 2020-12-13 02:35:30 +0800 <Mikanojo> @duty2warn Mr. Donald J. Trump is guilty of treason. Literal treason.  And the #CorruptAndComplicitGOP who continue to enable this #Fascist are criminally culpable.   If there IS a Civil War, it is going to end like the last one.  There will be no more #Republican party.
1337827116969168896 2020-12-13 02:30:14 +0800 <Mikanojo> @realDonaldTrump It had some thing to do with the fact that first you need to have brought actual evidence before a lower court... which you never did.  Mr. Giuliani brought paid actors, who gave the testimony they were paid to give, but also had no evidence.  So, you never had a case.  Simple.
1337824573052526592 2020-12-13 02:20:08 +0800 <Mikanojo> @7_highness @johnpavlovitz Your false dogma that demonizes the LeftWing for pointing out the #racism of the #RightWing is an interesting fallacy argument.  And no surprise, it is not Biblical; just politically dogmatic.  Do you know what IS Biblical?  The 10 commandments the #Republicans continue breaking.
1337822365347024897 2020-12-13 02:11:22 +0800 <Mikanojo> @7_highness @johnpavlovitz Yes... about that.  Jesus was a radical Socialist rabbi who came to fulfill and end the 603 carnal, cursed laws of Moses the #RightWing picks through to fabricate their dogma from.  There is nothing Christian about the Republicans.  https://t.co/whUnCMSaJN

They lie about scripture, just as they lie about the medical reality of pregnancy.    The Bible does not support your desire to control other women's bodies.

However even he admits the difference between killing a fetus versus; requiring a fine be paid as chosen by judges, and punished according to the woman's husband.  So it is NOT murder.

Neither was it an issue for Christ.  GOD the father had already provided a method of causing abortion in the Bible.  The dogma to control women's sexuality came from Paul, not from GOD.

Christ never discussed it at all; He DID how ever say that He and the Father (GOD) were one and the same. GOD the Father endorsed abortion in the Book of Numbers 5:11-31.

You are invited to OPEN the Bible and READ the cited scriptures your self.  If you choose other dogma, that is your choice, ah but there is that word choice again.

You are referring to Catholics and denominational dogma  ‚Äî the man-made doctrines that separate each denomination from the next, even through dogma often disagrees with scripture.  Are you a dogmatist or do you follow the scripture?
1336572656850587650 2020-12-09 15:25:28 +0800 <Mikanojo> @smarsby @iamslaven @unpregnantmovie The biggest problem with the pro-forced birth dogma; it simply lacks validity.  It simply is not true.  Neither medical science nor even Bible scripture supports your claims.  The real issue here has nothing to do with children; and every thing to do with controlling women.  https://t.co/NxrqaOpnNT

1335329897548374016 2020-12-06 05:07:11 +0800 <Mikanojo> @TessEractica @MichaelArt123 @bevdevwarrior False.  You seem to be completely unaware of the concern i noted and instead are discussing cancer studies.  You are never going to sell this pain killer to me as a recreational drug; i was involved with a pot smoker for six years.  They became abusive and forgetful when 'high'.
1335329330843406336 2020-12-06 05:04:56 +0800 <Mikanojo> @TessEractica @MichaelArt123 @bevdevwarrior Lung cancer is NOT an effect on the brain, it is an affect on the lungs.  You are attempting to dump extraneous, unproven sales pitches, while ignoring the actual concern:  How people react and think differently while under the influence of marijuana.
1335327978297860100 2020-12-06 04:59:33 +0800 <Mikanojo> @TessEractica @MichaelArt123 @bevdevwarrior Research means little compared to having been in a six year relationship with a pot smoker.  She became forgetful, she became casually abusive, and when confronted about her behavior while 'sober' she would gaslight about it in order to continue smoking it.

What i am discussing is how people under the effects of marijuana think and act differently.  i hope you understand the deep difference here?

1335299615650840576 2020-12-06 03:06:51 +0800 <Mikanojo> @my2centsay yes that is exactly what i mean.  States fine "faithless electors" $1000 if they ignore the popular vote of their state.  So i guess the bidding for their votes starts there.
1335299316726939648 2020-12-06 03:05:40 +0800 <Mikanojo> @wphamilton @MichaelArt123 If the vote were Democratic then every vote would count as one, and it would not matter which part of USA you were standing on when you cast your vote.  The votes of "states" only ever mattered because the Southern slave-owning states did not want slavery voted out by the North.
1335298933770211328 2020-12-06 03:04:09 +0800 <Mikanojo> @wphamilton @MichaelArt123 The Three-fifths compromise CREATED the situation where some states have more electoral power than others in the presidential election.  You will never see the election come down to how Idaho votes, for example.  But Ohio, Florida, Illinois, Iowa... they become battlegrounds.
1335298142053396480 2020-12-06 03:01:00 +0800 <Mikanojo> @wphamilton @MichaelArt123 There have never been enough faithless electors to change the vote.  Yet.  Have there been faithless electors?  Yes.  Is it possible to overturn the presidential election this way?  Yes. i read about states fining them $1000 ‚Äî so the bidding starts there to buy their vote.
1335296997096628226 2020-12-06 02:56:27 +0800 <Mikanojo> @wphamilton @MichaelArt123 The Electoral College is a product of the Three-fifths Compromise that protected slave-owning states, maybe THAT is the compromise they are referring to?   https://t.co/K7ClK1XP5D
1335296536264097792 2020-12-06 02:54:37 +0800 <Mikanojo> @wphamilton @MichaelArt123 The Electoral College decides who is president.  That is the first accepted answer, and that is what i would have given.  the second answer they offer is a lie.  That you are trying to twist to sound acceptable.  But it remains a lie.
1335296147766747136 2020-12-06 02:53:04 +0800 <Mikanojo> @wphamilton @MichaelArt123 The popular vote of the American people can be overridden by the vote of the Electoral College.  That means they have the power to compromise the popular vote.  They do not make compromises, they elect the president.
1335295778667950080 2020-12-06 02:51:36 +0800 <Mikanojo> @wphamilton @MichaelArt123 What you are attempting is nonsense.  And in that you succeeded sir.  Electors can, and have disregarded the popular vote in their states multiple times, becoming "faithless" and giving the election to others.  In fact Trump hopes he can convince enough of them to do this again.
1335294488852369409 2020-12-06 02:46:29 +0800 <Mikanojo> @wphamilton @MichaelArt123 Yes Republicans have meddled / changed the test, in an effort to make it more difficult.  No, it was not made more difficult for you.  Yes, it was made a bit more difficult for its intended victims, immigrants.  And that second Electoral College answer is actually wrong.

How many natural-born Americans do you think would have trouble with some of these test questions?
1335290759856103424 2020-12-06 02:31:40 +0800 <Mikanojo> @onefussyone @bevdevwarrior That is also a valid case for lesbianism ( ‡πë‚Äµ·¥ó‚Äµ‡πë)b

1335288120460230656 2020-12-06 02:21:11 +0800 <Mikanojo> @wphamilton @MichaelArt123 i am giving a personal account as a non-citizen.  I was brought to USA in 2007, i attended 4 years of uni here, study US history as a hobby, and still have found two questions so far that i would have been marked wrong on, simply because of the wording.
1335286077863563264 2020-12-06 02:13:04 +0800 <Mikanojo> @wphamilton @MichaelArt123 It would be more accurate to say that the Electoral College COMPROMISES the popular election, overriding the vote of the American people and actually deciding who will be president.

Answer 2 is FALSE but that IS what is listed as an acceptable answer.

And the value of one person's vote should be the same, regardless of what patch of USA you are standing on when you vote.  State versus state is no more than a false argument.

If Adam were the first and ONLY man, and Eve was the first and ONLY woman, How would Adam have any notion at all about mothers?

Adam and Eve were NOT the first people.  GOD creates people in Genesis 1:26-28 and tells them to multiply.  Adam and Eve first appear in Genesis 2:7.

Weight actually IS a secondary sexual characteristic:  Males tend to weigh more.

One that you cannot see when you set out to make judgements about other people.

1327434408433840133 2020-11-14 10:13:20 +0800 <Mikanojo> @GeorgeTakei @MCJResists i REALLY hope that #Parler turns out to be a #honeytrap and all of the #Fascists there calling for violence and sedition end up arrested.  Ah but... it is just as likely to be another chan site, another #FarRight dumping ground for hate, conspiracies and child porn.
1327433439708999680 2020-11-14 10:09:29 +0800 <Mikanojo> Another #PatRobertson prophecy that turned out to be false.  False prophets... false prophets... the Bible mentioned you many times.  And told us not to listen to you.
1327429011174084608 2020-11-14 09:51:53 +0800 <Mikanojo> @DaRhymenoceros @johnpavlovitz And now your account goes to the pit with the rest of the liars.  Wailing and gnashing your teeth as much as you want,  with the rest of the #Rightwing and your fact-free ideology of fear, hate and lies.  Is that really where you want to be?  Answer that your self; i do not care.
1327428424286175233 2020-11-14 09:49:33 +0800 <Mikanojo> @DaRhymenoceros @johnpavlovitz It was no thing.  In fact it was incredibly easy.  #RightWing #FakeNews relies on people being both too ignorant to recognize the truth and too lazy to discover it.  But we literally have the internet at our fingertips.  Your efforts are without honor, deserving no respect.
1327420149826080768 2020-11-14 09:16:40 +0800 <Mikanojo> @DaRhymenoceros @johnpavlovitz Your effort to distract away from the acts that #FascistTrump has been committing ‚Äî regurgitating old #FakeNews accusations against Obama ‚Äî  does NOT excuse #Trump in any way.  But i did not mind using your lies for good, reminding people of the truth.
1327418961802055685 2020-11-14 09:11:57 +0800 <Mikanojo> @DaRhymenoceros @johnpavlovitz The Obama administration never broke the law while watching Trump colluding with Russia.  That collusion DID lead to Russian interference in the 2016 election, which every alphabet agency admitted to publicly.   https://t.co/fcD30Zkj3B
1327417979886137344 2020-11-14 09:08:03 +0800 <Mikanojo> @DaRhymenoceros @johnpavlovitz The FBI indeed DID investigate the #Trump connections with #Russia starting before and continuing during his campaign for the 2016 election.  The rule of law was not broken; the surveillance was legal.  Again, Trump brought all of that on him self.  His own acts.
1327416721171378179 2020-11-14 09:03:03 +0800 <Mikanojo> @DaRhymenoceros @johnpavlovitz The hill publishes multiple conspiracy claims, #FarRight opinions, and #FakeNews in an effort to appear unbiased.  The actual result is that they offer a veneer of legitimacy to false claims, a mistake many media outlets make.  Republicans them selves disproved your lie already.
1327415529561153538 2020-11-14 08:58:19 +0800 <Mikanojo> @DoYouEvenLif It is terribly frustrating.  Mean while #Republicans continue to ignore the laws and rules, including the ones they wrote(!) pampering to this atrocity-committing cult of #WhiteSupremacist personality still squatting in the White House, causing as much harm as he can.
1327411312545075200 2020-11-14 08:41:33 +0800 <Mikanojo> @Eddiiiiiiie_ Can you imagine federal agents blasting Achy-breaky Heart at the White House for days using giant speakers, then running a tank through their hastily erected walls?  That worked so horribly with that OTHER #FalseChristian cult, arguably this one is even WORSE.
1327408444568072194 2020-11-14 08:30:09 +0800 <Mikanojo> @johnpavlovitz "Law and Order" was a #Trump dog whistle to #WhiteSupremacists ‚Äî quoting Mr, Nixon; that was his excuse for #PoliceBrutality committed against #CivilRights protests in the 1960s.  And #Trump kept THAT promise, by inciting MORE police brutality and re-igniting those race-riots.  https://t.co/aLI2t46PPX
1327407396356931584 2020-11-14 08:25:59 +0800 <Mikanojo> This is calling for violence.  No surprise considering the #WhiteSupremacist source, but no valid media service should be broadcasting it.
1327402668466208768 2020-11-14 08:07:12 +0800 <Mikanojo> @DaRhymenoceros @johnpavlovitz Undoubtedly you can offer numerous #RightWing #FakeNews fabrications, the difference is the credibility and of course, the truth or rather the lack of it.  #Trump with his own acts brought FBI scrutiny on him self.  And #Russian interference in the election was later proven.

1326730170154184708 2020-11-12 11:34:56 +0800 <Mikanojo> @yulebecool @MikeTolkien @AreMond2 But #FascistTrump is not alone.  In addition to his #FalseChristian #Evangelical handlers (Pence, Barr, Pompeo) he has his family who want him to escape.  They have their own family jet, Putin has planes waiting at the Venezuela airport.  Trump knows secrets that Putin wants.

But how many other fact-free cases have gone before the Supreme Court already?  the fetal-pain bills are a perfect example; it was nothing more than #rightwing lies but it still managed to win multiple court decisions and become law.
1324104093250449408 2020-11-05 05:39:51 +0800 <Mikanojo> @Judson4Congress i believe that if Trump cannot steal the election in court he will call for #CivilWar2 and then flee in the chaos.

1324089437291118592 2020-11-05 04:41:36 +0800 <Mikanojo> @thomaskaine5 Because Mr. #MitchMcConnell blocked every effort to pass protective measures for the 2020 election, it is possible that Russians and Chinese people might have also been voting by machine.  The mail-in ballots are more secure, just one of several reasons why #Trump fears them.
1324087828859383808 2020-11-05 04:35:13 +0800 <Mikanojo> @ElElewis18 @acnewsitics i wonder why i never get notified at all?  The way i find out is when what i tweet gets buried.   i get suspicious and use the Shadowban test to see what has been done to me.  i have tweeted a few times in the past to jack and twitter support but never had a reply.
1324086761316732929 2020-11-05 04:30:58 +0800 <Mikanojo> Do not bother with the US map (red states versus blue); crop fields and cows do not vote.  And even though #MitchMcConnell made certain NO election protection bills passed, meaning Russians and Chinese MIGHT be voting via election machines, the mail-in ballots are more secure.

Once again it favors the minority #RightWing over the vote of the majority of the American people.  #EndTheElectoralCollege and make every vote count as ONE, regardless of what part of USA you live in.
1322597386745651200 2020-11-01 01:52:44 +0800 <Mikanojo> @antoniodjtone This is NOT about Bible predictions, this is about #FakeChristian politicians USING the Bible as their model for their own plot.  If their dogma is true then they are raptured to heaven.  If their dogma fails, they believe they will have achieved a #Christofascist USA.
1322596905503793152 2020-11-01 01:50:49 +0800 <Mikanojo> @antoniodjtone When you look at Revelation 13, you can see the #Republican plan.  They modeled it from this chapter.  Their so-called #ReligiousFreedom bills will literally legalize faith-based discrimination in public businesses, i.e. no one can buy or sell unless they bear the mark.
1322596500833144833 2020-11-01 01:49:13 +0800 <Mikanojo> @antoniodjtone You seem to be thinking only of an interpretation of the Bible, most likely how the prophecies detailed the fall of the Roman empire.  You are NOT observing how the political #RightWing is attempting to create their own END Times scenario, using their useful idiot #Trump .

They are misled by their own false dogma.  They are evil.

1321752859919097863 2020-10-29 17:56:53 +0800 <Mikanojo> @TurnipsBride Empathy is a very necessary trait for all healthy creatures, including humanity.  https://t.co/AWgovt0bFh
1321751777625079808 2020-10-29 17:52:35 +0800 <Mikanojo> @TurnipsBride GOOD; that means you are a healthy human being. The people who either intentionally repress, or OPPRESS others for their human empathy, are showing us their literal disorder of #Sadism .  Sadism can be infectious.  Sadism can also be taught.  It is an evil to be AVOIDED.

They also signify courage, to keep fighting, keep hoping, do not give up.
1321745981952589824 2020-10-29 17:29:33 +0800 <Mikanojo> @TurnipsBride The important question is, when you sense anguish in others, their suffering, what is your usual response?  Are you triggered toward wanting to end that anguish, or are you triggered into fleeing from it?  Do you feel compassion, or revulsion more often?
1321744165508558848 2020-10-29 17:22:20 +0800 <Mikanojo> @TurnipsBride When we become aware of emotions in others, it often triggers reactive emotions in us; fear, joy, lust, and anger are all infectious conditions.  When we perceive others suffering, our fight-or-flight defenses are triggered ‚Äî most of us want that suffering to stop ‚Äî it upsets us.
1321739224693919745 2020-10-29 17:02:42 +0800 <Mikanojo> @TurnipsBride Empathy is a form of perception that allows living creatures to sense the conditions of others around them.  This perception is crucial to relationships, and also directly related to group survival; the herd responds collectively when individuals are threatened or suffering.

1321673298850193409 2020-10-29 12:40:44 +0800 <Mikanojo> @RexChapman The department as a whole is what is reformed.

Two givers, each providing for the other in equal love, honor, and respect,  can form a healthy partnership. Any thing less than that, is less than it should be.

The stable income of working as a cast member of a TV show would have been a great step up from a Leonard Bruce -style Vegas comic, and his sexist, racist attitudes would have faded in time.

1318424270825947137 2020-10-20 13:30:15 +0800 <Mikanojo> @_ebenknight @NinevehNow @johnpavlovitz Jesus stated that His reason for coming was to fulfill the law, because none of the law would pass away until it had all been fulfilled.  He became a rabbi and fulfilled the law for 33 years.  Even as He pointed out its flaws, causing unrest among the pharisees.

1318297563217358848 2020-10-20 05:06:46 +0800 <Mikanojo> @_ebenknight @NinevehNow @johnpavlovitz As for the #RightWing #Evangelical dogma that cites bits from Paul out of context, OPEN your KJV and see if you can find even ONE example of Paul ever establishing what is and what is not sin.  It is a trick question.  Only GOD defined sin, and He did so with 10 commandments.
1318297045287882752 2020-10-20 05:04:43 +0800 <Mikanojo> @_ebenknight @NinevehNow @johnpavlovitz Over half of the Bible is literally what Christ DIED to SAVE us from.  And we are told again and again that the law of Moses is NOT of faith, that it is a carnal curse that Christ redeems us from, that if we return to the law, we LOSE our salvation from Christ.  https://t.co/kCaZ6UmcLp
1318296674704322560 2020-10-20 05:03:14 +0800 <Mikanojo> @_ebenknight @NinevehNow @johnpavlovitz Be careful when you offer a misleading term like "Biblically"; over half of the Bible is Judaism, and mentions of other faiths such as Mammon worship.  Christianity begins in prophecies in Jeremiah, but does not actually arrive until the book of Matthew.
1318296299502882817 2020-10-20 05:01:45 +0800 <Mikanojo> @_ebenknight @NinevehNow @johnpavlovitz So many #Conservative #Evangelical churches choose to cherry-pick from the carnal, cursed law of Moses and ADD to the words of Paul, in order to excuse their LIE.  They falsely claim that homosexuality was a sin.  It NEVER WAS.  And reading the KJV will prove that to you.  https://t.co/FOIS9kh7cq
1318295766507560960 2020-10-20 04:59:38 +0800 <Mikanojo> @_ebenknight @NinevehNow @johnpavlovitz i am saying, exactly what the Bible is saying, that under the Jewish law of Moses, homosexuality was punishable by death, but Christ fulfilled and ENDED the ENTIRE Mosaic covenant, including the carnal law against homosexuality.  If you follow Moses, that law still stands.

The only teaching GOD gives about marriage is that There is no marriage in Heaven, He disagrees with the practice of divorce, and that it is a sin to adulterate your oaths, including your marriage vows.
1318124546017222656 2020-10-19 17:39:15 +0800 <Mikanojo> @_ebenknight @NinevehNow @johnpavlovitz Yes, i am a Christian, and yes, i have already guessed the false dogma you are hoping to mislead with.  GOD never married Adam and Eve, nor did GOD tell HIS first created people in Genesis 1:26-28 to get married first THEN be fruitful and multiply.  Marriage is a human creation.

No.  No, an egg is an egg, it goes through multiple stages, of development before it can become a human being.  Removing a fetus before it becomes a human being is not murder.

All you are telling me is that you have not bothered to open the Bible and even read the brief section cited in the picture, Matthew 25, verses 31-46, then comparing that with the policies and rhetoric of both parties.

The #Democrats are open to people of all faiths and no faith, while practically applying Christ's teaching.  The #Republican party loudly declares Christ, but violates Christ's teaching.

1316607483301916672 2020-10-15 13:11:00 +0800 <Mikanojo> @kccummins2 @johnpavlovitz The #RightWing attacks on women are based in their desire to control our sex; and how DARE any woman tell any man "No i will NOT bear your child."  They attack #immigrant culture because it is rich with good traditions, as opposed to what is truly 'white' culture:  the #klan .  https://t.co/mJ0694XS4B

The patches, Confederate flags, swastikas are outward symbols in support of the Fascist ideology they have embraced.

1315973880624738306 2020-10-13 19:13:17 +0800 <Mikanojo> @NorsemanActual Religion, at its best, is a collective effort to study the scripture and seek the will of GOD, how ever you are able to conceive of GOD.  It is a spiritual hospital, a network, a community center.  At its worst it is a SWINDLER of the spiritually naive, and a #HateGroup .

So again, even if some one does not believe in the Bible, they should at least know what it DOES and DOES NOT say, if they are going to seriously discuss it.

It changes from one denomination to the next, and they disagree with each other.  Dogma defines denominations, separating them.

1314796368280518656 2020-10-10 13:14:16 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpiritKing11 @Alexmipego @DavidJoeeee @AllanBr38201324 Did GOD fail in the message?  Or are you simply refusing to accept it, as so many refuse to accept it?  Are you not hearing GOD because GOD is not talking to you, or are you refusing to hear GOD because your dogma insists that it must not be GOD?
1314795921117310976 2020-10-10 13:12:29 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpiritKing11 @Alexmipego @DavidJoeeee @AllanBr38201324 So far this night, one man in two separate accounts has fled from me twice, refusing to accept the scripture when i pointed him to it verse after verse.  Another person, or possibly even the same person, in a third account attempted to play anti-theist, as you are attempting now.

Why do you call me good?  Your dogma seems to be a plank in your eye.  Keeping you from even seeing the scripture for it self.

Immediately the people pick up stones, and He asks them why?  They tell Him because you said that you are GOD... this was heresy under the law of Moses.  This would lead to His death on the cross.

He simply chose not to reveal Him self to be GOD until He had done all else to fulfill the covenant between GOD and Moses.  That was His plan, His stated purpose, to fulfill the whole law.  None of the law would end until it had all been fulfilled.

He did not simply abolish it, He fulfilled it, and so completed it.  And a LOT Of the Bible explains this.. why have you never read it?

Thus honoring the covenant with Moses while still offering salvation FROM it for humanity.  Salvation you have not yet chosen to accept.
1314788897549774848 2020-10-10 12:44:35 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpiritKing11 @Alexmipego @DavidJoeeee @AllanBr38201324 YES!  The reason He told them when He did was to bring about His necessary death under the law, for the law condemns ALL.  If He had not died, then the law would not have died with Him.  No one would be saved.

He had fulfilled the law, then died for it on our behalf.  On the 3rd day of His death, He resurrects.

He is born of Mary, grows up living under the law of Moses, spends 33 years teaching, while doing so, then declares Him self to be GOD, then He is given to the Romans for heresy.

It would help reiterate the same point i keep telling you, that Christians do NOT live by the law of Moses, and the law of Moses is not of GOD.

So i am not taking any of this personally.  But i do read it, daily.  And your dogma is not supported by the scripture.

Has your dogma blinded you to scripture entirely?

Salvation in Christ, or face judgement under the law of Moses.  Do you realize you are actually choosing to IGNORE significant portions of the New Testament in order to cling to this horrid false dogma?

It would contradict the anti-theist dogma you have chosen to live by instead.  Thank you for your review of a book you have not read sir,  but i cannot take your condescension seriously any more.

It is the last honest effort at translation, with none of the American political revisions.

A dogma you could disprove for your self IF you felt brave enough to open the Bible and read it for your self.  i wish you would.

The final act of Christ, being murdered by that law, dying under that law, WAS the fulfillment of that law.  This is WHY Christ had to die, so that you would NOT be cursed under that law.

That takes us back into Judaism and the carnal, cursed laws of Moses.  i am a Gentile woman, and saved by Christ.  The law holds no condemnation for me at all sir.  Read Romans 8:1.

Do not let the dogma of your denomination be a stumbling block that keeps you from scripture, sir.  Romans 10:4  For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.

So GOD became flesh, fulfilled the covenant between Moses and GOD in order to end it.

And the truth is, Homosexuality is NEVER called a sin.  Only GOD defines sin, and He did so in 10 commandments.  Moses added 603 carnal, cursed laws. which Jesus then ENDED.

1314764109288599552 2020-10-10 11:06:05 +0800 <Mikanojo> @AllanBr38201324 Jesus never spoke even one word about homosexuality, neither did He condemn it, Nor did GOD the father EVER call homosexuality a sin.  Instead there was a carnal law of Moses against it, and Jesus fulfilled and ENDED the entire covenant with Moses, ENDING all of those laws.
1314763660326178816 2020-10-10 11:04:18 +0800 <Mikanojo> @JerryBeets @Castro4Congress It is interesting how you pretend to suddenly care about marriage fidelity while still supporting a serial adulterer and sexual predator.  But that accusation about Joe comes from the jilted ex, with absolutely no evidence at all.  i think you can drop the facade of righteousness
1314703211467472896 2020-10-10 07:04:06 +0800 <Mikanojo> @Fah_Lo_Me That IS a great idea!  Instead of these mockeries of "debate" where the #Democrats are trying to discuss the issues and their plans, while #Republicans throw their dung and screech in an effort to interrupt, why NOT forget about that completely and just have separate interviews!

1314250842346672129 2020-10-09 01:06:33 +0800 <Mikanojo> @jefftimmer i think "militia" is just a word the #rightwing use, when they are trying to fabricate a constitutional excuse for their terrorist groups.  Their is no justice in their acts, no defense of the country, and instead of working to overthrow the authoritarian govt.  They JOINED it.  https://t.co/lB5VFy1taY
1314250153646125056 2020-10-09 01:03:48 +0800 <Mikanojo> It seems to me that #militia is just a word #rightwing people use, when they are trying to fabricate a constitutional excuse for their terrorist groups.

1313183518084616193 2020-10-06 02:25:23 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpqrImperator @KurtSchlichter In reality, Insurance companies discontinued older plans that did not cover enough, under the ACA guidelines.  No one lost their insurance, they simply had to switch from one plan with the same insurance company to another plan with their insurance company.

The #Trump administration has been seeking to destroy the Affordable Care Act for years now.  The 14 MILLION people that suddenly had health care because of the ACA will immediately lose that care.  And some WILL die.

If #Trump LIED about having #COVID19 then no, the driver was not exposed.  Evil and stupid either way.
1313003817105936384 2020-10-05 14:31:19 +0800 <Mikanojo> @KurtSchlichter @realDonaldTrump i think the hard truth here in your tweet is that you have no conception of the duty of the secret service; you are just desperate to make any excuse and every excuse for your #Fascist leader.
1313002730386931713 2020-10-05 14:26:59 +0800 <Mikanojo> @KurtSchlichter @realDonaldTrump The secret service are there to protect the president from threats.  YOU think that if the president THREATENS the lives of the secret service by exposing them to a potentially deadly virus that this is some how the same duty?  How is this different from Trump poisoning them?
1313002198792458242 2020-10-05 14:24:53 +0800 <Mikanojo> @KurtSchlichter @realDonaldTrump So...  #Trump knowingly, callously, exposing his own Secret Service detail unnecessarily to #COVID19, which in turn they would take home and possibly unknowingly infect their spouse, their children, their parents, their friends... you think that is acceptable?
1312990947752329217 2020-10-05 13:40:10 +0800 <Mikanojo> @IiiBort @splcenter And by declaring that good "needs" evil, evil is excused as being necessary.  And so evil is permitted to spread.  If people understood what evil is, they would not make excuses for it.  Who benefits from this Western philosophy?  Evil does.  All else suffers for this mistake.
1312990413645520896 2020-10-05 13:38:03 +0800 <Mikanojo> @IiiBort @splcenter That IS a popular Western twist on Eastern philosophy.

After Uther died, Merlin sunk the sword into the stone or into an anvil in some versions, and who ever could draw it out again would be king.  Arthur drew the sword.

1312980847788658689 2020-10-05 13:00:02 +0800 <Mikanojo> @twendi66 It definitely changed the life of Arthur.  Nimue laid in the lake and gave the sword Excalibur to Merlin who, being unworthy of the sword, plunged it into a stone.  Arthur was the only one to draw the sword from the stone, becoming king of Britain... if i am remembering correct?
1312979868900970497 2020-10-05 12:56:09 +0800 <Mikanojo> @IiiBort @splcenter Did you notice that the definition of good, does not even include the concept of evil in it?  Evil is /are intentional or callous unhealthy acts that cause harm, either to self or others.  Notice also that we do not need good to define evil.
1312979466356838400 2020-10-05 12:54:33 +0800 <Mikanojo> @IiiBort @splcenter Ah!  Good is/are intentional healthy and/or harmless acts, that result in benefiting self or others.  Happiness is not the same thing as good.  Happiness is a sense of personal contentment.  Those who choose evil, find happiness in the evil they commit.
1312948368809717760 2020-10-05 10:50:59 +0800 <Mikanojo> @IiiBort @splcenter Evil is not a balance for good, nor does good need evil to exist.  If creation were a garden, evil would be the weeds, that choke the soil, steal the water, produce no fruit, and give no joy.  We do not need weeds to appreciate the good plants in the garden.

1312944399198740480 2020-10-05 10:35:12 +0800 <Mikanojo> @IiiBort @splcenter In a very real sense, you and i share a basic concept; our souls are energy, we generate energy, we use energy, we share energy.  But there is positive, healthy energy, and negative unhealthy energy.  And that, in essence, is better known as good and evil.
1312943339046531072 2020-10-05 10:30:59 +0800 <Mikanojo> @Ch_JesusChrist @HollandJeffreyR It is only uncomfortable to the political #RightWing ; the #Evangelicals who spew politics from their pulpits and twist scripture out of context in order to excuse their hateful dogmas.

1312941991517331456 2020-10-05 10:25:38 +0800 <Mikanojo> @IiiBort @splcenter At its best, a church is a sanctuary, a meeting place, where people READ the scriptures, seeking to build a closer relationship with GOD. But every denomination is separated from the next by man-made disagreeable political dogmas that too often twist or ignore scripture.

Slavery was a major economic factor for the early USA, and even now in 2020 the #RightWing waves Confederate flags and screams "White Power"... sick.

You lost the debate before it really started.  Now i sit here giggling, wondering if you will even try to return to the topic of #UniversalHealthCare .

That is ANOTHER aspect of UniversalHealthCare that you on the #RightWing want to ignore.  It does not cost as much as people are being forced to pay.

And no one needs to choose between paying to keep the power on versus paying to feed your family.  #RightWing greed-based ideology causes too much death and suffering.

This is the same basic model that many, many other nations use, some of them since the 1930s.

But then in 1990 AD i chose to be born and since then life has not been the same.

His idol #Trump fired him, falsely scapegoating him for the Tulsa #hatespeech rally that was actually ruined by Tiktok users and Kpop fans ordering up all the tickets then not going.

That simple act is twisted into a grand conspiracy of pedophile cannibals by the #RightWing , exposing their own sickness.

1309248216378912768 2020-09-25 05:47:54 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 i agree they did indeed go against Christ's teaching.  They were following the man-made dogma of their religious leaders instead.  And when the Roman Catholics embraced Hitler they were doing the same, and when Evangelicals embraced Trump they too are doing the same.
1309247547861381121 2020-09-25 05:45:14 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Here you would find it hard to see a #RightWing #Evangelical correctly quoting Christ.  Instead they prefer their own dogma of hate and fear, twisting bits of verse, mostly from Paul, out of their context, or cherry picking from the laws of Moses.
1309247121967570944 2020-09-25 05:43:33 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Sadly we must admit the same of the Bible.  The crusades, the inquisition... and how the church treated the plague is no different than how #Evangelicals here are treating the #coronavirus ‚Äî abstractly, with lies and prayers instead of sense.

Some make good sense, some make no sense.  None are Christ's teaching, so they are not for me.
1309245305850798080 2020-09-25 05:36:20 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 We agree again.  And the #RightWing #Evangelicals here i place with them; Christ is on the facade of their buildings but their hearts are FAR from Christ's teaching.
1309244699601903616 2020-09-25 05:33:55 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Christ warned that He had come to divide the family, the children against the parents.  He was referring to the neu covenant He was offering, after fulfilling and ending the old one with Moses.  A covenant that He knew many in the older generation would reject.
1309244080551915520 2020-09-25 05:31:28 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Ah that group.  They are roughly as Christian as the Mormons, and to say that i mean not really at all.  The Mormons believe the men will all become gods of their own worlds, and all of their spirit wives will be their concubines to populate their neu earths.  Good luck with that
1309243328664281088 2020-09-25 05:28:28 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 i DO cover mai hair when i am in church, though i have bangs now and that will make it harder to go back with a scarf over me(!)  But i do so ironically. to humor Paul, because i have no wish to distract him or any one else with mai "glorious" and short hair.
1309242813381443584 2020-09-25 05:26:25 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Popularity and traditions do not actually define Christ's teaching, do they?  In fact they never did.  Christ has inspired neu traditions, but where His teaching might contradict Patriarchal tradition, Christ is amended, or simply ignored, in favor of Patriarchy.
1309242259196448768 2020-09-25 05:24:13 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 and then Paul went back to Judaism for this idea:   (1 Corinthians 11:3) "But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is GOD."  Paul again establishing patriarchy and women's subjugation to men.
1309241674879565824 2020-09-25 05:21:54 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Paul thought that our long hair was our glory, (1 Corinthians 11:15) and threatened to cut off our hair if it was not kept hidden in church, because Paul claimed Man is the image and glory of GOD: but the woman is the glory of the man. (1 Corinthians 11:6-7).
1309240803290570752 2020-09-25 05:18:26 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Read 1 Corinthians 14:35 "And if they (women) will learn any thing (in church), let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church."
1309240325219573760 2020-09-25 05:16:32 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Read 1 Timothy 2:11-15  Where Paul concludes to Timothy that women "shall be saved in CHILDBEARING, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety."
1309239563844378625 2020-09-25 05:13:31 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 i feel certain it is what gives us our different perspectives.  We have faith in the same Christ.  Amen!    Where we differ is regarding dogmas.  i confess you have amazed me, communicating with me for so long today, considering your dogma against me.
1309238972434903040 2020-09-25 05:11:10 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 i would say that the EKJV of the LDS church is the worst revision, and then the NIV would be the next worse.  Having studied from multiple versions, i returned to the 1769 King James which most closely mirrors the Textus Receptus.
1309238353594703872 2020-09-25 05:08:42 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 i would see a moral dilemma in accepting Paul's beliefs regarding women in the church as opposed to Christ's teaching of equality.  Just as i see a moral dilemma when Evangelicals craft dogma based on Paul out of context and cherry picking from the law of Moses.
1309237920289546240 2020-09-25 05:06:59 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 i do not see a dilemma.  i accept Paul admitting his own humanity, admitting that some times he is giving us his opinions.  When he speaks of Christ it is always in alignment with the teaching of Christ.  When he speaks from his own heart, some times it is not in alignment.
1309237365588721665 2020-09-25 05:04:47 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 i confess it is easier for me, i think, because i did take the time for serious study.  i am constantly asking people to open the King James Bible and read it, because they have dogma teaching, instead of scripture.  i violate dogmas daily.  But i follow Christ's teaching.
1309236890940239872 2020-09-25 05:02:53 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Again we agree.  Mai background... i was raised in the Ryobu Shinto of mai obaasan, on okaasan's side of the family.  Christianity began as a form of rebellion for me.
1309236333299130369 2020-09-25 05:00:40 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 i am not choosing what is inspired or is not.  Paul told us in his own words.  Why should i seek to ignore that?
1309236069859127296 2020-09-25 04:59:38 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Personally i have no thing against the adoration of saints.  i see them with a different perspective perhaps.  i see them as being very similar to Shinto morality plays or the many incarnations of Hindu gods and goddesses, each story teaches a valuable moral lesson.
1309235457528492034 2020-09-25 04:57:12 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 i am only taking Paul at his own word.  Others are interpreting as they choose to define their man-made dogma.  Sola scriptura.  Scripture alone for me.
1309234064956649472 2020-09-25 04:51:40 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Many denominations do not discuss the saints.  Only citing the stories of Bible voices.  Adoration of the saints is not actively preached in many Protestant churches.
1309233698940678144 2020-09-25 04:50:12 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Yes!  Again Paul said this him self.  1 Corinthians 7:6.  So if i believe Paul, then i believe him when he admits that some times he is writing his own opinions.  And i do.
1309233272635813888 2020-09-25 04:48:31 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Ah exactly!  And again, i do not worship them.  i consider their stories, i look for the lessons in them.  But always with the understanding that they are human beings. not GOD.
1309232954632056833 2020-09-25 04:47:15 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 i completely understand the difference between adoration and worship.  But Christ is the one i DO worship.  If any teaching disagrees with His teaching, then i reject it.
1309232655150456832 2020-09-25 04:46:04 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Exactly.  When Paul is speaking from inspiration, that is from GOD.  When Paul is speaking from permission, he is offering his own opinions.  And when we look at those teachings, it is easy to see, for he is NOT talking about Christ then; instead he is discussing other matters.
1309232271245803520 2020-09-25 04:44:32 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 i agree that we can look to the lives of the saints for good morality lessons.  And i do.  But i do not imagine any of them to be infallible.  They are all human beings.  Beautifully fallible.  ‰æòÂØÇ
1309231760937418753 2020-09-25 04:42:30 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 i am saying that i accept Paul's admission that at times he spoke from permission and not from commandment.  At times, Paul was adding his own advice.  He admits that.  Why should i insist other than that?
1309231468065951744 2020-09-25 04:41:20 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 There is a reason for every word in the Bible to be there.  But so much of it is telling us how NOT to act.  If you believe that every thing Paul wrote is Christ's plan then what happens when Paul contradicts Christ's teaching with his own?  As he did regarding equality?
1309231049533054976 2020-09-25 04:39:41 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 It is wise to discuss the NT when discussing Christianity because that is where you find it.  But how many gods are there in the NT?  do we bow down to the will of the saints?  Do the saints save us?  Are they necessary intercessors?  Christ took me in; i need no other master.
1309230536401940480 2020-09-25 04:37:38 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 O if it were about me at all, what i agreed with, then there would have been a few more sins on that list.   But it is not about me.  It is about learning the Bible.  Honestly studying it, recognizing the different voices, and using mai free will to decide whom i will follow.
1309230109291765760 2020-09-25 04:35:57 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 i DO believe it.  i DO accept this as the account.  But i also recognize the difference between Christ's teaching and the teaching of others.  And i do not worship any others.
1309229627236212741 2020-09-25 04:34:02 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 The Bible is a compilation of 35+ voices, collected over 1500 years.  Not every thing in the Bible is intended for Christians to follow.  Again, over half of the Book is telling us what Jesus DIED to SAVE us from.  As a Christian, i follow Christ's teaching.  Not hard math at all
1309229094257569792 2020-09-25 04:31:55 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 yes i am.  Christ treats men and women equally, Paul admits this.  So then all of the sexist Patriarchal dogma is NOT supported by Christ's teaching.  and therefore i discard that dogma.  Just as i reject dogma based on the writing of Moses.
1309228657764786177 2020-09-25 04:30:10 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 That is where i disagree.  We have Paul's testimony of Christ, and we also have Paul's testimony of Paul.  And recognizing Paul's humanity is important, just as recognizing Moses' humanity and Muhammad's humanity is important.
1309228318160351232 2020-09-25 04:28:49 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Since Paul admitted that at times he spoke from permission, and not from commandment, was he not stating that we should consider each to be from different sources, from Christ versus from Paul?  Pauline dogma has caused more than a century of horror for priests and their victims.
1309227662380941312 2020-09-25 04:26:13 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 If we would be like Christ, follow Christ's teaching.  If we would be like Paul, follow Paul's advice he gave to Timothy, etc... is it hard to see the difference?  i never felt that it was.
1309227362312044544 2020-09-25 04:25:02 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Paul wrote 13 books of the New testament.  but ALL of the Bible is stories about GOD and interactions between GOD and humanity, therefore the entire Bible IS inspired and as GOD intended God breathed.  Over half of the book is telling us what Christ SAVED us from.  What NOT to do
1309226958006353920 2020-09-25 04:23:25 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 For me is is simple now, but i confess i did 4 years of due diligence to be where i am now.  the B.A. Theology helps.  Reading the scripture, listening to Paul when he speaks for him self, as opposed to speaking of Christ.
1309226407399026688 2020-09-25 04:21:14 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Paul is repeatedly sexist in his writing regarding women, even though Paul also admits that Men and Women are the SAME to Christ.  So which direction does the church go?  Equality or patriarchy?  Surprise!  Men first, women are property, concubines, servant wives...
1309226041756405760 2020-09-25 04:19:47 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Paul admitted that at times he spoke from permission and not from commandment.  A good example:  Paul twice wrote that he felt all Christians should be abstinent as he was.  If that advice were followed, that would have wiped out Christendom in one generation with no heirs.
1309225665590222848 2020-09-25 04:18:17 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Another example.   https://t.co/cADBMgqayr

1309224668369354752 2020-09-25 04:14:19 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Jesus was the #Progressive socialist reformer, all others pale in comparison, i agree absolutely and that too i attribute partly to reliance on the opinions of Paul.  But i do not worship Paul.  Nor does he define Christ for me.
1309224240063807488 2020-09-25 04:12:37 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 The problems i have with the early church are the later additions of man-made dogma, and the over-reliance on the opinions of Paul, infamously sexist and anti-sex.  Dogma is always what separates me from most churches.  i do not suffer for this; i am closer to Christ without it.
1309223656237588480 2020-09-25 04:10:18 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Evangelicals in USA refer to #Trump as "the chosen one" and "the savior of Israel".  They compare him to King Cyrus and King David.  But behind the facade, they are working to make him into the 2nd beast of Revelation chapter 13.  They wear his mark on their foreheads.  https://t.co/2Vu8gq65QT

1309222808803631106 2020-09-25 04:06:56 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 They have long since abandoned the solas of the Reformers in favor of politics for power and money.  There ARE good churches, and there ARE good people in EVERY religion.  But  any dogma that disagrees with scripture, that infers or adds to it, is anathema to me.  i reject it.
1309222313674514432 2020-09-25 04:04:58 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 True.  And while i respect your faith observances, i do not share in any of that dogma and, i have no faith in organized man-made religion.  Every denomination / faction is separated from the next by their dogma, which disagrees.  i am sola scriptura.  The scripture alone.

And the current #rightwing #Evangelical ideology is NOT following Christ's teaching.  They are following Mammon, in every regard, including the sacrifice of other peoples children.  https://t.co/kJBTrHGdqr
1309221086379167745 2020-09-25 04:00:05 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 The Evangelicals here do not live by the solas.  Their faith is in their politically motivated religious charlatans faking "tongues" on stage for money, and in the hateful dogma of their leaders that cherry pick from the carnal, cursed law of Moses to excuse their dogma.
1309220578801250304 2020-09-25 03:58:04 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Mai personal witness?  i have been much more accepted by the Muslims, by the Wiccans, and absolutely by the Christians of the #Left than by any one else.  And having lived here since 2007, that has never changed.

But i have been met only with kindness by the Muslim people here in USA.  Treated MUCH better in fact than how the Evangelicals treat me.
1309218923955412992 2020-09-25 03:51:30 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Regarding the #Evangelicals, they have twisted Christianity to fit their #RightWing political beliefs.

1309218015896981504 2020-09-25 03:47:53 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 A farce used to excuse the genocide of both native Americans and Black people and claiming GOD wills it?  i would say that qualifies as violent.
1309217646072668160 2020-09-25 03:46:25 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 The average Muslim and average Hebrew of this era follow a faith that is updated and moderated by rabbis / imams as necessary for the sake of modern society.  There are still extremist sects, just as evil as the Klan, but they do not represent modern Islam.
1309216822063804416 2020-09-25 03:43:09 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 i have wondered about that.  There was no error in understanding.  So why is the story so changed?  Again the prevalent theory is that Christ was intentionally diminished and altered to better suit the intent of Islam.  Similar to how #Evangelicals and Mormons altered Him.
1309216050685255680 2020-09-25 03:40:05 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 i had a feeling that you and i shared the same information, but i do not share your animosity toward Islam.  Though Islam detests me, and would kill me, if i were in their power.
1309215716696928256 2020-09-25 03:38:45 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 The only revelation Gabriel brought to Mary was to tell her that GOD planned to make her the mother of the savior.  She questioned Gabriel then said "be it unto me according to your word" giving her consent.
1309214738119757830 2020-09-25 03:34:52 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Jesus comes to Judaism first, to fulfill and end the law of Moses, establishing a new covenant between humanity and GOD.  The Jews orchestrate the murder of Christ for heresy.  Then Islam diminishes His story, this Isa, he's a nice guy, and a prophet... but not GOD.. no no...
1309213987729334272 2020-09-25 03:31:53 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Essentially Islam is a revision of Judaism.  Moses versus Muhammad, one receives 10 commandments from GOD, the other receives revelations from the archangel Gabriel /Jibril.  Both men go on to add many carnal and abstract laws.
1309213041364365312 2020-09-25 03:28:07 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 And what they got right is what i have been pointing out this entire time.
1309212876175941632 2020-09-25 03:27:28 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Yes.
1309212744164372480 2020-09-25 03:26:56 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 i am aware of the transformation.  and Islam is very MUCH like Judaism in far more respects than many people are aware of or willing to admit to.  Muhammad became more like Moses the farther he went.
1309212298993528834 2020-09-25 03:25:10 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 As i mentioned, in fact the same angel, Gabriel, appears at the beginning of both Christianity and Islam.  Islam, coming later, absolutely drew from the stories passing through the country.
1309211947292790784 2020-09-25 03:23:46 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Judaism, Christianity and Islam ARE all Abrahamic religions with the same proto-source.  El.  It makes sense that the Romans would be aware of this association.
1309211635483959296 2020-09-25 03:22:32 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 The prophecy of a virgin birth predates Islam.
1309211279265902592 2020-09-25 03:21:07 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Now that is a theory i have not read or heard about before, and to be blunt that makes no sense.  Since so much of Christ's teaching is counter to Islam.  A more common theory declares that Islam added Christ to diminish and twist His message.
1309210765669195776 2020-09-25 03:19:05 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 The Quran left out the most important reality of Jesus.  To admit that He was GOD in the flesh and that He was our Savior, would have been (at best) a heretical alternative to Islam, just as Christ's teaching offers an extreme alternative to Judaism.
1309209995007766528 2020-09-25 03:16:01 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 Ah, then i must disagree.  Though the testimony is heavily embellished and his Godhood and purpose redacted, they still managed to include His basic wisdom.  They tried to make room for Him.  Just had a LOT of trouble making Him fit.
1309209177089167361 2020-09-25 03:12:46 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 It is Jesus the religiously friendly reboot.  The alternative would have been to declare Him a heretic, as Judaism did.  There is a deep mystery surrounding the reasons WHY Christ was included in the Quran at all, unless you accept that Gabriel /Jibril told the story.
1309208416489934854 2020-09-25 03:09:45 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 As already stated,  The Islamic account of Jesus is altered to fit the teaching of Muhammad, and intentionally avoids His purpose, or any thing He is recorded saying that disagrees with the Quran.
1309207649955635200 2020-09-25 03:06:42 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 i thought you were referring to the differences in the testimony?  https://t.co/7xPFpCcoY6
1309206820863369216 2020-09-25 03:03:24 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 2/2 accepting that the Islamic account of Jesus is diminished, even so they do a much better work than the Mormons or #Evangelicals who have drastically altered Christ to fit their false political dogma.
1309206263201292288 2020-09-25 03:01:11 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SpartanRed7 @twendi66 To be certain, it is a biased and paraphrased "Instagram highlights" revision, avoiding His actual purpose and focusing only on those statements considered to be agreeable and not in opposition to Muhammad. 1/2

Which ALSO does not call it a sin.  the sin in that story is idolatry, and GOD MAKES the group gay and lesbian!  Would GOD make some one commit a sin?  NEVER.

Does not call being gay a sin.  regarding the story in 1 Corinthians 6 read it in its context verses 1 - 12 and you discover Paul is referring to that same law of the unbelievers. Before saying that all is LAWFUL for him now.  https://t.co/QNJ2g22yoN

Again there are so many many acts that are horrid, that we would NEVER commit against another person if we are loving people as Christ told us to.  But we do NOT get to declare extra sins for sake of argument.  THAT is a sin.

So is homosexuality a sin?  NO.  Is it even immoral?  NO.  Is it rape?  Is it pedophilia?  NO.    Do you have a valid argument?  NO.

Absolutely that means NOT committing rape, and absolutely that means NOT committing pedophilic acts, or sadistic acts, or ANY similar assaults.  But if we LIE, we are the sinners.

But only GOD got to decide that.  The fact that you want to add to it, is false Christianity.

Like it or not.

Neither one is in any way associated with homosexuality, which is what you are attempting fraudulently to do.  And neither you nor i get to decide what is sin.  You admitted that before you started declaring sin in your opinion.

Both rape and pedophilia are carnal (flesh-minded) assaults upon a person.  When we look at the sins, GOD focused on the soul, not the body.
1308513870193938432 2020-09-23 05:09:52 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SnoozeLuL @SammySammyStagg @topha_doro @MlbDjs Paul also twice said that he wanted all Christians to be celibate like he was.  If we took Paul's advice about sex, all of Christendom would have died out in one generation, with no heirs.  Paul is no authority on what is or is not sin.
1308513347168468992 2020-09-23 05:07:47 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SnoozeLuL @SammySammyStagg @topha_doro @MlbDjs There are a lot of acts that you and i would want to be sins.  But only GOD got to decide that and GOD's list is only ten sins long.  So WANTING some thing to be a sin, does not make it a sin.  And Homosexuality is nothing like pedophilia at all.
1308512937301041152 2020-09-23 05:06:09 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SnoozeLuL @SammySammyStagg @topha_doro @MlbDjs The only thing GOD ever said about marriage was that there is no marriage in Heaven.  Regarding sins, the sin of adultery is literally oath breaking, adulterating contracts in order not to fulfill them.  That certainly includes your marriage vows, but is not limited to them.

The exact same word is used in multiple verses and NEVER for sex.  We can put that false dogma away now.

In fact the one verse intentionally twisted to falsely claim a homosexual reason is Genesis 19:5 "Bring them out that we may know them."
1308502495040241666 2020-09-23 04:24:40 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SnoozeLuL @SammySammyStagg @topha_doro @MlbDjs Indeed GOD established men and women and that is how children are produced!  But what did GOD say about marriage?  Did GOD create marriage?  or declare any genitalia requirements for love or sex?  No.  No GOD did not do any of that.  Did GOD ever call homosexuality a sin?  No.

Moses when on to add 603 laws for righteousness to those 10, until every one was condemned.  Christ came to fulfill and END that covenant, returning us back to 10 commandments.
1308501776069402624 2020-09-23 04:21:48 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SnoozeLuL @SammySammyStagg @topha_doro @MlbDjs Agreed.  Man does not define sin.  Only GOD does. So i ask again, which of the 10 commandments that GOD gave, defining sin, declares being homosexual a sin?  Moses made a law against it, Jesus fulfilled and ended that law.  Paul hated it, called it vile... does that make it sin?

The problem is that they are choosing to define sin.

Have you ever tried opening the Bible and reading the verses they mention?  But even before that, who defines sin?  Is it the church?  Is it Paul?  is it Moses?  Or is sin defined by GOD alone?

Your genitals are not a valid determining factor regarding how you feel about others, or about your self, your likes, dislikes, behavior, gender.. none of it.

There is plenty of false church dogma, based on the carnal law of Moses that Christ DIED to SAVE us from, and bits of Paul out of context.  You cannot use Christ to hate the LGBTQIA.

A child should be allowed to explore their gender without you attempting to reinforce what you think is masculine for a boy or feminine for a girl.  Let them play with the toys they want, wear the clothes they like.

It does not determine the genitals of the people you are sexually attracted to, or your gender identity / role in society.  Understanding that will help you a lot.

It does NOT determine where that individual perceives them selves in society.

One boy has a 50% chance of being hetero or homosexual, then two boys would increase those odds.  Your study found this to be true in an incredibly rough estimate: 15-30%, so less than half of the study group, with a further 15 +/0 error ratio.

But statistically in ANY group, a percentage of men are gay, regardless of their mother's number of male offspring.

You may as well claim that nearly all homosexual people have hair, much more than 15-30%, therefore hair must play a significant role in determining sexual preference.  (hint:  it does not).

Because genetics determine physiology, not psychology.

What you cannot claim, is that these hormonal values dictate gender role, nor socio /sexual preferences.

Yet i fell in love with a woman, and have always felt sexually attracted to other women.
1308461422649552898 2020-09-23 01:41:27 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SammySammyStagg @SnoozeLuL @topha_doro @MlbDjs What the androgen studies ultimately prove is what i mentioned already, that physical sex is ALSO a spectrum.  That every man and every woman is a genetic collection of multiple hormones and therefor hormones neither guarantee nor enforce the gender expressions of any one.
1308460637870202881 2020-09-23 01:38:20 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SammySammyStagg @SnoozeLuL @topha_doro @MlbDjs Hormones create genetic differences, not gender differences.  A man may exhibit all of the commonly "masculine" traits and still be very emotional, and homosexual  or bisexual.  A woman may exhibit every common "feminine" trait and still be a lesbian or bisexual.
1308460069940387842 2020-09-23 01:36:05 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SammySammyStagg @SnoozeLuL @topha_doro @MlbDjs The reality is that gender traits are non-sexual, despite all labeling.  Women and men are equally capable of expressing the exact SAME gender traits.  The problem is in the misappropriation of those traits to a single sex.
1308459579743772672 2020-09-23 01:34:08 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SammySammyStagg @SnoozeLuL @topha_doro @MlbDjs Gender-egalitarian countries accepted the difference between gender and sex, and have adopted gender equality based on the morality of that acceptance.  They are not collectively led by their hormones to recognize that a man may not feel like the societal expectation of "man".
1308458999239438336 2020-09-23 01:31:50 +0800 <Mikanojo> @SammySammyStagg @SnoozeLuL @topha_doro @MlbDjs There is physical masculinization, but not gender.   No amount of hormones indicates whether some one will be heterosexual or homosexual regarding their sexual preferences, their orientation, or their gender role.

Republicans IGNORED constitutional law, but now that their Fascist is in power, suddenly the law is convenient?

Yes, absolutely it is still applied, and people still confuse and transpose sex with gender.  And yes they are WRONG to do so.

And gender is nothing more than a social construct, that has wrongly been applied to sex.    Maybe before your children grow up, YOU need to grow up a bit more your self.

Your child needs to explore their world to discover it and to learn about them selves.  Why do i think you would sooner let your child play with guns than let them swap clothes?

A child can decide their gender multiple times with no ill effects on any one other than bigoted parents who might feel embarrassed.  Whose lives are you placing first in this situation, theirs... or YOURS?

If they truly do wish to change sex, the earlier the reassignment, the easier the treatment is.  At least consider that.

But if she was acting facetiously or if she was really having an episode of panic, i think the police acted better than US police.

And fighting with the police, who appear to converge on her to take her into custody without hurting her or letting her hurt any one else.  For me the sadness is the necessity of it.
1308078586780217345 2020-09-22 00:20:12 +0800 <Mikanojo> @twendi66 As i watched the video i kept wondering why she appeared to be acting so dramatically?  Was it because there was a camera?  Is she living with an altered sense of awareness?  The police subdued her without hurting her, which i think is how it should be accomplished.

Every pastor, every reverend every evangelist should have their messages held next to Christ's teaching, and those that do not match should be cast away and ignored.

You can also drop the word "Truthful" from your bio, because like #FoxNews you are offering #RightWing skewed COMMENTARY and therefore have no requirement or intention of being truthful.  https://t.co/17FznpRMZ1
1306525253699383296 2020-09-17 17:27:49 +0800 <Mikanojo> @ColumbiaBugle "Controversial" is an interesting spelling of "lying".  Even the Fox moderator told him flatly, no, he (Soros) did not (fund BLM protests).  #FoxNews is facing potential lawsuits for lying about the #Coronavirus .  They may suddenly be rethinking how they mislead the pubic.

But GOD also hates iniquity, GOD also hates evil, and as Christians we are told to do the same.  Hating evil, rebuking it, exposing it, having no fellowship with it, is exactly what we Christians are supposed to be doing.

1305825615522586624 2020-09-15 19:07:42 +0800 <Mikanojo> @larikoo Faith without works is dead.  There is no sin in being harmless, but there is no good work accomplished in allowing evil to grow and spread unchallenged and unexposed.
1305824897571069952 2020-09-15 19:04:51 +0800 <Mikanojo> @larikoo Arguably both Jesus and Siddhartha were activists.  Both sought to enlighten others, both spread their message.  One achieved their goal of fulfilling a cursed covenant, and offering a neu one instead, the other achieved their goal of escaping their life of 'suffering'.
1305824299685572609 2020-09-15 19:02:28 +0800 <Mikanojo> @larikoo i cannot associate the works of Jesus with the works of Siddhartha; one set out to fulfill and end a a covenant between GOD and mankind that had become carnal and cursed, the other sought to escape reality, with the assumption that being nothing is better than suffering.
1305823539644178433 2020-09-15 18:59:27 +0800 <Mikanojo> @larikoo Iya.  If the #MAGA have proven any thing to us, it is that education is not necessary at all for some one to suffer from delusions of superiority. The guru and the scholar both imagine them selves to have superior perspective on the world.
1305822620600811520 2020-09-15 18:55:48 +0800 <Mikanojo> @larikoo Even speaking out against evil, is more useful than sitting quietly while evil spreads and flourishes.  The illusion is that there is some middle ground between that which is beneficial good and that which is harmful evil.  Doing no thing is surrender to evil.
1305822002570096640 2020-09-15 18:53:21 +0800 <Mikanojo> @larikoo Doing no thing accomplishes no thing.  When Jesus did not act, what stunned the crowd was how this rabbi was failing to force the law of Moses upon others.  How He seemed at times to even make excuses NOT to live by that law.  Later He was crucified for violating that law.
1305809171648884736 2020-09-15 18:02:21 +0800 <Mikanojo> @larikoo i think you have offered an excellent point regarding stage five in the model; suggesting they would see the "fight" as not being theirs.  Some would see that as a revelation, as a disillusion of significance.
1305808393815257091 2020-09-15 17:59:16 +0800 <Mikanojo> @larikoo It seems to mean losing the will to defend those convictions, and also, losing many convictions to a sense of helplessness, where ultimately little matters any more beyond simple, "creature" comforts.  A comfy home, a cup of tea... a pleasing view...
1305807834706108416 2020-09-15 17:57:03 +0800 <Mikanojo> @larikoo Christ focused on defining good from evil, then asking people to decide for them selves which side they choose to follow.  Siddhartha sought to mentally separate from all passions / duhkha / suffering, in the hopes of removing him self from cycles of rebirth.
1305806640415866880 2020-09-15 17:52:18 +0800 <Mikanojo> @larikoo It is possible to be so Heavenly minded that a person becomes of no earthly use.    It is equally possible to become so self-centered as to be of no earthly use.  Both people in those conditions imagine them selves superior.
1305805951472074753 2020-09-15 17:49:34 +0800 <Mikanojo> @larikoo When we are tiny, we look mostly at our selves.  As we grow, our awareness grows, and we cast about, seeking direction.  If we find it, we follow that path at least for a time.  But at some point our gaze either moves upward toward Heaven, or back into our selves.
1305804967777763328 2020-09-15 17:45:39 +0800 <Mikanojo> @larikoo Stage four definitely does cast judgement; in fact we constantly refine our definitions of self based on how we feel about neu knowledge and awareness.  What is this?  What does it do?  Is this helpful, harmless or harmful?  How should i feel about this?
1305804497361354752 2020-09-15 17:43:47 +0800 <Mikanojo> @larikoo i would agree those are definitely two important aspects of the condition, or maybe, the decline of those two aspects.  It is a form of formal surrender from the world.  They accept #Fascism as quickly as #Democracy because they feel unaffected personally by either.

1305803086301028352 2020-09-15 17:38:11 +0800 <Mikanojo> @larikoo From practical experiences i can testify that the people in stage 4 are the ones who commit to finding solutions to problems and take action to bring about progress, while those in stage 5 tend to retreat into their comfort places, and quietly wait for the season to change.
1305801083827007488 2020-09-15 17:30:13 +0800 <Mikanojo> @larikoo This is not entirely a bad model, in fact it is fine until the final stage.  Calling that condition "interconnected" is charitable at best.  More accurate labels would be dispassionate, jaded.  Having lost their previous convictions of morality, in favor of gray fog of passivity.

The only teaching we have about abortion in the Bible is in the Hebrew Old Testament where GOD endorsed the practice by providing temple priests with a recipe to induce an abortion.  Now think about that.

Only GOD defines sin (Hebrew chatta'ah: and offense to GOD).

They are getting sex some where else so they are craving it less at home.  They stop asking for it and begin to rebuff your sexual advances.

1303677630328184838 2020-09-09 20:52:22 +0800 <Mikanojo> @flanbites @toddjersey There is no immediate magic fix in politics.  Not when one of your two political parties has embraced #Fascism .

1303675098541424642 2020-09-09 20:42:19 +0800 <Mikanojo> @flanbites @toddjersey Bernie promised sweeping transformations for the country, very likely knowing that he would NEVER be able to get it through Congress while the Republicans controlled the Senate.  The Republicans LOST the House in the 2018 midterms, but they STILL control the Senate.
1303674737202089989 2020-09-09 20:40:53 +0800 <Mikanojo> @flanbites @toddjersey When #Bernie appeared his plan was to divide the #Democrats against them selves, sectioning us into "establishment" versus "progressive" versus "corporate" in order to win primary votes away from Hillary.

1303674228047147009 2020-09-09 20:38:51 +0800 <Mikanojo> @flanbites @toddjersey The people who actually work in Congress realize that they are up against a mostly unified front, that is against ANY positive progress for USA.  They want to go back to some mythical place between Leave It To Beaver and Mad Max.  To get ANY thing passed required compromises.

They could not make such a sweeping change happen over night.

He is literally and falsely claiming that the people in charge of the Democratic party (who are Schumer and Pelosi) do not want what the majority of Democrats want.  That is a divisive lie.
1303662462240137216 2020-09-09 19:52:06 +0800 <Mikanojo> @flanbites @toddjersey i tend to listen to people when they tell me who they are and show me what they stand for.

If she knew he had other plans beside just cleaning graffiti?  She drove him over the state line so that he could violate the curfew in Kenosha... it seems damning but i feel there must be more untold yet.

The problem i have is that he left the place he was dropped off at to clean graffiti, he took a semiautomatic rifle into a protest he was against... there is no innocence in that.  There is intent.  There is motive.

Then an hour later a 17 year old was walking the streets with a semiautomatic rifle, shooting people.

He should not have taken a gun, he should not have BEEN at the protest.

The protestors rushed him, unarmed, attempting to disarm him, and he shot them.  Again, why did he bring the gun?  He started the evening covering over graffiti, so why did he take a rifle and go into the streets with it?  He CAUSED these deaths.
1300801167971082240 2020-09-01 22:22:20 +0800 <Mikanojo> @johnpavlovitz i confess, i think at least one third of the #MAGA "patriots" on #Twitter are #Russian trolls.  The other two third seem surprisingly uneducated about their own constitution and also unaware of the GOD they claim to be worshiping.

Seriously consider how phony his story is.

When he started shooting, one man holding a skateboard tried to disarm him and Rittenhouse shot him in the chest, killing him. Rittenhouse committed two murders and tried for 3.
