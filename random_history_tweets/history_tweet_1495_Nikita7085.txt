1327348452628557827 2020-11-14 04:31:46 +0800 <Nikita7085> @GSAEmily  Of course, but if you're a firm supporter of a dictator, as we have seen happen in other parts of the world over the years, then they go along with what they're told.  Whether it's to take control of all power over country or just get rid of those you don't like.

1327033961625825281 2020-11-13 07:42:06 +0800 <Nikita7085> @CNN Isn't there a law where if you see someone is in need of medical help &amp; u just watch, do nothing &amp; they die, u could be charged with a crime?  Isn't that what the Pres &amp; Rep's are doing by not allowing Biden to do what he needs to do.

I just re-started CNN since this election, usually only watch when something major is happening, have not seen anything that would have given me that impression.

1326576365517352960 2020-11-12 01:23:46 +0800 <Nikita7085> @jaketapper @wolfblitzer  Psychologically, every time you state he has 70 mill backers, you are reinforcing his dictator behaviors &amp; reinforcing other Rep's in power to back him.  Many of those votes could be just Republicans voting for Rep.  We don't know who he's colluding with
1326569049158021120 2020-11-12 00:54:42 +0800 <Nikita7085> @jaketapper Isn't this how dictators rise &amp; keep power?  We're afraid.  Esp since we don't know what's conspiring with other dictators.  Cutting off the head of govt like a dictator overthrowing those who oppose him.

What all is he doing that we don't know about?  We're scared.
1326560933775339526 2020-11-12 00:22:27 +0800 <Nikita7085> @LastWeekTonight How did Hitler rise to the highest power in his country &amp; keep it until his death?  He cut off the head of all who opposed him.  Isn't that scary?
