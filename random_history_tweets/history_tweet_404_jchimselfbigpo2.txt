1344036006383603712 2020-12-30 05:42:09 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> You have many friends !
1344034754916564993 2020-12-30 05:37:11 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Their “God “ is money in any form. Few of them have any space  in their heart for anybody but themselves- totally self absorbed. There are precious few really decent people in the LNP it appears.
1344033077782138880 2020-12-30 05:30:31 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> My phone is dying - hence garbled tweet. New I Phone will be commissioned this very day.
1344032189910974464 2020-12-30 05:26:59 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Murdoch / IPA became active ? Gradually increased their influence , until we get where we are today. The joy tears of Whitlamemory, Hawke &amp; Keating  seem just a distant memory
1344031120862502912 2020-12-30 05:22:44 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Every time he  pisses off to avoid something embarrassing , Australia has a little upsurge of happiness &amp; efficiency !

1343773624067477504 2020-12-29 12:19:32 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Or in Molan’s case   - White Phosperous - for use on women &amp; children. Kills by the most appalling burns! Barbaric &amp; I think now illegal!

1343666660712988673 2020-12-29 05:14:30 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Possibly the statistics we’re being fed are not totally accurate ? 🤷‍♀️

1343485799749152769 2020-12-28 17:15:50 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> I believe Hazzard the NSW  Health Minister has the affliction . I’ve seen somewhere there are at least six in the current LNP Government.?
1343458214092816389 2020-12-28 15:26:13 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Because half the Government would be on Remand ?
1343457977458540544 2020-12-28 15:25:16 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Me too- now watching the Supervet!
1343457234353750016 2020-12-28 15:22:19 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> You are truly an ignorant, stupid, irresponsible idiot- giving inaccurate and misleading advice to people, on an issue you seem totally unqualified to comment upon.! You should shut the fuck up before you seriously damage somebodies future prospects!
1343428471582650369 2020-12-28 13:28:01 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> How ? Horizontal performance review

1343389187316219906 2020-12-28 10:51:55 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> The further SmugMo is from Beijing, the better are our chances of having diplomats repair his ham fisted efforts !
1343365007233335306 2020-12-28 09:15:50 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Figures ! 🤮
1343363431747837952 2020-12-28 09:09:35 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Not found ? Maybe! - not announced ? Most definitely!
1343356359505408000 2020-12-28 08:41:29 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> We all know you’re slow Tim! But how many times do you have to be told - anyone who has withdrawn Super can forget applying to Banks and most other Home Lenders - assessing them to be poor money managers ! Got it ?
1343342023688945665 2020-12-28 07:44:31 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> I suspect what was purchased , were OPTIONS to purchase the Vaccines when available . Big difference.
1343339544737796096 2020-12-28 07:34:40 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> ✋🏼😥

1343338689255022593 2020-12-28 07:31:16 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> @Delbert58885396 @KirstiMiller30 So I gather you’re a poorly educated , religious nut case , pontificating about an imaginary fairy in the Sky- supported by a series of short stories, based on hearsay reports from unidentified people a couple of thousand years ago. This is your base - which you use as a prop! 👎  https://t.co/FpHpt9tL1w
1343125725147086849 2020-12-27 17:25:01 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> And Kate Carnell leads the charge! 🤮
1343125081925402624 2020-12-27 17:22:28 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> You’d be dead right !
1343124988300152838 2020-12-27 17:22:05 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> I don’t want to go anywhere near that !
1343124469624147968 2020-12-27 17:20:02 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> I think Gladys &amp; Morrison have that market cornered!
1343121081310224385 2020-12-27 17:06:34 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Ditto me ! ✋🏼😇
1343102571968262144 2020-12-27 15:53:01 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Another option is to hire an acro-prop ( a wind up vertical jacking thing) - no idea what they cost to rent - a phone call will tell you/ the issue is delivery unless you can have someone collect it ! Coates Hire or similar will have them- they are height adjustable . 👍🏽
1343101203081621504 2020-12-27 15:47:35 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Maybe $15/20 ? Guessing ! As few knots as possible - &amp; away from the edges as much as possible . Temporary fix- but treated with care should do the trick ! Good luck &amp; best wishes . 👍🏽
1343090497728835584 2020-12-27 15:05:02 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Grant has the same defect in me as does Morrison ! Reflex action ? - mute or change channels!  !
1343087679651528707 2020-12-27 14:53:50 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Genius! Only an ROP “mind “ could stump that up!
1343087190524317696 2020-12-27 14:51:54 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> What about all that fantastic Tasmanian single malt ? “E” ? Or not ?
1343086305169719304 2020-12-27 14:48:23 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> If ever a face deserved to be repeatedly punched - this surely is it!
1343085696760737792 2020-12-27 14:45:58 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Measure the height to the correct place - get a stud (75x50) about a foot longer - push up under the dropped rafter ( bottom on the ground)- kick bottom towards  the wall until  the “dropped rafter is where it should be. The slight bend in the stud will hold the rafter in place.
1343073332812386305 2020-12-27 13:56:50 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> I doubt they would care even if they did think about it! Unless it involves money &amp; how to get more of it !
1343069338635390978 2020-12-27 13:40:58 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Isn’t “he” a “she”? 🤷‍♀️

1341547763947905025 2020-12-23 08:54:46 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> 🐂💩
1341547028459913216 2020-12-23 08:51:50 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> No shit  Sherlock!
1341546557410213890 2020-12-23 08:49:58 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> In Morrison’s case-a horse’s arse !
1341435606828601346 2020-12-23 01:29:05 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Unless Trump &amp; his minions interfere with the Voting System again ?
1341434908464443393 2020-12-23 01:26:19 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> More likely enhanced in that  foetid field !
1341434697658724352 2020-12-23 01:25:29 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> At the very least a dishonourable Mention !
1341434465122361344 2020-12-23 01:24:33 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> So do I ! Right along with Michaelia Cash if that can be arranged!
1341432109248913408 2020-12-23 01:15:12 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> .
1341432105696292865 2020-12-23 01:15:11 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> From across the world - what an ignorant, dangerous  cretin you are !  You deserve the same fate as Trump- to be remembered with ignominy and ridicule !
1341431033418272770 2020-12-23 01:10:55 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> I’m sure help can be found ! 👍🏽✊🏻

1341429919528538113 2020-12-23 01:06:30 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Imagine ! A photograph of the Medusa!
1341429543467241472 2020-12-23 01:05:00 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> This has Morrison’s fingerprints all over it ! No sewer to vile for him to use to try to diminish Dan Andrews. On his best day, &amp; for as long as his Engadine Arse points South, Morrison will never be regarded in the same vein as people like Dan Andrews, &amp; Annastacia!
1341427622920654854 2020-12-23 00:57:22 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> The old “Lord” isn’t having a lot of wins lately! He must be pissed - can’t take a trick!
1341426414172553217 2020-12-23 00:52:34 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> His personal, travelling photographer, more &amp; more is catching the smug one, jaw thrust out, eerily reminiscent of how Mussolini was always pictured in WW2. The way Morrison is heading, he risks the same fate !
1341351124805173252 2020-12-22 19:53:23 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> 👍🏽🌹❤️
1341350912158134272 2020-12-22 19:52:33 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> He’ll have another Maccas Engadine incident !
1341349990950531072 2020-12-22 19:48:53 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> We do not want him here - or in New Zealand!
1341336399513960448 2020-12-22 18:54:53 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Farce writ large !
1341335874739392512 2020-12-22 18:52:48 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Ditto for me ! Bare feet- no hat- little leather bag A lunch if I was lucky - during the big strikes for the 48/44/40 hour weeks ( can’t remember dates now ) -day old bread for a penny - dripping with loads of pepper &amp; salt - sometimes nasturtium leaves if things were tight!
1341333815151583234 2020-12-22 18:44:36 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Please forgive my scepticism! - I simply do not believe anything Gladys says!

1341328364448059392 2020-12-22 18:22:57 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> We need a Law to make this sort of thing illegal ? We could call it “insider trading!” 🤷‍♀️
1341326755995373570 2020-12-22 18:16:33 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> “Nil Carborundum Bastardardum!” - (don’t let the bastards grind you down !) (my Latin is just a bit rusty!) 😁

1341322334959853570 2020-12-22 17:58:59 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Not so much “people!” - mainly Murdoch Journalists!

1341317096869830658 2020-12-22 17:38:11 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Bound to be Cabinet in Confidence ?
1341315524874006528 2020-12-22 17:31:56 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> ABC NEWS - Watching some simpering young female “journalist “, cheerfully telling us that people are so much better off this Christmas , because the Government’s support packages have allowed them “to increase their Savings!” - fuck me  - three quarters are young casual workers!
1341303501687648262 2020-12-22 16:44:09 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> No words adequate !
1341302996194357249 2020-12-22 16:42:09 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> The only certain way is an X Ray. If that’s not convenient, strap two together - but don’t obstruct blood flow . Watch closely for a week or so ?
1341301701886660611 2020-12-22 16:37:00 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Lovely story ! 👍🏽✊🏻

1341298213593075712 2020-12-22 16:23:08 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Strangely, he thinks he’s shit  hot ! He’s NOT !

1341294353289900033 2020-12-22 16:07:48 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> With a face like his, you’d think he’d welcome a mask !
1341293522679287808 2020-12-22 16:04:30 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Reversed shovel on the left ? 🤷‍♀️
1341276478537834496 2020-12-22 14:56:46 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Or gets a really well organised cremation ? I know my preference !
1341275641849606144 2020-12-22 14:53:27 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Is there ANYTHING he doesn’t shirk ?
1341274981188075520 2020-12-22 14:50:49 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> It certainly does have consequences ! Saves peoples lives- slows spread! What’s the down side ?
1341274565826080769 2020-12-22 14:49:10 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> You’re not !
1341273659311149058 2020-12-22 14:45:34 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> He’ll be remembered for many things none of them complimentary!

1341273059643121665 2020-12-22 14:43:11 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Perhaps you can  tell the IPA to go and practice self fertilisation ? 🤷‍♀️
1341259971007139840 2020-12-22 13:51:11 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Goes to character! She does not appear to have much . Nor Ethics either!

1341258203741310977 2020-12-22 13:44:09 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> I truly doubt even the LNP would even tolerate him. His speed is closer to ONP- Hanson, Latham &amp; Such ilk. His brain untroubled by neural activity !
1341253299278729217 2020-12-22 13:24:40 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Even for you Arthur , this is surely too low - even for you!

1334057171110174721 2020-12-02 16:49:49 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Pretty sure Pauline Hanson had a fair bit of influence in this tawdry business- so the LNP can  pencil in her votes in future Senate actions ! She’s been after the Family Court for years!

1333962414233042946 2020-12-02 10:33:18 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> My Christmas is looking wonderful. My elder Daughter wangled me out of my house last Saturday to “help  her select plants for our gardens”.- In my absence, all four Grandkids came to my house and completely decorated it - Tree and all . Whole family coming here Xmas day! 😥
1333960511373725696 2020-12-02 10:25:44 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Personally, I’m going to wait to  hear from somebody who actually knows the difference between  a debit  &amp; a credit - and that excludes our improbable Treasurer- who does not !

1333891747101900800 2020-12-02 05:52:29 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> The LNP have a very tenuous majority in the Reps. (In spite of the MSM headlines) - rall it needs is a couple of either decent or disgruntled MPs to swing it . Won’t be what’s necessary- but - 🤷‍♀️

1332794645856784384 2020-11-29 05:13:00 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Tents can be double anchored . Diagonal ropes over the top and big pegs can do much. I went through a cyclone in a new tent years ago in the Lamingtons- tent remained unmoved, but had been modified into a parallelogram by the wind &amp; rain. Still worked just fine. (Tent -Canadian,)

My puppy seems to paw at them rather than mouth or lick. Will watch.for a few more hours. 🤷‍♀️👍🏽
1332764656562278400 2020-11-29 03:13:50 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> A reasonable expectation ? Certainly ! If only we had a “reasonable” Government . - instead we have a  foetid, corrupt-, supporating , disgusting ,  incessantly lying, criminal gang posing as a “Government.”- Tim Wilson fits right in !

Suncorp, AAMI, Shannons &amp; others, are all under the Suncorp mantle, you will possibly get a far better deal from a not affiliated Insurer. Try some Brokers ? Or Choosi?
1331011723277438978 2020-11-24 07:08:18 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> She is absolutely correct ! Just doesn’t seem able or prepared to do something about it.
1331011082392006656 2020-11-24 07:05:45 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> I’m hopeful some light has landed on those afflicted fellow Queenslanders who slavishly read Murdoch’s bile &amp; voted for scum dwellers like Dutton &amp; Palmer &amp; Hanson.

1331007295686205441 2020-11-24 06:50:42 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> The idea is that the house does NOT have to be sold to fund retirement. It’s called Security !

1330991399941103617 2020-11-24 05:47:33 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> She was pretty blatant and not really apologetic when confronted! This on top of everything else? She should resign!
1330990721197752321 2020-11-24 05:44:51 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Certainly once, before the metastatic cancers of Murdoch and the IPA changed it for the worse. Only the ALP will repair this damage, probably assisted by the Greens and Independents. It will take a generation, and a lot of money and considerable courage and determination . ✊🏻

1330789467917991937 2020-11-23 16:25:08 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Jim Chalmers has the goods. I thought initially,  there may have been  a plan to switch to Jim Chalmers in early 2021. His recent greatly increased media exposure has not gone un-noticed .

1328850441581461504 2020-11-18 08:00:08 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Editorial independence is  the horse that bolted once Murdoch was set free by an Australian  Government! A very regrettable move !
1328849848196481024 2020-11-18 07:57:47 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Any man who did/does this should take his front teeth home in a brown paper bag ! ✊🏻

1328841495017705472 2020-11-18 07:24:35 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> It’s actually nowhere near as bad however, (because it’s an LNP State! )😳
1328841147473530880 2020-11-18 07:23:12 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> The Murdoch “ Flying Squad”- fully equipped - always prepared - run a rigorous schedule of recently frequented pubs, NRL Grounds, Ballet Schools - expensive secluded resorts- every where you’d expect our bludging, useless PM to hide! But a Ballet School? For this bag of lard ? 🤷‍♀️

1328806510802083840 2020-11-18 05:05:34 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> We here in Australia can hardly throw rocks at the state of Government in USA- given we have the worst &amp; most corrupt bunch since Federation! Half the Australian contingent should certainly be in Jail, and their assets seized as proceeds of crime seized!
1328805462611877888 2020-11-18 05:01:24 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Everything about this fellow reeks of exactly why we need a big hose through Media in Australia! Murdoch in particularis unsalvageable, and needs to be flushed into oblivion!
1328803120219004929 2020-11-18 04:52:06 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Not so much fun for Joe Biden, trying to hose out the toilet!

1328800563996151808 2020-11-18 04:41:57 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Your job at any given time does not define you. I went from Managing a British  Bank in Queensland to driving a Taxi on night shift. I can guarantee which was the more interesting !

1328607854060834817 2020-11-17 15:56:11 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> We’ll need a panel of top line Commissioners, and a budget to accomodate- and a Ministry for Royal Commissions!
1328606121125351424 2020-11-17 15:49:18 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> I am struggling to grasp this! Terry McCrann being an actual Journalist? /Shakes head - goes to get a hot cuppa. Unbelievable!

1328127802453889025 2020-11-16 08:08:38 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Getting the present Federal ”Government “ involved, seems a sure fire way to totally stuff it Up! The States actually work &amp; communicate  with each other (mostly)- they sorted the issues IN SPITE of disruptive Federal efforts !

1327869557659168768 2020-11-15 15:02:27 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Morrison’s idea of decency &amp; fair play is like the Queensbury Rules! No hitting below the belt! In the LNP version, the “belt” is worn loosely around the ankles !

Maybe a plan to correct over time?

1327034468612259840 2020-11-13 07:44:07 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Every time they stick their head over the parapet, they get a big knuckle sandwich ! ✊🏻

1327032617095479297 2020-11-13 07:36:45 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Trump’s obvious path forward, is a long walk on a short pier !
1327029761038721025 2020-11-13 07:25:24 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Maybe just a bit harsh ?
1327028642694586368 2020-11-13 07:20:58 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> It’d still  contain Trump! He’d need a single lane road to fit through !

1326731918138765312 2020-11-12 11:41:53 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Couldn’t be more graft could it? $1.1m to Crosby Textor- &amp; maybe a lot of it flicked back to the LNP as a “donation!” ? Surely not ?
1326730959463444482 2020-11-12 11:38:04 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> This is fantastic, and might well change my jaundiced view of the Greens following their actions in the Rudd: Gillard years. The elephant  still unremarked, is the refusal of Albanese  to be part of it! Yet another bad decision IMO.
1326726712189616128 2020-11-12 11:21:12 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Extremely unlikely I’d venture ! !

1326720323702542336 2020-11-12 10:55:49 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Needs lots of courage &amp; a safe fall back option !

1325934306053664768 2020-11-10 06:52:27 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Not sure Permission was granted as some sort of Policy - but In the period 1965/1990 , in Banking, Finance, &amp; Law, (I can’t comment on other areas) - visible behaviour was little different. It was not “encouraged “ - just wilfully ignored . The same thing really !

1325718632211476480 2020-11-09 16:35:27 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> In a failed Economy, this will result in hundreds of family disintegrations, as desperate people borrow money they can’t afford, just to pay their rent or mortgage, and feed themselves and their children. There will be bankruptcies, and suicides. Families will be destroyed!

1325606835127136256 2020-11-09 09:11:12 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> The very idea of an Australian LNP “Think Tank” thinking it can speak for “Working Class” people in USA is fatuous crap! The piece is a cheap shot even Menzies would avoid! That it is later echoed by PVO adds to the verbal diahorrea!

1325604703011368961 2020-11-09 09:02:44 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> ABC NEWS- Listening  again to ABCNews (Joe O’Brien) - talking about a big  blue water yacht race , called “The Everest of the Sea” - statement made that it runs for 45,000 “Nautical Kilometers!”- my question is , is the actually such a thing as “Nautical Kilometers?”🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️

1325379744376909825 2020-11-08 18:08:50 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> I think most of the groundwork is carried out in the home. I’ve known lots of kids going to expensive Private schools. In the main, they came out largely as they went in.

1325378225875214336 2020-11-08 18:02:48 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Try having a hundred of the bloody things descend on an eight metre diameter vegetable plot, you’ve spent twelve months developing, &amp; watch them chew it to the ground! If I’d had a shotgun, I’d have cheerfully shot the lot!
1325374276321472512 2020-11-08 17:47:06 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> He’s a serial disrupter! If he can’t keep his job, he’ll try to destroy everything he can on the journey out !
1325373779594235904 2020-11-08 17:45:07 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Which was then about ten times the wage a normal , working Tradie could expect?
1325371057314828288 2020-11-08 17:34:18 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Fortunately, it was another of SmugMo’s “Announcements!” - Zero chance of any actual money moving , unless it’s heading into one of Angus’ Cayman accounts, or the Barrier Reef Authority, or Hill Song, or Stuart Robert’s slush funds, or Barnaby’s Pilliga land investments, or - - -

1324982474921844736 2020-11-07 15:50:13 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> There’s a better than average chance Biden will quickly categorise SmugMo as less than  of front row importance!

1318668282895847424 2020-10-21 05:39:52 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Frydenberg himself causes a mental health problem- for ME - every time the useless prick bobs up on my television !
1318667240355450880 2020-10-21 05:35:44 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> Coorey is these days constantly confirming he is Owned by the loopy LNP. Just a waste of print and oxygen!
1318666444729577473 2020-10-21 05:32:34 +0800 <jchimselfbigpo2> So Annabelle Crab maintains her ever classy stance in supporting anything LNP!
