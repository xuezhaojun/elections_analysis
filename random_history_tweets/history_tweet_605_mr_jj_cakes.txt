1331796402297470976 2020-11-26 11:06:20 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> My dentist noticed and I said that it just might have something to do with the current massive stress about everything.😁👏👏
1331788749668196352 2020-11-26 10:35:56 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Point and laugh. They seem to enjoy persecution. Help them out.

1331378297142329345 2020-11-25 07:24:56 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> This is to keep sowing doubt.  Already went from 80% repubs believed election legit to 60 something now.  Tell a lie often enough....  This is dangerous.

1331339775404511233 2020-11-25 04:51:52 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> We will need to seize every asset he has.
1331071730887000064 2020-11-24 11:06:45 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Well masking up would still seem wise in that situation.
1331069320235925505 2020-11-24 10:57:10 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Our lesson is they have done not “right” or normal.  Watch for the sucker punch.
1331067218151370753 2020-11-24 10:48:49 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> We clearly have a lot of shaming to do.
1331066643435274243 2020-11-24 10:46:32 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Seriously, she needs that purse.  - that is a tasty beverage  https://t.co/QvMHSuoTkc
1331065398888828930 2020-11-24 10:41:35 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Not if you are in a tent. That is people in a smaller confined space with lots of shared air breathing.   Large space with lots of air circulation and few people is better.  I’ll be doing face-time thanksgiving. It’ll be fine. Not the same, but fine.
1331061850159542274 2020-11-24 10:27:29 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Well Sh*t. Building up the immune system is going to help a lot and I see others have given you the right items to send.  Hoping she got a small dose viral load and has a easy time till recovery. Best of luck to you all ❤️💪
1331055288540033025 2020-11-24 10:01:25 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Should be able to see him well on multiple monitors from the security desk at the prison I would think.
1331035455924576258 2020-11-24 08:42:36 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Monday is the new Friday🍸
1331034166255763457 2020-11-24 08:37:29 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> So when will we get the rural diner perspective on the Biden win, again?  I’m looking at you corporate media👀
1331029587799666688 2020-11-24 08:19:17 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Agree. Good time for a reminder: you NEVER get everything you want.  Perfect isn’t a thing.  Where you feel there are issues, call lawmakers and speak up to gain support pressure. Enough pressure and things happen.  Now we can get on to the real work! #BidenHarris2020
1331027645987844099 2020-11-24 08:11:34 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> My bet here is some crazy numerology based theories on the 16 days this took to happen are about to bloom.

1330954086359867392 2020-11-24 03:19:16 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> I’ve read that sociopaths are about 1 % in any given population.  In business world populations, CEO’s who are sociopaths runs 3%. History has many tales of super rich going/being crazy. Howard Hughes, Michael Jackson...

1330688584764911616 2020-11-23 09:44:16 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> And like their “comedy”, it isn’t funny.
1330676733197000706 2020-11-23 08:57:10 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Ahh, thought it was “Why don’t we do it in the road”.  This is better.

1328417063979732994 2020-11-17 03:18:03 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> THIS is the problem. All the time “oh, we have been very careful”, followed by a list of non-essential places they just went.   And these are people who DO believe it is real.

1328103006957576194 2020-11-16 06:30:06 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Feels weird, think I’ll go take a shower.
1328100209327448064 2020-11-16 06:18:59 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> True. But this “not that into politics” problem has been with us for decades and this was the most votes cast ever. So little by little we are getting better.  Expect climate change will be a factor.  This time with this prez it is hard to fathom how so many didn’t get the memo.
1328097069412671489 2020-11-16 06:06:30 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Thank you. I’ve been trying to point this out as well.   Numbers matter.

1325897312908894209 2020-11-10 04:25:28 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Gotta say, she would have much more power and impact as the new “lioness” of the Senate if we can take it.
1325894840144457734 2020-11-10 04:15:38 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Agree. I believe asset seizure is going to play a big role but yes, there is a massive amount of lost money from this four years of fascism.

1325637500891664388 2020-11-09 11:13:04 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> That could be the best scenario and seems highly probably but these folks are actively devious. Worried.
1325635135862005765 2020-11-09 11:03:40 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Q thinks it is so that proves you point but seems worse.
1325634837756014592 2020-11-09 11:02:29 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Sadly they regularly violate all kinds of rule/laws/common sense with no repercussions.

1325631892385718276 2020-11-09 10:50:46 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yep.  This is when he uses his Svengali hold on the cultist to start violence.   Election is over. We need to legally stop these rallies.

1325292510722232320 2020-11-08 12:22:11 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> So if Four Seasons Landscaping did the rose garden “makeover” and got stiffed, maybe the press conference in the parking lot was part of the payback. We know the campaign is low on cash.🤣

1325243735429455872 2020-11-08 09:08:23 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Apparently it was part of the deal made when they did the rose garden “makeover” on credit.

1325188859546624004 2020-11-08 05:30:19 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yep. This is a very dangerous time now. He owes somebody a bunch of money. And nobody gets to quit the mob.
1325188032245346305 2020-11-08 05:27:02 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Really? Awesome! Think I’ll get one for each niece.  Is Ost partying?
1325186098281148417 2020-11-08 05:19:21 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yep. And we are going to find out all the ways they did.🗽
1325185278194036737 2020-11-08 05:16:05 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> They are who we said they were.
1325185168743657472 2020-11-08 05:15:39 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Idea for corporate media.   Interview some children in cages to see if they have any grievances.
1325182320597299206 2020-11-08 05:04:20 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Well that there just brought out some joy tears!❤️✌️

1325168285202042881 2020-11-08 04:08:34 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Too long. We need a white hot spotlight on everything they do from now to Jan 20.
1325167464003506179 2020-11-08 04:05:18 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Right back at you! You have been a rock of passion and love and I thank you.  Now let’s get back to work✌️😁🎉🏅❤️💪  Well, maybe tomorrow🍰🤣
1325139877671755778 2020-11-08 02:15:41 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Isn’t gone yet and he owes somebody a lot of money.  Danger is now at the highest.
1325127152803565570 2020-11-08 01:25:07 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> BoxO is pretty good.  Going with tequila because we will now get those tasty taco trucks!  Congrats to us all! #BidenHarris  #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
1325121106424913921 2020-11-08 01:01:05 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> And then the unveiling of the healthcare plan.
1324928966369505281 2020-11-07 12:17:36 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> that cat be trippin
1324927287599407104 2020-11-07 12:10:55 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> boom! Love it.😆
1324916400448655360 2020-11-07 11:27:40 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Tucker is going for the next new populist prez spot. Laying the propaganda ground work.
1324914225672720384 2020-11-07 11:19:01 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Wow, he really has a fear of ramps now.
1324878223402913792 2020-11-07 08:55:58 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> yep. people going for big jail time.
1324828329300512769 2020-11-07 05:37:42 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Might just print this tweet out and put it on the fridge.😁
1324827511914520576 2020-11-07 05:34:27 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> And don’t forget the “tax cut” for the rich payback starts due next year on the backs of the middle class. And Dems will get the blame. Surprise!
1324819403175723008 2020-11-07 05:02:14 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Well some of them I assume, are good at getting covfefe.
1324813993697964034 2020-11-07 04:40:44 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Let’s ask the kids in cages.
1324813800458002434 2020-11-07 04:39:58 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Do they need help packing up? That might cheer them up.   With 75 million volunteers we should be done by 4, start of happy hour!
1324808138676084741 2020-11-07 04:17:28 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Fyi to all - FB still makes money off you until you hard close your account.   Dry up that money hose.
1324783422003273728 2020-11-07 02:39:15 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> I’m feeling proud of you and all those who worked so hard.  AND feeling grateful for that massive effort.  Joyful to see the chance again to start fixing so many problems.  Lastly, respect off the charts! Thank you good sir. 🥇🎉✌️
1324768006321270785 2020-11-07 01:38:00 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Oh snap! Winner!🥂
1324767417214459904 2020-11-07 01:35:39 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Correct. Let the great shunning begin.  Maga, welcome to pariah town  https://t.co/A8s1iblfd1
1324540110084296709 2020-11-06 10:32:25 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> And a quick shift to being fiscally “concerned” again.

1324196288989065218 2020-11-05 11:46:12 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> I assumed he was there to start striking the set. Show has been closed!
1324167096423444481 2020-11-05 09:50:12 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Assessing the work ahead. Undoing the damage, deprogramming, covid, climate etc.  Glad that we will be able to start making progress again.  Hard work builds us up. All has to be done but we can do it.💪❤️
1324163961776869376 2020-11-05 09:37:44 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yep. And the many investigations might reveal some Senators might have had too close of a Russian relationship...  This is a dirty bunch.
1324162585973809152 2020-11-05 09:32:16 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> There was never any doubt.
1324160841973866497 2020-11-05 09:25:21 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Sorry about that loud stupid 4year party and thanks for not calling the cops.
1324159911031287808 2020-11-05 09:21:39 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Warming up the car.
1324150691007324161 2020-11-05 08:45:00 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> yep
1324148521688162304 2020-11-05 08:36:23 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Better to be the one throwing someone under the bus....
1324148246361436160 2020-11-05 08:35:18 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Oh but they will.
1324148098193481729 2020-11-05 08:34:42 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> boom!
1324147970510520321 2020-11-05 08:34:12 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Oddly enough, I am Spartacus!
1324144987370516480 2020-11-05 08:22:21 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Nah, they throw the Rino label at the drop of a hat.   This will make them hate fox for several hours. Then back into the arms of the rage cult.
1324144065416372226 2020-11-05 08:18:41 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> When the Karens become self-aware.
1324123294266634241 2020-11-05 06:56:09 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Looks like might go to run-off.
1324121032421113856 2020-11-05 06:47:09 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Throw in FB and clear channel and let’s get to work.
1324120573861978114 2020-11-05 06:45:20 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Add “owning the libs”. They have some real psychological problems, just wanting to cause cruelty.
1324115584280268800 2020-11-05 06:25:30 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> But don’t they usually like to get paid? Could be a difficult job search.🤣
1324115177885741058 2020-11-05 06:23:53 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Dictators do that though. Keep your eyes open.
1324114670978883584 2020-11-05 06:21:53 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Looking forward to a C-span ‘trump family crimes commission’ dedicated channel.🍰

1324107111266054144 2020-11-05 05:51:50 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Sorry,  no the bot you mentioned.

1324043392163090432 2020-11-05 01:38:38 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Not wrong but if you talk to foxers, they are not told any of this and so are not aware/don’t believe when told. Then throw in the allowance to hate “the other” and the brainwash is complete. This is a chunk of it.  Need to build a media equivalent to counter fox-rush-facebook.
1323829805167509504 2020-11-04 11:29:55 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> The 300,000 postal service ballots not delivered....that’s Florida. Legal stuff starts tomorrow.

1323762466988335105 2020-11-04 07:02:21 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Well done Dad!
1323761399613460482 2020-11-04 06:58:06 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Believe me, I remember the feeling in 2016. I’m a pessimist by nature so I’m hoping to be pleasantly surprised but ready for the corruption to take over.  Will say Twitlers mood/responses today seem unusual for him. Which could be a clue to ??????  - Curmudgeon ready to dance
1323759251580350465 2020-11-04 06:49:34 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> The Trump administration has a dirty little secret: It’s not just planning to increase taxes on most Americans. The increase has already been signed, sealed and delivered, buried in the pages of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   https://t.co/zU5gEgZ1ZO
1323711720792076288 2020-11-04 03:40:42 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> And Thursday nights are Goulash at the Gulag. Tasty.😋🍽🥂

1323683994957869057 2020-11-04 01:50:31 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yes, thought I remember that as well.
1323681098191138816 2020-11-04 01:39:01 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> fyi
1323489324810133505 2020-11-03 12:56:58 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Thank you.
1323488319762690049 2020-11-03 12:52:59 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> And find out who ordered it and approved and where is the money coming from.

1323485510245834752 2020-11-03 12:41:49 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Love the way that sounds!
1323485244268322816 2020-11-03 12:40:46 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Seems like that should be a forfeit.....

You get the gist of it. #Covidiots
1323363207063351296 2020-11-03 04:35:50 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> THIS is what I was hoping for. Thank you!  No one will accuse this folks of being smart and anyway they love pulling on bootstraps. Hope they remembered to bring em.
1323362319565348865 2020-11-03 04:32:18 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Get this info out there. You know this will be used to cudgel Biden.  Americans; this tax INCREASE is already coming.  Vote accordingly. #BidenHarris2020
1323361728415948800 2020-11-03 04:29:57 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Right our of the 30’s Germany playbook.   Again.
1323056881254895616 2020-11-02 08:18:36 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> They ate deep staters trying to help him lose.  Yep. That has to be it.

1322294007628640259 2020-10-31 05:47:13 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> So now he is pushing for a non-profit healthcare system like the rest of the world? Sounds like he turned socialist on you magats.

1322000422303756289 2020-10-30 10:20:36 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Seems the right thing to do if as it looks is to nullify Butler county votes across the board. That will cut down on the cheating.  Like whole police departments having to pay for legal fines because of a few bad apples. You start to see the blue line fadeout.
1321986598263685121 2020-10-30 09:25:41 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yep. This has been the plan.
1321969249737338881 2020-10-30 08:16:44 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Well still could be but the Nevada man case, April with one strain then June with another isn’t. Hospitalized on the second case.
1321962832880050177 2020-10-30 07:51:14 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Sweet!
1321949141392519168 2020-10-30 06:56:50 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> True. Not just the US though. Authoritarian playbook has been studied well and it plays about the same, every time and place. Roughly 30% of any given population that is drawn to authoritarian can be used for populist power by scapegoating “others”. #VOTE
1321916016746622976 2020-10-30 04:45:13 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yes, that look. It has power. Difficult to resist, even with “supposed to be dieting” cats. 😁
1321912707876974592 2020-10-30 04:32:04 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Surprise! The personal responsibility crowd blames someone else!
1321912297925701632 2020-10-30 04:30:26 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Lemmings.
1321893573424377857 2020-10-30 03:16:02 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Agree. I believe most of the planning started because of civil rights movement/Dixiecrat swap, over racial resentment.  Book author is/was fox employee. High tech operation using science to addict viewers. Scary. But they know what they do. Pure propaganda.
1321865688990928896 2020-10-30 01:25:13 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yep. This was a plan from the 80s. (originally pitched as GOP TV) Regan ending fairness doctrine was done to build this. And then all small town AM radio started Rush non-stop. Read ‘Foxocracy’ they use psychology to hook you.  Pure propaganda.  Irrational anger at “the other”.
1321865174203068421 2020-10-30 01:23:11 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> The Rush/Fox propaganda networks have been frighteningly effective. Would not have believed it if I had not witnessed this.  But here we are.
1321859583095185408 2020-10-30 01:00:58 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yep. Overlay that timeline. That is when this started and was a plan from the 80s. (originally pitched as GOP TV) Regan ending fairness doctrine was done to build this.  Read Foxocracy. Explains how they use psychology to hook you. Irrational anger at “the other”.
1321649092523552770 2020-10-29 11:04:33 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> They will.  #ItsACult
1321631734732001280 2020-10-29 09:55:34 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Thank you to the whistleblower who leaked this actual footage.
1321626978303188992 2020-10-29 09:36:40 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> While they continue with the plan of doing nothing.
1321607262763245568 2020-10-29 08:18:20 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> To be safe PA, IF YOU STILL HAVE YOUR BALLOT DROP IT OFF!  (not shouting, just indicating importance 😁)
1321606743164547072 2020-10-29 08:16:16 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Thank you!
1321589314803757056 2020-10-29 07:07:01 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yes, this is being reported by dentists all over the country. NYT or WaPo had a story on it recently.  Makes sense.
1321582816371511296 2020-10-29 06:41:11 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> It’s a start. Now let’s step on the gas!  VOTE.  Did already? Help get never voted/new voters to vote. #BidenHarris2020
1321557118009266178 2020-10-29 04:59:04 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Good. Not good enough.  Time to step on the gas!  VOTE!  Then help others to vote.
1321553360529498112 2020-10-29 04:44:09 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Government (Blackburn) retaliating against you for your critical speech against them.  MAGA; THIS is what the 1st Amendment IS FOR.  Real world/realtime example.   Learn from it.
1321551153608364032 2020-10-29 04:35:22 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Because he (and Miller) learned that the disease hit communities of color harder.
1321526972657225728 2020-10-29 02:59:17 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Eat the food you ordered. It’s who they are.
1321288761909628928 2020-10-28 11:12:43 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Some people are just born with it.😁
1321273440481865728 2020-10-28 10:11:50 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> East and West.
1321236010370359298 2020-10-28 07:43:06 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Recusal.
1321233509881556994 2020-10-28 07:33:10 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Call me crazy but that seems like a tell.  And something that should be illegal.
1321231986271244288 2020-10-28 07:27:07 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> It’s on the right. #VoteThemOut #BidenHarris2020
1321229190327267329 2020-10-28 07:16:00 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> During a campaign rally no less. Dictator checklist is full.
1321228403815534592 2020-10-28 07:12:53 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> And after not being investigated by the Obama administration.  But we knew this. Lots-o-blood on his hands.
1321227480691134464 2020-10-28 07:09:13 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> I think you could make the case for his needed recusal if that happens. Not that he would.
1321210271830929409 2020-10-28 06:00:50 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> So good to hear that. Hope your quarantine ends without incident as well. 👍
1321206250659409920 2020-10-28 05:44:51 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> This story needs much more spotlight.  MAGA: we told you he was robbing you. Now turn your anger at being conned by him, to voting Joe.  Has to be at least three or four of you out there.
1320886456571682816 2020-10-27 08:34:06 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Thank you. Helpful distinction.
1320866969214545920 2020-10-27 07:16:40 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Note to future USA: Impeached Prez cannot run again.
1320806282257788929 2020-10-27 03:15:31 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> So sorry. Thank you for being one of the helpers.❤️
1320805082867269633 2020-10-27 03:10:45 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Well who knew that the five people in the overlapping circles of BLM AND Communists had arson in mind. Sheeezz.  Sorry but I don’t think she is going to come around. Propaganda/fox/rush is some powerful sh*t.
1320803192699981824 2020-10-27 03:03:15 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Agree.
1320800127389372416 2020-10-27 02:51:04 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Please let us start treating them like Typhoid Mary, pariahs. If you haven’t figured it out from March till now, you are a danger to society. Jail time is what we have for dangers to society.
1320798094317875200 2020-10-27 02:42:59 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> And NO hesitation. Loved it.
1320782862291927040 2020-10-27 01:42:27 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> bingo
1320778912331223042 2020-10-27 01:26:46 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Respect. You have mine!
1320563103235334144 2020-10-26 11:09:13 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Wonderful!
1320560511692328966 2020-10-26 10:58:55 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> disinfo bot there. Reported it.
1320544891147931648 2020-10-26 09:56:51 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> There will be an airing of grievances!
1320537740274880517 2020-10-26 09:28:26 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> The mask is almost life-like.
1320535259507687424 2020-10-26 09:18:34 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yep.
1320521584025636864 2020-10-26 08:24:14 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Ah still going with the traitor and mob wife costumes. Sticking with the classics.  The Melania mask is almost life like.   Creepy.
1320490555164352512 2020-10-26 06:20:56 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Big time yes.  Tired of staying home doing the right thing. Let’s do this.
1320489762168295424 2020-10-26 06:17:47 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Ok, my voting line sucked. This is joyous!
1320108187672981505 2020-10-25 05:01:33 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> do it
1320104964027416576 2020-10-25 04:48:44 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Thanks. Yep, that is a disinfo bot. Reported.
1320070036787130368 2020-10-25 02:29:57 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Love that! Thank you!
1319840273925455872 2020-10-24 11:16:57 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Nice. 747 was brand new and huge!
1319829520765964288 2020-10-24 10:34:13 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> High speed network lethargy IS his superpower.
1319825765551149056 2020-10-24 10:19:18 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Thanks!  Betting the lock-down helped get this variety together. Love St. Vincent. Will check it out.
1319819313960738817 2020-10-24 09:53:40 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Many of us appreciate it. Sadly that should be “all” of us. Thanks.
1319813878344134656 2020-10-24 09:32:04 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Excellent Friday eve song. I only have Fashion Nugget. Will have to dig into their other work. Struck how he sounds like a happier Lou Reed.😆
1319806664002867200 2020-10-24 09:03:24 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> I think he was supposed to drop in product placement for his mr. pillow benefactor. Quid pro style. He f’ed that up too.
1319806112707735553 2020-10-24 09:01:12 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Oddly I think I could watch years of C-Span live investigation committees.
1319805703377154048 2020-10-24 08:59:35 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Eww. That is bathroom time now panic face.
1319803530761236480 2020-10-24 08:50:57 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Big fan of The Decembrists. Hell, The Crane Wife album is one long story.  Last album has a song I will not say your name   https://t.co/8b9mXPrPqK  Oh and Everything is Awful. Not fans of twitler.
1319801967460245505 2020-10-24 08:44:44 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Runner up was Bad Bad Leroy Brown
1319799354857672705 2020-10-24 08:34:21 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yes, too much. Leave out sphincter mouthed.  Hasn’t been scientifically verified yet.
1319798166502264832 2020-10-24 08:29:38 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> The Night Chicago Died.  Brother what a night it really was.
1319796648587874304 2020-10-24 08:23:36 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> BS
1319793797899771904 2020-10-24 08:12:16 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Nah, they all had eyes wide open. Faustian bargain. Still wanting to use him for their ends.
1319728005187465217 2020-10-24 03:50:50 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Second
1319726910646013953 2020-10-24 03:46:29 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yep. Even the Nazi haircut for the tribe.
1319453317760626688 2020-10-23 09:39:19 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yes loved that one!
1319452906374926336 2020-10-23 09:37:41 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> #Krakatoa gonna blow!
1319426813043486721 2020-10-23 07:54:00 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> I’m going with projection on this one.  It really is all they have.
1319390980911452160 2020-10-23 05:31:37 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> yep
1319368823791734784 2020-10-23 04:03:34 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> got it.
1319368636503486465 2020-10-23 04:02:50 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> What could possibly go wrong?
1319366869720027136 2020-10-23 03:55:49 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Getting their people in the spots to provide cover again.
1319318568823996416 2020-10-23 00:43:53 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> yep
1319295608675389440 2020-10-22 23:12:39 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> “Prosperity Gospel”.   Yeah, that’s a thing. -smh
1319076704833339393 2020-10-22 08:42:48 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Que the Orwell 1984 quote.
1319075969978658816 2020-10-22 08:39:53 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Worse. This is the trail they are laying to set up election court battle.
1319002276090900481 2020-10-22 03:47:03 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Press them on it. Uncomfortable but could start to make them think.
1319001824272150528 2020-10-22 03:45:15 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Agree but I would strike one for smaller gov and end the DHS. It has always been not needed and a problem. “Homeland?.?”
1318981263735152640 2020-10-22 02:23:33 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> The disinformation propaganda networks are not paid to present damaging news.  Bet fox isn’t talking China account at all.
1318980031750680576 2020-10-22 02:18:39 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Wait...he is financially supporting a communist regime?  “America Second”
1318978920700522496 2020-10-22 02:14:14 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> So America second.  And financially supporting a communist regime.......not a good look.
1318978041175969792 2020-10-22 02:10:45 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yep.
1318975908993064960 2020-10-22 02:02:16 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Not her sect.   She is one of the other 2500 christianity versions so she will ignore with “the Pope isn’t a real christian”.
1318739430509744128 2020-10-21 10:22:35 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> They are told what to be angry at.   And so they are.  Thought process is not invoked, only emotion.
1318738617775185921 2020-10-21 10:19:22 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Hoping there will be a c-span channel just for televising hearings/court proceedings for this whole cabal. I will watch the sh*t out of that.
1318735579429793793 2020-10-21 10:07:17 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Looks like he didn’t get a head of lettuce and carrots today.
1318733489227718657 2020-10-21 09:58:59 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Or the only one willing to hold the sign for $20.
1318694592909176834 2020-10-21 07:24:25 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Pics or it didn’t happen.
1318686982176788485 2020-10-21 06:54:11 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Sadists. Cruelty IS the point.  And they walk among us.
1318394900224765956 2020-10-20 11:33:33 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Henrietta but we called her Hank. Heard she got addicted to huffin bowling shoe spray.  That probably hasn’t helped her voice.
1318393283802849281 2020-10-20 11:27:08 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> It is a Wall Street Journal opinion piece that you could send the link to or make a copy of the text into the email.
1318364501360537600 2020-10-20 09:32:45 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> But projection is thriving!
1318355215070814208 2020-10-20 08:55:51 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> ❤️💪Best of luck Jeff!
1318342035431043074 2020-10-20 08:03:29 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Did. #BidenHarris2020
1318341389281763328 2020-10-20 08:00:55 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Been asking that for about a week now.
1318337636734357504 2020-10-20 07:46:00 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Wow. Creationist think tank. How is that a thing?   Creationist is the definition of don’t think, just regurgitate the dogma.  How do they have a tank and what do they think about?  Like, “I think I’d like soup for lunch”?
1318257517751726080 2020-10-20 02:27:38 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Got it. Reported.
1318250837592788992 2020-10-20 02:01:06 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> And then help others to vote!  Time to go big! #BidenHarris2020
1318020435863166976 2020-10-19 10:45:34 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yep. Oh and Hunter isn’t running for office.
1318016549811179521 2020-10-19 10:30:07 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yep. He knew.   Occam’s razor
1317985695898595333 2020-10-19 08:27:31 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> They are very dim.
1317933806460887040 2020-10-19 05:01:20 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> This is my suspicion as well. Not everyone gets out alive but some spend a month intubated.
1317917774279106560 2020-10-19 03:57:37 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Remembering a simpler time when these folks would just stick forks in toasters.
1317915430820827136 2020-10-19 03:48:19 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Now that is how to do it!  Good on you American. #BidenHarris2020
1317908838255710208 2020-10-19 03:22:07 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Good times.
1317907872181751808 2020-10-19 03:18:16 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Oh no. Not on a puffy shirt I hope.
1317906312039075840 2020-10-19 03:12:04 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Awesome!  Now let’s all do more to help people vote. No letting up. Get fired up, get others fired up.  This is great but time to really hit the gas! #VoteBidenHarris  #BidenHarris2020
1317901428648636416 2020-10-19 02:52:40 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Voted two weeks ago and Hillary wasn’t even on my ballot? Weird right?
1317898936498102272 2020-10-19 02:42:46 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> When animatronic presidents escape and the software is lil glitchy. #FullBodySpasm
1317897450737201153 2020-10-19 02:36:52 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Thank you American. Peace , good health to you and yours.
1317896970631966721 2020-10-19 02:34:57 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Now that IS personal responsibility. Good on you. Never stop growing.  Thank you.  PS help get others to vote too!
1317893105023033345 2020-10-19 02:19:36 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Making license plates is honest work and they won’t even check your references.😬
1317873628269006848 2020-10-19 01:02:12 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> And dangerous.
1317870832916389888 2020-10-19 00:51:06 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Happy Bday Hayden!🎂🍕🎃
1317864576948473856 2020-10-19 00:26:14 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Thank you. Needed this.🙂
1317864216678735873 2020-10-19 00:24:48 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yeah, this was very sad. Good man vs. violent crazies.
1317863263627931650 2020-10-19 00:21:01 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> So looks like Q lied about JFK Jr (deceased) replacing Pence yesterday. Surprise!  Critical think time: so Q was lying to me?   Will you take personal responsibility and start to question why Q is lying to you?  Of course you won’t because leaving a cult is hard.  And “reasons”.
1317860238343589889 2020-10-19 00:09:00 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> And new voters matter too!  If you already voted, help others to vote.  We can do this. #VoteThemAllOut  #BidenHarris2020Landslide

1308504321756069888 2020-09-23 04:31:55 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> We are at the point that some penalty(s) should be enacted. Not at the point of repeating what we all know.  Again.  So safe to say, nothing will happen to him.  Again.
1308207556863483905 2020-09-22 08:52:41 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Bravo! Thank you!  People, feel energized and engage! One by one.   Start with people who have never voted. Much easier to sway and a whole lot of them.
1308204073175248896 2020-09-22 08:38:50 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> They probably didn’t like him lying and still getting confirmed.   Probably it.
1308106964400914433 2020-09-22 02:12:58 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Non-voter is the huge chunk we need to work on. Folks not paying attention but not watching fox.  Reach out to 10 and teach them what is happening and help them register. Build participation pride and they will vote.  A few new voter percent could really build the wave.
1308041678553456641 2020-09-21 21:53:33 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Look at the beautiful morning! Good time to do some healthy blocking (It feels pretty good). 😁❤️
1307852838207455232 2020-09-21 09:23:10 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Exactly. Find new voters. Millions out there that just need a little help to get involved. I want a crushing.
1307852284127145984 2020-09-21 09:20:57 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Now that is some great neighbors! Wonderful. Thanks for sharing.
1307851576191586306 2020-09-21 09:18:09 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> So sorry for your loss. Awful amount of blood on twitlers hands.
1307347846815907840 2020-09-19 23:56:30 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yes. Outreach those around you. Many don’t follow politics. Give them a reason to care and help them to vote.   Tell them America needs them.
1307151056502104064 2020-09-19 10:54:32 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yep.  Mitch McConnell is a man without honor who should be forced to resign immediately.                         Pass it on.
1307053118123905026 2020-09-19 04:25:21 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Sounds sooooacurate! Might have sold the boat though.
1307045272032337920 2020-09-19 03:54:11 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Three. Years. Ago.  Then he jokingly threw a roll of paper towels at them.  They won’t be fooled.
1307020213905317888 2020-09-19 02:14:36 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> And he is a paid propagandist. He is ramping up anger in the magats.
1307019638056738816 2020-09-19 02:12:19 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Thank you. We have to stop pretending like this is mistaken ignorance.   This is on purpose and we are not the audience.
1307019257369165824 2020-09-19 02:10:48 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> He is speaking to the poorly educated.  Who will be angered.
1306787886172385281 2020-09-18 10:51:25 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> I now call it “uncommon sense”

1306730020522532866 2020-09-18 07:01:29 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> On it! @AZVetsForward
1306699733902094336 2020-09-18 05:01:08 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Would love to know. Could it be monetary fear of lost Red subscribers? Can’t be that many that read.  But twitler would denounce loudly and often any paper that would.

1306695253865295872 2020-09-18 04:43:20 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yes.  This is truly baffling. Not one?  Not too late to be first...WaPo, NYT.....anyone?
1306693845405450240 2020-09-18 04:37:44 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> This.

1305700364956569601 2020-09-15 10:50:00 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Picking winners and losers.  So now they’re back to liking that. Hmm.
1305693385311698946 2020-09-15 10:22:16 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> What could possibly go wrong? /s
1305670499335249921 2020-09-15 08:51:19 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> We watched.  He did.
1305652239625646080 2020-09-15 07:38:46 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Never seeing that money.
1305652005705101312 2020-09-15 07:37:50 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Litmus test: rooting for the Gov or the people in Belarus? You can already feel the hypocrisy from the 45 voters.  Guess they could surprise me and actual SAY the Gov.  Nah.
1305649049047949313 2020-09-15 07:26:05 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Many people are saying he is an incredible geneyass.
1305648628082515969 2020-09-15 07:24:25 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Soooo, the easy decision there was RETIRE.
1305629643920175105 2020-09-15 06:08:59 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Keep rolling these out till the election. With all the crime, I’m sure there are many. Expect turbulence.
1305628930892685313 2020-09-15 06:06:09 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Agree. Also think there is a percentage that has daddy/protector issues.  So, snowflakes. Because it’s always projection.
1305280938243284993 2020-09-14 07:03:21 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yikes! Hope for a full speedy recovery. If you are going tohave a stroke, that’s the place to do it.😉💪❤️

1304497303516925953 2020-09-12 03:09:28 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Glad you all got out. Hope the structures survive but you got the important stuff. Stay safe!
1304457774743519234 2020-09-12 00:32:23 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Skills! Well done.
1304457432450568192 2020-09-12 00:31:02 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> So classic, on brand.
1304219666605244416 2020-09-11 08:46:14 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Heavens Gate, Jim Jones......they always go all the way.  It’s a cult.  And a grave danger to Democracy.
1304181315365789697 2020-09-11 06:13:50 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> From wiki: 1 percent of the general population meets the clinical criteria for psychopathy. Figures of around 3–4% have been cited for more senior positions in business.
1304053455124799489 2020-09-10 21:45:46 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Hmm, any newspapers going to call for resignation?  Hello?  #ResignNowTrump #TrumpLiedAmericansDied
1303853265373638663 2020-09-10 08:30:17 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> You don’t leave the cult.
1303847474403008513 2020-09-10 08:07:16 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> THAT must have been why he was telling us about the murderous caravans. #PretendPresident #ResignNowTrump

1303844162609934336 2020-09-10 07:54:07 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Pretty sure I saw him at the state fair, a carney running the tilt-a-whirl.
1303766152619778048 2020-09-10 02:44:08 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> This is another of many that we hope can turn a percent here and another percent there. Hope these add to a tidal wave of blue voting.
1303758426787389440 2020-09-10 02:13:26 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> She did her job. Lay out the new “argument” the poorly educated will use now. Building on the disinformation talking points.  She is a propagandist.
1303756921539710976 2020-09-10 02:07:27 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> And there STILL is no plan other than let people die.

1303524681002049537 2020-09-09 10:44:36 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> I think many people are saying this. Could be something to it.
1303524236678504449 2020-09-09 10:42:50 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Good for him but you have to cold turkey no more propaganda. That emotional tweaking they do is how he GOT brainwashed. Gets better each day without. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

1303474173222645761 2020-09-09 07:23:54 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Clearly no one else does or will. Ever.
1303467351178788864 2020-09-09 06:56:48 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> That is how it works. She isn’t speaking to you and me. But the poorly educated will now routinely use this “argument”.  Mission accomplished.
1303413080441761792 2020-09-09 03:21:09 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> He did, court stopped the recount.
1302810848113516544 2020-09-07 11:28:05 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> If the propaganda system is remove the artificially inflated rage will dissipate with time.
1302806802447253512 2020-09-07 11:12:01 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> I’ve now watched this for about ten minutes.  Not done.

1302773029093535746 2020-09-07 08:57:49 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Agree. Time to evangelize to grow the user base. They are hurting.
1302760274005352449 2020-09-07 08:07:08 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Keep this idea rolling. This is helping Americans feel the pride of participation for the most important vote of our lives.  Goal of 10, only helped 3? That’s 3 more than 0.  Helped 10? Now try for 20.   Easy to do and very effective. Let’s build to a record # of voters!
1302754980928139270 2020-09-07 07:46:06 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Fox tv/Rush clear channel am (rural reach radio) was built to do this.  propaganda.  Anger and tribal identity works tweaking on emotion. Read Foxocracy for the high-tech way they do it.  Always heard, 1st thing when invading a country is to take over the media.  Yep.
1302729737442177024 2020-09-07 06:05:47 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yes this is different from years past. Really should be about 78 here today. Winter storm bringing a foot of snow Tuesday (which will help with the fires) but back to 70s by Friday. Crazy.  Hang on, stay cool.
1302721292173336576 2020-09-07 05:32:14 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Thanks to Finis Mitchell who packed in barrels of live trout back in the day.
1302717828869496832 2020-09-07 05:18:28 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Yes Sept is the best for that. Almost always a night freeze to take out the little monsters.  You did this at the right time, forecast Tuesday foot or more coming to the high country.  Love the Winds. Great pic, thanks for sharing.

1301621516887404546 2020-09-04 04:42:07 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> What could possibly go wrong?  And we all know already. This is a death sentence for many dimwits. And those will be the lucky ones.
1301344750709080064 2020-09-03 10:22:21 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Add it to the pile.

1301320657259487232 2020-09-03 08:46:36 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Has anyone actually seen his law degree? Sounding like that could be the problem.
1301315564816740357 2020-09-03 08:26:22 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> He knows. And as AG should.  Part of the act, like purposely stepping on your foot then saying “Oh I didn’t see you there”.
1300987592326877185 2020-09-02 10:43:07 +0800 <mr_jj_cakes> Or in this case, the nuclear football.
