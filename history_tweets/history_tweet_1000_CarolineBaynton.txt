1322495271725682689 2020-10-31 19:06:58 +0800 <CarolineBaynton> @DevonshireDanUK I'm interested in knowing about NHS Trusts advising staff to download track &amp; trace or NOT to in light of the fact that their terms &amp; conditions are generous.  If there is hospital capacity but not the staff to run it. Acquiring a positive test doesn't seem hard. Call me a cynic.

1320267152646131712 2020-10-25 15:33:13 +0800 <CarolineBaynton> @DevonshireDanUK 16 years ago I accompanied a young person to the Luton Army Recruitment offices. I had a few hours to explore the town centre. Tried a church, locked. Allah Akbar everywhere. Tried a shoe shop, a hardware store, I was ignored, couldn't get served, it felt totally alien &amp; hostile.

1310497291539820544 2020-09-28 16:31:16 +0800 <CarolineBaynton> Where these incidents occur the powers that be should consult their counterparts in Poland &amp; Hungary, see how their policies differ regarding protecting their citizens.
