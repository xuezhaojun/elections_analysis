1343590289311756288 2020-12-29 00:11:02 +0800 <tomslater42> @hoolacambs and it is also important to imagine independence without the SNP.
1343588625527808001 2020-12-29 00:04:25 +0800 <tomslater42> @hoolacambs FFS.  I am pro Indy and pro EU.  But the widespread belief that the SNP is a social democratic party of progressives is damaging to Scotland in the long run.
1343494253553586178 2020-12-28 17:49:25 +0800 <tomslater42> @mostlybolshie No.  Numerous examples of this sort of thing among senior SNP politicians.
1343329630065983488 2020-12-28 06:55:16 +0800 <tomslater42> A few people have asked me recently why I have issues with Sturgeon‚Äôs SNP.  This is why.  An unbelievably idiotic and ignorant bunch of charlatans masquerading as progressives.  Comparing contemporary Scotland with apartheid South Africa is just breathtakingly stupid
1342854291204280320 2020-12-26 23:26:26 +0800 <tomslater42> Hi I‚Äôm a few ‚Äúline managers‚Äù
1342765391270043649 2020-12-26 17:33:11 +0800 <tomslater42> Johnson should now apologise unreservedly for 1) belittling Chapman like this 2) lying.  I don‚Äôt suspect he will do either, because he is a thoroughly dangerous and nasty piece of work
1342164925913964544 2020-12-25 01:47:09 +0800 <tomslater42> Imagine giving a protofascist idiot masses of airtime for years and then he gets what he wants and is then given more of the same.  The BBC has a lot to answer for.
1342133627124129793 2020-12-24 23:42:47 +0800 <tomslater42> 350 million quid every week into the NHS now eh?  Lying arsehole.  Looking forward to rejoining the EU one day when your ruinous government and party are long gone, and looked back on with the contempt they deserve.
1342126276803493889 2020-12-24 23:13:34 +0800 <tomslater42> Totally agree, but not one led by the SNP.
1342061007259258881 2020-12-24 18:54:13 +0800 <tomslater42> Devastating for Scotland but then so is Brexit (which Scotland voted overwhelmingly against).
1341294295471583232 2020-12-22 16:07:34 +0800 <tomslater42> Lynner was my colleague in Edinburgh for a few years and we supervised some great students together.  Her command of her subject was awesome and she was a remarkable mentor to many, many people.  RIP.
1341051021728993280 2020-12-22 00:00:53 +0800 <tomslater42> Oh shit
1341050224509394946 2020-12-21 23:57:43 +0800 <tomslater42> Yes!  The problem with so many public health scholars who are always on TV is that they rarely, if ever, mention these social drivers. Easy option for mainstream TV producers.
1340990388044259329 2020-12-21 19:59:57 +0800 <tomslater42> Why is this idiot anywhere near public office? He has delivered absolutely nothing of substance in his political life other than utter mince.  "In the short term this won't have an impact."  It already is, you fountain of pish.
1340939931837997063 2020-12-21 16:39:27 +0800 <tomslater42> This thread is spot on about Sturgeon and the SNP.  Tired of seeing the fawning over her leadership by public health academics with very little grasp of political economy or even Scottish politics

It is a fine special issue, very well edited, but I still think it came too soon. Ok to say that, and not moaning either.

1339307231217655812 2020-12-17 04:31:41 +0800 <tomslater42> Indeed.  I hope Derek Gregory‚Äôs next blog will reflect on the awfulness of being offered a job that he hadn‚Äôt even applied for over a glass of sherry from the HoD.  Sigh
1338884908706623489 2020-12-16 00:33:32 +0800 <tomslater42> @JulReid Hi Julian, did you take this photo?  If not, any idea who did?  I would like to use it in my forthcoming book and need to ask permission. Many thanks.

1337657682002632704 2020-12-12 15:16:58 +0800 <tomslater42> This pathological liar, aided by the pathetic, fawning, supine mainstream media (e.g.  Peston, Kuenssberg) never had any intention of getting a deal.
1337458467372756996 2020-12-12 02:05:22 +0800 <tomslater42> Just remembered this fine tweet from 2017.  Much of the UK media is absolutely complicit in this unfolding catastrophe.
1337338653043994626 2020-12-11 18:09:16 +0800 <tomslater42> @JK_Remnant There is (perhaps) comfort to be found in the fact that success rates hover around 10-15% for most funding schemes. Sigh
1337327055613124609 2020-12-11 17:23:11 +0800 <tomslater42> @JK_Remnant since 2013, but still, it's getting ridiculous now.

1313781440467927042 2020-10-07 18:01:18 +0800 <tomslater42> @cat_neculai yep
1313770282834853889 2020-10-07 17:16:58 +0800 <tomslater42> Also, HR advisors. Now is not the time to send us emails about change curves and how we are all going to experience "shock and denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance".
1313769670349070336 2020-10-07 17:14:32 +0800 <tomslater42> University senior managers everywhere.  Now is not the time to send emails encouraging your staff to be 'resilient' and to 'adjust' and 'adapt'.
1313748789841350657 2020-10-07 15:51:34 +0800 <tomslater42> This NYT piece is one of the best yet on 10 years of Tory neglect and maltreatment of UK universities
1313463438069444611 2020-10-06 20:57:41 +0800 <tomslater42> Except that this was absolute shite and you just razzed everyone up by spreading pish when decisions on restrictions are not confirmed until tomorrow (and we all just heard it will not be another lockdown). A dangerous shitrag spreading pure mince yet again üò°üí©

1311379178747580416 2020-10-01 02:55:35 +0800 <tomslater42> Agree, brilliant work by @mara_ferreri
1311205127995482113 2020-09-30 15:23:58 +0800 <tomslater42> Been thinking that for decades tbh.  Also wtf England.
1310261076009852933 2020-09-28 00:52:38 +0800 <tomslater42> I see academics replying in anger to Andrew Adonis.  That completely ludicrous bellend blocked me years ago for asking him a genuine question about why he is obsessed with portraying academics as inveterate slackers, so I imagine he is saying more of the same? Ignore him.
1308845710209675264 2020-09-24 03:08:29 +0800 <tomslater42> @wjnicholls03 Roll over? Steam roller?
1308844353377497095 2020-09-24 03:03:05 +0800 <tomslater42> @ProfKate99 Adam thinks he can say and do what he likes. Adam must have Tory pals.
1308841900787535879 2020-09-24 02:53:20 +0800 <tomslater42> @DarjaReuschke Sadly not.  But hasn‚Äôt yet called us ‚Äúessential workers‚Äù to justify it.
1308830321434034176 2020-09-24 02:07:20 +0800 <tomslater42> Just when you think Adam Tickell can‚Äôt get any more appalling, he‚Äôs putting the health and safety of his staff and students at risk when he has the option to move all teaching online.
1308715834467061761 2020-09-23 18:32:24 +0800 <tomslater42> Have been numb about this since I heard the news from his family on Monday. A great friend, comrade and geographer who I enjoyed meeting in Edinburgh for lunch (with Joe Doherty) on many occasions in the past few years. Will be sadly missed.
1308106024797310976 2020-09-22 02:09:14 +0800 <tomslater42> The UK Prime Minister is a truly appalling human.  Also isn‚Äôt it time to call him Johnson rather than Boris?
1307642539705593856 2020-09-20 19:27:30 +0800 <tomslater42> Let‚Äôs talk about Angela Davis and Antonio Gramsci and the mind-blowing stuff they wrote during their ‚Äúlockdowns‚Äù.  Probably more relevant than Newton to understanding and fighting the absolute political shitshow we are all in right now.
1307631846088474624 2020-09-20 18:45:01 +0800 <tomslater42> @LizzieGadd Er...yes.  I meant the paper that reports on the collaborative development of a vaccine, by those who developed it.  If we get that far!
1307629615108759552 2020-09-20 18:36:09 +0800 <tomslater42> How about we give the only 4* rating to the paper that develops a vaccine (that would be truly ‚Äòworld leading‚Äô), distribute any and all future research funding equally across all unis, and be done with the whole REF charade.
1306985025800372224 2020-09-18 23:54:47 +0800 <tomslater42> Excellent Covid-Political guidance by my office door  https://t.co/wQcJZOp6w5
1306854127956365312 2020-09-18 15:14:38 +0800 <tomslater42> In case you were in any doubt about Trump's fascist and white supremacist credentials.
1306831231271735296 2020-09-18 13:43:39 +0800 <tomslater42> That he just quit and has encouraged all his colleagues to do the same.
1306831062211923968 2020-09-18 13:42:59 +0800 <tomslater42> Shut pubs early and send students home (online learning is fine for now).
1306552802215329795 2020-09-17 19:17:17 +0800 <tomslater42> I cannot understand how this appalling fool is anywhere near public office
1306292872245841920 2020-09-17 02:04:25 +0800 <tomslater42> @HAYLESBEN Fabulous news, congrats üëç
1306226109663543300 2020-09-16 21:39:07 +0800 <tomslater42> Also, worth noting that this guy is the one person in the world Adam Tickell admires the most, and together they are the architects of the raid on our pension scheme.
1306223269457154048 2020-09-16 21:27:50 +0800 <tomslater42> Everything that is wrong with UK university senior management in one video.  Excruciating and repugnant.

1305418553319981056 2020-09-14 16:10:11 +0800 <tomslater42> Many of us had ‚Äògrave misgivings‚Äô about David Cameron when he became PM in 2010, and to hear this arrogant abomination lamenting a catastrophe of his own making is frankly exhausting
1305091335985270785 2020-09-13 18:29:56 +0800 <tomslater42> A shameful disgrace of a politician

1303771321889959937 2020-09-10 03:04:40 +0800 <tomslater42> Rest in power.  A very great human.
1303720180070125568 2020-09-09 23:41:27 +0800 <tomslater42> @LorettaCLees belated congrats from me too, sorry I missed the tweet!
1303633560419610624 2020-09-09 17:57:15 +0800 <tomslater42> OMG.  The sickening smirk, the indifference, the arrogance, the consistently pathetic attempts to defend the indefensible. And this astonishing natural emetic of a politician is the health secretary during a devastating pandemic.

1303243892322693126 2020-09-08 16:08:51 +0800 <tomslater42> The District Six Museum in Cape Town has set up a link for international donors:    https://t.co/jW4gr7A8hm  If you are able to, please donate to help save this incredibly important Museum of forced removals under apartheid. My blog below explains the history of District Six:
1302554002173964288 2020-09-06 18:27:29 +0800 <tomslater42> And now the District Six Museum is in serious trouble and needs to be saved.  My blog below explains the history, and this Museum simply cannot close.  Donations via this link:  https://t.co/28sqpPW0G9

1302296519245168642 2020-09-06 01:24:20 +0800 <tomslater42> Having had its plans to nick our pensions derailed by theee rounds of industrial action, UUK‚Äôs new strategy is to kill us off early

1301799446527848449 2020-09-04 16:29:08 +0800 <tomslater42> Further evidence that @NicolaSturgeon @JohnSwinney  and @scotgov are simply not prioritising the mental and physical health of young people. The closure of these centres would be a devastating loss.

1301515362207436800 2020-09-03 21:40:17 +0800 <tomslater42> Horrific news.  A shattering blow.
1300767195149012993 2020-09-01 20:07:21 +0800 <tomslater42> @davidjmadden the more interesting question is that it takes a report by two BoE economists to get this picked up in the mainstream media, when every critical housing scholar has pointed this out in peer reviewed journals for at least 15 years.
1300752423687016451 2020-09-01 19:08:39 +0800 <tomslater42> @Arrianna_Planey that's exactly it.  People say it reduces email but it adds to it, as you get notifications that people are trying to reach you and then when you get there you can't find shit.  Infuriating
1300703542756478977 2020-09-01 15:54:25 +0800 <tomslater42> 'Microsoft Teams' is utter pish
