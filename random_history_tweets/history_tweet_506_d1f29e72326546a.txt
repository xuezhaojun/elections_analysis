1302446347384246273 2020-09-06 11:19:42 +0800 <d1f29e72326546a> @aubrey_huff @MLB I hope you're right, Aubrey. I love the game of baseball. It's supposed to be America's game. Since I saw players taking a knee to our flag and MLB bowing to BLM, I want nothing to do with MLB anymore. Players can't be afraid to take a stand for what they really believe in.
