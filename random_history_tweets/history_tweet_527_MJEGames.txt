1344032980251996160 2020-12-30 05:30:08 +0800 <MJEGames> @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump Mcconnel blocked it but lets be honest it was never about getting money to the people for Trump. It was about 230 and the limitations on his authoratrian behaviors that come with it.
1344022417564286976 2020-12-30 04:48:09 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump If Trump stood for Justice he wouldnt have abused his pardon powers so blatantly obstructing justice and giving Guilty pleaing criminals free passes for being loyalist and to prevent them from testifying against him.
1344022002999255040 2020-12-30 04:46:30 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Trump is a criminal who has been using his fathers money and privelige to get away with it his entire life. Rapist, con artist, pedophile, pervert, tax evading coward.

1344020410619203584 2020-12-30 04:40:11 +0800 <MJEGames> @GoshDarnIt15 @willisgirl01 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Exactly if there was massive fraud it 100% was done by @senatemajldr and @LindseyGrahamSC whom literally not only used decade old republican voter suppression tactics but ACTUALLY tried to interfere in other states election processes.  Full audit and investigation must be done.
1344019940810973184 2020-12-30 04:38:19 +0800 <MJEGames> @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Funny how they dont suspect fraud when @LindseyGrahamSC literally tried to interfere in other states elections and both he and Mcconnel were trailing horribly in the polls. Not to mention Kentucky and Texas were among (repeat offenders) the worst for republicans voter suppression
1344019504318144513 2020-12-30 04:36:35 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump I would agree with him but Trump doesnt even believe the virus is real despite catching it himself. He doesnt care about you or getting you relief. He cares about the language in section 230 limiting his authortarian tendencies.
1344019080320229377 2020-12-30 04:34:54 +0800 <MJEGames> @Jim_Jordan When people aren't dieing from poor leadership.  LOOOOOOKING AT YOU PAL!
1344018833032454144 2020-12-30 04:33:55 +0800 <MJEGames> To be clear Trump never cared either. Hes just trying to garner sympathy by pretending to fight for the very people he is grifting. Its always been about section 230 for him he doesnt care about you. He still denies the virus on the whole.
1344018390940205056 2020-12-30 04:32:09 +0800 <MJEGames> @disgracedtolma Cyberpunk still needs some patching but it will eventually get there!
1344016089177460738 2020-12-30 04:23:00 +0800 <MJEGames> @Jim_Jordan "Thank for you protecting the patriots from a global pandemic the likes of which hasnt been seen in this scale in a century"...?  Probably something like that.   They would be embarassed by you, #GymJordan.

1343036524217044992 2020-12-27 11:30:34 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump "Freedom of press is gone" he says refusing to have press conferences, attacking their credibility, calling anything that isnt approved propaganda "fake news", lieing over 280k times in just 4 years, spreading baseless accusations and lies.  Authoratarion douchebag says what?
1343035868580179968 2020-12-27 11:27:58 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump The only reason hes pretending this was about money to the people NOW is because it sells better to his cult than "I dont want section 230 because I dont like how people call me out, &amp; call me names on the internet, and I cant circumvent congress to play military leader anymore"

1341491037286531072 2020-12-23 05:09:21 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Lol why is everything always a record with him... Of course its a record we havent had a pandemic of this global scale EVER and havent had one of a national scale this bad since 1918.  Sadly I think we are seeing more resistance to the vaccine now than back then.
1341490605877149696 2020-12-23 05:07:38 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump False.
1341272510369726466 2020-12-22 14:41:00 +0800 <MJEGames> @SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump At this point an endorsement by Trump points to corruption.
1341208725302910976 2020-12-22 10:27:33 +0800 <MJEGames> Who knew Barr would have a line to draw somewhere. Finding something resembling a backbone even his gaslighting seems to have had its limits.  Barr says no need for special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden, publicly undercutting Trump  https://t.co/l59BmO44wZ
1341156602083123201 2020-12-22 07:00:26 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Imagine that.....Now that your officially out NOW they all remember its Country before party......too lil too late.   Can't wait for the criminal to get arrested. #TrumpCrimeSyndicate.

1340801735502176256 2020-12-21 07:30:19 +0800 <MJEGames> @gatewaypundit @realDonaldTrump @joehoft The only thing this math proved was that there was unexpected voter turn out.  Suppresion efforts at its finest. So many exposed for the corrupt scum they are point and case #TheGatewayPundit.
1340800913842192384 2020-12-21 07:27:03 +0800 <MJEGames> @jeasRyuu @realDonaldTrump @MichSoS @gatewaypundit Look at their "witnesses" who lack any and all credibility. Look at their lawyers who wont actually argue fraud in court but that fraud was undetectable while publicly claiming mountains of evidence(you cant have it both ways).   Even Trumps loyalists are telling you otherwise
1340764681586188288 2020-12-21 05:03:04 +0800 <MJEGames> @gatewaypundit Good lord its a cult.  https://t.co/6wPaO9A97t

1340484638129602561 2020-12-20 10:30:17 +0800 <MJEGames> @JoRickhards @ProductivePrty @realamberheard But SHE hasn't.

Their literally is audio and video of her abusing him and taunting/goading him into reacting negatively.  I see through you. Hypocrite.  https://t.co/MzlazpFJ9h
1340484016382742528 2020-12-20 10:27:49 +0800 <MJEGames> @JoRickhards @realamberheard I dont think youre using that word right.

She literally antagonizes him and goads him. Twas her spinning the web of lies to make herself into a courageous survivor and victim.
1340483258572623874 2020-12-20 10:24:48 +0800 <MJEGames> @realamberheard Fuck no, will not touch ANY work by an abuser and liar.   Depp may have had his faults too but so far he isnt the one lieing about them.

1340430311906111488 2020-12-20 06:54:25 +0800 <MJEGames> @RealCandaceO Somebody remind her how many days we went without press briefings or questions in Trump and republicans efforts to control the story/narrative.
1340430072423936000 2020-12-20 06:53:27 +0800 <MJEGames> @RealCandaceO @TheRightMelissa Its funny because shes the same person who critized work places for taking the restrictions &amp; guidelines seriously because its all "fake" yet they are literally trying to keep people employed and incomes flowing. They seriously think your stupid enough to fall for that hypocrisy
1340429287795507200 2020-12-20 06:50:20 +0800 <MJEGames> @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump No no no dear with no credible proof coming forward gaslighting has ALWAYS been your field of expertise.
1340428947733925889 2020-12-20 06:48:59 +0800 <MJEGames> @TheRightMelissa Hahahahhaha holy fuck now THAT is irony.  Read the 1918 pandemic dear, Read up on Trumps legal battles from pedophilia to racist discrimination to sexual assaults in which he is blocking dna evidence testing which would normally exonerate an innocent person.  TRASH!

The second hes out of office he is held to the same agreements we are and he likely will be suspended (often) if he doesnt change his behaviours.

1339717123422109696 2020-12-18 07:40:27 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump What this means is when Trump registered to vote in Florida he did so illegally.
1339716706265022464 2020-12-18 07:38:48 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Don't forget after all Trumps preaching of Voter fraud, it was he himself who committed it.  Residents in Florida file an official complaint citing @realDonaldTrump agreement in the 90's that to turn the Mar-a-lago into a private club nobody could reside there. Trump included.
1339711919846875142 2020-12-18 07:19:46 +0800 <MJEGames> @ReportThis12 Okay sure. But you realize it is still largely the Proud boys terrorizing the streets and therefore we would be squashing their racist and ignorant 'rebellion'
1339706292600856578 2020-12-18 06:57:25 +0800 <MJEGames> @UbisoftSupport Sent! As well as a few other bugs I was able to replicate more than once. Great game I have only the most minor complaints and even then more of suggestions.  I.e. the order should become a nemisis system similar to #ShadowsOfMordor it would keep the mechanic fresh &amp; add endgame.
1339457504808341504 2020-12-17 14:28:49 +0800 <MJEGames> @jkenney Heard you just sold of the rights to mine our Rockies for a fucking pittance.   Not even PRETENDING to have our interests in mind anymore huh?  #FuckTheUCP

1339457111793651713 2020-12-17 14:27:16 +0800 <MJEGames> @KyleMit55837747 You realize Trump has more secret chinese bank accounts than ANY of the Bidens combined right?  Who the fuck cares about what his son was paid, he isn't the President, this was already investigated and found no wrong doing.   Just stop you sad lil being.
1339456627372507138 2020-12-17 14:25:20 +0800 <MJEGames> @KyleMit55837747 @cjtruth Sure thing egg account, with 66837747 numbers in your name, created this or last month because your other bot/troll accounts got suspended indefinitely.  https://t.co/h8aKMJILjN

1339419099160408066 2020-12-17 11:56:13 +0800 <MJEGames> @SaraCarterDC @RandPaul Yep its rigged so make sure you boycott the Georgia runoff.
1339418939621699590 2020-12-17 11:55:35 +0800 <MJEGames> @cjtruth @SaraCarterDC @RandPaul Prove it.
1339396434626428948 2020-12-17 10:26:09 +0800 <MJEGames> @KiltyJeremy @HelenSpade4 Wake me up when you guys provide any actual evidence.
1339396243307446272 2020-12-17 10:25:23 +0800 <MJEGames> I've noticed as Magats are calling to boycott the senate runoff elections, some people are tongue in cheek encouraging this sentiment.  I'm proud of all of you, and yes they really are that stupid, they really are turning on their own because they congratulated Joe Biden

You know when youre that dumb teenager still trying to figure out who you are and what your place is in this world?  He spent the rest of his life fighting for civil liberties.

1339383679710195712 2020-12-17 09:35:28 +0800 <MJEGames> @HelenSpade4 @cjtruth Shhhhh, 1) its a political spectrum not right vs left not rep vs dems.  2) if he doesn't why is it that democrat leaderships ends up with the most growth, and a stronger society building each other up while republicans increase debt and widen the gaps in the classes?  https://t.co/oL7KRqVAT5
1339382632921006083 2020-12-17 09:31:18 +0800 <MJEGames> @jennifer_gee1 @cjtruth Please... Enlighten me.....in what universe has Trump shown ANY repetence?
1339382422941564928 2020-12-17 09:30:28 +0800 <MJEGames> @Lesley20234 @cjtruth Yeah but in which universe has Trump shown ANY repetence?
1339381478656933888 2020-12-17 09:26:43 +0800 <MJEGames> @JoannaM43017231 @ReportThis12 Bahahaha you are soooo right it hurts.
1339065336809713667 2020-12-16 12:30:29 +0800 <MJEGames> @AnnaGoanna4 @TalbertSwan @AlexSamuelsx5 @JoeBiden It almost flipped this election! But this just shows how corrupt the elected republican officials are in Texas.
1339065087043063810 2020-12-16 12:29:30 +0800 <MJEGames> @AlexSamuelsx5 @ArtofwarU @JoeBiden No. They voted 34-4 to condemn the supreme courts decision.   Which means nothing. Its whining, complaining that the big mean court didnt give the child having the hissy fit what he wants.
1339064697593556993 2020-12-16 12:27:57 +0800 <MJEGames> @HasNoSay @ArtofwarU @the_resistor @wesrap @realDonaldTrump Not to mention they only did EXACTLY what they were supposed to... Republicans won texas they were supposed to vote for Don the Con as per tradition (voting for candidate with the popular vote in that state)   The fact you think this is relevant/ makes an arguement is astounding.
1339064143802814464 2020-12-16 12:25:45 +0800 <MJEGames> @wesrap @realDonaldTrump So? They won that state thats how its supposed to work.
1339064049418469376 2020-12-16 12:25:22 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Im more grateful for the next four to come. Bye bye.

All I really have to say is nobody should be shamed for being their true self, You be you Lady!

1338791325836038144 2020-12-15 18:21:40 +0800 <MJEGames> @SantiagGoal88 Imagine that, a deleted post, from a banned account. I can't wait for your next suspension pal.  lol is it sad and lonely knowing that this is the only gratification you are getting out of life is being an internet troll?
1338791084042776578 2020-12-15 18:20:42 +0800 <MJEGames> @SantiagGoal88 @familyunequal @realDonaldTrump Like you did?  Get the fuck out of here, grow up.
1338790755389751296 2020-12-15 18:19:24 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Then why did you roll back pretty much every environmental policy you could get your tiny lil hands on then?
1338728582806269954 2020-12-15 14:12:21 +0800 <MJEGames> @wesrap @realDonaldTrump So they wasted time voting on something that doesnt matter. They've already been toldno now they are pouting when their hand got slapped reaching for the cookie jar.
1338728173517729792 2020-12-15 14:10:43 +0800 <MJEGames> @wesrap @realDonaldTrump Lol he didnt read this article it calls his election fraud claims baseless right in the middle.   What a fucking moron.

This would only be shocking if the hand recount didnt immediately debunk this....
1338721613139742722 2020-12-15 13:44:39 +0800 <MJEGames> @CodeMonkeyZ @realDonaldTrump Despite Trumps hand picked REPUBLICAN Head of intelligence describing this as, and I quote word for word, "this was THE MOST secure election in modern US history.
1338720982979080196 2020-12-15 13:42:09 +0800 <MJEGames> @CodeMonkeyZ @realDonaldTrump You mean like how mueller told us  Russia interferred intending to get Trump elected then Trump had barr cover it all up but back then it was fake news, and you barely reacted.   Now you actually want to borrow that narrative and argue it impacted this election?
1338720339841359872 2020-12-15 13:39:35 +0800 <MJEGames> @KelemenCari @realDonaldTrump Maybe if he actually has any evidence. Fucking cult.

Law, order, justice and democract won this election.  Trump is fraud. Has been with an open trail since at least 1973. Seek therapy leaving a cult can be difficult as you confront reality and become dillusioned.

1338666415914536963 2020-12-15 10:05:19 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Nope.

1338635821453176832 2020-12-15 08:03:45 +0800 <MJEGames> @ReportThis12 @lv_teacher Meanwhile back in reality:  You do know Biden will unredact the Mueller report and uncover what Barr tried to hide right?  https://t.co/c3u6QXK5k8

1338635241733332992 2020-12-15 08:01:26 +0800 <MJEGames> @ReportThis12 @lv_teacher Or the relief that Trump publically says pelosi is blocking but privately has mcconnel block it in the senate?
1338635117648961537 2020-12-15 08:00:57 +0800 <MJEGames> @ReportThis12 @lv_teacher Or the earth shattering evidence on clin-bama-unter or whatever baseless q-anon nonsense your obsessed with today?

1338634629440393216 2020-12-15 07:59:00 +0800 <MJEGames> @ReportThis12 @lv_teacher Like his tax returns?
1338634551245991937 2020-12-15 07:58:42 +0800 <MJEGames> @ReportThis12 Lmao Trump is the one trying to convince you he has evidence while providing none.  In public he promises mountains of it in private his lawyers argue that the fraud is undetectable and therefore should overturn the election.  So which is it?  Seek therapy leaving a cult is hard.
1338633882883694592 2020-12-15 07:56:02 +0800 <MJEGames> @realRyanPence @ReportThis12 Lmao first of all Kelly Loeffer is the sitting REPUBLICAN senator trying to defend herself in the run-off. Not a democrat.  Setting that aside a blurry pic of two blonde women does not a conpsiracy make.  This is an especially strong brand of stupid.
1338633193704984577 2020-12-15 07:53:18 +0800 <MJEGames> @ReportThis12 The fuck is a Resurrection act? There is a insurrection act.... Whats the resurrection act? If Jesus rises again all the magats will stop being terrible human beings?

Given I often place sources in my posts that sounds even less likely.  Given that you think youre on the right side of this as Trump promises mountains of evidence but doesnt provide any...well...

1338282851935027202 2020-12-14 08:41:10 +0800 <MJEGames> @shannatorp Flynn.... The guy who plead guilty mutilple times getting a pardon to protect the crime syndicate, whom Judge Elliot specifically said while the pardon renders their litigation moot it he made a special point of noting this does not mean he is innocent by any means. #HandsTied
1338282363546001408 2020-12-14 08:39:14 +0800 <MJEGames> @shannatorp Its a political spectrum and you are but a puppet dancing to the republican pulling your strings. Repeating lies and misinformation as gospel truths. Its not your fault they have spent decades garnering this left vs right mentality to unite the naive against an imagined enemy.
1338281580163297281 2020-12-14 08:36:07 +0800 <MJEGames> @shannatorp People what they can or cant post.
1338281534516731905 2020-12-14 08:35:56 +0800 <MJEGames> @shannatorp First of all incest is still legal in several states. Secondly 98% of it is fake &amp; roleplaying. 3rd none of these facts mean I support the platform being used in such a way. Finally the problem is the old freedom of speech arguement. At what point does it cross the line telling
1338280810093236224 2020-12-14 08:33:03 +0800 <MJEGames> @shannatorp Oh but it is.
1338280746805460992 2020-12-14 08:32:48 +0800 <MJEGames> @shannatorp Uh yeah no.

1338280467091472387 2020-12-14 08:31:42 +0800 <MJEGames> @shannatorp @Disabled_Vet_US @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Note that it says alleger right at the top. That they already investigated all this and found nothing wrong and this has been a ridiculous narrative from the start and finally Hunter Biden was not running for nor is he the President-Elect.
1338280083967025155 2020-12-14 08:30:10 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump And now he attacks his own party.
1338279864319627264 2020-12-14 08:29:18 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump They did not chicken out they just wouldnt gas light your baseless claims not even newly appointed whacko Amy Barrett would do it for you.
1338279269412134912 2020-12-14 08:26:56 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Then why cant you or your lawyers provide any evidence or credible witnesses. Why are your lawyers not arguing that there was fraud but that mail in ballots made fraud undetectable and thus millions of legal votes should be overturned. The supreme court rejecting it outright.
1338278728292466688 2020-12-14 08:24:47 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump This isnt just a lie but still has nothing to do with Trump or operation warpspeed.
1338206366490533890 2020-12-14 03:37:15 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Spoiler alert. He cant it passed with a majorirty proof meaning he cant veto it. Its outside his power.
1338206142694969344 2020-12-14 03:36:21 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Technically hes right republicans went through new records in their efforts to suppress the vote yet despite that we had the highest turnout in modern US elections.
1338165696346243072 2020-12-14 00:55:38 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Still no evidence anywhere to be found.
1338165531208118273 2020-12-14 00:54:59 +0800 <MJEGames> @Too_Many_Leaks @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump @jack @TwitterSupport Its not censorship. Twitter has stated he loses special protections Jan 21st at which point it is no longer a matter of public interest insuring everyone has access to his tweets despite him violating the twitter policies daily. He will get suspended after that like anyone else.
1338164995696148480 2020-12-14 00:52:51 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Its veto proof... How do you STILL not understand how governing works....
1338140631885963264 2020-12-13 23:16:02 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump They dont care about a criminal counting his final days in office.  Also your executive order did nothing.... It takes congress to impact drug prices and you had Mcconnel block any meaningful bills.
1337889929724981248 2020-12-13 06:39:50 +0800 <MJEGames> @noah_nonsense @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump Actually though....  Yule, Winter solstice, Saturnalia festival many others lost to history.  Yes it did, and Jesus was born in the spring. Christmas was a church created idea to squash "paganism" aka anything that didn't agree with their pov.
1337883689334624261 2020-12-13 06:15:02 +0800 <MJEGames> @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump Its not even Jesus' real birthday.  https://t.co/rqV5WXL8HX
1337882192081342464 2020-12-13 06:09:05 +0800 <MJEGames> @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump The holiday to undermine the pagan ways.
1337882049110106112 2020-12-13 06:08:31 +0800 <MJEGames> @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump These executive orders arent worth the paper their written on and NOBODY CARES IF YOU SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!  No body was ever against this. Its implied when someone says happy holidays.   Besides Christmas was actually a pagan ritual that the church didnt like so they created
1337881409277456384 2020-12-13 06:05:59 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA They did, they verified the signatures on the day of the election. Youve been spewing this lie ever since.
1337734820995067905 2020-12-12 20:23:29 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Again he pretends there is mountains of evidence...yet his lawyers produce none and argue that the mail in ballot provisions made detecting fraud impossible.  You cant have it both ways. Especially when your own head of intelligence describes this as the MOST secure election.
1337733526477631494 2020-12-12 20:18:21 +0800 <MJEGames> Wow.
1337716086783889410 2020-12-12 19:09:03 +0800 <MJEGames> @DanCrenshawTX Dan why are you pretending that case after case ISNT getting thrown out of the SCOTUS including Texas lawsuit now.  Just because you look like a real life bond villain doesnt mean you have to act like one.
1337715577746411520 2020-12-12 19:07:01 +0800 <MJEGames> @RNossolin @tracybeanz Incorrect, 56 lawsuits thrown out at the highest levels.  Explain to me why Trump is arguing there is mountains of evidence of fraud....yet his lawyers are in court arguing the opposite that mail in ballot provisions made fraud undetectable... So which is it?
1337714965755490304 2020-12-12 19:04:36 +0800 <MJEGames> @Acosta #14thAmendment. This guys are unbelievable... #CorruptGop
1337572878284308481 2020-12-12 09:39:59 +0800 <MJEGames> Of evidence of fraud, yet his lawyers are actually arguing that the fraud is undetectable and thus should overturn millions of ballots.  So which is it? This is why Trump has had 55 of 56 cases thrown out or dismissed before even seeing the court room.  This is the reality.
1337572393087221760 2020-12-12 09:38:04 +0800 <MJEGames> Instead they are in court arguining that the changes (made by republican and in republican controlled states btw) made to accomadate mail in voting and the pandemic has made it "impossible to detect fraud"   Thats right Trump is spewing tweet after tweet claiming mountains

So much so that Judge Sullivan had to make special note of it, specifically he believed this only further confirmed Flynns guilt but constitutionally the point is moot.

Because god definitely tells you to attack thy neighbour and call him lucifer and then mock him/her for their struggles.  Thatll get you into heaven FOR SURE.   Moron.
1331907909538570240 2020-11-26 18:29:25 +0800 <MJEGames> @cjtruth @GenFlynn Idiots celebrating guilty men (who plead guilty TWICE) getting rewarded for lieing to protect the conartist himself.

Because we are the idiots for being upset when someone pleads guilty TWICE that theyll get a pardon for being loyal lapdogs to the most corrupt man in modern day history.
1331906017299374081 2020-11-26 18:21:54 +0800 <MJEGames> Blatant corruption so of course #CheerleaderGraham is here.   Too bad hes likely going to have to resign for ethics violations.
1331904709817368576 2020-11-26 18:16:43 +0800 <MJEGames> Useless bum. Destroying Alberta while feeding the conservative cult here.  His incomptenece is staggering and is likely the final straw pushing me, an Albertan raised and lifelong harper/conservative voter, away from the party permanently.

We saw this a lot when the first states tried it and sadly the businesses were left pretty defenseless..  Point is federal checks/trumps state power not the other way around

Which is why your states that have legalized marijuana, technically is still illegal.  If a federal agent chose to charge you, or more commonly do a seizure of state legitmate businesses supplies/assests

1331585386976460802 2020-11-25 21:07:50 +0800 <MJEGames> I love how she's trying to blame them for something they haven't even been in office for yet. Does she think we'll just forget its been Trump in office the last four years and until Jan 21st?  That's how pathetic Ronna McDaniel really is.  She really thinks you are that stupid.

1331279031442890753 2020-11-25 00:50:29 +0800 <MJEGames> They are. Thats why 30 of Trumps lawsuits have been laughed at and thrown out of court.

Sadly his followers dont see the con.  Even #Scotland's government is investigating @realDonaldTrump for #moneylaundering and it may result in his properties there being seized

OR could just be because the one judge hasnt thrown the case out yet and is letting Guilliani embarass himself further first.

But in reality county and state laws had that one going to a runoff due to its close margins anyways AND has no impact on the presidential race.  The other I think they would consider a "win" is either the 20 feet reduced to 6

1330358226747936768 2020-11-22 11:51:32 +0800 <MJEGames> Eye opening to the fact that half of Americans would follow a facist right to the bitter end.

Is that why he wants to count all the votes... So long as they are for him...but stop counting all the ones that aren't those are fraud.....
1327598154213060610 2020-11-14 21:04:00 +0800 <MJEGames> I'm so glad your phrased it that way since it's REPUBLICAN ELECTION OFFICIALS saying and I quote "this was the MOST secure election in modern US history."   Its like they like the taste of foot in mouth.

1327387453662003200 2020-11-14 07:06:45 +0800 <MJEGames> Considering its all bullshit? Yes.  The company very specifically made a public statement distancing themselves from the liar in chief. They received no funds from the US government and had nothing to do with #ProjectWarpSpeed  As usual Trump lies right into your face.
1327387145552621568 2020-11-14 07:05:31 +0800 <MJEGames> Except that we had more job growth, GDP growth, and we werent so polarized by the xenophobic wanna be dictator facist divider in chief @realDonaldTrump. Fucking cult.

1327386590662934528 2020-11-14 07:03:19 +0800 <MJEGames> Until you remember that this company distanced themselves from him, stating specifically that they were not a part of the project, did not take any funds from the US government and Trump had literally nothing to do with it.   #StillYourPresident #PresidentBiden.
1327386295841165312 2020-11-14 07:02:09 +0800 <MJEGames> Here we can see Trump blatantly lieing again. Taking credit for work that had nothing to do with him. The company that developed the vaccine distanced itself from the US government. Specifically stating they had nothing to do with projectwarpspeed and took no funds from them.

1326928806678913024 2020-11-13 00:44:15 +0800 <MJEGames> @lindalb9 @realDonaldTrump Even Fox has called it for Biden and is calling Trumps lies out for what they are.  That's why he just had a 30 tweet rage fest slamming fox news.

People denied efficiency, people wore them till they were filthy people bitched about how they don't work and how we should be doing something else rather then being part of the solution not the problem.

They require proper seals so no facial hair, they require changing the filters which most people have never even considered.  4) that study didn't find that masks made it worse they found

N95 may be the most efficient but 1) they aren't as readily available. 2) proper mask fittings are required or they don't work.  https://t.co/RfAJqkcezs

1326803501406593025 2020-11-12 16:26:20 +0800 <MJEGames> God king of deception Trump retweets a link that is 6 days referencing the ruling that instead of 20 foot distance for covid it should be reduced to 6.  WHO THE FUCK CARES.  You lost. You coward #concede or get the fuck out of the way.

One last con to pay off his debt. Don't fall for it.

That was it.  That is the extent they care about your reports of a peaceful and pointed protest.
1326362249234018306 2020-11-11 11:12:57 +0800 <MJEGames> @MKLonestar @kwilz17 @realDonaldTrump @Twitter walking in on underage girls when he owned miss teen usa on Howard stern. Its wrong that a sitting president is undermining the election process, suppressing he vote, and actively trying to change the results.

Its also wrong for a President to have raped 26 women and bragged about grabbing them by the pussy. Its wrong that some of those girls were underage at the time. Its wrong that he openly bragged about

Dec the electoral college votes for the President, VP based on the ballots. In January The senate aka congress then confirms the count, at which point it becomes "official" and then they swear in the next president on Jan 20th.

That's it. That's as far as twitter deemed your "reports" worthy of their attention.  It is our right to peacefully protest injustices. Like a sitting President trying to suppress and change the vote.

Shocker that the only REAL evidence is the Republican voter suppression efforts. Eliminating 90% or voter booths in minority communities is states like Texas and Kentucky.

Or when they voluntarily paused and rearranged the

The current count does not reflect provionals either as they were set aside however there isn't enough of them for Trump to win the state even if he won 100% of the batch.
1325256396728758272 2020-11-08 09:58:41 +0800 <MJEGames> @FTESTERNBTLSFAN If you support Trump we don't fucking want ya.
1325256284367515650 2020-11-08 09:58:14 +0800 <MJEGames> @FTESTERNBTLSFAN @CheckTheBiceps @realDonaldTrump State supreme court PA ruled that any mailed in ballot POSTMARKED before the polls closed on Nov 3, had three days to be delivered (not found) at which point they were then verified under one republican and one democratic pollwatcher PER TABLE.   You lost. #PresidentBiden.

1325092356337496067 2020-11-07 23:06:51 +0800 <MJEGames> He's raging so hard he literally can't make simple tweets. I expect this to be one of his greatest tantrums to date.  It's going to be a loud one #OldManYellsAtClouds   #Election2020

1325086400228728832 2020-11-07 22:43:11 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Why did he take that tweet down already? did he Misspell #Philadelphia again?
1325084433230098433 2020-11-07 22:35:22 +0800 <MJEGames> @HerschelWalker It shouldn't cost the State itself anything to perform it.
1325084337910345728 2020-11-07 22:34:59 +0800 <MJEGames> @HerschelWalker Because that would cost a fortune in a country whose already BALLOONED the debt in 4 years, still in pandemic crisis with further spending required to combat it, plus in states like Wisconsin if Trump wants a recount he has to pay for it. Thats just law.  Have your recount but...

One republican and one democratic poll watcher PER TABLE was allowed and is in the room overseeing the count.  This is a blatant lie. Youll note they want you to keep counting the votes in Arizona but stop counting here.

1324993558965678081 2020-11-07 16:34:16 +0800 <MJEGames> @nick_mice @Jim_Jordan is not counted twice.  It also has been common practice to give a small alloted time to correct mistakes like missing signatures or incomplete ballots.   Jim is shooting himself in the foot here, so far mostly Trump voters changed their minds about voting by mail in ballot.
1324993254593449985 2020-11-07 16:33:03 +0800 <MJEGames> @nick_mice @Jim_Jordan He doesn't realize a lot of those provisional are actually votes FOR Trump too. The most common reason for a provisional is because someone requested a mailin ballot but then changed their minds and went in to vote anyways.  This requires extra verification to ensure a vote...

1324977771622232065 2020-11-07 15:31:32 +0800 <MJEGames> Just to see how many people would support a man who uses the same techniques he did to seize power, attacking the very integrity of the elections and election officials.
1324977618756665344 2020-11-07 15:30:55 +0800 <MJEGames> So you have to be wondering if #Putins #Facism experiment doesn't have him a little upset that it turned out to be a 1 term run.   I mean think about it, what if he did enable Trump in 2016 just as an experiment to see how receptive America would be to a Facist turnover...
1324977174919610372 2020-11-07 15:29:10 +0800 <MJEGames> @Wahrhaftig @BereftOfTheDial It's all just fuel for the fake narrative, this was planned ahead and we knew would happen for months, Since Trump and his allies blocked early voting booths and early processing in these states to setup this narrative.

1324963222475059200 2020-11-07 14:33:43 +0800 <MJEGames> @paulsperry_ Its funny that we've been breaking daily records every day since the election started and you are trying to pretend like it went away.
1324962325904809985 2020-11-07 14:30:09 +0800 <MJEGames> @paulsperry_ The fact that you don't know this causes the provisional ballots and THATS what they are giving them a few days to sort through, validate and correct.   You're ignorance is astounding where is Twitter on this one.

Trumps campaign succeeded in changing the distance OF THE WATCHERS ALREADY IN THERE doing their jobs from both sides from 20 feet away to only 6. They then paused to reconfigure to accomdate for the change and resumed counting.
1324953621495099392 2020-11-07 13:55:34 +0800 <MJEGames> @BuckSexton @realDonaldTrump They were never blocked this is such a bullshit narrative.  The MAIN REASON judges already dismissed trumps campaign efforts to sue to stop the vote in Pa and Georgia and Michigan is because THERE IS REPRESENTATIVES FROM BOTH SIDES ONE EACH PER COUNTING TABLE.  period.

They voted largely in person. We knew that would be reflected first while the mail in ballots were counted.   Your own republican party blocked early voting booths and early processing here.

I thought they were lost for a bit but my gut still tells me ultimately we might see a blue GA.  #Elections2020 #Election2020 #Biden2020 #CountEachVote
1324261486819074048 2020-11-05 16:05:16 +0800 <MJEGames> @lil_angi @GMB It is a close race though which is why Trump has started sowing distrust and stirring the pot.  https://t.co/8r5d6XDudg
1324261201853861889 2020-11-05 16:04:08 +0800 <MJEGames> @lil_angi @GMB AP news (Associated Press)  (what google is posting) predicted the last election with 99.8% accuracy.  Most media pages are using AP news to relay the information.

1324249684622286848 2020-11-05 15:18:22 +0800 <MJEGames> This was designed, and is typical Republican strategy.   Republicans suffer when voters turnout.  They live and thrive in misinformation.  https://t.co/7qinOcFpqs
1324248631688404992 2020-11-05 15:14:11 +0800 <MJEGames> We are in GREAT SHAPE. I have a REALLY good feeling about Georgia and the trending count in PA.
1324248365404598278 2020-11-05 15:13:08 +0800 <MJEGames> This should be written in the god damn history books after the embarrasing child tantrum we witnessed for four years from Trump.

1324228635637673984 2020-11-05 13:54:44 +0800 <MJEGames> Did you ever think people would voluntarily march to protest counting every vote?  #Election2020 #darktimeline #TrumpCult

1324206463359741953 2020-11-05 12:26:38 +0800 <MJEGames> @MrsLackey2 @pantomath__ @realDonaldTrump Who wants to tell her we've been voting by mail for decades and there has been no significant or provable voter fraud. However Republicans ARE well known to use voter suppresion tactics, by removing polling stations in minority communities and overburdening the ones that stay.

1324193012625285120 2020-11-05 11:33:11 +0800 <MJEGames> Link to the story in question. Donoghue's decision came in an hour before Trump began calling for the counts to be stopped.  @realDonaldTrump WILL NOT block constitutionally protected votes.  #CountEveryVote   https://t.co/abPlFQe9N2

1324186019680325633 2020-11-05 11:05:23 +0800 <MJEGames> @CrackheadBev @JoeBiden Its universally accepted that voter fraud is a myth. This was always just the false narrative of repubs in their continued effort to suppress the vote. They make it harder for minorities to vote by removing booths in critical areas.  Mail in voting has been secure for decades.
1324171335887593472 2020-11-05 10:07:03 +0800 <MJEGames> If Trump was the stable genius he thinks he is, or ACTUALLY cared about the republican party or platform he would shift gears and focus on winning the house and senate essentially blocking Bidens efficiency.   Instead hes busy trying to sow mistrust in the system.
1324167826525970433 2020-11-05 09:53:06 +0800 <MJEGames> @Lynnenallo Some still have no called some of the close races, CNN Fox and AP news have all conceded Michigan to Biden hence the discrepency.

1324157916820066305 2020-11-05 09:13:43 +0800 <MJEGames> @MERQIX @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Well I mean...one is thanking democracy and telling everyone to be patient and count every vote....The other one can't make a single post on facebook or twitter without it being flagged for blatant misrepresentation. Trump would never concede, but theres an GOOD chance hes lost.

It will likely be very late into the morning when we know but the Margin has shrunk to 44000 in GA #Biden2020   #IHaveWonPennsylvania
1324150236512620545 2020-11-05 08:43:12 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump has no defence, he feels the ground slipping from under him as Nevada holds, and margins shrink further and further in Georgia and Pa. What a Nail biter!  https://t.co/K8Q0OqigoP

1324116796962582529 2020-11-05 06:30:19 +0800 <MJEGames> @EricTrump Somehow that still isn't as bad as gutting the US postal service right before an election, removing the majority of polling stations in minority neighborhoods,  or suppressing the vote your father attempted.

1324112259774251014 2020-11-05 06:12:18 +0800 <MJEGames> LMAO WOW.....Trump really has deeply fooled the naive, as they continue to count Constitutonally protected Absentee and early votes.  REMEMBER it was the TRUMP CAMPAIGN and REPUB ALLIES who BLOCKED early processing of votes in PA to set themselves up for this very narrative.

1324079568077033472 2020-11-05 04:02:23 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump They arent finding them they are adding the total tally from the absentee votes THAT YOU BLOCKED EARLY PROCESSING OF in combat states like PA but not repub fortresses like georgia.   He set this narrative up.

Then THINK HARD about you mouthing off.  Second you need to figure it out, Take a look at the margins, Biden is still most likely to take a victory and Trump is still trailing. Senate/house still tight  https://t.co/i1SLNm2HJt
1323978220035694594 2020-11-04 21:19:40 +0800 <MJEGames> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump the gaps are closing, its a tight race. Biden still looking to have the most options to victory open to him still.  https://t.co/XGAImb8kEq

1323968128192139264 2020-11-04 20:39:34 +0800 <MJEGames> @Machine__Trader @TC_Schoenbeck @murray_nyc @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Maybe but  in Pittsburg, Montgomery and Philly Biden still has a decent lead and those are the larger populations in the state.   with close to 3 mill votes left to be tallied and absentee votes with valid postmarked dates will be counted up to Nov 12 In PA if I am not mistaken.
1323966534083960834 2020-11-04 20:33:14 +0800 <MJEGames> @VoteHimOutFFS Its still FAR from over, and Biden actually maintains the edge so far. He still has the most paths to victory as it stands now.
1323965716811243520 2020-11-04 20:29:59 +0800 <MJEGames> Interesting to watch Nevada and Wisconsin exchange leads, however Biden keeps a narrow lead on both, with many more votes still coming in major cities of Michigan, and PA.  https://t.co/IkJhlh6b1e

1323963480592900097 2020-11-04 20:21:06 +0800 <MJEGames> @realanshulmitra Also several states and counties are saying current numbers reflect in person voting only with absentee totals to be added later today or as late as thursday morning i.e Kenosha county and Nevada (former and later)
1323963267266433024 2020-11-04 20:20:15 +0800 <MJEGames> @realanshulmitra If Biden gets one more state (excluding Alaska) and keeps his leads in Nevada and Wisconsin he wins. This is a like having a queen and a jack the flop gives you a King and a ten all your waiting on is the ace or ten for your straight..... PA and Michigan are our Ace and 10.  https://t.co/I1zOS7ogN4
1323960243596877824 2020-11-04 20:08:14 +0800 <MJEGames> Ou those margins #Biden2020, #Election2020 Several states and counties still reporting no more posting until either later in the day or as late as tomorrow morning.   I am feeling good about Michigan this morning.  https://t.co/1x0ygIGeIa
1323957979557736449 2020-11-04 19:59:14 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump We could easily see this go on into Friday until we have a clear winner, and then the recounts, challenges and everything else.....Chins up everyone! Patience!
1323957799110414336 2020-11-04 19:58:31 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump He hasn't won anything yet. He knows the more absentee votes that come in the worse its going to get for him in those tight swing states.  But with Counties and States like Kenosha and Nevada not expecting to post further results until later in the day or Tomorrow morn for Nev...  https://t.co/wtJPnEgdyB
1323957104365854726 2020-11-04 19:55:46 +0800 <MJEGames> Goodness!! So how are you all going to cope for the next few days while @realDonaldTrump tries to sell that he won despite still technically trailing.
1323956660184907776 2020-11-04 19:54:00 +0800 <MJEGames> @murray_nyc @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump I should specify that Alaska isn't a factor here, even if Joe wins it the 3 electoral votes he get wont be enough, he NEEDS PA, Michigan at this point I think.
1323953877922668545 2020-11-04 19:42:57 +0800 <MJEGames> @Machine__Trader @TC_Schoenbeck @murray_nyc @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump lol Just keep watching, This is far from over yet.

Its getting closer still anyones race in Georgia, NC, AND Michigan. I would still expect recounts and challenges though, and the senate and house race remains neck in neck.  https://t.co/hCLwKKJMcw

There is a reason Trump crippled the US postal system. There is a reason Trump and republicans blocked PA from processing votes early but not Georgia.  Get out of the cult.

Trump blocked early processing of votes in Battles states like PA for this exact reason. He wants this narrative. Michigan says they need until friday to count every vote.   Far from over.
1323877501802749952 2020-11-04 14:39:27 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Fuck his statement hes going to pretend hes won while they still count the mail in votes.

1323847303241760768 2020-11-04 12:39:27 +0800 <MJEGames> @NoAgendaShop then use AP news they've only reported with 99.8 percent accuracy 2016 and more

1323117227793502208 2020-11-02 12:18:24 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Except that the trade deficit with China has only grown under Trump....  Despite all his fluff and claims otherwise.

1323068761184718854 2020-11-02 09:05:48 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump is a #Criminal pure and simple. Hes left a bread crumb trail as far back as 1973 with repeated cases of sexism, racism, discrimination, fraud, rape, tax evasion, divisionism, he has openly tried to violate YOURE rights while he lines his own pockets.
1323068115018633216 2020-11-02 09:03:14 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Scare tactics. Gun control and regulation paired with proper mental health care structure doesnt mean you lose your second amendment. It means children can safely go to school without the constant fear of another mass shooting.  It only works literally everywhere else.

Heres why: 32% drop of a much larger number is still way more of a loss than a 33% rise of a much smaller number.....  Thats like pecentages 101.... This is the same reason most Americans think 3/5s is larger than 2/3rds....
1322765900148137985 2020-11-01 13:02:21 +0800 <MJEGames> @Sheepdogs_Rock @JoeBiden mhm. Now do the Fraud part. Noticed you carefully danced around that. Fucking cult man...

1322618839075450880 2020-11-01 03:17:58 +0800 <MJEGames> @kamalas_a_witch @Candour99 @realDonaldTrump You do know that the "laptop" turned out to be a "hard drive" of which lacked so much credibility that not even fox news would pick up the story and NY post only did so if the author didnt have to post their name on the article right?

1322472284519424001 2020-10-31 17:35:37 +0800 <MJEGames> @EricTrump You forgot to fill in all your families crimes, rapes, and tax evasion over the years. Here I linked it for you.   https://t.co/wtEJ1tAppl
1322471625858535424 2020-10-31 17:33:00 +0800 <MJEGames> @Sheepdogs_Rock @JoeBiden Fraid not. 750 twice and nothing any other year. Reported massive losses for taxes and massive gains for loans aka fraud. Don't pretend that isnt why he didnt want you to see them.  His "I prepaid them in millions" line is as garbage as his "dont blame me blame the system" line.

1322387395258380293 2020-10-31 11:58:18 +0800 <MJEGames> @NotLoon Since 1973..... Tsk tsk....
1322387290237280258 2020-10-31 11:57:53 +0800 <MJEGames> @NotLoon Yep... Soon the serial criminal, conman, rapist, pedo, tax fraud, liar, draft dodging,  racist, transphobic, sexist narcissist can finally go to jail.   https://t.co/wtEJ1tAppl
1322386723284815875 2020-10-31 11:55:38 +0800 <MJEGames> @Sheepdogs_Rock @JoeBiden He still paid more taxes than Trump over the last 15 years.

1322385679184089089 2020-10-31 11:51:29 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump I agree, go vote for #Biden2020
1322383861242712064 2020-10-31 11:44:15 +0800 <MJEGames> @USATODAY I mean it looks nothing like her half the time but k.
1322340668979601408 2020-10-31 08:52:38 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Its between a compulsive incompetent liar, serial criminal, rapist and pedo and then @JoeBiden.
1322340162777485313 2020-10-31 08:50:37 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump The election should "end" when ALL the votes are counted.

Ive got some bad news for you.
1322252310521671680 2020-10-31 03:01:31 +0800 <MJEGames> @GOP @realDonaldTrump This is such a blatant lie to distract the uneducated or those bad at math.  GDP fell 32% before rising 33.1%.....heres the thing with percentages though:  32% of a much larger number is greater than 33% of a much smaller number. This means net we still lost more than we gained
1322251652682842112 2020-10-31 02:58:54 +0800 <MJEGames> @GOP @realDonaldTrump Pure propaganda smear tactics. If I wasnt already not going to vote for you running a campaign on the faults of others and not any actual platforms is THE FASTEST way to lose my vote.
1322251279708479489 2020-10-31 02:57:25 +0800 <MJEGames> @GOP @realDonaldTrump Ooooo peace treaties in places that werent even fighting....quick nominate him for another nobel.... Fuck off.
1322251098153865217 2020-10-31 02:56:42 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Remember when the Trump admin tried to list "defeated Covid" as a list of accomplishments even though we are seeing record numbers daily. Bigger than weve ever seen before, they tell me, believe me. Never been seen before him.
1322250639871676416 2020-10-31 02:54:53 +0800 <MJEGames> @DahlELama2 @GOPChairwoman Actually even FoxNews wouldnt touch the story and NY post only did under the condition that the authors name not be linked to it because it lacked THAT much credibility.  Its a pathetic scam and Rudy literally got caught with his hands in his pants.
1322250214804127744 2020-10-31 02:53:12 +0800 <MJEGames> @KoellerRonny @GOPChairwoman Its literally happening under Trump and his gaslit GOP propaganda machine.
1322250022633705472 2020-10-31 02:52:26 +0800 <MJEGames> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING THERE. Not one bit of credible information came from the fake and clearly desperate "scandal"...  Pathetic really.
1322249454980788224 2020-10-31 02:50:10 +0800 <MJEGames> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Is that #FakeMelania again? It doesnt really look like her.

1322047473590824960 2020-10-30 13:27:34 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump For years the USA is going to be apologizing for letting a serial criminal conman rapist lead the country via nepotism and incompetence losing face across the entire globe.
1322046894118375425 2020-10-30 13:25:16 +0800 <MJEGames> @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump was planning a 250 MILLION dollar campaign vetting celebrities for political views to seek endorsements to paint Trumps response to Covid. 250 celebrities THAT WERE SPECIFICALLY CHOSEN TO SAY YES told the Trump campaign to eff off.   https://t.co/FoShpg3w2l
1321908006779453440 2020-10-30 04:13:23 +0800 <MJEGames> @reptile45 @mygibsonlady @JoeBiden You know who has even less credibilty than eveb this B.s. desperate fake scandal?  Tucker god damn Carlson.   https://t.co/bsUlytI9E5
1321907676398280704 2020-10-30 04:12:04 +0800 <MJEGames> @mygibsonlady @JoeBiden You realize he hasnt been president the last 4 years right?
1321864054856577025 2020-10-30 01:18:44 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Every vote cast on or before the election date should be counted. Period.   Stop trying to undermine the election via fraud and voter intimidation.
1321855844523237376 2020-10-30 00:46:06 +0800 <MJEGames> @ByronYork @realDonaldTrump Thats sort of cherry picking the details....   So I guess were in the "okay fine its true he did that, but its not that bad" part of the cults stages of denial.
1321853346047647744 2020-10-30 00:36:11 +0800 <MJEGames> @SanuroSwordsman @fabjoseph21 @JustAManic2020 @pablo_honey1 @realDonaldTrump Buddy.... You need to take a math refresher course. Particularly regarding percentages.  32% (loss) of a large number is still more of a loss than the 33% growth of a much smaller number....   If you still dont get it, I'd love to give you a "low interest" loan.
1321852572039217152 2020-10-30 00:33:06 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump "Best in history": 33% of a higher number is more than 32% from a smaller number.... The drop was taller than the climb.  No wonder you went bankrupt so often.
1321851501942198272 2020-10-30 00:28:51 +0800 <MJEGames> @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends As if the President who doesnt read intel reports is reading these books the same day they come out....
1321850977658437632 2020-10-30 00:26:46 +0800 <MJEGames> @SanuroSwordsman @JustAManic2020 @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump The GDP went up 33% after falling 32%. If you understood math, you'd know that it fell more than it rose.  32% of a higher number is larger than 33% of a much smaller number....you might as well be wearing the dunce cap with this tweet.
1321850316942270464 2020-10-30 00:24:09 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Preeeetty sure our numbers are still negative...  https://t.co/WxkGTcDXRa

1321709267754180608 2020-10-29 15:03:40 +0800 <MJEGames> @sohmer Mostly it scares me because of this....   https://t.co/bsUlytI9E5
1321651536234078208 2020-10-29 11:14:15 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Who?
1321553579656663040 2020-10-29 04:45:01 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Because that isn't how algorithms work, and nobody is buying your #FakeScandal.
1321529185165213696 2020-10-29 03:08:05 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump It lacks so much credibility that Fox News wouldnt even take the story from Guilliani.   #FakeScandal from a #FakePresident.
1321528176950956033 2020-10-29 03:04:04 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump What....a....narcisstic douchebag.
1321527671335972864 2020-10-29 03:02:04 +0800 <MJEGames> @RealJamesWoods @MuhammadAlassa6 James woods is a washed up racist. Like I care about his opinion.

1321527048691544065 2020-10-29 02:59:35 +0800 <MJEGames> @Marcelo77931223 @Brixea @realDonaldTrump Now do the #Centralpark5 or the hundreds od coloured people Trump refused to rent to until he was sued and charged, then do the unfounded claima muslims were cheering on the planes in 911, then do his blacks vs whites race war episode pitch, then do "shitworld countries"......
1321526522755174401 2020-10-29 02:57:30 +0800 <MJEGames> @Brixea @MisfitZeppelin Definitely not bots... Nothing to see here. Nope nothing at all move along.  https://t.co/RhFueFDdx7
1321526264037920768 2020-10-29 02:56:28 +0800 <MJEGames> @MisfitZeppelin Except that again.... This was all after Biden left office, was all 100% legal, and has already been investigated TWICE. Trump and #FauxNews tend to leave that part out while they desperately use their smear tactics campaign.
1321525833043861504 2020-10-29 02:54:46 +0800 <MJEGames> @stan4_america @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Except that literally EVERYTHING he mentioned he specifically said took place AFTER Biden left office and actually further nailed the lid shut on the whole no wrong doing case.
1321525428041912320 2020-10-29 02:53:09 +0800 <MJEGames> @reaves2021 @cktailgrl @News3LV @realDonaldTrump Also I'd point out this, when it comes to fox "news" and their credibility.   https://t.co/bsUlytI9E5
1321525146629271552 2020-10-29 02:52:02 +0800 <MJEGames> @reaves2021 @cktailgrl @News3LV @realDonaldTrump Right...in which we found out that everything he was talking about took place AFTER Biden left office and once again pointed to no wrong doing.
1321524816277483520 2020-10-29 02:50:43 +0800 <MJEGames> @News3LV @realDonaldTrump THEY ALREADY DID.... This is pure propaganda.
1321524710329380869 2020-10-29 02:50:18 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump ...then he gains control over the flow of information. Next hell try to censor the news or push his own network again.
1321524507895422978 2020-10-29 02:49:30 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Hes been attacking the press since day 1 for two reasons.  1. Hes left a criminal bread crumb trail all the way back to 1973.  2. They are a check and balance, in America free press holds the President accountable. If he undermines them like every other "great" dictator...
1321523748579667968 2020-10-29 02:46:29 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Because it is a #FakeScandal from a #FakePresident. It lacks any and all credibility and was laughed at by your own hand picked head of intelligence. You are so desperate even the cult can sense it.
1321360268824207360 2020-10-28 15:56:52 +0800 <MJEGames> @RealTribble Like fox news you are just trying to twist reality to suit your desires.   https://t.co/bsUlytI9E5
1321360080541863936 2020-10-28 15:56:07 +0800 <MJEGames> @RealTribble Boblunksi first of all is referencing a deal that happened AFTER Biden left office. Its a #FakeScandal and a desperate play by the Trump propaganda campaign. Theres nothing there &amp; if you were paying attention at all its been thoroughly investigated with zero wrong doing found.
1321359283502473216 2020-10-28 15:52:57 +0800 <MJEGames> @MuhammadAlassa6 @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Try again... This wasnt even english.

1321357940385697792 2020-10-28 15:47:37 +0800 <MJEGames> @Inparadisez3 @realDonaldTrump Found the bot.
1321357805685633026 2020-10-28 15:47:05 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump I see a #SuperSpreader and then @JoeBiden leading by example.  https://t.co/wUsAnRkA4u
1321354756145573894 2020-10-28 15:34:58 +0800 <MJEGames> @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Remember when Fox News won a legal battle by stating that no one actually believes Tucker Carlson therefore they are not legally responsible for what he says, despite how misleading or inaccurate or what a bold faced lie it might be?  Cause I do.
1321145215533469701 2020-10-28 01:42:19 +0800 <MJEGames> @ChuckCallesto @realDonaldTrump I prefer this one:   https://t.co/NUbgPZtNRh
1321143780053938176 2020-10-28 01:36:37 +0800 <MJEGames> @SKYTelecomWy Except that republic handpicked Inspector general said: ""We did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced (the) decision to open Crossfire Hurricane," the Inspector General's 2019 report said."

Heres the difference: Obama did it to rescue abused children being used to garner sympathy to get them across the border when there was no actual relation.  Trump wanted to use it as a deterrent, and packed the buildings so full...

1313840346510495745 2020-10-07 21:55:23 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump You exacerbated this mess with your divisionism and rhetoric. Whatever narrative racist James Woods is going for here doesn't shine a good look on you either pal.
1313828413803651072 2020-10-07 21:07:58 +0800 <MJEGames> @rdbrewer4 "Donald Trump on Thursday suggested that the Democratic candidate for president "probably" received “immunity” in the case"  Fuck me you fell right for the real fake news and propaganda didn't you? Use what's between those ears mate.
1313827683269111808 2020-10-07 21:05:04 +0800 <MJEGames> @rdbrewer4 You mean the 5 aides supposedly given immunity? She was never given immunity they found no wrong doing. Full stop.  Meanwhile Ivanka and Kushner have been told SEVERAL TIMES to stop doing exactly what they are accusing her of.   But but but their emails?!?!
1313827118703210496 2020-10-07 21:02:49 +0800 <MJEGames> @vrosen11 She says as the cult tries to villianize antifa literally the political stance to stand against and prevent fascism like Hitlers to ever exist ever again.  As they attack civil rights movements life #BLM yet praise white supremacists like the Proud boys.   Real cute.
1313826710014447616 2020-10-07 21:01:12 +0800 <MJEGames> @vrosen11 @wanaoni_michael Remember when he tried to say he couldn't have said those things because he was on the phone with Melania.....who was sitting in the same vehicle with him the while time?   Wake up he doesn't care, the question is do you?
1313826163576303616 2020-10-07 20:59:01 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump I can't believe the distraction plan they are going with is once again "The Mueller report is fake" when we all know damn well Barr tried to mischaracterize it and bury it.

1311606996580339712 2020-10-01 18:00:51 +0800 <MJEGames> @Lucas_Gatti_ARG @glamelegance @realDonaldTrump There's nothing fraudulent about a third party printing firm admitting and rectifying a mistake. This has nothing to do with political correctness so I don't know why you brought that up.... The ballots can't be used. That's the end of it. Nice verbal diarrhea.

Biden acted presidential and clearly won the first round. When Trump was spewing lies, ignoring the very debate rules he agreed to, talking over bidens 2 minutes Biden addressed the American people directly.  #TrumpHasNoPlan.
1311358845239914503 2020-10-01 01:34:47 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Trumps executive orders does nothing. The drug prices have not changed. Its a symbolic gesture worth the paper its written on.  It takes congress to enact a bill to lower Drug prices.

Proud boys are an organization, labeled as domestic terrorists &amp; called for the violence to stop altogether

1311337540813811712 2020-10-01 00:10:07 +0800 <MJEGames> @MattsBanjo You aren't even informed enough to understand antifa is a collection of organizations. All with varying ideologies.   He did not denounce them he said he would &amp; then when prompted by both Joe and Wallace he stopped himself &amp; refused instead telling them to stand down &amp; stand by.
1311337052693319681 2020-10-01 00:08:11 +0800 <MJEGames> @MattsBanjo Biden literally pointed out Trumps own staffs take on it.
1311336887160909829 2020-10-01 00:07:32 +0800 <MJEGames> @MattsBanjo Do the whole thing. Wallace corrected Trump in that homicides and violence was seen just as prevalent in Republican states as it was in Democratic ones.   There are literally tapes man.
1311336440052289536 2020-10-01 00:05:45 +0800 <MJEGames> @MattsBanjo He literally said and I quote "Stop the violence. Violence is never the answer." By trumps own HANDPICKED director of FBI:Antifa is an idea, a political stance of being anti facist. It is not an organization but a collection.  Proud boys on the other hand are dosmetic terrorists.
1311335264120434692 2020-10-01 00:01:05 +0800 <MJEGames> @charcomanhoard @realDonaldTrump I don't know how any sane person could say they are voting for Trump after that debacle.

1311333773196308481 2020-09-30 23:55:09 +0800 <MJEGames> @MattsBanjo Oh come on. That's not at all how it happened. Trump was the only one who couldn't follow the structure of a the debate in which he agreed to.   Trump had NUMEROUS opportunities and chose again and again not to condemn them and instead to stand by for the election results....

What Biden does want is to give businesses/infrastructure the tools &amp; ability to open properly &amp; correctly in the safest/most effective way possible

1311314896408195072 2020-09-30 22:40:09 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Remember that time when Trump said the sheriff of Portland endorsed him only for the sheriff to come out and say he would NEVER and has NEVER supported Trump?
1311314584842665984 2020-09-30 22:38:54 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump That was super embarrassing for you #TrumpHasNoPlan. One person through a hissy fit and one person had a debate. Joe clearly won the first debate. Joe clearly addressed and appealed to the American people Trump tried to make it a circus.
1311313948952670209 2020-09-30 22:36:23 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Joe also has a very detailed and laid out plan to grow the green energy sector creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process and reducing our carbon footprint by 2035.   #TrumpHasNoPlan.
1311313712582742023 2020-09-30 22:35:26 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Joe went on to say there would be more environmental restrictions on fracking but that he absolutely was not against it.
1311313583410642944 2020-09-30 22:34:55 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Again false. The GOP used McConnell to block Obamas picks to pack the supreme court themselves the dems COULD but have not committed to packing the lower courts by raising the total appointees while in office.
1311313076503941120 2020-09-30 22:32:55 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump "He won't even say law and order"  "Yes I will, I've always been law and order. We need law and order but we also need transparency I want to increase funding to the police"  "See he won't say law and order, he won't say it"  Is EXACTLY how it played out last night.
1311312668490452992 2020-09-30 22:31:17 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump Wrong you just couldn't follow the rules of the debate and were too busy throwing a hissy fit to hear him. He literally said "I am for law and order and against defunding the police."
1311312301513900035 2020-09-30 22:29:50 +0800 <MJEGames> @Stuuked @USATODAY He didn't answer. He avoided answering as usual.
1311312070923759616 2020-09-30 22:28:55 +0800 <MJEGames> @OjoAcido @USATODAY Right.... Because Trumps "art of the deal" has worked out sooooooo well up till now.   One person through a hissy fit the other had a debate.

1311307031773679618 2020-09-30 22:08:53 +0800 <MJEGames> @LisaTurnage12 @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump Actually he pointed out that TRUMPS HANDPICKED head of the FBI said antifa is an idea not a dosmetic terrorist group however he DID label the proud boys as cosmetic terrorists.   He never said anything else. In fact he implored the violence to stop and to come together unified.

This is a pathetic game being played by Trump out of desperation. They never argued ear piece inspections they never asked for any breaks. He's openly lieing in your face AGAIN.

1310930913619046400 2020-09-29 21:14:20 +0800 <MJEGames> @triggeringU5150 "Trump has elaborated that he has been audited for a consecutive "twelve years or something like that." In 2016, Trump's tax attorneys have stated that Trump has been under audit since 2002."  They are. His days are numbered.
1310928520873377792 2020-09-29 21:04:49 +0800 <MJEGames> @triggeringU5150 Totally normal to write off nearly a million dollars in "consulting fees" only to shuffle that money over to Ivanka. Oh wait thats tax evasion.
1310928334952566785 2020-09-29 21:04:05 +0800 <MJEGames> @triggeringU5150 Right because its totally normal to report staggering losses for taxes &amp; tremendous profits for loans...oh wait that's fraud. Its totally normal to get 72.9 million in tax refunds you don't deserve. Oh wait that's fraud and YOUR MONEY.  Totally normal not to pay taxes in 10 yrs..

1310926568332685314 2020-09-29 20:57:04 +0800 <MJEGames> @Rosie76597954 That's because there is no real evidence in the film. It is illegal to buy whom someone votes for it is not illegal to give them cash and instructions on how to fill out an absentee ballot. You'll note not once did he tell the person in question who/what party he should vote for.
1310925661872304128 2020-09-29 20:53:28 +0800 <MJEGames> @Project_Veritas Notice he isn't telling him how(who to vote for) to vote which is about the only thing that would be illegal here. Giving instructions on how to fill it out and how to vote properly is not illegal.   There is no evidence here. Its a "gotcha" out of context piece at best.
1310924637132460032 2020-09-29 20:49:23 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump To be clear there is no evidence any dem OR Omar actually paid anyone for votes, instead there is a video of a single campaign staff talking about how money is the true motivator behind politicians motives &amp; showing the absentee ballots he collected.  I don't really care do you?
1310923769402269697 2020-09-29 20:45:57 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump In case your wondering what this distraction is about they are complaining that one of Omar's staff had more than 3 absentee ballots on them at any given time.   Its illegal to pay to influence someones vote. It is surprisingly not illegal to pay them just to vote period though.
1310922506304458752 2020-09-29 20:40:55 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump @CNN Pretty sure they are busy reporting on the 790k "consulting fee" you gave her to write off as a business expenditure......FRAUD. Pure and simple.

1305669135494311936 2020-09-15 08:45:54 +0800 <MJEGames> @TheRealKennySey Meanwhile Trump is laughing about all those times he had Epstein and Maxwell at the Mar Largo recruiting underage girls while they partied.   Trump on Russian bounties on USA soldiers? Not a peep. Trump on Kashaggi murder? Great people, strong leader... Maxwell? Wish her well!  https://t.co/4cE4rl8Wvm

1301602306668912641 2020-09-04 03:25:47 +0800 <MJEGames> @realDonaldTrump King of the drift "President" Trump uses gas and force for a photo op with a bible.... He fakes stories like this:  https://t.co/ikvPU2nGCC  To fool the naive in his cult. He is a liar and a #Conman #FakePresident

1300700247916605440 2020-09-01 15:41:19 +0800 <MJEGames> @smith_jcase @Candour99 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @seanhannity Lol THATS the point. It exacerbates existing conditions and youre just too childish to think of those at risk while ironically using an ignorant and incorrect Fox News line. You are so wrong on so many levels whether there was other conditions or not covid was still a factor.  https://t.co/yvvPIWCiHT
