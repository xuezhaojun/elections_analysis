1324622756521168896 2020-11-06 16:00:50 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @SebGorka So when fraud cases get to the courts and these vids and pics are submitted as evidence, what will the tech giants do then? I so wish msm would do their job.
1324619492933083136 2020-11-06 15:47:52 +0800 <KiranaeRose> Remember when Trump said his campaign was spied on &amp; MSM heads cried "he says these things w/no proof! He's making it up! He's lying!"  And then we found out it was always true?  Do you know of other examples? Pls share
1324615981969362945 2020-11-06 15:33:54 +0800 <KiranaeRose> So many of these. If this isn't addressed legally, we have no government. Investigate, arrest, imprison. Whatever side you're on voter fraud is real and If our law enforcement does nothing, we the people must. Call your reps!!

Been proven time &amp; again so that can't be the real reason. JB has proven he is racist many, many times against more than one race. You want to like him. That's fine, just be honest about it.

1315005265494843393 2020-10-11 03:04:21 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @TheBishop1776 @JoshuaVats My study bible says taking his name in vain is referring to taking an oath by swearing- "I swear to ___ I will ___." So yeah, maybe so. There's plenty of other scripture for clarification. Let your yes be yes and your no be no. No need to say more than that.

1314999322925314050 2020-10-11 02:40:44 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @Sherathorington Begins Monday. Mom and I will be there when it begins. Yay! Pray for step-dad. He's a Trumper but says its obviously rigged, wreaking in corruption &amp; fraud and his vote won't matter. Overwhelming evidence. Hard to argue that.

1314732742198865922 2020-10-10 09:01:26 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @ChristIsComing4 Well said.

It was used here to drive his point home. More effective when its used by someone who rarely says it. Especially during a public speaking situation
1314727746065571840 2020-10-10 08:41:35 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @CrysAnderson1 @zach4vikings That made me laugh. Ty. An intelligent person who curses a lot prolly said that as an "expert". Lol

1314411801552056320 2020-10-09 11:46:08 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @Scoobyluff Especially the women, they're the worst. Kammy reminds me of the mean girls in h.s. who thought they were better than others cuz her Daddy had money. Remember that bubble headed, cheerleader? "Look at me! I'm so awesome and you're so not". She went on to be an actress, lol

Fights even for those who hate him.  Apologies, I couldn't narrow to just one word. Trump 2020

1314397574498070528 2020-10-09 10:49:36 +0800 <KiranaeRose> Well the nxt debate monitor has shown his true colors.  I'd really like to see Tim Pool monitor. Joe Rogan would be entertaining, no doubt, but Tim would be fair to both sides and would ask questions that we would want to ask. What do y'all think? @Timcast
1313142171357323264 2020-10-05 23:41:05 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @JoshuaVats I prayed about this right after I committed to him. I admitted I was afraid. He reminded me of his promises. Fight fear with the Word. He's with us to the end. Death, where is your sting?

It's ridiculous to believe this was all put in place in the last 3 years. Trump declared war on them the day he said he would drain the swamp. Then they (dems &amp; rinos) freaked out and have shown themselves as they really are.

Trump is the 1st president I've seen try to fight against it. Things are crazy cuz the old guard is being challenged. Why do you think they've gone after him so hard? Using playbook of lies &amp; now violence.

Our school system is a mess, teaching point of view instead of facts. Sending our young people to fight wars that push a pol agenda. Our sons and daughters dying to fill their pockets.

I prayed about it and I felt within me these words: I am God and I have forgiven you because I love you. Now you must forgive what I have, you are not wiser than God. Also, scripture says forgiveness covers a multitude of sins. You are greatly loved!

He did not stop the death of that theifs body which was mandated by the government.  AND Jesus didn't come to change the law of God in OT, but to fulfill it. Teachings of Christ were based on OT. ALL of the Bible counts!

1308465365861773312 2020-09-23 01:57:07 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @Georgia51931 @OD_ant Yes, but if he hadn't put Fauci out in front most of us wouldn't have heard of him much less researched his past. So there's that. He's been exposed. NEXT!
1308459821411241991 2020-09-23 01:35:06 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @miles_commodore I'd really like to see the Joe Rogan debate. I'd let the other slide without complaint if I could see that.
1308458289991217154 2020-09-23 01:29:00 +0800 <KiranaeRose> Very possible bordering on probable. I did dream last week that I heard the news saying he had dropped due to health reason. So real I thought it was a memory at first. Blamed it on info overload and too much theorizing.
1308428965611286529 2020-09-22 23:32:29 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @ChiefG4LSU @JoshuaVats It is amazing
1308428542804451328 2020-09-22 23:30:48 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @JoshuaVats Genesis. Reading the whole Bible again from beginning to end
1308324329826861056 2020-09-22 16:36:42 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @JohnGuyeski @Lrihendry @antsabq @realDonaldTrump Watch the video. He was defending himself from one who tried to use a skateboard as a weapon and the other was coming at him with a gun. Facts are more effective in arguments than emotions.
1308314984632389633 2020-09-22 15:59:34 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @JoeBiden Us? I don't wanna be mean, but I don't think you are one of "the forgotten people" he was talking about.
1308314155036807168 2020-09-22 15:56:16 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @BannedDeplorab1 Here. Sitting outside in Texas. Light rain, really red sky. Its not very dark. Looks almost not real
1307817230646865921 2020-09-21 07:01:40 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @JoshuaVats I remember that I was once enslaved to deceptions and someone prayed for me for 20 yrs of no contact with me. I found her to tell her and we wept for joy. There is still hope for them and so we pray. When I have difficulty praying for them, I remember this dear sister's faith.
1307454012522987522 2020-09-20 06:58:22 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @FlorioGina I think so, but maybe not like some would think. Take a closer look. Many are forming our own study groups leaving the church system behind. 1st century Christian style.
1307449064036929544 2020-09-20 06:38:42 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @ellllljayy My brother is my dearest friend.

1306884803749449728 2020-09-18 17:16:32 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @TasteLikeGravy @jooooody @PurrringPatriot @FREEDOMWWGIWGA That's when God resurrected him from the dead. He appeared to roughly 500 ppl after that, then ascended to heaven. Promised to return again to set up his kingdom on earth.
1306395493040300033 2020-09-17 08:52:11 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @LightoftheStar @GodsLoveFamous My thoughts too. So much to learn!
1306363366814949376 2020-09-17 06:44:32 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @amo_mokwena Yay!
1306002370397171713 2020-09-16 06:50:04 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @votivateusa @clortho_vince @ScottAdamsSays Are you saying that Jared &amp; Ivanka are evil? Maybe I've misunderstood. I'm not aware of any provable crimes they've committed. Are you? Or are you talking about their character?
1306000688158302210 2020-09-16 06:43:23 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @votivateusa @TheCreditGuyTV @ScottAdamsSays It's been promised by every POTUS I can remember including this one. President Trump is the only one to get it to happen. So, yes I believe he's responsible.
1305999363173482496 2020-09-16 06:38:07 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @votivateusa @clortho_vince @ScottAdamsSays Likability is not the reason. Trump isn't always likeable. Its the job that they do, or don't do. And the obvious criminal acts so many keep getting away with. On both sides. So many have been fired or resigned, kinda like a swamp being drained.
1305998336349138945 2020-09-16 06:34:02 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @labrat341 @votivateusa @ScottAdamsSays Asking for people to share their views is not interference. Its exactly what we've been trying to achieve. This person has been polite, responsive &amp; positive and I, for one, am thankful for the effort.
1305993802583244801 2020-09-16 06:16:01 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @pokemonduodenum @MysticManifest9 @AKkevi7 @SenSchumer Look it up on YouTube. He has said it at least twice. You can watch and listen to the man himself. Look up recent press conferences.
1305860039605915649 2020-09-15 21:24:29 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @KiousErica Biblically prophesied to occur with unprecedented weather upheavals during the last part of the end of the age.
1305598705060532227 2020-09-15 04:06:02 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @mr_squeege I was the black sheep until I became a Christian. Now I'm not considered "bad", but just weird. I'm ok with that.
1304656605426974726 2020-09-12 13:42:28 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @golmalfans I'm seeing this tweet coming from several people. So obvious. The wording and all is exactly the same.

1303855852093308933 2020-09-10 08:40:34 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @cjtruth Joseph. His family turned on him, sold him into slavery. He becomes prime minister in the nation that bought him. He forgives &amp; saves his family and they all love each other from then on. Beautiful foreshadow of Jesus.
1303853691485728769 2020-09-10 08:31:59 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @2020winagain @realTT2020 @cjtruth Read the whole book of Job. He went thru the worst of experiences, but never turned from or cursed God and he was blessed beyond his loss.

1302043106452353024 2020-09-05 08:37:22 +0800 <KiranaeRose> @PowerReclaim Yes, it's fascinating. What if I told you much of it is in code?
