1310744454874136579 2020-09-29 08:53:25 +0800 <sportballplayer> Franco was also close with Cuba and later, China. And the relationship with the U.S. was late into his regime, and shortly after liberalization had begun. It was a pragmatic, purely economic move since he was diplomatically isolated, including by the U.S., for pro-Axis views.
