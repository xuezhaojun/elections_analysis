1333501610941702146 2020-12-01 04:02:13 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @anitambyrne The tweet is a bit deceptive as it actually underemphasises level of public opinion in favour of restrictions to bring number of infections down. 71% say Level 5 is good and another 10% on top of that say it is not enough!
1333500807841538056 2020-12-01 03:59:02 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Burying the lede with the 71 % headline. An overwhelming 81+%! think level 5 is either appropriate or not enough. These people will be getting pretty angry when lockdown three kicks in as a result of catering to the wishes of business interests, restaurateurs and publicans.

1332761512428056576 2020-11-29 03:01:20 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Hermann Kelly and Dolores Cahill are now trying to position thenselves as the acceptable face of the far right in Ireland and they have mostly managed to date to avoid media scrutiny and criticism. They should be given no quarter.

1328674486141513730 2020-11-17 20:20:57 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> I see Hermannoid is spouting absolute garbage about the IFR of COVID 19 on his twitter. Global IFR is .6% according to the WHO. IFR in Ireland I believe is very approximately .8% because of older age profile of population. Hermannoid says .23% is global IFR. He is full of shit.

1328340271340392454 2020-11-16 22:12:54 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @dubhster @Palari_Palari He campaigned during runup to presidential election with slogan 'Ireland First' and spouted the far-right talking points about Balbriggan.

1328308364099661824 2020-11-16 20:06:07 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> The date of the rally is a few days before the intended end of the level 5 restrictions. I would guess Hermannoid is betting on the authorities turning a blind eye because it will happen as heavy restrictions are coming to an end.
1328306288913248257 2020-11-16 19:57:52 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Pretty sad place for Kevin Sharkey to end up - the token black man providing the lipstick for a bunch of out and out white supremacist pigs.
1328305700540477440 2020-11-16 19:55:32 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> This is shaping up to be a straight up gathering of the far-right tribes.

1328304276989501440 2020-11-16 19:49:52 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> I would think shoving Dolores Cahill into the national media is the key aim of this rally. She is a danger to public health and part of an international far-right attempt to disrupt public health initiatives:  https://t.co/n3f0jPnz9G

1326140089374740481 2020-11-10 20:30:10 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> It is looking to me like Paul Cullen's weird article with its strange lack of detail may have been his way of not giving this oxygen.
1326139729809727489 2020-11-10 20:28:44 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> In article Cummins states that group behind white paper have funding for advertising and will be linking in with the 'Great Barrington Declaration' people.
1326139268062973953 2020-11-10 20:26:54 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Seems this group of doctors is the one Ivor Cummins has - as mentioned in this article - been talking to:  https://t.co/dEhJw7SvsB

1326121836153868288 2020-11-10 19:17:38 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Have you any concerns about the fact that the only public SM account of this 'group' seems very familiar with Qanon conspiracies?  https://t.co/RgA7HCKLsk

1326076302944841728 2020-11-10 16:16:42 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Important thread. Irish Times looking totally shambolic or worse.

1320781276534759429 2020-10-27 01:36:09 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @gemmentedod1 Headmelting. 1. There was a protest Thursday. He was 'organiser' of that - publicly anyway. Another protest was called for Saturday and he was going to be a speaker. On the day before - Friday - on his FB he said 'if I get arrested - come protest Copshop'.
1320763021111820292 2020-10-27 00:23:37 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @gemmentedod1 The guy who was arrested asked people on friday on his facebook  stream to gather at the Copshop IF he was arrested on Saturday! All too surreal. They had their man already.

1318549786388287489 2020-10-20 21:49:01 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Another one. Has the Irish government communicated with South Korea, Vietnam, New Zealand governments while strategising?
1318549334825324544 2020-10-20 21:47:13 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Another basic question. At that time in March Leo V. said we were going to be 'aligning our strategy' with that of the UK. Is this still the position of the Irish government?
1318546785464442880 2020-10-20 21:37:05 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> I have seldom if at all seen this commented on or discussed. It certainly was not publicly discussed to any meaningful degree when Leo V. made his March lockdown speech. Is b) above still the strategy? Anyone?
1318545996369039360 2020-10-20 21:33:57 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Journalists please ask basic questions about national COVID strategy. One key one would be - Is the present strategy to  a) contain the virus - or is it b) to delay and mitigate the spread of the virus? In March when we locked down Leo V. snuck in a change of policy from a to b.

AFAIK it is illegal to organise a public gathering of more than 15 people at the minute. What is the point of legislation if it is not used!
1317392233713238016 2020-10-17 17:09:19 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @mechtranicus Not that I know of. There was a pop up event there maybe a week ago notably featuring Dee Wall coughing on people. It was small and barely publicised in advance - thus my mention of Galway.
1317391151033421824 2020-10-17 17:05:01 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Spread the word please. It is good to see these crew being forced in places like Cork and Galway to call events at extremely short notice. They are in fear of giving decent people time to mobilise against them.
1317390169083944961 2020-10-17 17:01:06 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @davidjthunder And of course like all of your ilk you specialise in moving goalposts. We got the situation from rampant to almost eliminated once and that can be done again with political will.
1317389782272671744 2020-10-17 16:59:34 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @BertMac81197913 @davidjthunder Life is a job Bert. Your face does not wash itself.
1317389530035531776 2020-10-17 16:58:34 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @davidjthunder The choice to allow the virus to 'move' again post summer was a political one. Not an inevitability. Political choices can and do change.
1317389088350240770 2020-10-17 16:56:49 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Fascist IFP event planned for Cork tomorrow.  https://t.co/uJBhYR87lM
1317377228188098565 2020-10-17 16:09:41 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @davidjthunder We got it down to very tiny levels earlier this year without even shutting borders. You are full of sxxt and bad advice.
1317373402584317952 2020-10-17 15:54:29 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @DeclanWaugh @irishexaminer @CormacJOKeeffe Are you comparing the 1916 revolutionists with pond scum fascists like Chopper O'Keefe?  https://t.co/IDKBrSVNDh
1317142101772111879 2020-10-17 00:35:23 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Decent piece. Points out the worrying fact that garda sources talking to metia seem intent on incorrectly portraying yellowvests and their present campaign as somehow legitimate but subject to infiltration by fascists.

1317015424941383681 2020-10-16 16:12:00 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @curlymo_99 I think for once no marches this weekend.

1316444484146733063 2020-10-15 02:23:18 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @glenndoyledkit Back when she had youtube channel - probably September last year off the top of my head. There was an attack on a young girl wearing a hijab in a dublin suburb.
1316428665413160961 2020-10-15 01:20:26 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> She should have been lifted the day she said 'burn every hijab you see'.  Imagine -  she got to say that without an ounce of media scrutiny.

1315692394113830913 2020-10-13 00:34:45 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @Unisaur64 Also at time Murphy was describing himself as a National Socialist on his Twitter bio. That's a bit hard to ignore.
1315691360519888896 2020-10-13 00:30:39 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @Unisaur64 I personally presented him with all this in more detail than I can recall now on the phone (said I was a journalist) and he had little to nothing to say. He did ring me back and basically beg me to present him as an innocent in over his head - which he wasn't.
1315690792988618756 2020-10-13 00:28:24 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @Unisaur64 He knew Murphy was far right. I remember him commenting on their fb page that Gearoid's views were 'a bit strong'. He also worked with local gemmaroids and one Conor McZorba (Rafferty) of the Irish Freedom Party who was running an online propaganda operation around events there.
1315674225231962115 2020-10-12 23:22:33 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @tim_brannigan NP P9 refers to capital punishment in their manifesto. In the context of that rally it and the nooses were basically aimed at Roderic O'Gorman. They also argue for the death penalty for Doctors who perform abortions.
1315626786517024771 2020-10-12 20:14:03 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @OrlaSmith14 Him, Torino, The National Party, Chopper. Look at the whole history of hate being whipped up around the provision of accomodation for asulum seekers from 2018 to the present and they're there agitating and formenting out and out racism and white supremacy.
1315624455486537730 2020-10-12 20:04:47 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @OrlaSmith14 Gearoid Murphy who was there Saturday literally worked alongside key organiser Patrick Curran at Oughterard. He supplied the propaganda used on locals and collected signatures on their 'petition' at the infamous meeting at which Grealish let loose his foul racism.
1315623786348244992 2020-10-12 20:02:08 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> This is what the people who @ColinGleesonIT refers to as 'contrarians' wear to their rallies.  https://t.co/tOwuZ3QsHB

1315614149452476416 2020-10-12 19:23:50 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> They're getting good reviews from the fascists for their styling of them as 'right wing' too.  https://t.co/xR22zaM42V

1315572202889187328 2020-10-12 16:37:09 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> I remember Mick Clifford rubbishing the work of anti-fascist activists who showed clearly and in great detail that fascists were centrally involved in events in Oughterard last year.  One of said fascists was in attendance at the Dail on Saturday as it happens.  https://t.co/te56NL93HC
1315566146503008257 2020-10-12 16:13:06 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> God be with the days when the local now defunct Strokestown based rag The Democrat published a four page rant warning locals that the organisers of a small anti racism rally in Rooskey were communists bent on warping minds and destroying all that was good in the local area.

1315316268698923011 2020-10-11 23:40:10 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Weeping, wailing and moaning about Saturday's (less than satisfactory for them) events over in the sewers has morphed into a big incel self help therapy session. They're bemoaning the fact that the majority of young Irish women are 'communists'. Ya couldn't make it up.
1315295537856491520 2020-10-11 22:17:47 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @niallcarsonpa @sbprme Didn't say you had. I am commenting on Irish Times coverage and the Journalist's tweets about his reporting and the event. He has said clearly that he refused to identify himself when asked - let alone show his press credentials.
1315292288256442370 2020-10-11 22:04:53 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @niallcarsonpa @sbprme As for the stuff about IT journalist not stating whohe was. That is NOT the standard behavior of a journalist. This is for example from NY Times guidelines. I could find many many examples of similar.  https://t.co/pzlFMJ59A3

1315288504499400705 2020-10-11 21:49:51 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @niallcarsonpa @sbprme I didn't perpetrate any violence. I am arguing abt the reporting of the event. You are moving the goalposts. Good reporting would accurately describe the attack on the fascists. It would also report the statement in wide circulation from antifascists describing their motivation.
1315287646894256128 2020-10-11 21:46:26 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @niallcarsonpa @sbprme That's whataboutery 101. There is no history in ROI of press materials being used to prosecute fascists.
1315285909466681344 2020-10-11 21:39:32 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @niallcarsonpa @sbprme Naming the organiser of the fascist rally and giving a sense of the racist, homophobic, threatening speeches made would have helped too.
1315285485263126532 2020-10-11 21:37:51 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @niallcarsonpa @sbprme Also wrt to the reporter being asked to move along - it would have contextualised that if it had been mentioned that media reporting on anti fascism have been in the past been forced by gardai under protest to turn over their materials to assist in prosecuting anti fascists.
1315284608762753026 2020-10-11 21:34:22 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @niallcarsonpa @sbprme In an informed manner.  Accurately describing the National Party for what they are would have been a good start. They are a far-right fascist group - not a 'right wing' group as this report describes them. Reporting the motivations of the anti-fascists would have helped too.
1315269934730145792 2020-10-11 20:36:03 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @paulduanefilm AND he ended up having to alter his initial characterisation of the event under public pressure.
1315263087210041346 2020-10-11 20:08:51 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @niallcarsonpa @sbprme That was the occasion where you entirely misrepresented a straight up violent attack on counterdemonstrators including two women by known fascists. And you wonder why antifascists are wary of the media.  https://t.co/WO4eeHH0Vi

You've done that part yourselves on your timeline today. Putting pressure on the state to apply the existing law to fascists when appropriate is legitimate imo.

Not surprising since they made a deliberate decision -  which was communicated to us in advance -  to allow us to be attacked that day.

All sounds like a listing in advance of excuses for a consequence free outing to Dublin for O'Keefe.
1314856151142617089 2020-10-10 17:11:49 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @CormacJOKeeffe I mean the tortured shit in these paragraphs. O'Keefe is CLEARLY the self declared organiser. Nothing 'suspected' about it.

1313792870827032577 2020-10-07 18:46:44 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Both events were organised by O'Keefe and there is no confusion about that fact - as he has publicly identified himself as the organiser in both cases.

1312391591462670337 2020-10-03 21:58:33 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Good to see the support for the Yellowbellies collapse. I think the large dose if daylight shone in these crew by the national media in recent weeks has opened the eyes of some of their soft support.

1307736752896040960 2020-09-21 01:41:53 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Why are the media SO NERVOUS about pointing to HERMANN KELLY as a key driver of the growth of the far-right? He is the MAIN MAN. The YELLOW-VESTS are his puppets.  Fascists all.

1307703704678793218 2020-09-20 23:30:33 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> To me if anyone is looking for a 'traitor' - Dolores Cahill and Hermann Kelly would be good starting points. Their knuckledraggers love throwing that accusation around. It's what is termed 'projection'.
1307703388080156675 2020-09-20 23:29:18 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Hermannoids have been trying to to distance themselves from the out and out knuckledraggers of the Irish Far-Right. Thing is they are as bad if not worse. Hermann and the brexit boys would love Ireland to look worse than Boris's COVID wracked Britain and are trying to make it so.
1307701256048214018 2020-09-20 23:20:50 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Funnily enough this investigation showed some full on links between Cahill's IFP (and their big Daddy Farage) and fascistsic anti-semitism:  https://t.co/wtcmWWM7mb

1306943980911951876 2020-09-18 21:11:41 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @BTriagain @christineomg5 I think it was a much more contested and complicated phenomenon in France. Here straight up mix of woo merchants and racists from the word go.

1306932780761219074 2020-09-18 20:27:11 +0800 <EamonnVIDF>  https://t.co/AQNeX6nMgc
1306932597524750337 2020-09-18 20:26:27 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> The existence of these 'squads' is likely illegal. In the case of the 'squad' with matching security company style armbands who participated in the attack on Izzy Kamikaze - I would say their actions and the actions of the protest organiser are very likely to have been illegal.
1306930987499225090 2020-09-18 20:20:03 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> They are usurping the role of the police basically at these events. They are being allowed to do so by the police. Not a good sign at all.
1306929989208637442 2020-09-18 20:16:05 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Some of the same people have been in these crews on multiple occasions. It is pretty full on that these groups are being allowed by Gardai to mete out violent 'punishment' to any and all who oppose them largely without any consequences.
1306928752631451649 2020-09-18 20:11:10 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Philip Dwyer said openly on a broadcast that the National Party had helped with 'security' at the first large Yellowvests rally at the Customs House. This was the rally where a counterdemonstrator was seriously injured and knocked unconscious by a crew carrying weapons.
1306928353069469697 2020-09-18 20:09:35 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> In my opinion both Michael O'Keefe and Philip Dwyer are very closely involved in organising these crews. O'Keefe organised both Dail rallies where violence happened.
1306927437100601344 2020-09-18 20:05:57 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> It is clear that those attacking people on the street in and around these rallies are organised. It is not random hotheads. These are organised security crews with a brief to immediately physically attack and punish any and all who counterprotest their events.
1306926898870706177 2020-09-18 20:03:48 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> It is now clearly dangerous to life and limb to counterprotest this milieu. People should not have to face a strong prospect of assault and serious bodily harm if they choose to exercise their right to public protest.
1306926055580631048 2020-09-18 20:00:27 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Meanwhile, as a result of systematic Garda inaction at Plague Division rallies leading to counterdemonstrators being assaulted / battered by tooled up 'squads', the constitutional rights of those who want to protest the Plague Divisions are being set aside.

Gemmaroid Plague Division having a wee march between GPO and RTE tomorrow afternoon. The NP aligned tooled up plague droogs also planning a regional event soon. Nuts.

1306757291656359936 2020-09-18 08:49:51 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @paulmurphy_TD I agree with this generally. However I think the way out proposed will not happen fast. A social movement outside party lines is badly needed.

1306732508973858816 2020-09-18 07:11:22 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Wearing a mask at appropriate times is a mark of respect for others - older and other vulnerable people and frontline workers especially. It protects others more than it protects you. You get some protection. Wearing a mask lowers the dose of the virus you get.

1305945593773162496 2020-09-16 03:04:27 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Fascist nihilism is a structural response to the clock running down fast on a habitable planet. Irish meat industry is as much a symptom of fascist nihilism as the drooling 'patriot' headbangers on the streets. It is ecosocialism or fascist barbarism. 'Centre' ain't gonna hold.
1305941772124786697 2020-09-16 02:49:16 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> There is a big crossover between his security on the 22nd and 'Chopper' O'Keefe's security at Dail Saturday gone. Like very big. Who is this Glenn Miller? He tends to hide amd avoid scrutiny. Would be an excellent time to shine a bright light on him.
1305941093104656384 2020-09-16 02:46:34 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Glenn Miller is a dissembler and fascist. The National Party provided 'security' (a tooled up fascist squad) at his rally @Aedubh describes.  Included in that squad were members of Siol Na hEireann - the group who led his march Saturday gone. He is an equal opportunities fascist.

They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert.

1305237434884648961 2020-09-14 04:10:29 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> My theory wrt this is that to report on the rally the media outlets would have had to explain that a far right exists here - something which - due to their own negligence and failure - would come as a sudden shocking surprise to their readers.  Easier to ignore whole thing.

1305215178745819136 2020-09-14 02:42:02 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Has there been a single mainstream report on the Anti far right rally that took place on O'Connell St yesterday?

Hate also their consistent use of 'both sides are as bad as each other' words like 'clash', 'skirmish', 'scuffles' to describe what is now a series of increasingly violent attacks on people by the far right.
1305196903680929792 2020-09-14 01:29:25 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @TreasaMalarky @TarynDeVere @ConorGallaghe_r @thejournal_ie Absolutely 100%. My basic point is not aimed at you.

1305098478897508358 2020-09-13 18:58:19 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Business as usual today in Irish media. No accurate descriptions of events in Dublin. No calling things what they are. Journalists content to virtue signal on twitter without ensuring proper hard reporting on the far right in their actual outlets can do one.

1305089933653221377 2020-09-13 18:24:22 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @playfulghost_ Same as others are saying. Speech was great. Was good to see lots of young speakers at the event.
1305080724933013504 2020-09-13 17:47:46 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> The utter scum are now saying Izzy Kamikaze staged her injuries. They have elaborated the whole thing into a detailed conspiracy theory.

Him and Chopper who was 'in charge' today at the open the pubs demo and calmly filming his security assaulting people are a real KatholiK Kop job duo.

1304912874385571840 2020-09-13 06:40:48 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Funny. The guy who organised both rallies was clearly working with a 'security detail' in place both times. They have a little uniform now. I think that might be illegal. None of this security crew ever seem to get arrested. They just assault and walk around unimpeded afterwards.  https://t.co/itwkgCGmwg
1304911765898235905 2020-09-13 06:36:23 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Funny thing - the Guard who told us explicitly at the noose rally that if we counter-protested we would not be protected by the Gardai - was also on the scene at the Dail today.

Basically saying that in your words - condemning them equals amplyfying them. Nad take. Like a really shit take. Heard same 100 times and it was shit then too.
1304905550774390784 2020-09-13 06:11:41 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @colmtobin So we should have ignored them all through 2019 when they were doing arson attacks on intended direct provision centres and whipping up racist hate? They reach audiences in the 100s of 1000s. Your tweet is dangerously complacent rubbish.

1300850243018383365 2020-09-02 01:37:21 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @squidlimerick Go look at Dara Flaherty from Galway's recent vids. Sweating like a stuck pig and still putting himself about.
1300834162711113728 2020-09-02 00:33:27 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> Spread the word about this. Ask groups and your political reps to support. It definitely is time to say enough is enough to the far right.  https://t.co/19FHrfIndy
1300832033959292928 2020-09-02 00:24:59 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @TarynDeVere Could be wrong but think those deals were made by Martin Cullen.
1300824918221881347 2020-09-01 23:56:43 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @vmax_14 Think locarion has changed to GPO. Good to see.
1300773591697551361 2020-09-01 20:32:46 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @WSMIreland One other issue with that article. In description of Leinster house 'March for Innocence' rally - their security crew was NOT 40 people. More like 5 or six. The 40 number seems accurate wrt Customs House events.
1300769800663314434 2020-09-01 20:17:42 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @WSMIreland That said - I think the rest of the article is a good insightful account of what's going on.
1300768480480972801 2020-09-01 20:12:27 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @WSMIreland Summer 2019: Speakers Unicorner March and Rally at Barrow Street was arguably the biggest countermobilisation to date. Calls to mobilise were fully public.
1300768006298099719 2020-09-01 20:10:34 +0800 <EamonnVIDF> @WSMIreland Not accurate: 'it has been a remarkable feature of most gatherings of the Far-Right in Dublin at least that no organisation or network has called publicly to oppose them (the one notable exception since 2016 has been the December 2019 counter-rally outside Leinster House)'
