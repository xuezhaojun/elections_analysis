1341973152914690048 2020-12-24 13:05:06 +0800 <DolanGroyper> @mattcase31 @KoroGames @GroypGersh Nehemiah showed no interest in converting the mixed children, the tribe was understood as a race and so those mixed race Jews were banished. As far as Galatians 3:28 goes if you take it literally then you must not believe in a distinction between men and women.
1341970514387021824 2020-12-24 12:54:37 +0800 <DolanGroyper> @mattcase31 @KoroGames @GroypGersh Yea prohibition of the Jewish race marrying outside the Jewish race they knew it was wrong and so all those who mixed were banished from israel. It’s a law for Jews because all laws of the Old Testament were specifically for Jews.
1341286825734926342 2020-12-22 15:37:53 +0800 <DolanGroyper> @KoroGames @GroypGersh Yep Ezra 10:10 and a few other verses are pretty explicit about this.

They look nothing like a Caucasian. It also largely signifies behavioral patterns and other qualities. It’s what separates places like Japan from places like Detroit or Haiti.
1340201418813272066 2020-12-19 15:44:52 +0800 <DolanGroyper> @INJUNHATINGMILF Probably not, most western directors feel the need to spite his social views when adapting one of his works. That recent one based off “The color out of space” being a good example. The director said it’s why he put an interracial relationship in it. Plus the movie just sucked.
