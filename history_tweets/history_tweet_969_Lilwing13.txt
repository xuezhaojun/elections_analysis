1343710209605324802 2020-12-29 08:07:33 +0800 <Lilwing13> @Queenfreemarket Depends on interaction. I like open discussions and seeing other points-of-view, but there are also trolls and bots and people who twist truths and those who believe/follow anything they see online.

1339392063696220161 2020-12-17 10:08:47 +0800 <Lilwing13> @MaryLyn00719971 @dpatterson17 @gail_bee @RDCLandscapes I’m a surgical tech (trauma)&amp; hubby is a paramedic (ER) I’m glad you clarified that because I’ve just personally not seen them used. I’m guessing it would be much more expensive on such a massive scale to use those? Otherwise, seems that all clinics &amp; hospitals would have them.
1339369446780100608 2020-12-17 08:38:55 +0800 <Lilwing13> @dpatterson17 @gail_bee @RDCLandscapes My husband and I have each been in healthcare for 22 years and have never used these or seen them in any facilities we’ve worked. We work in the US so maybe they’re not as common here as in the UK?

1315355375240122369 2020-10-12 02:15:34 +0800 <Lilwing13> @Skell20XX Followed you because you said you like to talk and debate but aren’t malicious. It’s okay to have a difference of opinions. I prefer to see different sides anyway. 😊
