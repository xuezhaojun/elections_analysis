What about all the ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù burning of cities to the ground and looting? Did COVID just decide to skip infection during those times? Get the fuck outta here with that shit.

I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre following in the footsteps of those illustrious Democrats before you... already making excuses and screwing the people. It‚Äôs an age old tradition... keep it up, it feels great!!!
