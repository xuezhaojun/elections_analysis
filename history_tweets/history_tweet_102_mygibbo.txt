1344049839802372096 2020-12-30 06:37:07 +0800 <mygibbo> People posting, asking why the government doesn't close schools, take over a TV channel to broadcast to kids without good IT at home, you know actually get a grip.  After all, modern TV is about 200 channels of nothing.

1344040695942709248 2020-12-30 06:00:47 +0800 <mygibbo> A government whose failings cost the lives of its own citizens.  A Prime Minister who goes missing when leadership is needed.  A Cabinet stuffed with shallow, clueless propagandists.  The worst government of my lifetime.

1343968368739692545 2020-12-30 01:13:23 +0800 <mygibbo> A massive hike in cases on top of yesterday's unprecedented levels.  This government failed over the initial lockdown. It failed over Covid cases in care homes.  It failed over PPE and test and trace.  Its failures are costing lives.

1343869915149856768 2020-12-29 18:42:10 +0800 <mygibbo> @lucyallan So do you think over-60s like me are less than human?  Is this an excuse for a record number of infections yesterday, over 40,000?  Does it exculpate a government that has presided over tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths?  What exactly is your point?
1343864665470865409 2020-12-29 18:21:18 +0800 <mygibbo> There can be no compelling public health argument for reopening schools with this level of infection in the population.  Labour should be challenging the government over this.  No time for bipartisanship.
1343861260635549696 2020-12-29 18:07:46 +0800 <mygibbo> The government let Covid get out of control the first time.  It decanted the infection into care homes.  Now it is letting it run out of control again.  This is terrifying and irresponsible.

1340595222535942147 2020-12-20 17:49:42 +0800 <mygibbo> This morning journalists across the spectrum are saying the pandemic crisis is a tough gig, poor old Johnson, nothing he could have done.  Just how is it that such a coherent- and false- narrative is issued to excuse a government that has failed, failed and failed again?
1340594700991025153 2020-12-20 17:47:38 +0800 <mygibbo> @PippaCrerar It is a much easier gig if you do something about it as the governments of South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, Denmark, Australia and many others did.  No excuses for Johnson and his crony Covid capitalists.

1339486273099231233 2020-12-17 16:23:08 +0800 <mygibbo> Support the socialists who have been 'administratively suspended.'  Labour is a democratic socialist party that needs to be democratic and socialist.

I was in the SWP 1974-1996.  I joined the Labour Party in 2016, inspired by Corbyn.  Our CLP has delivered Labour's biggest vote share two elections running.

1339202138547888134 2020-12-16 21:34:05 +0800 <mygibbo> I have asked the Labour Party for an explanation regarding my suspension.  All I know is that it relates to my role as CLP Secretary.  I can only assume that this is the reason ⬇️

1339186091493093378 2020-12-16 20:30:19 +0800 <mygibbo> Thanks Aaron.  Ironically, I got the suspension email on returning home from our Walton Vale community hub, providing £15 worth of shopping to our members for £3.50.  Socialism sinks roots through such activity.

It happened the other way round in 1964 when outgoing Tory Chancellor Reginald Maudling popped his head round the door and told incoming Labour Chancellor Jim Callaghan:   "Sorry to leave such a mess, old cock."
1338498812512440321 2020-12-14 22:59:19 +0800 <mygibbo> @jemgilbert Sorry, I can't think of a situation when you don't call out a clearly far right individual spouting racism.  What would have been the reaction if the previous leader had failed to rebut such comments?
1338474854107009032 2020-12-14 21:24:07 +0800 <mygibbo> I have just had it confirmed that if you are a wealthy, Tory, Telegraph journalist and join Christmas crowds you are not milling. You are only milling if you are a less well-off, common or garden regular person. I hope that is clear. (By the way, please refrain from milling.)

Today 175 CLP Secretaries and Chairs have published a letter highly critical of the leadership.  80 CLPs passed pro-Corbyn motions.  8 unions have demanded Starmer sort out the mess.  Momentum is launching a campaign to elect GS.  That is not silence.

Maybe by then there will be an inquiry into the incompetence of this government, leading to the world's worst death toll, the deepest economic hit and the most money spent to achieve this dire state of affairs.

Jeremy's biggest problem was trying to pursue a socialist direction in a party in which the real Left was tiny when he won the leadership.  This time we build the Left so we are ready when there is a new chance of socialist change.

The issue with it is people are self-identifying as Labour Party members so we can't be sure if that is true, but Survation is a respected polling agency so the findings are worth studying.

1331621845469114371 2020-11-25 23:32:42 +0800 <mygibbo> In the 1870s one building in seventy-seven in London was a pub or beer shop.

You freeze the pay of those key workers you had the bare-faced cheek to clap.  You failed on early lockdown, PPE, test and trace.  You have nothing to be delighted about.
1331593799836065799 2020-11-25 21:41:16 +0800 <mygibbo> The government used to hypocritically clap for carers.  Now it delivers crap for carers.  Despicable.

1331581931394396160 2020-11-25 20:54:06 +0800 <mygibbo> I am sad to hear of the passing of Patience Thomson. Patience was a co-founder of @BarringtonStoke , a publisher that has led the way in supporting dyslexic children and pioneering ‘quick reads.’  An inspiring teacher, editor and publisher.
1331579772795805696 2020-11-25 20:45:32 +0800 <mygibbo> Johnson waffles and beetles his blithering Buller brow then lies through his teeth about key workers' wages.  They have faced real terms pay cuts.  His government is condemning them to more hardship.  Will he clap his flaccid hands for that?
1331579062117142528 2020-11-25 20:42:42 +0800 <mygibbo> Johnson claims the government is removing dangerous cladding.  It has been three years since the Grenfell disaster.  Repeat that.   Three years.  Gross and scandalous failure.
1331578610394804224 2020-11-25 20:40:54 +0800 <mygibbo> I sincerely hope Johnson, paid £150,000 at PM for gross, irresponsible failure, doesn't expect plaudits for freezing Ministerial salaries.  For very well paid Ministers a freeze is barely noticeable.  For a key worker, it is hardship.
1331569243960324098 2020-11-25 20:03:41 +0800 <mygibbo> The Home Office broke equalities law with hostile environment measures.  The media should hold the government to account and spell out that this is a matter of deep and enduring shame.   https://t.co/KLe6PvjlN9   @PeoplesMomentum

None after a NEC committee voted unanimously to reinstate him.  No reason to try to gag Young Labour.  No reason to block FBU's Murray as NEC chair.

It was anti-democratic sabotage as shown in the Labour Leaks document.  Hopefully, the Forde Inquiry will investigate this properly.  We then lost because of a Brexit policy forced on Corbyn by second referendum fans.
1331287716701593600 2020-11-25 01:25:00 +0800 <mygibbo> @titchytracey @HardingMike Not quite, and why was that?  It was the sabotage of sections of the PLP and party bureaucracy, diverting resources, willing a Tory victory.  #labourleaks
1331287486732136459 2020-11-25 01:24:05 +0800 <mygibbo> @SpaJw @BawsmanJJ A bit rich if you are trying to excuse subverting Corbyn after he won two elections.  In fact, our CLP will deliver six council election victories and return a Labour MP by a landslide in four years as we have done for years.  That isn't subverting anybody.  #labourssafestseat
1331286073901772803 2020-11-25 01:18:28 +0800 <mygibbo> @BawsmanJJ @SpaJw No, I am somebody who set out the facts with consistency and campaign accordingly in Labour's safest UK seat.
1331285736478355458 2020-11-25 01:17:08 +0800 <mygibbo> @titchytracey @HardingMike So how come in 2017 he added three million votes, an extra 10% vote share.  What sunk us was an impossible Brexit policy and on the doorstep that is what I heard again and again in Crewe, Bolton, Blackpool and elsewhere.
1331285452498808835 2020-11-25 01:16:00 +0800 <mygibbo> @BawsmanJJ @SpaJw So was Clement Attlee, Labour's greatest leader.  It is what you do, not where your parents sent you to school that matters.
1331285298647592963 2020-11-25 01:15:23 +0800 <mygibbo> @SpaJw @BawsmanJJ I think you will find the current leader chose to subvert the rules with an arbitrary suspension of Corbyn then the removal of the whip in spite of the ruling by the NEC that he should be reinstated to membership.  We have rules for a reason.
1331284370691330050 2020-11-25 01:11:42 +0800 <mygibbo> @BawsmanJJ @SpaJw Big deal. We all grew up in working class areas. My family were railways and Rolls Royce. You don't play the Monty Python septic tank game. You get out and work for socialism and that doesn't entail subverting a twice-elected leader.
1331282576460406797 2020-11-25 01:04:34 +0800 <mygibbo> @HardingMike It the people who sabotaged his leadership despite him winning two democratic elections were half decent, they would have supported him rather than derailing our 2017 General Election campaign.  #labourleaks
1331282061659959297 2020-11-25 01:02:32 +0800 <mygibbo> @BawsmanJJ @SpaJw Rubbish.  He had some principles.  A life devoted to socialism, solidarity and internationalism, precisely why the right wing were so keen to ignore two democratic leadership victories and sabotage his leadership.
1331280568642887685 2020-11-25 00:56:36 +0800 <mygibbo> @BawsmanJJ @SpaJw Unlike you, I don't believe in ignoring two leadership elections and subverting the party's chances.  The way Corbyn treated was an utter disgrace and still is.
1331277039861714945 2020-11-25 00:42:34 +0800 <mygibbo> @BawsmanJJ @SpaJw In other words, nothing to deliver a Labour victory.  We were in constituencies all across the North West, not willing the Labour right to sabotage the election campaign.  Actions not words.  Something Starmer has to learn. You don't win by trying to suppress the Left.
1331275158364033034 2020-11-25 00:35:06 +0800 <mygibbo> @BawsmanJJ @SpaJw Kinnock grandstanded and lost two elections.  Instead of urging Starmer to eliminate the Left who do all the work, you should argue for unity.  In our CLP we deliver 84.7% of the vote for Labour.  You?
1331274900397563905 2020-11-25 00:34:04 +0800 <mygibbo> @BawsmanJJ @SpaJw You fail to take responsibility.  The Labour right sabotaged our 2017 election campaign. The Forde Inquiry should demonstrate this with plenty of evidence if it is conducted fairly.  The EU obsessives refused to accept the referendum and forced Labour down the disastrous 2nd ref.
1331273854304612352 2020-11-25 00:29:55 +0800 <mygibbo> @BawsmanJJ @SpaJw Neil Kinnock managed to lose two elections when Thatcher was loathed by large sections of the British population.  Probably the worst Labour 'leader' ever.
1331273632924971010 2020-11-25 00:29:02 +0800 <mygibbo> @BawsmanJJ @SpaJw So explain why, even with the sabotage of sections of the PLP and party bureaucracy he added three million voters, 10% vote share over Brown and Miliband.  Your loathing of Corbyn blinds you to facts.  If the Labour right had lifted a finger we would be in government.
1331273304016084993 2020-11-25 00:27:44 +0800 <mygibbo> @BawsmanJJ @SpaJw Are you really arguing Johnson with 50,000 deaths, failure over the lockdown, failure over PPE, failure over track and test isn't even worse- and by some distance- than May?  You won't find many takes for that claim.
1331271003843031044 2020-11-25 00:18:35 +0800 <mygibbo> @BawsmanJJ @SpaJw By the way, it is four elections were lost and the only one where we came close to winning was under Corbyn.  Inconvenient truths again.
1331270824490373120 2020-11-25 00:17:53 +0800 <mygibbo> @BawsmanJJ @SpaJw The Labour right tried to lose them FFS.  You are obvious unaware of the #labourleaks document revealing the sabotage.  The 'fence sitting' delivered a 10% rise in vote share in 2017.   Second referendum stupidity led to a disaster.  Thanks, remain party right wingers.
1331268826932064260 2020-11-25 00:09:56 +0800 <mygibbo> @BawsmanJJ @SpaJw We added 10% vote share in 2017, three million voters.  The Labour right did everything to sabotage Corbyn's leadership, saddling us with an indefensible Europe policy.  Johnson makes May look like a genius and we still don't have a decent lead.  Inconvenient truths.

Corbyn's right to discuss the scale of the issue is enshrined in Article 10 of the Human Rights Act. See page 27 of the EHRC report.

1331196185630167040 2020-11-24 19:21:17 +0800 <mygibbo> @JohnRentoul If you bothered to follow events you would know the factional behaviour is suspending then withholding the whip from the former leader, suspending CLP officers, trying to silence young Labour then blocking the FBU vice-chair of the NEC becoming chair.
1331192504209854470 2020-11-24 19:06:40 +0800 <mygibbo> @MrBreakspear @siennamarla Precisely principle.  A faction in the party suspended Corbyn arbitrarily then withheld the whip against a NEC committee decision that had legal advice.  People can't argue for a broad church then exclude the Left.
1331192111690096641 2020-11-24 19:05:06 +0800 <mygibbo> The NEC minority were absolutely right to register a protest at the factional behaviour of the Labour right.
1331191518187679744 2020-11-24 19:02:44 +0800 <mygibbo> @Conservatlve_JA Nonsense.  Against the worst government in living memory, Labour can't even manage a consistent lead because it is not involving a large section of its own membership.  Factionalism is the biggest obstacle to our advance.
1331191240734502913 2020-11-24 19:01:38 +0800 <mygibbo> @francesweetman That is not the issue and you know it.  As vice-chair, the FBU's Ian Murray was due to take the chair.  This was an arbitrary act to exclude the Left and trade unions.
1331190726198169608 2020-11-24 18:59:36 +0800 <mygibbo> @john_plebeian @lara_eleanor Sometimes you have to take a stand on principle.  The former leader suspended then denied the whip despite a NEC committee supporting reinstatement. Local officers suspended. Young Labour's freedom of speech challenged.   There is a pattern here.
1331189146119966726 2020-11-24 18:53:19 +0800 <mygibbo> Does a factional grouping in the Labour Party want it to become a kind of Democratic Party.....that is not democratic?
1331188621278388224 2020-11-24 18:51:14 +0800 <mygibbo> @SocialDemSheff Really?  The right of the party subverted a twice elected leader for four years.  Now they act against rule in suspending Jeremy Corbyn when his right to free speech is specifically enshrined in the EHRC.  Then the whip is suspended against a NEC committee with legal standing.

1331185697617743873 2020-11-24 18:39:37 +0800 <mygibbo> This is extremely worrying.  The unions helped found the Labour Party and are at the heart of our movement.

1330875364164427776 2020-11-23 22:06:27 +0800 <mygibbo> @Jdm_progressive True, but Ministers should not impose a pay freeze on key workers then accept a £3,360 rise for themselves.  Indeed, they shouldn't impose a pay freeze, full stop.
1330822649539391488 2020-11-23 18:36:59 +0800 <mygibbo> @virginmedia, my wife asked to be phoned to rectify a problem.  Instead of one of your staff doing this, you keep sending the same series of robotic tweets, entirely avoiding your responsibility to provide the service for which we pay.  No texts, no robot messages, a phone call!
1330812296222953472 2020-11-23 17:55:51 +0800 <mygibbo> @DailyMailUK And not a mention that the hypocrites who applauded key workers and called them heroes are now condemning them to a three year pay rise.  Commission by omission.
1330811782743601153 2020-11-23 17:53:48 +0800 <mygibbo> Howard Beckett's detailed and comprehensive speech was one of the highlights of an excellent 'Freedom of Speech' event.  Please watch what he has to say.

This was one-way traffic.
1330796282567331840 2020-11-23 16:52:13 +0800 <mygibbo> Hancock wouldn't say whether he would take his proposed £3,360.  This is my prediction.  https://t.co/StbQ88GwwC
1330795453865218048 2020-11-23 16:48:55 +0800 <mygibbo> Given a choice between taking a pay rise and not taking a pay rise, Hancock bravely chooses the third way by saying absolutely nothing....at length.  Laughable.
1330794616677928961 2020-11-23 16:45:36 +0800 <mygibbo> Will MPs reject the rumoured £3,360 pay rise when they are trying to force a pay freeze on the very key workers they lauded as heroes?  New Zealand MPs took a 20% pay cut.
1330793962098094080 2020-11-23 16:43:00 +0800 <mygibbo> Hancock is a very unimpressive Health Minister, but I am quite impressed that he can maintain a broad, fake smirk while talking absolute nonsense.

You don't add 10% purely on negatives. The Labour message cut through until we were saddled with Brexit disaster.

We added three million voters.  Nothing trite about it.  What destroyed Labour's chances was four years of sabotage, ignoring Corbyn's mandate.

Draconian, wrong and counter-productive.

1330487215680589827 2020-11-22 20:24:06 +0800 <mygibbo> @virginmedia All we need is somebody to phone up and sort it out.  The phone connects to everyone else's Wi-Fi, including friends on Virgin, but not our household Wi-Fi.
1330486867825930240 2020-11-22 20:22:43 +0800 <mygibbo> @virginmedia It is a Samsung A-20, bought a year ago. When you try to get on Wi-Fi the message about a CA certificate comes up. It has been going on for about a month. Before that everything was fine and she didn't do anything different.
1330470162080915458 2020-11-22 19:16:20 +0800 <mygibbo> @virginmedia I will get that information over when she gets in, but she was promised a phone call to sort it out.

1330464140897423364 2020-11-22 18:52:24 +0800 <mygibbo> @virginmedia It is the internet altogether.  She is asked for a CA certificate, something she has never been asked for before.
1330463869307908096 2020-11-22 18:51:19 +0800 <mygibbo> @virginmedia To be honest, this looks like gobbledegook.  Her phone was working fine, now she can't access the internet and it is Virgin's job to give her step by step instructions to resolve the issue, not just send links for a chat room.

Our members are involved in foodbanks, community hubs, homeless street teams. Our people have been battered by austerity and the pandemic. But the Labour leadership is more interested in waging a destructive and unnecessary war against the left. We won’t stand for it.
1329734973608390657 2020-11-20 18:34:57 +0800 <mygibbo> @meeware @skwawkbox That sounds like waffle.  Not one clear response to the issues of process or rule.

The SCG has combined on a statement.   7,000 emails demanding restoration of the whip dropped into Starmer's inbox.  The campaign is growing.
1329709651965976580 2020-11-20 16:54:20 +0800 <mygibbo> A few months ago, the likes of Johnson rushed to pound their hypocritical palms in recognition of the heroic efforts of public sector workers in the pandemic.

1329701794969247745 2020-11-20 16:23:07 +0800 <mygibbo> Exactly.  Many CLPs passed motions in support of the restoration of the whip to Jeremy last night.  This is evidence of the Left's resilience.  Time to plant the red flag.

1329701213521252352 2020-11-20 16:20:48 +0800 <mygibbo> @katedodd3 Absolutely.  The Left performed strongly in the NEC elections and we are mounting a growing campaign to restore the whip to Jeremy Corbyn.  Rumours of our demise are exaggerated.

1329375559164551174 2020-11-19 18:46:46 +0800 <mygibbo> @mattforde The unions created the Labour Party.  The money and campaigning energy of trade unionists built this movement.

1329037056891383812 2020-11-18 20:21:41 +0800 <mygibbo> @BilalNaks @siennamarla Socialists will not be silenced by an authoritarian leadership acting without due regard to the traditions of the party or its processes.  While we do the campaigning, work in the food banks, man the picket lines and canvass the public, we are being let down badly from above.
1329036431935877120 2020-11-18 20:19:12 +0800 <mygibbo> The Labour Left demonstrated resilience in the NEC elections.  We forced Jeremy's reinstatement.  We will not allow that to be reversed immediately after a properly constituted NEC panel reversed the unjust suspension.
1329034291758702597 2020-11-18 20:10:42 +0800 <mygibbo> Sleazy, corrupt and driven by greed.  It's the Tory way.
1329033631042592769 2020-11-18 20:08:04 +0800 <mygibbo> Paul Mason has been an enthusiastic supporter of Starmer's leadership.  He too knows that Starmer and Evans' conduct of this entire episode has been authoritarian, chaotic and inept.

1329024334858514433 2020-11-18 19:31:08 +0800 <mygibbo> @ElizCro If the leadership continues this way rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.
1329023687249555461 2020-11-18 19:28:33 +0800 <mygibbo> At the moment, I'm afraid, the party leadership couldn't restore a Mr Whippy to an ice cream-deprived child.
1329023193626128385 2020-11-18 19:26:36 +0800 <mygibbo> In the middle of a pandemic and at a time the government is dishing out billions of pounds of contracts without proper scrutiny, the leader of the opposition should be holding it to account.  Instead, he is conducting a chaotic campaign of denigration against the former leader.
1329022636131819522 2020-11-18 19:24:23 +0800 <mygibbo> @littleblueshed @EvanCull @siennamarla A good addition.
1329022362734501888 2020-11-18 19:23:17 +0800 <mygibbo> @parsifel43 I do indeed.
1329021916921933824 2020-11-18 19:21:31 +0800 <mygibbo> The suspension of Jeremy was arbitrary and questionable in terms of process.  The authoritarian restrictions imposed on CLPs were unacceptable.  The hasty and chaotic refusal to restore the whip after due process by a NEC panel risks exposing the leadership to ridicule.
1329021037015691264 2020-11-18 19:18:01 +0800 <mygibbo> @jane123towers @LabGrassroots @BBCNewsnight @KirstyWark @JVoiceLabour @bbclaurak The prejudicial language trips easily off the Tory tongue.
1329019302406656001 2020-11-18 19:11:08 +0800 <mygibbo> @siennamarla So Starmer is not restoring the whip to Jeremy.   His leadership is, by turns, authoritarian, chaotic, driven haplessly by events and inept.

1325508707959136257 2020-11-09 02:41:17 +0800 <mygibbo> @DonnaP2005 Corbyn's opponents did that.  2017 the culmination of two years of sabotage (Labour Leaks).  2019 a Europe policy forced on us by opponents of Corbyn that stuck two fingers up to the people who won the 2016 referendum.
1325508355138392064 2020-11-09 02:39:53 +0800 <mygibbo> @rmaycock2 Corbyn didn't lose Scotland. That was McTernan and Murphy before Corbyn became leader.  What lost the towns in the north and Midlands was the undemocratic Europe policy forced on us by the PV fanatics.

1325084962182344705 2020-11-07 22:37:28 +0800 <mygibbo> @CaballoBat @PeoplesMomentum And we all welcome the forthcoming departure of Trump.  That said, I feel no great enthusiasm that Biden will offer an exciting future for the American people.
1325018537988149249 2020-11-07 18:13:31 +0800 <mygibbo> Stephen Bush takes a pop at @PeoplesMomentum in the press, proclaiming Biden's conclusive victory.  Squeaking past the President of a country that has seen over 200,000 people die from Covid-19 and given succour to white supremacists.  Hardly a ringing endorsement of Centrism.

1324988816101412866 2020-11-07 16:15:25 +0800 <mygibbo> Another disturbing case of a teenager attracted to Neo-Nazi activity.
1324823616509366275 2020-11-07 05:18:58 +0800 <mygibbo> Donald J Trump issues statement on the state of the campaign.  https://t.co/3c2EhJXUH6
1324808181542014976 2020-11-07 04:17:38 +0800 <mygibbo> @JoeSucksmith You don't work with Dan.  I do as CLP Secretary and knew the statement was coming.
1324807955217321984 2020-11-07 04:16:44 +0800 <mygibbo> @earthygirl011 @Lashesxx On that we can agree.  It would be better if the SCG issued collective statements on behalf of all 35 MPs instead of statements coming out piece meal.  Good to end on a point of consensus.
1324805838293393410 2020-11-07 04:08:20 +0800 <mygibbo> @earthygirl011 @Lashesxx This really is pointless.
1324804919820492800 2020-11-07 04:04:41 +0800 <mygibbo> Great episode.
1324802432883396609 2020-11-07 03:54:48 +0800 <mygibbo> @carolinehowitt1 @DanielFooksArt @DanCardenMP He has done the right thing.  The article in Tribune calling for Jeremy's reinstatement.  The resignation from the Shadow Cabinet over the CHIS Bill on principle.  Four years having Jeremy's back.  Same as our CLP as a whole.
1324799047631339521 2020-11-07 03:41:21 +0800 <mygibbo> @KS4P45 @DanCardenMP @socialistcam He has backed Corbyn for four years, resigned from the Shadow Cabinet over the CHIS Bill and has published an article in Tribune calling for Corbyn's reinstatement.  Another article is to come.  Put your energies into criticising people who have not shown this record.
1324798088976998400 2020-11-07 03:37:32 +0800 <mygibbo> @neilhdg @DanCardenMP @jeremycorbyn @AngelaRayner Dan has just resigned from the Shadow Cabinet over the CHIS Bill and his support for Jeremy's reinstatement is clear.
1324797375899193351 2020-11-07 03:34:42 +0800 <mygibbo> @DanielFooksArt @DanCardenMP You overestimate hot air on Twitter.  He was always going to make a statement in favour of reinstatement.
1324797180155170817 2020-11-07 03:33:55 +0800 <mygibbo> @frescos4U @Papillons888 @DanCardenMP I don't know Eoin, but he hasn't worked with Dan in Walton CLP on picket lines and in campaigns.  I have.  He has always backed Jeremy and still does.   https://t.co/2iA1JKrMy9
1324796848050184194 2020-11-07 03:32:36 +0800 <mygibbo> @Papillons888 @DanCardenMP Dan has made his position crystal clear for four years, having Jeremy's back.  Nothing has changed.   https://t.co/2iA1JKrMy9
1324796267214548993 2020-11-07 03:30:18 +0800 <mygibbo> @neilhdg @DanCardenMP @jeremycorbyn I am not going to go into a timeline.  The point is Dan was always going to back Jeremy's reinstatement.  Four years of having his back spells that out.
1324796041221279746 2020-11-07 03:29:24 +0800 <mygibbo> @UKDemockery @carolinehowitt1 @PaulaBarkerMP @WavertreeCLP @socialistcam @jeremycorbyn Of course it is not just Dan.  He, Nadia Whittome and Paula Barker have come out for reinstatement in addition to the original signatories.  I hope the remainder of the SCG complete the list.
1324795755408875527 2020-11-07 03:28:16 +0800 <mygibbo> @UKDemockery @carolinehowitt1 @PaulaBarkerMP @WavertreeCLP @socialistcam @jeremycorbyn Now there I think you may have a point.  The Socialist Campaign Group needs to get its messaging right as a group so that people don't get pilloried unnecessarily.  Dan backed Corbyn for four years and resigned over the CHIS Bill.  That is a very solid, socialist record.

Three have backed Jeremy's reinstatement since.  I hope more do.  It is the actions of MPs that matter not whether it happens Thursday or Friday.  This campaign will go on.

Hopefully there will be others.  It is not whether you make the statement Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday, but that you make it.
1324788694323220483 2020-11-07 03:00:12 +0800 <mygibbo> @UKDemockery @carolinehowitt1 @PaulaBarkerMP @WavertreeCLP @socialistcam @jeremycorbyn You're replying to points I didn't make.  Dan has backed Corbyn for four years and just resigned from the front bench over the CHIS bill.  His statement was already planned.  He has made clear he wants Corbyn reinstated and will be making the same point in the press again.
1324788067388055555 2020-11-07 02:57:43 +0800 <mygibbo> There once was a Trump-a-Lump A graceless, sexist, racist Flump-a-Lump Who went out on the Stump-a Lump, But lost- aw- Now he’s a Grump-a-Lump.

Often political statements are done by WhatsApp with a short timescale to reply.  You judge people by what they say.  I'm Dan's CLP Secretary and he has backed Jeremy ever since 2015.
1324756400397012996 2020-11-07 00:51:53 +0800 <mygibbo> @wesstreeting Maybe they supported the elected leader.  Might make a difference.

1324754085002825728 2020-11-07 00:42:41 +0800 <mygibbo> @lisjmorris My understanding is not everyone was at the meeting. Nadia Whittome &amp; Paula Barker have also clarified they support Jeremy’s reinstatement. Maybe the SCG should do an update.
1324751834230259712 2020-11-07 00:33:44 +0800 <mygibbo> @PaulaBarkerMP Good to see Paula calling for Jeremy's reinstatement.  Let's see every Socialist Campaign Group MP do likewise.  @DanCardenMP did earlier today too.

We added 10% to the vote share, three million people.  It wasn't enough, but it should have been the green light for unity behind Corbyn.  Instead, sabotage grew.

Corbyn didn't divide. He won two leadership elections and was obstructed from day one.  If you talk about strongest constituencies, mine polled 84.7% at the General Election, the highest in the UK and we backed Corbyn all the way.
1324370893414502400 2020-11-05 23:20:01 +0800 <mygibbo> @RoteSockenSteve @PeoplesMomentum No, there has been a substantial social media campaign, 7 trade unions have raised this with Starmer and CLPs are passing motions and trying to raise them with Regional Execs though you may be aware what happened in London.  Could like to explain what 'striking back' means?
1324369674457518080 2020-11-05 23:15:10 +0800 <mygibbo> @d_smark60 @jeremycorbyn Keir Starmer was in the shadow cabinet during the period, you know.  Jennie Formby improved its processes as the EHRC report indicates- I have read it twice- but not adequately.  We should be discussing the report rather than the arbitrary and wrong suspension of Jeremy Corbyn.
1324366769310543875 2020-11-05 23:03:38 +0800 <mygibbo> @Bobbaaah @starmerung @Redcountessa @Melo_am_ @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour @LibDems The 80-seat majority is the result of saddling us with a policy on Brexit that gave two fingers to people who voted to leave the EU.  For people to pose as democrats after four years sabotaging a twice-elected leader is a bit rich.

For for years, Corbyn worked to unite the party, being elected twice.  He was insulted, criticised, obstructed and defeated, not by the Tories, but by people allegedly on our own side.

1323529439720988673 2020-11-03 15:36:23 +0800 <mygibbo> @MattHancock It is not about capacity, it is about actual people tested, and people traced crucially.  Everybody keeps explaining it to you.  That, belatedly, Liverpool is undertaking mass testing and tracing is testament to your gross failure.

1323270323584835584 2020-11-02 22:26:44 +0800 <mygibbo> Devastated.  Richard was personally kind to me and had volunteered to be my election agent.  He served his community, especially on disabled rights, and was personally so generous.  Richard is a sad loss to the movement.

1323185420813914113 2020-11-02 16:49:22 +0800 <mygibbo> We should end the distraction posed by Jeremy Corbyn's suspension.  The party must reinstate him.  This is what the EHRC report itself says on the right to express a view.  https://t.co/giu37NGIME

1323175041467666432 2020-11-02 16:08:07 +0800 <mygibbo> @red_revenant I think it is simple.  The suspension is wrong.  We demand reinstatement.
1323174392512303107 2020-11-02 16:05:33 +0800 <mygibbo> @CraigHackneyCub I think that is what solidarity means, but redraft the CLPD motion as you wish.  Momentum is demanding Jeremy's reinstatement and our EC tonight will be putting in that wording.  This is one model motion for people to look at.

1322878691546943491 2020-11-01 20:30:32 +0800 <mygibbo> Thank you, JVL, for your firm support for Jeremy's reinstatement.
1322878517995020296 2020-11-01 20:29:51 +0800 <mygibbo> Excellent statement by Dave Ward of the CWU trade union.  Reinstate Jeremy then do what we should be doing, considering the recommendations of the EHRC report.
1322877414838575119 2020-11-01 20:25:28 +0800 <mygibbo> The ludicrous Patrick Swayne MP claims there is no rise in excess deaths.  The latest figures show excess deaths are 6% up.  This is a legislator who has no respect for evidence.
1322823987639013379 2020-11-01 16:53:10 +0800 <mygibbo> SAGE called for a lockdown in September.  The government disregarded the advice.  It does not 'follow the science.'  It never has.
1322823709879685120 2020-11-01 16:52:03 +0800 <mygibbo> Sophy Ridge has now asked the blindingly obvious question about the government ignoring the scientific advice for weeks....  ...and Gove didn't even try to answer it.  Says it all really.
1322823464051421184 2020-11-01 16:51:05 +0800 <mygibbo> @Clearyconomics I posted about three minutes before she finally asked the blindingly obvious.  So frustrating.
1322821661503217664 2020-11-01 16:43:55 +0800 <mygibbo> Sophy Ridge, this is not difficult.  When Gove says he is following the evidence, the science, you ask why the government disregarded the evidence, the science and refused to look down weeks ago when SAGE suggested it.  It is your job.

By 1948, he was founding the NHS.  At the last election Labour still got ten million votes. Times are tough, but it is unlikely the party is going away.

1321724799568273409 2020-10-29 16:05:23 +0800 <mygibbo> 'The virus is in a bad place in all parts of the country.' Jenrick.  'A proportionate local strategy.' Jenrick.  So the answer to a problem affecting all parts of the country is a piecemeal response?  Really?
1321724331316154368 2020-10-29 16:03:31 +0800 <mygibbo> Robert Jenrick MP says the virus is 'in a bad place.'  Late into lockdown, PPE failure, test and trace fiasco, interest only in handing contracts to Tory donors and supporters, rather than rely on local expertise in local govt/NHS.  Now under whose stewardship did we get there?

At least be honest for once.

1320736861690699781 2020-10-26 22:39:40 +0800 <mygibbo> Tory MP Danny Kruger dares say the way forward is to regionalise.  The centralisation of test and trace, throwing money at the likes of Serco, is a major reason the system is failing.  Trust local public health agencies and the NHS.
1320736454608408582 2020-10-26 22:38:03 +0800 <mygibbo> Tory MP Danny Kruger says the government 'has funded local government.'  In fact, it has slashed council budgets to the bone.  Meanwhile his wretched crew pours billions into the greedy throats of the likes of Dodo and Serco.
1320735173307150336 2020-10-26 22:32:58 +0800 <mygibbo> @KirstieMAllsopp @BootsUK Would you care to explain why people on low incomes are expected to fork out £120 and why the government has not stepped up?  Of course, it is mere pocket money to you.
1320734791642337280 2020-10-26 22:31:27 +0800 <mygibbo> His party has been in power for ten years, slashing council budgets.  Despite the starving of resources to local government, Labour councils, even two Tory councils have stepped up.  Meanwhile, this despicable individual, basted in wealth and privilege from birth, makes excuses.
1320700684749230081 2020-10-26 20:15:55 +0800 <mygibbo> How dare Boris Johnson talk about ensuring no child goes hungry after his members voted down a motion to provide school meals through holidays?  How dare he say his government has 'given' money?  The resources disposed of by any government belong to the people.
1320652609229889536 2020-10-26 17:04:53 +0800 <mygibbo> Look @MattHancock, you can't protest you want to feed kids from low income backgrounds out of one side of your mouth and defend a vote to stop them being fed during the holidays out of the other.  So either be honest and be damned or, better still, U-turn.

1320399528688844800 2020-10-26 00:19:14 +0800 <mygibbo> @patrick_hurley Pleased to see our improvement, but that Tory score was in very exceptional circumstances.  I think a more reliable index of recovery is from the 32% at the General Election.  Let's hope we are 40% plus on a regular basis soon.

Their priority is Dodo, Serco and other Tory mates.

1318592000539693056 2020-10-21 00:36:45 +0800 <mygibbo> London is at the same time a great working class city and a centre of capitalist power.  Everyone in the Smoke should be proud of its traditions of struggle and solidarity and prepared to topple the Tories from their Westminster perch.
1318588229684178944 2020-10-21 00:21:46 +0800 <mygibbo> I lived in Manchester.  I live in Liverpool.  These two great cities should be as one in solidarity against the Tories who starve working class communities of resources and pour billions down the throats of their chums.

One example: Bevan was briefly expelled in 1939 and the Right attempted again just a few years after founding the NHS.  You don't get handed the keys to the Republic.  You fight for it.

There are 34 Socialist Campaign Group MPs, 35 when Claudia Webbe is hopefully exonerated. Their job is to provide a Left pole of attraction and a defence of socialist policies.

The Socialist Campaign Group, as shown in the CHIS 'Spy Cops' Bill is trying to demonstrate an alternative to the current direction.  There is no remotely plausible alternative.

I had a go at one of the groups.  It is smaller, greyer and less relevant.

1316777808144879630 2020-10-16 00:27:48 +0800 <mygibbo> Well done, Margaret.  The Bill is immoral and unacceptable.
1316775923946082304 2020-10-16 00:20:19 +0800 <mygibbo> It is the right thing to do, Nav.  This Bill is unacceptable.
1316762582712279043 2020-10-15 23:27:18 +0800 <mygibbo> Very proud of our @LpoolWaltonCLP Member of Parliament today.
1316744500094607360 2020-10-15 22:15:27 +0800 <mygibbo> @Catheri22274003 @19MW98 @siennamarla @DanCardenMP Oh, believe me, we know.
1316743846194294785 2020-10-15 22:12:51 +0800 <mygibbo> @ta_mills My son reminds me this is satire!  I am a bit literal.
1316740698729779200 2020-10-15 22:00:21 +0800 <mygibbo> @DanCardenMP references Hillsborough, the Blacklist Support Group, Shrewsbury and others.  We should listen to the Labour movement and justice campaign groups always.  They are the backbone of our party.
1316740419062059009 2020-10-15 21:59:14 +0800 <mygibbo> @DanCardenMP is right to say Labour MPs should not have trust in this government on the CHIS Bill.  "We have a healthy suspicion of state power."  He has the full support of @LpoolWaltonCLP in opposing it.
1316740041234939905 2020-10-15 21:57:44 +0800 <mygibbo> Just watching our MP, @DanCardenMP, speaking against the Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill.  It is an unacceptable piece of legislation.  All Labour MPs should vote against it.
1316739678591213569 2020-10-15 21:56:17 +0800 <mygibbo> If you have any doubts about the immoral CHIS Bill, read Helen's story.   https://t.co/PDB2h85O1Q
1316715099915259904 2020-10-15 20:18:37 +0800 <mygibbo> @AndrewMarkSP @LiamThorpECHO @DanCardenMP @LpoolWaltonCLP I don't agree at all.  Passing this bill into law is a green light for state undercover agents to commit appalling abuses.  The Tories would love to dismantle the Human Rights Act too.  This is an essential stand on principle.
1316714660679372801 2020-10-15 20:16:53 +0800 <mygibbo> Boris Johnson: "Today is the deadline. I will walk away."  Deadline passes.  No walking.  Man, that Buller boy ain't got no damned principles!
1316712721572941825 2020-10-15 20:09:10 +0800 <mygibbo> Absolutely the right thing to do in opposition to an immoral bill.  @LpoolWaltonCLP backs Dan all the way.
1316712444740468737 2020-10-15 20:08:04 +0800 <mygibbo> @AndrewMarkSP @LiamThorpECHO @DanCardenMP will be back in leadership roles in the future I am sure.  Realism is no excuse in this case, a bill that would protect undercover state agents even if they committed murder, torture or sexual abuse.  @LpoolWaltonCLP backs its MP all the way.
1316712022978048002 2020-10-15 20:06:24 +0800 <mygibbo> @DanCardenMP has resigned his front bench position in opposition to the immoral CHIS Bill.  There should be widespread opposition to this legislation this evening.
1316711165586792448 2020-10-15 20:02:59 +0800 <mygibbo> We have @DanCardenMP give a lead this morning by resigning from the front bench.  It should focus the minds of colleagues on opposition to the immoral CHIS bill.
1316710728439652352 2020-10-15 20:01:15 +0800 <mygibbo> @jangalang34 @DanCardenMP There are some issues of principle you can't sidestep and this is one.  Dan has, and will, stand up for the people of Walton with all he has and we will back him all the way.
1316709290112094208 2020-10-15 19:55:32 +0800 <mygibbo> @AndrewMarkSP @LiamThorpECHO It is called principle.
1316709040341352449 2020-10-15 19:54:33 +0800 <mygibbo> That is no excuse for a Bill that could give undercover agents to commit murder, torture or sexual abuse without redress.  @DanCardenMP is right to step down over this issue.
1316708723193270273 2020-10-15 19:53:17 +0800 <mygibbo> Spot on, Laura.  Made up that our MP @DanCardenMP has resigned from the front bench over this issue.
1316688942373232640 2020-10-15 18:34:41 +0800 <mygibbo> Well done, Dan.  Proud to support you as @LpoolWaltonCLP constituency secretary.

1316651842248597509 2020-10-15 16:07:16 +0800 <mygibbo> This government pleads poverty when it comes to funding local government or continuing the furlough, it has replaced any form of scrutiny with a troughfrom which private companies like Serco can gorge.  Immoral and damaging to the public health.    https://t.co/QfZg7VmXTr
1316468632981995524 2020-10-15 03:59:15 +0800 <mygibbo> We should take this doctor seriously.

1315733541871923200 2020-10-13 03:18:16 +0800 <mygibbo> @Cornish_Damo Not just someone.  Every Labour MP should vote against the Bill if the amendments fall and a Tory 80 seat majority make that pretty certain.
1315733205245460481 2020-10-13 03:16:55 +0800 <mygibbo> @David__Osland The test is the third reading of the spy cops bill now.  Starmer has said, according to Sienna Rodgers, he will not recommend a vote against the bill.  Labour MPs should vote against it regardless.

1315673246130470914 2020-10-12 23:18:40 +0800 <mygibbo> Renters should not be dreading homelessness during this crisis.  If 'putting arms round people' means anything, it means ensuring the roof over their heads.  Well done, Dan.
1315669712324493314 2020-10-12 23:04:38 +0800 <mygibbo> When the Prime Minister says he is putting his arms around people, I hope that is metaphorical.  On Merseyside, it would be an unwise move.  We remember the comments he sanctioned about this city.
1315668980259000321 2020-10-12 23:01:43 +0800 <mygibbo> Sending Liverpool back to the 80s is no way to manage this crisis.   https://t.co/gKMWFFTY6Q

Hopefully, 6 months is at the extreme end of what might happen, but that depends on test and trace and that requires greater involvement from the public health teams rather than private companies.

Corbyn in 2017, despite constant obstruction, led us to 40%, adding 3 million voters.  If the whole PLP had backed him and not lumbered us with a Europe policy that gave two fingers to leave voters, we would be in government now.  https://t.co/XsOouJbeGe

1314113185176313856 2020-10-08 15:59:33 +0800 <mygibbo> Just watched moving item about the work of NHS staff nursing a man back to health.  One nurse was from the Philippines, I think, and the other had a name of African heritage.  Nothing could better summarise benefits of migration.  Let's remember that and sacrifices made for us.

1313932874157109256 2020-10-08 04:03:03 +0800 <mygibbo> Absolutely.  The trade unions helped found the Labour Party and are central to its activities.  When people talk about a 'broad church', that includes unions, affiliates and Labour-supporting movements.
1313932550012887045 2020-10-08 04:01:46 +0800 <mygibbo> @GeoffNorcott We were at the same point, 40%, in the poll that really matters, the General Election of 2017.  We now know that some of the people demanding unity now were doing everything in their power to topple a twice-elected leader.  No double standards.
1313932179341279234 2020-10-08 04:00:17 +0800 <mygibbo> @KatyJayne101 You can't demand unity behind Starmer and rubbish the previous twice-elected leader.  Our CLP always delivers Labour MPs and councillors and we have no truck with people who act the way some did against Corbyn.  We need Keir to demonstrate unity and stick to the ten pledges.
1313931334352547840 2020-10-08 03:56:56 +0800 <mygibbo> @make_trouble McCluskey backed the twice-elected leader Jeremy Corbyn solidly, observing the democratic mandate.  Meanwhile, some in the PLP and bureaucracy did everything to oppose that democratic mandate and destroy Corbyn.  Read the books by Owen Jones, Gabriel Pogrund and Patrick Maguire.
1313930869963358208 2020-10-08 03:55:05 +0800 <mygibbo> @RichardGCorbett What a silly comment.  The answer is no.  Len McCluskey backed Labour's campaigns in 2017 and 2019 to the hilt while some in the PLP and bureaucracy....didn't.
1313922889012391936 2020-10-08 03:23:22 +0800 <mygibbo> @CrocodileCat2 @MerryMichaelW @DanielFooksArt You directly implied we don't support Labour. We fanned out across the North West constituencies and delivered the best vote in the country at home.  When you say things like that, you are duty bound to say what you did and how well your constituency did.  Actions not words.

Nor do I remember the union briefing against the leader, organising regular MP resignations, sulking in the Commons or doing any of the things catalogued in the Labour Leaks document.  Funny that.
1313878260435087360 2020-10-08 00:26:02 +0800 <mygibbo> @WritesBright @BylineTimes I note how you choose evidence selectively.  Our polling is still below the 2017 election when we recorded 40%, three million extra voters.  Instead of building on this, sections of the party telling us to shut up now continued sabotage with the People's Vote disaster.

It is pure hypocrisy to bring down a twice-elected leader then issue Stalinist demands to members to desist from any criticism.  Socialism needs democracy and debate.

People are not losing their jobs because of 'the lockdown', but government incompetence.  High death rates, big economic shock, fat contracts to chums.   The Tory way.
1313850497107927041 2020-10-07 22:35:43 +0800 <mygibbo> @BylineTimes @WritesBright We have the worst government in my lifetime, delivering one of the world's worst death rates and, simultaneously, one of the worst economic hits.  Labour is averaging 39% in the polls. At the 2017 GE it was 40%.  You can't just claim electability on this evidence. Prove it.

Read Left Out by Pogrund/Maguire and Owen Jones' book This Land.  The Left is not engaging in the kind of outrageous sabotage the Corbyn leadership suffered.
1313754799381401601 2020-10-07 16:15:27 +0800 <mygibbo> @Rikdisco @SyHawkes First past the post and the abysmal records of self-declared new parties from ILP to Respect make this unlikely.  McCluskey makes it clear Labour should be the party of working class people, but every socialist in the party is growing ever more frustrated at the present course.
1313753842404687872 2020-10-07 16:11:39 +0800 <mygibbo> @AlanSherry1 That makes no sense when the Tories have seen their polling fall substantially.  Governments don't lose support by their own failures alone.  The opposition has to be plausible.  Being constructive to disastrous incompetents is not good politics.
1313753533246779394 2020-10-07 16:10:25 +0800 <mygibbo> @fionambruce Our best performance since the end of Blair was Corbyn getting 40%, 10% better than Brown/Miliband.  The response of some telling us to unite now was not to build on that, but to destroy the leader who helped make it happen.  What lost the 2019 GE was ignoring the 2016 referendum

1313748229851435009 2020-10-07 15:49:20 +0800 <mygibbo> @AlanSherry1 This, from the summer, shows the crumbling of that initial rally-behind-the-government response.   https://t.co/3YTa5PCKlq  The Tories will not collapse without a concerted counter attack. That's what we need from Labour.
1313747420614995975 2020-10-07 15:46:07 +0800 <mygibbo> @AlanSherry1 The Tories reached a high point of 56% in the polls. They are now on 40%.  That is a dramatic drop.  There are reasons competent governments have good polling.  There are strong reasons the Tories are losing support, but we need convincing opposition to accelerate its collapse.

But I don’t see at the moment any dramatic move to disaffiliate from the Labour party. The Labour party is our party."  McCluskey
1313737585458663424 2020-10-07 15:07:03 +0800 <mygibbo> @ayeshahazarika We were doing better than the latest polls at the 2017 General Election, 40%.  It didn't persuade much of the party to get behind Corbyn.  The membership wants unity, but that means the party not shifting right and being 'constructive' towards the worst government in my lifetime.
1313736230224486400 2020-10-07 15:01:39 +0800 <mygibbo> @bayviewdreamer @skwawkbox I think you will find it is an unavoidable warning from one of the party's major backers that you can't discard the interests of working people without consequences.  I agree with Len and his executive.  I am hearing growing discontent from our membership.
1313735875650564097 2020-10-07 15:00:15 +0800 <mygibbo> What was that about 'not letting a good crisis go to waste'?  The few aren't suffering the privations of the many.

1313622767296745478 2020-10-07 07:30:48 +0800 <mygibbo> That Labour still trails the Tories in some polls after Johnson's catastrophic conduct of the Covid-19 crisis should focus minds on the quality of opposition the party is providing.

1313606892904644611 2020-10-07 06:27:43 +0800 <mygibbo> @mdbuckley Rubbish.  In 2017, despite internal sabotage, we added three million votes, a 10% rise in vote share.  Then some in the PLP hung a big, fat, undemocratic second referendum round our neck.

This demonstrates to me that Labour has to put meat on the bones and expose the fake Tory rhetoric.  https://t.co/IafWhbHVLd
1313437748209102850 2020-10-06 19:15:36 +0800 <mygibbo> A spectre failed to haunt the Johnson speech...  ....the spectre of austerity.  Forget the fatuous peroration of smiling, happy super-people striding across sunlit uplands.  His chancellor is preparing to pile the cost of Covid onto the shoulders of those least able to bear it.
1313434688393023488 2020-10-06 19:03:26 +0800 <mygibbo> Johnson's peroration is in equal parts risible, sick-making and mendacious.  And tragically, some millions of the population will swallow it hook, line and sinker.

1313431115273834497 2020-10-06 18:49:14 +0800 <mygibbo> 'The Covid crisis is a catalyst for change.'  Well, this government's incompetence has seen living people change into dead ones.

1313415570457587712 2020-10-06 17:47:28 +0800 <mygibbo> @rozzleberry Exactly that.  Some people are tested several times.
1313393055182053378 2020-10-06 16:18:00 +0800 <mygibbo> Johnson, 2020: "I remember how some people used to sneer at wind power, twenty years ago, and say that it wouldn’t pull the skin off a rice pudding.”  Johnson, 2013: “" Labour put in a load of wind farms that failed to pull the skin off a rice pudding.”  Consistency.

1313374663100239873 2020-10-06 15:04:55 +0800 <mygibbo> Sunak claims he is testing '250,000 people a day.'  That's the number of tests and some people tested several times.  The figure for people is 86,000, as he knows, and then there's yesterday's 16,000 missing tests that miraculously reappeared from an Excel spreadsheet.

1313142152147464193 2020-10-05 23:41:00 +0800 <mygibbo> @RishiSunak If you genuinely used the 'overwhelming might of the British state', nobody would have to lose their job.  Where there is a will there's a way.  Maybe you need more will.  A furlough isn't just for summer.
1313137730856071168 2020-10-05 23:23:26 +0800 <mygibbo> Not once, not twice, three times.  Stanley Johnson is a repeat offender in dispensing with his face covering.  Does he really think what lies beneath is so appealing?
1313137254924251142 2020-10-05 23:21:33 +0800 <mygibbo> Sunak says he will: "always balance the books."  This is language reminiscent of George Osborne when he was telling us we were all in it together then favoured the already rich and powerful in the austerity con.  Guess whose shoulders he will judge more able to bear the burden?
1313130085361254402 2020-10-05 22:53:03 +0800 <mygibbo> @NatGriffin3 @LLB___ Well, I think you will find the new crop are completely encouraging and welcoming, Nat.  In the last ten days we have held face-to-face Zoom meetings with members in five Momentum groups.  Transparent, democratic and open as we promised in our campaign.
1313128918673694722 2020-10-05 22:48:25 +0800 <mygibbo> @LLB___ @NatGriffin3 I think he should come along and debate issues of concern.  I think that was self-evident by posting opportunities to get involved.  Now I have made the implicit explicit.
1313126143940321280 2020-10-05 22:37:24 +0800 <mygibbo> @NatGriffin3 I thought you were in Momentum.  You could always have joined us campaigning in support of refugees and A Level students and for a pay rise for NHS staff.  Nobody was attacked.  https://t.co/bnNazwGYvG
1313099654083620868 2020-10-05 20:52:08 +0800 <mygibbo> Really?  Maybe @SkyNews would like to do its job and post what Johnson and his Ministers have been saying and compare that to his account here.  It is what the media is paid for.  Please do your job.

This is a country of economic migrants and it works both ways.  We should welcome economic migrants and refugees.

I met Sudanese guys fleeing Darfur in Calais, Iraqis, Syrians, Eritreans all facing horrific repression, war and terror.  Being politically illiterate you don't know asylum seekers do not have to stay in the first country.   Read.

Refugees don't risk their lives in tiny boats because they are trying to misuse the system.  They do it out of need.  Migration is a good thing.  Refugees are welcome here.

Asylum seekers in particular are fleeing persecution, war or hunger and deserve our hospitality, empathy and solidarity.  No human being is illegal.  Refugees and migrants are welcome here.

1311306323749986305 2020-09-30 22:06:05 +0800 <mygibbo> @BrokenBarnet I don't think it is as simple as good and evil, but the priority clearly has to be the removal of Trump.   I don't agree Sanders couldn't have won. He is far less open to the populist line Trump peddles about the Democratic establishment.
1311301796082716674 2020-09-30 21:48:05 +0800 <mygibbo> That the government could even consider detaining asylum seekers on Ascension Island, a remote, volcanic island in the middle of the Atlantic, 4,000 miles from Great Britain is not just inhumane.  It is obscene.  No human being is illegal.  Refugees are welcome here.

That said, you don't close the book on the past.  Sanders and Corbyn were hope. We need to learn the lessons and revive it as soon as possible.
1311284811642941440 2020-09-30 20:40:36 +0800 <mygibbo> @MrBreakspear @siennamarla We are both.  A Labour Party that fails to support renters and workers fighting for their jobs will not rebuild loyalty in its former heartlands.
1311284454833426435 2020-09-30 20:39:11 +0800 <mygibbo> Many Labour Party members will support renters in peacefully opposing evictions.  Our party leadership should take the same position.
1311284258833563650 2020-09-30 20:38:24 +0800 <mygibbo> I think Labour should be up front in support of the students' demands.  They should get a first class university experience or get their money back.

1311227775534149642 2020-09-30 16:53:57 +0800 <mygibbo> Biden says I am the Democratic Party now.  There is the voice of the Democratic Party establishment.

Johnson's incompetence dwarfs May's and we are still only hovering level or just above.

In 2017, we repaired much of the damage, adding three million votes, 10% extra vote share, the biggest shift since 1945.  Those hopes were wrecked by people who refused to accept two leadership victories.  Democrats, my arse!

I headed off to university in 1971- freedom, a full grant that I didn't have to pay back, fantastic music, still excellent public services, the vestigial security of the Welfare State.

Takes a lot more than wishful thinking.

I'm defending a previous, twice-elected leader.  I campaign for elected leaders.  Everyone should back elected leaders.  Anything else would be hypocritical.

That and refusing to accept 2016 referendum result to blame.

And when did the majority of the PLP get behind that twice-elected leader?
1309225344885547009 2020-09-25 04:17:01 +0800 <mygibbo> @shaunjlawson Achievements?  You seem to have forgotten the biggest rise in vote share since 1945, an extra three million votes.  Unfortunately, the gesture politics of some of his opponents was to be ready to throw a General Election.
1309224985265926145 2020-09-25 04:15:35 +0800 <mygibbo> @shaunjlawson So if there is an 80-seat majority and our Shadow Defence Secretary has coruscated the bill it looks consistent and sensible to vote against it.
1309224637465792512 2020-09-25 04:14:12 +0800 <mygibbo> @shaunjlawson So why not get Brexit done when the public said get Brexit done in June 2016?

1309109895946436609 2020-09-24 20:38:15 +0800 <mygibbo> @kit_chrisr @HairyChestLover Politically, there was nothing whatsoever to lose by voting against this bill.  We should have been firm on principle, as eighteen Labour MPs were.  Abstention was not adequate in the circumstances.
1309109378851770368 2020-09-24 20:36:12 +0800 <mygibbo> In a pandemic with the potential to pauperise people through no fault of their own, what is a non-viable job?  The Tories think Dido Harding has a viable job, but then she is married to a Tory MP and went to a posh school.
1309108759810265101 2020-09-24 20:33:45 +0800 <mygibbo> @kit_chrisr @HairyChestLover Distancing yourself from a previous leader isn't necessarily principled politics.  Time to provide proper opposition on bill, but unlikely committee stage would have much impact with an 80-seat Tory majority.  A clear signal on a vital human rights issue would have been welcome.
1309108263410114562 2020-09-24 20:31:46 +0800 <mygibbo> @CarlTSpeak @kit_chrisr @HairyChestLover You can still amend at the committee stage and vote against at the end of its passage through the Commons.  I think it was important, on a strong human rights issue, to signal firm opposition.

1309040171455844353 2020-09-24 16:01:12 +0800 <mygibbo> On an issue like this, I still think the entire Socialist Campaign Group should have voted against the bill.  Starmer created this situation, but there should have been a solid stand of principle.  I don't go around denouncing people. I would rather say well done to the eighteen.
1309038858538024960 2020-09-24 15:55:59 +0800 <mygibbo> Starmer should not have whipped his MPs to abstain.  Labour should have voted solidly against this bill.  Well done to the Labour MPs who voted against.

1308363763452706816 2020-09-22 19:13:24 +0800 <mygibbo> @paulmasonnews Embedding local Labour Parties in communities, standing by renters, relating national policy to local roots is a good start.

1307244022310854656 2020-09-19 17:03:56 +0800 <mygibbo> @John_Burgess001 Looks like London is now actively discussing similar measures to the North East and North West.
1307240824078577664 2020-09-19 16:51:14 +0800 <mygibbo> @helen_tweed @BlackRaven999 @RhianLismore @KP24 @piersmorgan Precisely the kind of measures that have helped.  Different in different places, but coherent, robust measures that put the UK to shame.
1307240618083713025 2020-09-19 16:50:25 +0800 <mygibbo> @rich_mvfc @KP24 @piersmorgan This makes no sense whatsoever.  Both are advanced democracies. Both can take firm and coherent public health measures.  New Zealand did and cut deaths to zero.  The UK didn't with inevitable consequences.

You are testing consistently like Singapore, New Zealand and other places do.  My daughter works cabin crew and has seen it working perfectly will in countries more serious about public health.
1307051999960027136 2020-09-19 04:20:55 +0800 <mygibbo> Two years ago Councillor @GerardWoodhous1 and I opened the outdoor library shelter at Whitefield Primary.   The school has now won a National Teaching Award.  Very proud of its achievements.  @LpoolWaltonCLP  https://t.co/iEq7WKqcb6
1307048242895564803 2020-09-19 04:05:59 +0800 <mygibbo> Whitefield is a lovely school in our constituency.  Well done.  @LpoolWaltonCLP

1307039003951198209 2020-09-19 03:29:16 +0800 <mygibbo> @sproston_rob @KP24 @piersmorgan That doesn't make sense.  Fewer people but a smaller state to do it.  It is all about leadership and will, not size of population.  South Korea far better than the UK for example and not an island.
1307006006237462529 2020-09-19 01:18:09 +0800 <mygibbo> @kennnny9595 I don't think it's down to the councils.  Merseyside is doing the same as the North East.  It is an inconsistency of policy from government.

1306992916758433799 2020-09-19 00:26:08 +0800 <mygibbo> @NeilBandtock @KP24 @piersmorgan We have 'capacity.'  All across the country people are having to drive long distances to get tested.  The system is a mess.  Far from trying to bring something down, we want a government that actually copes.   Ten million into lockdown and counting.
1306990858500268040 2020-09-19 00:17:58 +0800 <mygibbo> @NeilBandtock @KP24 @piersmorgan We face eye-watering levels of unemployment.  If there is a second lockdown, the UK will be punished for its inability to test and trace.  And that does not even address tens of thousands of deaths.  The apologias for the worst government of my lifetime are risible.
1306990335852240898 2020-09-19 00:15:53 +0800 <mygibbo> @angelazhay @Johnnysmalls78 @rich_mvfc @KP24 @piersmorgan And all these arguments of exceptionalism amount to what?  Should the UK have locked down the way NZ did? Yes.  Should the UK have had a responsible leader the way NZ did? Yes.  Could the UK have implemented a zero-Covid strategy? Absolutely.
1306989882817097730 2020-09-19 00:14:05 +0800 <mygibbo> If incidence of Covid-19 show the North West first, London second and the North East third, why is the North East locking down first, the North West second and London not at all?  (ONS).
1306981924813053953 2020-09-18 23:42:28 +0800 <mygibbo> @NeilBandtock @KP24 @piersmorgan It dealt with the crisis far more effectively than the UK, all but eliminating the virus.  Our economic problems are among the worst in the world.  Johnson is hopeless.
1306981380149186560 2020-09-18 23:40:18 +0800 <mygibbo> @RhianLismore @KP24 @piersmorgan The UK could have tested and quarantined at airports, could have locked down earlier, been consistent. Instead it delayed, the PM boasted of touching patients, no PPE, no test and trace.  Ahern showed leadership with fewer resources. The UK, 6th biggest economy, floundered.
1306922480758599687 2020-09-18 19:46:15 +0800 <mygibbo> @rich_mvfc @KP24 @piersmorgan We are also an island.  That is nonsense.  What was lacking was will and leadership.

1306906078584565760 2020-09-18 18:41:04 +0800 <mygibbo> @KP24 @piersmorgan At the outset, we should have pursued a zero-Covid strategy like New Zealand.  It is not too late to do that now.  I hope you were adding your voice to the many calls for an effective anti-Covid strategy from the outset.

MPs weren't 'pushed out.'  The Tiggers, after endless sabotage, tried to pull a SDP and failed dismally, some gliding into the Liberals to help split the anti-Tory vote.  That is toxic.
1305402902152908800 2020-09-14 15:07:59 +0800 <mygibbo> @MoT53 @unojen_wood @Keir_Starmer It is an interpretation.  2017 demonstrated decisiveness and produced the biggest shift in vote share since 1945.  Instead of getting behind the leader for such a positive performance, sections of the party stepped up its attacks on him.  Shameful.

It must be very comfy living in a world where years of obstructing a twice-elected leader don't matter and the electability of Sir Keir is assured.  I want to see Labour at least reach the 40% Corbyn achieved.

The obstruction of the hopes of 2017, the biggest vote share since 1945, by some, is beyond question.  I won't act like them.

Most of all, if the PLP had got behind the leader as we are asked to be behind Keir.

1303656983216771072 2020-09-09 19:30:20 +0800 <mygibbo> To support British farming, Johnson is wearing wheat and talking bullshit.  Slurry with a fringe on top.
1303656662537064449 2020-09-09 19:29:03 +0800 <mygibbo> Johnson's every answer is deflection.  Why don't you support NHS workers?  Why don't you support us?  Why don't you love me?  It is time he actually answered a question.

1303655659146285057 2020-09-09 19:25:04 +0800 <mygibbo> Apparently, government ministers are wearing wheat to demonstrate that their reputations are shredded.

I am also a democrat. Socialists, whether leave or remain, should have focussed all their attentions on a soft Brexit.  If we had done that, we might now have a Labour government.

1303451469035831297 2020-09-09 05:53:41 +0800 <mygibbo> Brandon Lewis has admitted the government has broken the law in a “very specific and limited way.”   Is this the same government that grandstanded over Extinction Rebellion protestors temporarily blocking the delivery of a few newspapers...in a very specific and limited way?

For that reason, I am sure Mr Jenrick will agree it is wrong that three corporations dominate 83% of the UK's national newspaper market.  It's the ownership, stupid.

A claim to balance then resort to the trendy right-wing and slanted adjective 'woke', a word that anyone with an attachment to the English language would only use in the context: 'Boris Johnson woke up in the Commons to discover he was utterly incompetent.'

1301624635298062343 2020-09-04 04:54:30 +0800 <mygibbo> @tonymc39 @lukeakehurst Inaccurate as usual, but I expect nothing more from you than unevidenced claims.  'Fellow travellers?'  What's this, Tony 'Joe McCarthy' McDonough, a man with an outlook so sour he would curdle the workers' milk?
1301622663035662336 2020-09-04 04:46:40 +0800 <mygibbo> @tonymc39 @lukeakehurst This isn't 1997.  A serious crisis demands radical answers.  The red flag might be fluttering sooner than you think.  We'll be standing up for the rights of refugees and NHS workers the next two weekends.  Come along. You might learn something.

1301621563180175360 2020-09-04 04:42:18 +0800 <mygibbo> @tonymc39 @lukeakehurst Celebrating undemocratic and damaging sabotage is pretty tawdry.  I am proud of the socialist principles on which we stood and the respect we showed for the views of our members in two leadership elections.  Enjoy your poisoned chalice of a Tory victory.  We'll be back.
1301619492519374848 2020-09-04 04:34:04 +0800 <mygibbo> @tonymc39 @lukeakehurst Desperation is refusing to acknowledge that nobody has denied the veracity of the damning material in the Labour Leaks document.  Still, you have your usual axe to grind.  Happy grinding, Tony.

1301531052389924864 2020-09-03 22:42:38 +0800 <mygibbo> A number of journalists and writers have depicted Jeremy Corbyn's response to the Skripal poisoning as 'pro-Russia', 'faux anti-imperialist', 'unpatriotic' and so on and so forth. This is what the leader's office put out. Criticism is fine. Rewriting history is mischievous.  https://t.co/u1sxYeRUnP

He says he will meet the bereaved his government has failed so badly then, in a show of craven cowardice and contempt, backtracks.  I wouldn't trust him to run a bath.   https://t.co/MwJ48QB4pj
