1342054668038529024 2020-12-24 18:29:01 +0800 <tesssummers98> @SpencerHills2 @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost @Nigel_Farage @june_mummery @BillCashMP @Arron_banks Sounds as if the French were lying (shock horror) and the concessions made are mainly from the EU.
1342053132600307712 2020-12-24 18:22:55 +0800 <tesssummers98> @jcsid5 And soon to be long lost presenters.
1342051451326050307 2020-12-24 18:16:14 +0800 <tesssummers98> This sounds okay. Seems they're banning super trawlers too. I may have underestimated Boris - or rather David Frost.
1342049958258683904 2020-12-24 18:10:18 +0800 <tesssummers98> @Saffrontulip I've heard similar, think it's right. If they've bested the EU on the level playing field, it sounds like a pretty good deal.
1342037925786234881 2020-12-24 17:22:30 +0800 <tesssummers98> They've now got Dominic Grieve on. Talk about a whinge-fest!
1342019056317169665 2020-12-24 16:07:31 +0800 <tesssummers98> @Bust3d00 I think this tiny isolated rock has done pretty well. Half the world speak English. The UK's contribution to EU coffers equalled 18 other countries. You live up to your avatar. Your knowledge of geopolitics is that of a child.
1342017532476223488 2020-12-24 16:01:27 +0800 <tesssummers98> @Rossva1189 Love it. Remainers having a wake this Christmas.
1342015683278876672 2020-12-24 15:54:06 +0800 <tesssummers98> @Bust3d00 The "it" millions of brave men and boys died for in wars defending. The "it" that stops us being slaves to an enemy force, say China. The "it" that let's you play on your Xbox instead of working 18 hrs a day for a foreign slavemaster..
1342013825084780551 2020-12-24 15:46:43 +0800 <tesssummers98> @Achinback1 @annofarabia I hope they ban the supertrawlers from day one, or there'll be no fish left.
1342012989117968384 2020-12-24 15:43:24 +0800 <tesssummers98> SkyNews has Hilary Benn on discussing a Brexit deal' "If you regard sovereignty as a gain.." These people just don't get it.

1339493465391063040 2020-12-17 16:51:43 +0800 <tesssummers98> @SkyUK Why has RT been removed from my channels (I'm in Ireland) while other news channels are still there? Also many radio stations removed. While I be charged less for getting less channels?

1334587288517480450 2020-12-04 03:56:19 +0800 <tesssummers98> The Children of Men is a dystopian novel by PD James. Set in England in 2021, it centres on the results of mass infertility. James describes a UK that is steadily depopulating and focuses on a small group of resisters who do not share the disillusionment of the masses. ü§î

1327907079210856448 2020-11-15 17:31:33 +0800 <tesssummers98> @BasqueLondon I sometimes wonder if we should do a mass population movement - red pilled types in one country, blue pilled in another. You just know one would thrive and the other would destroy itself.
1327906371736662016 2020-11-15 17:28:44 +0800 <tesssummers98> @top1percentile That's exactly how it is. I wonder if, centuries ago, some Roman was tweeting on his parchment "feels like the End Days..."

Biden promotes Iran so it'll protect Islam before Christians. It'll all impact on us. This is a turning point in history for the free West.

1323909617420820480 2020-11-04 16:47:04 +0800 <tesssummers98> @Bignozer Its a deliberate ploy to stop Trump being formally elected. Read my tweet where Pelosi admitted this is what they'd do.
1323909120001531904 2020-11-04 16:45:05 +0800 <tesssummers98> The bias from EU countries is sickening. This latest from the Irish media: TRUMP MAKES UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS OF ELECTION 'FRAUD' AS PRESIDENTIAL RACE HANGS ON KNIFE-EDGE  https://t.co/MSUD6E0PPk Unsubstantiated!

1323879033621389313 2020-11-04 14:45:32 +0800 <tesssummers98> How to cheat: Nancy Pelosi: "Whatever the end count is on the election that occurs on Tuesday, he will be elected. On January 20 he will be inaugurated president of the United States." "The states will count the votes that they have in a timely fashion"  https://t.co/h1NzJFY6Ke
1323875796218466308 2020-11-04 14:32:40 +0800 <tesssummers98> From the same site: "The cheating states stopped counting when they saw Trump winning. Now they are trying to figure up how many fraudulent fake votes they are going to need for Biden, and if they can get away with it."

1323869549423448064 2020-11-04 14:07:51 +0800 <tesssummers98> @Nick_Pye I read on a US site that ballot counters are taking them home. European news channels making it sound like Biden's won. Looks like major cheating going on. I hope to God they don't get away with it.

1323523368755363847 2020-11-03 15:12:15 +0800 <tesssummers98> Watched news channels covering the Islamic terror attack on a synagogue and others places in Vienna. Sky just briefly mentioned an attack, no mention of it being a synagogue, then went on with political propaganda.

1323228103259410432 2020-11-02 19:38:58 +0800 <tesssummers98> @KarenH777 The Chinese state has lent about $1.5 trillion in direct loans and trade credits to more than 150 countries.

1322431636655525890 2020-10-31 14:54:06 +0800 <tesssummers98> @Jimbothebull @CarolineBaynton I read stats some weeks back that half the covid patients caught it in hospital. I'd rather treat family at home. How did we get to this? A few decades ago our hospitals were immaculate. Everything's gone downhill since then. Everything.
1322428368860680193 2020-10-31 14:41:07 +0800 <tesssummers98> @Jimbothebull @CarolineBaynton But so many people, even who I've considered sensible and right-thinking, are falling for this bullshit. Just now:  https://t.co/yTDPtGcxim

A bug which kills about 0.5% of the people who catch it, much like the flu, shuts down the country and stops weddings, whereas the Blitz killed hundreds of thousands and people carried on.

1310251297254387713 2020-09-28 00:13:47 +0800 <tesssummers98> @Graeme__McGuire How to put it simply? Can you still smell things when wearing your mask? If so, realise that those smells are molecules. If those odour molecules can penetrate your mask, so can covid molecules.

1309408422794846208 2020-09-25 16:24:30 +0800 <tesssummers98> Croydon - another little town that used to be a respectable suburb.

1309367767070638080 2020-09-25 13:42:57 +0800 <tesssummers98> Weeks of rioting, burning down properties and destruction in the US, not covered by the media. Today Sky News cover a 'far right' protest by 'the Oath Keepers, a group of veterans, as if that was as bad, but all I've seen is a peaceful march.
1309365029238706176 2020-09-25 13:32:04 +0800 <tesssummers98> There are plenty around the PM who urge far greater lockdown, but he‚Äôs resisting.

1309359656821821440 2020-09-25 13:10:43 +0800 <tesssummers98> @AndyScanlan You use paid volunteers who've had the virus. If there are so many that it's a pandemic, how come they can't find any of these to volunteer? So few that they have to physically inject their volunteers with it?

1309043460511608832 2020-09-24 16:14:16 +0800 <tesssummers98> @Adamadamant1111 I'm all for equality, but we're now supposed to debase ourselves and be silent while we're subject to abuse. The irony is that it's most of us who are paying for all this.
1309043006222331913 2020-09-24 16:12:28 +0800 <tesssummers98> @teasoil Yes. But whoever's using it is racist. Do a twitter search for the word gammons and see the disgusting stuff they're tweeting. If they posted the same about black people they'd be banned in an instant.
1309040599761387521 2020-09-24 16:02:54 +0800 <tesssummers98> @Vote_UKIP @astenev No, if he's locked his account I don't think anyone can see it?
1309039975560810498 2020-09-24 16:00:25 +0800 <tesssummers98> Is it just me, or do you think calling white people 'gammons' - ie equating them to pigs, is just as bad as equating black people to monkeys? I think it's appalling that this is acceptable on all social media.
1309039172565504002 2020-09-24 15:57:14 +0800 <tesssummers98> @LFProduct He's the PM. He can sideline them, but he obeys their every word and let's them speak for him at press conferences.
1309022536877985792 2020-09-24 14:51:07 +0800 <tesssummers98> @astenev @Vote_UKIP For now. They constantly change them, probably multiple bot accounts.

1309017524474966019 2020-09-24 14:31:12 +0800 <tesssummers98> As for Whitty, my previous tweet: "received a large grant, $40 million of which went to a group of malaria research bodies of which he was Director" This pair of charlatans need to be sacked asap.  https://t.co/Aazim4sKnY
1309012991283728391 2020-09-24 14:13:12 +0800 <tesssummers98> I reported some of the vile abuse I got on a thread last week from the Leftwaffe. Just got notice that they did break the rules. Checked and they're not banned, just locked the account so we 'gammons' can't read their abuse. I made an obvious joke and got banned for a week.  https://t.co/QRQwtSOoHO
1309011601610203137 2020-09-24 14:07:40 +0800 <tesssummers98> @BaqueHime Exactly. I don't watch BBC news, but I imagine they're the same

1309009449252786178 2020-09-24 13:59:07 +0800 <tesssummers98> @ConceptsBBK Not 100% sure. Either Boris is just weak, or there's a global agenda going on to use covid as an excuse to cover up for the impending economic collapse, (which is unavoidable in my opinion.)
1309008123068284928 2020-09-24 13:53:51 +0800 <tesssummers98> SlyNews coverage of the US election show a series of people saying... "I cannot vote for Trump." - "Voting for him was the biggest mistake of my life" -  Such balanced, unbiased reporting.
