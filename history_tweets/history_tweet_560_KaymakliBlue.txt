1339257073675030528 2020-12-17 01:12:23 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @inkyfirelight @eb454 Ah yes, with nothing left you fall to insults because a woman refuses to cover herself head to toe in public in fear of "contaminating" others  how fascist of you

1339033398640164864 2020-12-16 10:23:34 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> is Cyberpunk 2077 worth the price?

1337110815216844800 2020-12-11 03:03:55 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @OohLaLaDarc it's the kitchen table and its at least 10 years old, it needs to be refinished, we already lost one of the four chairs and I just had to superglue and rescrew another one.   I'm sure i can find a decent replacement for cheap
1337109408803786752 2020-12-11 02:58:20 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> if a piece of furniture isn't a heirloom, how often should one replace it?  5 years? 10?  or should one keep repairing it in perpetuity?

1337085674877415424 2020-12-11 01:24:01 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @QueenOfGayJews Bleaching and dying hair is horrible, horrible torture and it should never be done for anyone but the person themselves. I've burnt my scalp so many damn times and my hair is just destroyed

1332371717822369795 2020-11-28 01:12:26 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> I was skeptical at first but i didn't mind Dawson as Ahsoka. Hasn't been a shit episode of Mandalorian yet and the farther they can get from the sequels the happier I am. Those two surprises at the end was greatly appreciated as an EU truther

1332307011837460485 2020-11-27 20:55:19 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @brianlilley @JustinTrudeau Vaccine's could be available tomorrow and most people, including my family will not take it. It's too fast too soon and the SCIENTISTS‚Ñ¢Ô∏è are telling us that we will STILL have to wear masks and social distance even with the vaccine.   HARD PASS
1332163258388684801 2020-11-27 11:24:05 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @Fentyyyonce Idk what that is but it‚Äôs not lasagna
1332162132150939650 2020-11-27 11:19:37 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @realikamusume And masks are a sacred icon that can not be questioned

1332128586770235392 2020-11-27 09:06:19 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> Stupid winters got me wanting nothing but charcuterie platters.  Give me meat and cheese and fucking bread! I want three different kinds of olives and the salt to go with them.
1332127919401959425 2020-11-27 09:03:40 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @BlackAngus_GotN Jesu those are expensive
1332127209549557761 2020-11-27 09:00:51 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @BlackAngus_GotN With the speed government moves my great X 9 grandchildren would recive it and it would be 100 years out of date
1332125708294844416 2020-11-27 08:54:53 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @privatecitizenn @suzDaFlooz The would have to sedate and imprison me, to keep me from storming that hospital.
1332123733289439234 2020-11-27 08:47:02 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @BlackAngus_GotN True, but through movies the sheep are trained to be scared of the yellow hazmat suits
1332120427255058434 2020-11-27 08:33:54 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @IntellectEmbarg Great now I want a half cape
1332119613455224833 2020-11-27 08:30:40 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @Kuryakin007 @_SJPeace_ If "AMERICA BAD" why did you come here in the first place and why do you remain?
1332119266519261184 2020-11-27 08:29:17 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @BlackAngus_GotN I'm *THIS* fucking close to buying one of  those yellow hazmat costumes to wear in public  if the government wants to be absurd I CAN BE ABSURD
1332118873756160000 2020-11-27 08:27:43 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @SundayintheSky @_SJPeace_ Did you cause ANY of the acts in the photos to happen? if not your "apologies" are meaningless and self aggrandizing
1332118579097919488 2020-11-27 08:26:33 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @_SJPeace_ Why though? I'm not connected to any of these people and you wouldn't give a fuck if these photos showed white people in pain
1332118298255712256 2020-11-27 08:25:26 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @BlackAngus_GotN I'm becoming more and more of an individualist with each government overreach
1332118094215405568 2020-11-27 08:24:37 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @BlackAngus_GotN Husband wears one, he's more worried about the fine but getting the cold as a smoker will suck. They keep pushing the "asymptomatic spread" BS, because they NEED everyone to wear the mask so we feel disconnected
1332117145832935424 2020-11-27 08:20:51 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @BlackAngus_GotN @YourAlberta the "listen to local media" part made me laugh...
1332116832262602753 2020-11-27 08:19:37 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @BlackAngus_GotN I didn't wear one when it was a suggestion, now that it's mandatory with a fine if you disobey, that makes me even less inclined to obey
1332114850990854144 2020-11-27 08:11:44 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @GoodBadFlicks Not even a wafer thin slice?
1332114552461295616 2020-11-27 08:10:33 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @autiscat ooh that's even worse,   go take a nap and relax before you get a migraine
1332114414737080320 2020-11-27 08:10:00 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @BlackAngus_GotN I'll probably be going over to moms house to help her decorate soon, and I will continue to not wear or deliberately wear a mask inappropriately.   I will no longer obey an authoritarian draconian government
1332113877249658885 2020-11-27 08:07:52 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @autiscat Tryptophan!!!  https://t.co/Okc2QBjECa

1331603758522920963 2020-11-25 22:20:50 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @NotJeffEpstein I think i'm the only one  I know who doesn't get the "Outdoorsy" lifestyle.   I've never once had fun camping or hiking it's never warm enough in the woods and I always have to keep an eye on the dog or in this case the baby because no one else will.

I've seen it at least three times, I've listened to people talk about it endlessly and while i think it's a fine movie. I don't find it scary, I don't "See" the connections others are making to it.
1327655890019700738 2020-11-15 00:53:25 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @naughty_nerdess I‚Äôll check that out, had a ‚Äúneed‚Äù to watch SG1 and got annoyed to find out not only did prime not have season 1 but I‚Äôd have to sign up for MGM to get season 2
1327655324715651074 2020-11-15 00:51:10 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> Unpopular opinion  The Shining is overrated as is most of Stephen King novels and the movies made from those novels.

1324801818786844673 2020-11-07 03:52:21 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @RealWriteWinger I'm chill, mostly cause I'm Canadian but I also expected the Dems to rig this election. I didn't expect them to allow Trump a second win and with Trump doing little to help the average white man, let him loose, maybe it will help wake people up.

1321818391582179329 2020-10-29 22:17:17 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @MayorBowser So Covid is so deadly it can kill you even if you don't have symptoms, and you need the test to tell you if you have it but it can be beaten by a hard rain?  Damn this is the weirdest pandemic EVER  and yes I'm including the "dancing sickness" in the pandemic list

I'm sick of black fragility and Baizuo's like you.

1302960493817020416 2020-09-07 21:22:44 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @leafybinch @Nature_and_Race its a word, just a word and the fact that blacks react so violently to it (unless its shouted in a rap song) and white liberals react so submissively to the demand not to say it is evidence that MORE people need to say it. Words only have the power we give them.
1302958190003249154 2020-09-07 21:13:34 +0800 <KaymakliBlue> @leafybinch @Nature_and_Race And the saying of a WORD any WORD does not require physical violence. This time nigger was actually said, all other times the violence happens and than they claim "YT called me Nigger" it's the black criminals get out of jail free card
