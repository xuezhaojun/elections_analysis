1343759575195987970 2020-12-29 11:23:43 +0800 <hboo711> @steffie_effie6 Same.  I can't forget the lies and the gaslighting job he did on Rocky ever.
1343759248816304128 2020-12-29 11:22:25 +0800 <hboo711> @Jessica65481190 It's up to the Captain none of us or Eddie

1343758138269433856 2020-12-29 11:18:00 +0800 <hboo711> @realhwofsunset Eddie is a d*ckhead.  He's deck crew he need to let the Captain make remarks and decisions about the Chef.  I'll never see Eddie the same after watching him lie and gaslight Rocky.  He's a d bag
1343757643328978946 2020-12-29 11:16:02 +0800 <hboo711> @SipSeeRealitv She is the most talented Chef ever on Below Deck.
1343757398679420928 2020-12-29 11:15:04 +0800 <hboo711> @Jessica65481190 Eddie needs to mind his own business on the deck.  I'm sure Captain Lee is the best to decide what to do with Rachel.
1343756248848756737 2020-12-29 11:10:30 +0800 <hboo711> Eddie can't let go of the Rachel thing.  He can be such a douche bag.  It's up to Captain Lee so Eddie keep your damn nose out of it and worry about the exterior. We don't forget how you gaslighted Rocky so chill. #BelowDeck
1343714592409710597 2020-12-29 08:24:58 +0800 <hboo711> @june_heinz @2broke2retire @LeemarieNy I know it's already here but all those people in flying tubes is going to make it higher.  It's so high now I actually have friends that have it.  We are staying isolated because I have a bad heart.
1343714173625257986 2020-12-29 08:23:18 +0800 <hboo711> @LadyRoseTheOne @latimes @JessieJ It's definatly not a hospitalization situation but to each their own. I don't know this girl but I went down on Christmas day and I'm not hopitalized I'm just waiting on getting into an ear, nose and throught doctor to have it drained and get tubes again.
1343713320432525318 2020-12-29 08:19:55 +0800 <hboo711> @LadyRoseTheOne @latimes @JessieJ I've had it twice.  It's fluid behind the eardrum so you have to have it drained and sometimes tubes put in.  I've never had to be hospitalized but it is scary if you don't know what it is.  It messes up your balance and that's why walking or standing is difficult.  Hospitalized?
1343658419887239174 2020-12-29 04:41:45 +0800 <hboo711> @2broke2retire @LeemarieNy @june_heinz See so many flights going in and out over Christmas made me sick.  So many people just don't care.
1343658229985849347 2020-12-29 04:41:00 +0800 <hboo711> @LeemarieNy I'm so sorry Lee that you had to go through that.  How incredible hard that had to be.  Our family did not get together because we care about the nurses, doctors and health care workers as well as out fellow human beings.  This is no time for these people to be selfish

1341802100351746048 2020-12-24 01:45:24 +0800 <hboo711> @RadicalJesus3 I will always respect Jimmy Carter.  He does not take any money for being a former President. $2,000 now and more when Biden get's in.  Yes, tax the Bilionaires and provide for working class.  They don't need a 2nd and 3rd house.  Help the poor, working class and disabled.
1341801379254419456 2020-12-24 01:42:32 +0800 <hboo711> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump NO!  Just the $2,000 nothing else

1341562553219080192 2020-12-23 09:53:32 +0800 <hboo711> @donwinslow Because of this garbage you are making sure my son doesn't get his prom, his graduation and we will have longer to quaranteen.  Selfish azzholes

Single parents of HS Juniors and Seniors only get $600 while lots of money going to foreign countries?  It's a slap in the face
1341556536397750272 2020-12-23 09:29:37 +0800 <hboo711> @AndrewYang I'm a Dem but I don't agree with this stimulus. All the money going to other countries?!  I'm a single Mom making 32,000.  I get $600 and nothing for my high school senior?  This is a slap in the face. $600 doesn't even pay half my rent.  It's an insult

1341237709189373958 2020-12-22 12:22:43 +0800 <hboo711> Andy said exactly what I thought.  New face Margaret (sp)?  She said a little.  No shame in the plastic surgery game but she has had a MAJOR overhaul.  Be honest....we can tell.  #WWHL
1341222516484915200 2020-12-22 11:22:21 +0800 <hboo711> @ClassyVintage Most all Chefs are like this.  Not putting them down they are just creative and emotions are a part of their make up.  She is an amazing Chef but yea, saying FU to Cap Lee was sad and unfortunate
1341221743445368834 2020-12-22 11:19:16 +0800 <hboo711> @capthlr I hope it goes better.  I know Eddie is a great Deck Crew but why does he say "for now".  His ego makes him hard to like at times.  Again, does a great job, but he has personality issues as well.

1340933772452216833 2020-12-21 16:14:59 +0800 <hboo711> What a joke.  I make less then half of $75,000 and have a 17 year old in high school as a single Mother this is a joke.  Don't you think Juniors and Seniors in High School Cost more then 16 and under?  What stupidity.  $600 is a joke.  #600IsNotEnough
1340875775772401664 2020-12-21 12:24:31 +0800 <hboo711> @CaslerNoel @GOP It is a complete joke.  They won't even give 17 and 18 year old Juniors and Senior in High School money to me and I'm a single Mother.  Junior and Seniors in High School are still dependants and much more expensive then younger children.  Complete Joke
1340875319880904705 2020-12-21 12:22:43 +0800 <hboo711> @SarahBCalif @senatemajldr I make less then half of $75,000 and I'm a single Mother of a High School Senior and I only get $600.00 but married people get 1,200.  Nothing for my child who is dependant on me.  It's nothing.

1339771992032079872 2020-12-18 11:18:29 +0800 <hboo711> @clarperonhighst Leva is messy and thirsty.  I was excited as a fellow restaurant owner that she got cast but her behavior is petty and privledged.  Over her
1339771708656537600 2020-12-18 11:17:21 +0800 <hboo711> @blckbravobrat I hope she finds good love, real love.  She deserves it after Thomas and constantly being the scape goat by cast members.

1339770594863230976 2020-12-18 11:12:56 +0800 <hboo711> @declanblaine Leva being extremely petty calling Kathryn petty names and turning Dani and Patricia against her is disgusting.  Kathryn reached out to her and she made fun of her voice calling her a "kitten" and crap when she should be supporting growth. Petty and extra
1339766266819698688 2020-12-18 10:55:44 +0800 <hboo711> @BravoLatinas I've always thought he became more attractive when his behavior became less snooty.  He does look great this year.

I'm disgusted with this show.I understand people need 2 learn &amp; grow but 2 villify her behind her back and turn all her friends against her is disgusting.This show has an agenda and are doing a 180.

1339716756802289664 2020-12-18 07:39:00 +0800 <hboo711> @chrissyteigen Hi Chrissy.  Facebook has a video of you and John asking for comments to say "Love".  Then it asks for you to register your credit card.  Just wanted to let you know in case this is not a real giveaway.  It says John is giving away $5000 to 300 people who comment LOVE.

1339714855629156352 2020-12-18 07:31:26 +0800 <hboo711> @Andrea_Kremer @RealSportsHBO @HBO I just wanted to weigh in on people not watching sports this year.  I did not stop watching sports because of players kneeling or BLM.  I stopped watching because COVID killed watching sports because it was different and it's a friend thing.  We couldn't get together and watch.
1339679621940453379 2020-12-18 05:11:26 +0800 <hboo711> @gibsonoma He doesn't get that it's because he didn't "show up" for Gizelle is why he's getting heat from us.  So now he doubles down...no shocking.  Show up for Gizelle and show your love J*mal
1339678935706165250 2020-12-18 05:08:42 +0800 <hboo711> The only evidence I have heard is the taped recordings.  From what I heard it was #JohnnyDepp who was mocked and hurt by Amber.  I have been abused and I usually side with the person abused.  I haven't heard any evidence of fact that Amber was hit.  So for now I support Johnny.

Sadly without any COVID releif we will temporarily close right after Christmas.  I'm a single Mom and Now I will have to sell my home contents to survive.

1337512653288316929 2020-12-12 05:40:40 +0800 <hboo711> @AndrewYang Yes they do.  I voted for Mr. Biden/Ms. Harris however I hope they and their appointee understand the BALANCE of the "War on Opiods"  by looking at the street problem vs the war that has been hurting Chronic Pain Patients.  We can no longer criminalize Chronic Pain Patients.

1337275067663851522 2020-12-11 13:56:36 +0800 <hboo711> @Jim_Jordan People aren't coming in to restaurants and bars already without curfews in Marysville Ohio.  Don't blame the election or the governer it's the people who see and hear the numbers who are keeping themselves at home.
1337274728155844610 2020-12-11 13:55:15 +0800 <hboo711> @Jim_Jordan We voted against your buddy Trump Jim.  Face it.  If you can't see he's a lunatic you are not a smart man.  I thought you were at least a smart man sir.  We have almost lost as many Americans as we did in WW2 and the other day lost more Americans then on 9/11.
1337273818520424448 2020-12-11 13:51:38 +0800 <hboo711> @PearlyB57 @Jim_Jordan We are almost at a total of deaths in 2020 then we lost in WW2.  We surpased a daily death total larger then 9/11.  Jim serve your people not yourself.  There is nothing human in you.

1337224732517789697 2020-12-11 10:36:35 +0800 <hboo711> Stopped watching #SouthernCharm half way through.  Using a reality show to skew what is really going on by the way of blaming one cast member is garbage.  Do better @Bravo
1337224234066644992 2020-12-11 10:34:36 +0800 <hboo711> @KILambeth Why did you say "this is not a diagnosis"/
1337224037165125632 2020-12-11 10:33:49 +0800 <hboo711> @KILambeth I think anyone talking about minor children are wrong so there's that.  Thomas is a liar and I'm sure he can payoff Drs.
1337215732174761986 2020-12-11 10:00:49 +0800 <hboo711> @KILambeth Oh my really.  Thomas is a liar!  And you are really going to talk crap about what a little boy looks like?  How low
1337214358976421888 2020-12-11 09:55:22 +0800 <hboo711> @SarahSaysS0 So do I  WTF?  I say the kids  Are we just attacking Kathryn for shi-s and giggles?
1337214068193714177 2020-12-11 09:54:12 +0800 <hboo711> @DoxieMama70 Shoving it all on Kathryn. Please ladies let's talk about the rich lady in the big house and the men with all the money....please the white privledge is not Kathryn.  What garbage.
1337213275663183879 2020-12-11 09:51:03 +0800 <hboo711> Leva and Danni shi - -ing all over Kathryn.  The whole episode let's hate Kathryn for an ancestor from 200 years ago.  Let's talk about the rest of the rich casts privledge please!  You women make me ill.  #SouthernCharm
1337211306538135553 2020-12-11 09:43:14 +0800 <hboo711> @TheBravoMess Because they had to address it and in doing so tried to once again vilify Kathryn.  As if she is the "real" issue
1337210941562351618 2020-12-11 09:41:47 +0800 <hboo711> @mymommainthe80 Yea so Kathryn is guilty of racism because the 7th vice president hundreds of years ago????  Please  Danni trying to get off the friend of Southern Charm
1337210586392883206 2020-12-11 09:40:22 +0800 <hboo711> @elynn1978 I'm sure that friendship isn't one sided.  Kathryn has anxiety and depression and self isolates when going through this and Danni takes it as a snub so turn on her.  Ridiculous.  Danni is crap stirring
1337210233601609728 2020-12-11 09:38:58 +0800 <hboo711> @futurebravoleb Dani jealousy over Kathryn talking to Leva to start a I hate Kathryn story line is pathetic.  I like Leva, but I don't like how Dani is being so shady to Kathryn.

1337177064403857410 2020-12-11 07:27:10 +0800 <hboo711> @DonaldJTrumpJr Suck a dumb tweet.  No one is trying to shut us down but people are not coming in.  That's why we are sinking.  Don't be obtuse

1336765059570290691 2020-12-10 04:10:00 +0800 <hboo711> @senatemajldr 600$ is not enough.  Our last "stimulus" of $1,200 only helped for a few months and that was many many months ago.  We are losing homes and cannot affford food.  $600 is a joke
1336764644606824456 2020-12-10 04:08:21 +0800 <hboo711> @deadskulltweets That is fkg ridiculous for sure!!!  Why aren't these medical workers being provided these tests for free as well as all their PPE?

I admit I saw a retweet and thought you were being obtuse until I checked your origninal post and saw you were indeed making fun of those who make excuses.  I get it
1336720941452304389 2020-12-10 01:14:42 +0800 <hboo711> @TeamPelosi Burnt Christmas 2020.  Disgusting that @GOP and Democrats can't help us eat, keep a home over our head and slip into the abyss of economic disaster.

1336691541679759363 2020-12-09 23:17:52 +0800 <hboo711> We also need rent and mortgage releif as most of us are facing homlessess!
1336691016062132225 2020-12-09 23:15:47 +0800 <hboo711> @senatemajldr @SpeakerPelosi We need help now!!! My restaurant/coffee house that I invested 300k in is going to close after this week putting more people on unemployment.  My family is struggling financially.  Get this releif out ASAP or it will be a Black Christmas of starvation

1336384142167207943 2020-12-09 02:56:22 +0800 <hboo711> @GovMikeDeWine I will get the vaccine when it's available
1336382064816484356 2020-12-09 02:48:07 +0800 <hboo711> @JoeBiden We also need good pain managment and not treated like criminals just because we have to take pain medications to have a somewhat functional life.  True pain patients are responsible and not addicted. The DEA tracking Drs and pain patients is not a good way to manage
1336381251150868483 2020-12-09 02:44:53 +0800 <hboo711> @JoeBiden @DrBiden People need to understand that we would rather be working  then be disabled.  I worked 40 years in the auto industry until my back had to be fused plus several other joints replacements.  We need more jobs we can do from home or better Rx prices, or an increase to our benefits
1336375296736567298 2020-12-09 02:21:14 +0800 <hboo711> @SpeakerPelosi We need COVID releif now Nancy.  The vaccine is great news but most of us are on the verge of being homeless!  We should have had something two months ago so we cannot wait based on the vaccine to keep us in our homes and keep our children fed.  We are sinking into winter abyss
1336374557616246788 2020-12-09 02:18:17 +0800 <hboo711> The vaccine won't help us fix the damage of the past two months and the months ahead.  We are losing our homes, out grocery money.  It's bad.  Please @SpeakerPelosi we need a good Stimulus before Christmas. It is already late in the game we cannot wait any longer for the vaccine
1336324524963291146 2020-12-08 22:59:29 +0800 <hboo711> It is treason!  I agree!

1336204504279248896 2020-12-08 15:02:33 +0800 <hboo711> I have so much hope that our healthcare workers get this vaccine.  They are working so hard and are exhausted helping out sick and dying. They deserve to be first in line.
1336203725115887617 2020-12-08 14:59:28 +0800 <hboo711> @tburages Jim Jordan deserves to be on that list.  I agree with all on the list now.

1336080977056198657 2020-12-08 06:51:42 +0800 <hboo711> @Annie_Renee @BravoTV I'm similar.  I only watched Potomic and Atlanta.
1336080796734648321 2020-12-08 06:50:59 +0800 <hboo711> @misslika68 Disapointing
1336080644829548546 2020-12-08 06:50:23 +0800 <hboo711> @Caposignora Mike was right.  Do you want a wedding or a marriage.  People always get these two very confused.  More marriages would last if the focus was on the marriage and not a wedding.
1336080347998658562 2020-12-08 06:49:12 +0800 <hboo711> @TheQueenMrs @Oramc29 I think she hired an advisor.  After her and Phaedra were twerking everywhere and the lie came out she has worked hard to change her image.  Even i this is true I do respect her activism.  I like to see her growth and hope it continues.

1335542466536148992 2020-12-06 19:11:51 +0800 <hboo711> @dremilyportermd Yes, After 40 years of hard work I became disabled.  I can't get the newer RXs for my health because I don't have the money so I have to settle for old medications that aren't nearly as effetive so I can keep my med costs to $500 month and I have Medicare Plus with Aetna.

1334844160973660161 2020-12-04 20:57:02 +0800 <hboo711> @AndrewYang The middle.  It's where the work is.  It's also the place where there should be an specific action plan.  During the SAP you can run into unexpected issues and have to countermeasure etc.

It has dropped beause of a pandemic that Trump and other leaders ignored.  We still have no additional COVID releif package for families and true small businesses.  Nothing to do with Biden.

Today I had to temporarily (I hope temporarily) my coffee shop/restaurant.  I have fought hard for 9 months to keep my people employeed.  After 6 years it's 💔
1333497438666190850 2020-12-01 03:45:39 +0800 <hboo711> @bridget_joy_ Yes.  All I know is after fighting to keep my small business open for 9 months of this I'm temporarily shutting my doors today after 6 years.  Our government made a mess of this pandemic by not being organized or demanding a mask mandate w/ consequences.

1333395214992543745 2020-11-30 20:59:27 +0800 <hboo711> @whca It was for "small business" of 499 employees.  I never thought that amount of employees was true small business. Most small business is 25 or less employees.  I know Nestle got one because they are divided into divisions and some have 499 or less employees.  Many Corps got $$

Day doing all the protocols and all these others shopping like nothing is different.  DeWine you made a mess of this.  Stupid Stupid.
1332432337402032129 2020-11-28 05:13:19 +0800 <hboo711> Today I found out that my brother went to eat at a huge shopping mall (Easton) in Columbus Ohio.  Later in the day I found out one of my restaurant employees was shopping at another "packed mall" Polaris.  What is wrong with people?  Columbus is purple Level 4.  DeWine did 0

1330951876465004545 2020-11-24 03:10:29 +0800 <hboo711> @EvanAKilgore I believe it happened in 2016 but not in 2020.  I think Trump thought it would work again and that's why he's not accepting this loss.  He needs to go.

1330670546976182279 2020-11-23 08:32:35 +0800 <hboo711> @mightbe_crazy Kinda strange for me because I had my son at 40 but my situation is unusual.  I think as long as they are 25 and older go right ahead.  Not wrong at all

At the same time I think Candiace verbal and social media talk is toxic and nasty.  I hope she get's the help she needs.  There is true anger in her heart and she needs to heal.

I think she is so beautiful. What comes out of her mouth on the show and on social media is awful.  I don't watch NJ because I can't stand Teresa, I don't watch OC because I don't like them.  Nothing 2 do with color

There is no democracy right now, he needs to be stopped.  We are dealing with COVID and a dictator right now.  @TheDemocrats do something!!!!!

We sanitize everything after every guest.  Our School however is sending us 3 or 4 letters about staff or students getting COVID.  You are looking in the wrong direction

I'm so sicked that the majority of Republicans are pretending that Trump didn't lose. Just riduculous and danagerous.

Anyway, maybe she spent so much time in school and taking care of her kids and needs to gain some social skills.  Mad respect for her studies but there is something off.
1325630322130743296 2020-11-09 10:44:32 +0800 <hboo711> @nicole_perez1 I do respect her hard work and dedication to her studies.  She needs to realize it's now she needs to understand relationships with women.  There must be some insecurity in her to keep mentioning her degrees and giving everyone the constant resume.  Now learn more about people

Thank you to all the women mentiond and so many others.

It's time to help the disappearing middle class and the poor.  Thank you to the Black Women and others who made this happen! #bidenharis2020

I'm also excited to see a Woman, a Woman of Color become the next Vice President of the United States!  I look forward to the day when I can see a Woman, a Woman of Color elected as President.  Our daughters are watching. ❤️🇺🇸
1325155112768040961 2020-11-08 03:16:13 +0800 <hboo711> I thought I would never get to see in my lifetime a Woman, A Woman of Color get elected as Vice President. Now I hope to see a Woman, a Woman of Color be our President someday.  I ended a few friendships w/Women who were against my hopes and I don't care. So happy.#bidenharis2020

1324058719198601219 2020-11-05 02:39:33 +0800 <hboo711> @BiancaIafrate @gibsonoma Only when Thomas date called her an egg donor.  Cam has cut her low every season.  Seems weird that Cam quit if there was no truth in it.
1324058251898560517 2020-11-05 02:37:41 +0800 <hboo711> @gibsonoma How do we know Kathryn is making it up?  If she's making it up on her own why isn't Cam on the show?
1324058053306712068 2020-11-05 02:36:54 +0800 <hboo711> @gibsonoma Why leave the show if it's not true?  I love Cam so why quit?
1324056872182292483 2020-11-05 02:32:12 +0800 <hboo711> @Jaredlatchford polls are trash and I will never put an ounce of faith in them again.

1324055605380812802 2020-11-05 02:27:10 +0800 <hboo711> South Carolina will not get any tourist money from my family until Graham is not longer seated.  Enjoy your nut.  I will make sure everyone I know makes South Carolina the last destination vacation.  #Graham

1324040122195759104 2020-11-05 01:25:39 +0800 <hboo711> @YNB These ballots must be delivered ASAP. We must count the mail in ballots of people who were cautious of COVID as well as those could be military ballots.  #CountEveryVote

1324034011019227137 2020-11-05 01:01:22 +0800 <hboo711> @realDonaldTrump You knew they would because Democrats take COVID seriously and mailed in their votes.  It's good for the country because we kept the spread of COVID down but every vote counts #CountAllTheVotes

1323953858536787968 2020-11-04 19:42:52 +0800 <hboo711> @ml10e Almost half of us didn't vote for Trump.  I'm still holding out hope because we do count mail in ballots dated Nov 2nd and before for the next 10 days.  Ohio is hard for me to love too.  It's so divided and hard to live in.
1323952958825005058 2020-11-04 19:39:17 +0800 <hboo711> @RadiantJLR Ohio still counts mail in ballots for 10 more days if posted Nov. 2nd.
1323952690838339584 2020-11-04 19:38:14 +0800 <hboo711> @seanmdav Ohio still accepts vote by mail for 10 more days as long as it was dated by Nov. 2nd.  How can anyone call Ohio yet?
1323951923536535553 2020-11-04 19:35:11 +0800 <hboo711> @YNB I hate living in Ohio.  I didn't listen to the polls and my Parents and Son voted for Biden.  Of course our racist counties went Red.  It's so frustrating how our votes never count for the Ohio total.  I'm so out of here when I retire in 4 years.  Heartbroken.  Racist azzez
1323832645462167554 2020-11-04 11:41:12 +0800 <hboo711> @MaryLTrump I'm sickened.  I may end up stuck with this Abuser and Cheif of nastiness
1323832286371086336 2020-11-04 11:39:47 +0800 <hboo711> @mmpadellan I had more hope in Ohio but once again I live in a county that my vote will never count.  I'm tired and angry if this Orange jerk get's to keep his foot on my neck for  4 more years.  What country are we living in?

1323505937727000576 2020-11-03 14:02:59 +0800 <hboo711> @Rschooley Wow.  Hear this #ClevelandOhio Trump crapping on Lebron for paying fines for people so they can vote.  Trump is upset he can't cheat this time.
1323505352327991297 2020-11-03 14:00:40 +0800 <hboo711> @ReignOfApril I don't think Trump is wise to crap on Lebron James.  He is our man in Ohio and Cleveland.  Trump can lose if he loses Cleveland....  Trump is scared because Mr. James and Mr. Bloomberg helped people reinstate their human rights to vote.  Thank you our Ohio son Lebron James.

1323455748387557387 2020-11-03 10:43:33 +0800 <hboo711> @hohweek It effects not only her but her family too.  It has to stop.  It's not ok.  It's not decent.  The game is over, people need to stop harrassing her, Vic, and her family.
1323452065516052481 2020-11-03 10:28:55 +0800 <hboo711> @nicole_franzel Nicole.  You are loved, loving and deserve love.  Never accept anything less.  I pray for you and your family for peace and happiness.

I was doing this (basically microblading) years before it became popular.  I'll admit I do it less now I have a mask ❤️

1323375457438486529 2020-11-03 05:24:30 +0800 <hboo711> @Shelley_OBR @YouTube Obvious it's jealousy.  I think Nicole is right in staying off of social media as long as she wants.  She has a wedding in December and that is a great thing to focus on.  She doesn't need to please the haters whatsoever.  I respect her privacy for as long as she needs it.

1323328788990775298 2020-11-03 02:19:04 +0800 <hboo711> @Shelley_OBR @YouTube I would support Nicole if she did sue her for defamation.  I'm just suprised a 40 year old woman who "seemed" to have her own successful life would have more class.  Clearly I was wrong.

1322904615482961926 2020-11-01 22:13:33 +0800 <hboo711> @ShannonFreshour I wonder if anyone who attends his rallys and get left out in the cold still can't see he doesn't care about them.  Unbelievable.
1322702802473390086 2020-11-01 08:51:37 +0800 <hboo711> @CheckinMyPage @Shelley_OBR Completely agree! I wish people understood that better about cyberbullying.  That is what I'm so concerned about for her.  She and Vic were treated and cyberbullied so badly.  I hope she can find peace and be happy for her wedding and everything in the future.
1322700742478712832 2020-11-01 08:43:26 +0800 <hboo711> @CheckinMyPage @Shelley_OBR Agreed.  I am wrong on the jab about Botox. I agree it started with nastiness from the fans and then I got pretty upset that  Janelle who was someone I loved too stoked the flames.  It has really upset me.  I just can't imagine what it's like for Nicole right now.
1322698128269676545 2020-11-01 08:33:02 +0800 <hboo711> @Shelley_OBR @CheckinMyPage Pretty sad that people are Queening some 40 year old botox bunny.  I don't like being negative but Janelle started all this toxic Nicole F garbage.  Nicole F is younger, more fun, and I know a very sweet girl.  Positive Vibes Nicole
1322697620641488897 2020-11-01 08:31:01 +0800 <hboo711> @CheckinMyPage I can't begin to understand what it feels like for Nicole to be treated so badly.  But I'm so happy I found others to support our support for her.  I've enjoyed her 3 seasons and I don't blame her or her family for keeping her Social Media only supportive for now.  Love Nicole F

1322668411479068677 2020-11-01 06:34:57 +0800 <hboo711> @ashmcki7 Absolutely.  I loved watching Nicole again.  She just needs to stay away from Social Media and block the hell out of anyone negative just like Dani and Dom do.  No one has time for that.  There is nothing wrong with Nicole.  She's a doll.  I'm sad, this must be awful for her. NO8

They can say it's not all they want, we ALL know when it is not Melania.  Trump really thinks we're stupid. Hopefully we get to show him we're not at all.

You are right.  No problem Trump writes of 70k for hair but how dare A WOMAN look great on a photo cover.  People need to stop with the racism and sexism.
1322010800790396928 2020-10-30 11:01:51 +0800 <hboo711> @AOC It is criminal and cruel.  A SCOTUS to replace the amazing RBG is a punch in the face.  RBG stood for equal rights of all.  This was more important then a second stimulus as we are out here not knowing how to pay rent and also put food on the table.

1322004294116192257 2020-10-30 10:36:00 +0800 <hboo711> @RepsForBiden Not only do I need Trump out.  I want him to pay legally for what he has done to our country.  I can't understand why most American's cannot see the horror that he had done.
1322003965823930368 2020-10-30 10:34:41 +0800 <hboo711> @RepsForBiden I absolutly hate to admit this.  I don't believe the polls and it scares me that people won't go vote for Biden thinking he has it like in 2016.  I need Biden in the White House, I can't take anymore of the current admin. lies, deceptions and it's treachery.  1/4 of a mil. dead.  https://t.co/oLWGfi1sWe
1321895614070882304 2020-10-30 03:24:08 +0800 <hboo711> @b_tay @Boy1der22 @DrJasonJohnson What you described is basically Big Mack sauce.  Very good on Sandwishes.
1321894604594171905 2020-10-30 03:20:08 +0800 <hboo711> @DrJasonJohnson Miracle Whip is a dressing.  Like Mayo but zestier.  I use Miracle whip on more bland items like A BLT but if I make a dish I put spices or other flavors in like Potato Salad I use Mayonaise.  Lot's of good diffrences listed but a taste test helps.
1321893787711479812 2020-10-30 03:16:53 +0800 <hboo711> @Mediaite Chuck Todd is not very bright.  COVID is a pandemic and nearly a quarter of a million Americans are dead.  How can you not Take it seriously like Joe Biden. Half a Million Americans DEAD!  Outrageous
1321893175175294977 2020-10-30 03:14:27 +0800 <hboo711> @CeeHawk Designers loan the clothes. Go to a shoot.The clothes are many times pinned or clamped for perfect shape fit.  This is for designers to get marketing.She didn't keep the clothes.  If she buys good designer clothes that's her business.  Why r we talking about clothes? How obtuse
1321892020399546369 2020-10-30 03:09:51 +0800 <hboo711> @RepsForBiden Of course Trump mocks the man (Joe Biden) doing the right thing instead of holding super spreaders that the Trump rallies have caused.  That's not just rhetoric it's fact.  Trump rallies have cause each area he's been to causing a rise in COVID #TrumpTreason #TrumpCovidHoax
1321891325227225088 2020-10-30 03:07:06 +0800 <hboo711> I don't trust the polls.  I will never trust them after 2016.  Please don't trust them.  Please vote if you want peace for Joe Biden.  Don't rely on the polls showing him ahead.  It was a trick used in 2016 that caused many not to think they needed to vote #JOEBIDEN2020
1321700423519162369 2020-10-29 14:28:31 +0800 <hboo711> People we have 2 get Trump out of office. Not only did Bob Woodward have Audio of Trump saying he knew in Jan. this virus was deadly but didn't tell now here we have Audio w Jared bragging they took the country back from Drs. in April. Now nearly 1/4 of a million dead Americans
1321699197989564416 2020-10-29 14:23:39 +0800 <hboo711> @jamiegangel @realBobWoodward @realDonaldTrump @elizabethstuart @MichaelRWarren So Bob got the Audio where Trump says he knew how deadly this virus was in January and lied to us becausse he thought we would panic.  Now Jared give Audio bragging they took the country away from Doctors.  If this isn't treason on a quarter of a million people dead what is?
1321698653501870081 2020-10-29 14:21:29 +0800 <hboo711> @JoyAnnReid @USPS Is this the best you got Tuckie?  Vanished lmao  https://t.co/0lyvUZsTvW

1321648888458215425 2020-10-29 11:03:44 +0800 <hboo711> @melbrown00 They ran!  https://t.co/P7WdQvZZ20
1321648645830250496 2020-10-29 11:02:46 +0800 <hboo711> @melbrown00 This made me the happiest tonight.  Love Da'Vonne.
1321648218535530496 2020-10-29 11:01:04 +0800 <hboo711> We love you AFH @DayDaVonne_  Best ending ever! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ #BB22
1321642353455734784 2020-10-29 10:37:46 +0800 <hboo711> Love your sense of humor Enzo but if you win it's the biggest joke.  But you do make us laugh because you are funny. Cody is the winner if not, sad about a bitter jury.  I don't think they are. Also the prejury keep your mouths off Nicole.  It's over move on.  #BB22
1321639649702514688 2020-10-29 10:27:02 +0800 <hboo711> @chersfilms Nearly a quarter of a million of our citizens dead.  Gurl not even close to being funny.  I pray no one get's it not even you
1321639297263587328 2020-10-29 10:25:37 +0800 <hboo711> Heartbroken that Nicole F was evicted by Cody.  Enzo you lied, you could not win any comps in the end and you just got a charity 2nd place. Love you @nicole_franzel  and I'm glad you get a chance to go home and decompress from this tough game.  Sending love ❤️🙏 #BB22
1321633582377566213 2020-10-29 10:02:55 +0800 <hboo711> It will be a blessing not to hear Yo again.  #BB22
1321633316592848896 2020-10-29 10:01:52 +0800 <hboo711> If anyone in the Jury votes for Enzo I never want to see them on BB again.  Congratulations Enzo for getting dragged without merit to the F2.  Cody wants all the votes.  He needs it after being beaten badly by Derrik.  #BB22
1321632607579344897 2020-10-29 09:59:03 +0800 <hboo711> Always will be.
1321631609192407040 2020-10-29 09:55:05 +0800 <hboo711> @lyraverse @leeleedutchaski @melbrown00 I agree.  She voted for Nicole to win in BB18.  She may not vote for her but I understand it.
1321631367201988608 2020-10-29 09:54:07 +0800 <hboo711> @VeeVaehh @melbrown00 💯
1321631231168184321 2020-10-29 09:53:34 +0800 <hboo711> @melbrown00 Would rather see her then Dr. Will.
1321621912905273350 2020-10-29 09:16:33 +0800 <hboo711> Enzo's reaction.  Wowza.  He had Nicole crying and Cody upset.  I think they understand his frustration.   #BB22
1321614416945782784 2020-10-29 08:46:46 +0800 <hboo711> I love this game and I will miss it.  Thankful I had it to get through the COVID situation.  People just don't realize how hard it was to get a season at all.  Looking forward to tonight and I'm going to miss it.  Can't wait until next year. #BB22 #BB23
1321597128259547136 2020-10-29 07:38:04 +0800 <hboo711> @TamarBraxtonHer Tamar you are a truly amazing person too.  Thank you for sharing your life with us and helping us in the mental health communitiy.  Bless you.

1321581692683997185 2020-10-29 06:36:43 +0800 <hboo711> @CBSBigBrother Thanks for giving us a season under the COVID conditions it was amazing you worked so hard to give us one.  Thank goodness all the twitter haters didn't ruin my love of this game.
1321580404084740096 2020-10-29 06:31:36 +0800 <hboo711> @jkeefe This is just stupid.  I promise you mine would not tell you who I voted for.  ny times must be bored
1321434820526919681 2020-10-28 20:53:06 +0800 <hboo711> I will be so glad when this election is over.  I have never been deeply into politics as far as social media.  I'm sorry to anyone following me for my serious anger at the current President.  I don't disrespect anyone for liking him.  I just can't.
1321433917371654146 2020-10-28 20:49:31 +0800 <hboo711> @JennaEllisEsq Fortunate Son?  OMG he is really that stupid or is his team punking him?  It's really such an afront to my father, uncle and all the other people who served in the Vietnam War.  I'm just shaking my damn head?
1321432954292391937 2020-10-28 20:45:41 +0800 <hboo711> @rjboccomino @djmeph Clearly not. While that nasty man was getting his little loan of 1M from Daddy and got around going to Nam it was my Daddy who actually fought in Vietnam.  How dare he play that song.  He truly is a complete idiot that's why I voted against him.  Please Lord we've had enough
1321430879013642240 2020-10-28 20:37:27 +0800 <hboo711> @dyllyp 😂😂😂😂😂 It is so funny.  He can't ruin those songs for me ever.  He's the leaning forward dancing idiot. Hey Trump organizers........Listen to the songs you play at his rally's.  Fortunate Son is everything that Trump IS NOT.  My daddy went to Vietnam, not this azz.
1321429906551656453 2020-10-28 20:33:35 +0800 <hboo711> @Sir_Preciliano Trump only knows the name of the song. He sure was a fortunate son but nothing close to the sone.  I'm sure his little bitty foot spurs were just horrible right along with that little bitty loan Daddy gave him for 1M.  I lost my father to the Vietnam war.  DJT is the enemy within
1321342937171693568 2020-10-28 14:48:00 +0800 <hboo711> @AlfonsoOlave @BB_Updates So nasty and rude
1321264671148642304 2020-10-28 09:37:00 +0800 <hboo711> @BravoTV I'm watching for Garcelle only.  I have alot of respect for Kathy but let's add someone to shut up Rinna.  Rinna makes it so hard for me to watch this show.  She will sell her soul and lose friends for $$$$$$$$$  We see it.
1321263531791175685 2020-10-28 09:32:28 +0800 <hboo711> Voting for AFP is over.  Good Lordt stop with the posts. #BB22  https://t.co/gNtopMSSwU
1321263048569618432 2020-10-28 09:30:33 +0800 <hboo711> @BigBrother_2020 It's the question at the core of this game.  Do you want to be dislike or have $500,000? Do you want to be loved and lose. I love Day and Janelle for sure.  I do have respect for Nicole's game.  It worked for Enzo.
1321254784645632006 2020-10-28 08:57:43 +0800 <hboo711> I respect Nicole Fs loyalty to Cody.  But I hope if she wins the final she takes Enzo.  I hope the deep solid gamer i her knows she has to cut Cody.  But I do respect the loyalty if she doesn't.  #BB22
1320976339357339648 2020-10-27 14:31:16 +0800 <hboo711> @TheBigBroTea He made alot more money then Day for getting to F3.  He didn't take the shot he shold have taken.  I like Enzo but he didn't take the shot at Nicole.  He let a former winner stay.  I'm glad he did but it was bad for his game.
1320975797361037312 2020-10-27 14:29:07 +0800 <hboo711> @TheBigBroTea I think he will win over Enzo and Nicole if he get's F2 unless there is a bitter jury.  If Nicole is brave enough to cut Cody she will beat Enzo.  It's all up to the final comp.
1320975148686737408 2020-10-27 14:26:32 +0800 <hboo711> @Pinkypalm2 Nope
1320973984184324097 2020-10-27 14:21:54 +0800 <hboo711> @askiwillstay I wouldn't rely on this.  I never answer these questions I just vote and I've given DaVonne all of mine.  No disrespect to Tyler.
1320973405055799299 2020-10-27 14:19:36 +0800 <hboo711> @ianterryonlyman A board certified plastic surgeon.  Meaning a great and well researched for their specialties.  I won't put down anyone who has plastic surgery.  I'm not a huge fan but if you have the money and you want to so what.  If you're in NYNY see Dr. Matthew White. BEST
1320972091638845440 2020-10-27 14:14:23 +0800 <hboo711> @Dillybop08 @missRabbit804 @JOSHMBB19 I agree with you.  She had a huge target on her back as a former winner and there were several competitions she could have won and strategically didn't until she had to.
1320971620530429952 2020-10-27 14:12:31 +0800 <hboo711> @JOSHMBB19 I agree she knows this game and plays it well.  Not the same game many others want but she has been effective and deserves respect on her name.  Thank you Joss.

1320921604210233345 2020-10-27 10:53:46 +0800 <hboo711> @NicolekRose @danidONAT0 I love them and I think Dom and Dani have it 100% right.  Be a jerk to them and you're blocked.  Period.   I would do the same on my page.  These are real people not celebrities who played a game.  There is no disrespect or hate needed to ever be placed on them. This was superb.

1320920100929703936 2020-10-27 10:47:48 +0800 <hboo711> I will.  Every last one!  Sickening.

1320919813242454021 2020-10-27 10:46:39 +0800 <hboo711> @cryborg I do suppose he is.  He didn't literally take a gun and shoot a man but went much further.  Nearly half a million Americans are dead.  Half a Million in 8 months GONE!  Genocide of POC, and the poor.
1320918957478608900 2020-10-27 10:43:15 +0800 <hboo711> @YNB @jaredkushner Privledge never screamed so loud. Kushner Let me give you FACTS.  Men of Color, Women of Color and many white women have to work 4 times harder to get to the same place where many white men get to.  Now let's talk about the white men with family money.  YOU ARE CLUELESS
1320916706559184896 2020-10-27 10:34:18 +0800 <hboo711> @raesanni @YNB I feel like we just got slapped back to 1950.  I'm crying, can't stop.

1320915591079907330 2020-10-27 10:29:52 +0800 <hboo711> @CocoDaBear I don't doubt Da Bear.  Thank you!
1320915413593690112 2020-10-27 10:29:10 +0800 <hboo711> It's incredible and it is voter suppession to have such long lines for early voting.  But I will wait all the hours it takes tomorrow.  I'm packed and ready to vote. Hey line buddies I'm bringing plenty of snackies!  We won't be stopped #JoeBidenKamalaHarris2020
1320914501328392195 2020-10-27 10:25:33 +0800 <hboo711> @GOP Thank you as a woman for just slapping me in the face with this SCOTUS.  I promise the slap is going to be returned soon or in 2 years.
1320914163133272065 2020-10-27 10:24:12 +0800 <hboo711> @FrankAmari2 @AliAdair22 @lisamurkowski That's exactly what I thought.  Thank you
1320913934082285568 2020-10-27 10:23:17 +0800 <hboo711> Also Pay attention to your State and Local.  Judges aren't always shown with a party affiliation.  Make sure you investigate it because they are a R or D.
1320913546637643779 2020-10-27 10:21:45 +0800 <hboo711> @AfroBoPeep @YNB Yes. The Presidency is not the only one thing we are voting for. We need to make sure Joe Biden has a House and a Senate that is Democrat too so we can get rid of those that allowed Trump to do all this damage to our democracy. Be aware of your local and state too.  #VoteBlue

That conversation with @DayDaVonne_ and you had me in flowing tears. POWERFUL!  Freedom of Religion people please get it.  https://t.co/J1qmWQQRNm

1320909152550531074 2020-10-27 10:04:17 +0800 <hboo711> @Strongislandni2 @CBSBigBrother Loved seeing you tonight and your game speaking points on the F3 was so spot on.  Best take on the game came from you.  Nothing personal just game truth.  I'll always love you.  Love THE PODMASTER!!!!!
1320907305563684871 2020-10-27 09:56:57 +0800 <hboo711> @NicoleQuas Thank you for that!
1320907116933083138 2020-10-27 09:56:12 +0800 <hboo711> @NicoleQuas She has gotten &amp; will get all my votes not out of pity. I vote 4 her because she is very entertaining, thoughtful &amp; isn't afraid to stand for what needs to be stood up against.  Racism/Sexism. It's hard enough being a woman &amp; POC in a mans world. She is my favorite foreva &amp; a Day  https://t.co/jC9uFVQE59
1320905511798231040 2020-10-27 09:49:49 +0800 <hboo711> @IsaacYbarbo No we in that
1320904991989780481 2020-10-27 09:47:45 +0800 <hboo711> @kap_3rd This time it was for the sit down.  But that's just what I heard on the feeds and can never be 100% sure.  I heard Nicole tell Cody that in seasons before this he would have gotten out for taking his feet off.  Let's go DaVonne for AFP!!!!!
1320903394714914817 2020-10-27 09:41:25 +0800 <hboo711> @theotherJade They are.  I heard them on the feeds say that they had different disc sizes for their feet size
1320903236006649858 2020-10-27 09:40:47 +0800 <hboo711> @tinatoo92 Ditto
1320902727417946112 2020-10-27 09:38:46 +0800 <hboo711> @kap_3rd I do.  Yea it used to be your feet couldn't leave.  I can't remember if they had the slimy stuff that year Haleigh got robbed.  Maybe it was that reason they didn't get eliminated this time for taking their feet off?
1320902238169190400 2020-10-27 09:36:49 +0800 <hboo711> @TheStreetsOfBB @mariiiahkay I will say I'm looking forward to next year already with mostly or all a new cast. 😀
1320901937701769216 2020-10-27 09:35:37 +0800 <hboo711> @chelsea_vic3789 It's funny that some people think only men are sexist but we know there are women too.  Someday it would be nice if all women of all races stood together like most men do today.
1320901678804180993 2020-10-27 09:34:36 +0800 <hboo711> @JOSHMBB19 Cody for sure against either Nicole or  Enzo.  Nicole and Enzo = Nicole Wins.  Bitter Jury Enzo wins.   People may not like Nicole's game play but it's effective and in 3 seasons she's never gone prejury (Season 16 she battleed back in) to make jury.
1320900688449294342 2020-10-27 09:30:39 +0800 <hboo711> Yes indeed!
1320900412078215169 2020-10-27 09:29:34 +0800 <hboo711> @chelsea_vic3789 Of course I think  it's sexist when they crap all over Nicole Fs game play but applaud Enzo's when it's basically the same game.
1320900162018050048 2020-10-27 09:28:34 +0800 <hboo711> @chelsea_vic3789 And has won more comps now then Enzo
1320900031252226050 2020-10-27 09:28:03 +0800 <hboo711> @TheStreetsOfBB @mariiiahkay They thought that but they are talking in the Jury house.  Enzo had the best social game I agree on this point.  He was friendly with everyone.  Nicole has won more comps and is a past winner who got to F3.  My point was the sexism in the comparrisons.
1320893670531452928 2020-10-27 09:02:46 +0800 <hboo711> @GovMikeDeWine Enjoy your last few years as our Governor sir.
1320892220011151360 2020-10-27 08:57:00 +0800 <hboo711> @MyDailyMagazin1 Leave the man alone.  You are sickening
1320891853261152258 2020-10-27 08:55:33 +0800 <hboo711> @mariiiahkay Exactly I totally agree with you.  Only Nicole A and Keesha put some respect to Nicole Fs game.  Nicole F has played a better game then Enzo as a former winner.
1320891338020278274 2020-10-27 08:53:30 +0800 <hboo711> The sexism when talking about Nicole F vs Enzo makes me sick. Enzo did the exact same thing Nicole F (A former winner) did. Not in the committee but in final with Memphis and Cody...please.  Thank you Keesha and Nicole A for putting some respect on Nicole Fs game.    #BB22
1320882227530661888 2020-10-27 08:17:18 +0800 <hboo711> Only the enemy shows you where you are weak. Only the enemy tells you where he is strong'. Resolving our social ills, improving our union is not just 'good'. It is a defense requirement as vital as any tank, as critical as any gun. From the book Enders Game #JOEBIDEN2020 #BB22
1320881720699269122 2020-10-27 08:15:17 +0800 <hboo711> Don't miss this interview.  Fan or not Mr. Chappelle is more brilliant then you'll ever know.  Funny of course but very wise.  Ohio loves Dave Chappelle.
1320881244285083648 2020-10-27 08:13:24 +0800 <hboo711> @SittingDutchman @lcmsilek @AVindman @DaveChappelle @Letterman That's the only book he wrote that I ever read like 18 years ago (and again every 4 years lol) and I did indulge myself in watching the movie.  I've never read anything else by him. I honestly don't know anything about him.   But that book has always stayd with me.
1320879741075890181 2020-10-27 08:07:25 +0800 <hboo711> @real_ayaan I promise you that Mr. Dave C is not a supporter of Mr. Trump.
1320879555645755392 2020-10-27 08:06:41 +0800 <hboo711> @real_ayaan He was joking but you nailed it on the head with what some black people are endorsing Trump for.
1320879009467715584 2020-10-27 08:04:31 +0800 <hboo711> @BirdsOfJannah I wish many people would see Religions as we are all trying to get to the same higher power. People take different vehicles to the higher power.  I'm glad that Dave Chappelle shared that I just want to add to that tweet. That is why we need to respect freedom of religion.
1320877884244938752 2020-10-27 08:00:02 +0800 <hboo711> @Mlondon83 @patrick_oshag But we will very nice to you about it.  We just won't tell you anything about him.
1320877721266905088 2020-10-27 07:59:24 +0800 <hboo711> @Mlondon83 @patrick_oshag lol No worries about putting yellow springs on the map.  It may be new to you however most people know he's almost always been here. If peple ask where he is or try to find him they will find the town protects him to the max.  Great place to vist. Don't visit with that agenda
1320873955083853825 2020-10-27 07:44:26 +0800 <hboo711> @lcmsilek @AVindman @DaveChappelle @Letterman So true and I remember that quote well.  People look at me strangly when I tell them my pets name is Ender.  Love Dave Chapelle.  An amazing human being.
1320822931413438467 2020-10-27 04:21:41 +0800 <hboo711> And the GOP is rushing a SCOTUS nomination before giving any of their people COVID relief.  The Dow plunged today...The American people know YOU are not serving us.  You should makeit the priority to get a COVID relief package for the people you serve instead of SCOTUS push
1320822013162889217 2020-10-27 04:18:02 +0800 <hboo711> @shearm @npfandos And they wonder why the DOW is tanking.  Rushing through a new SCOTUS and nothing done for COVID releif for the American people who are dying and struggling to survive.
1320821460517212169 2020-10-27 04:15:50 +0800 <hboo711> @atrupar We did not elect you Jared.  Why is this fool talking.  Let the president say this.  He didn't at the debate.  Trump has been a racist since back in the day when he refused to rent apartments to black americans....so much more racism from Trump but we all know it already
1320820702396768258 2020-10-27 04:12:49 +0800 <hboo711> @GaleTay91676546 @RepsForBiden This is it.
1320820595223891968 2020-10-27 04:12:24 +0800 <hboo711> @RepsForBiden Putting the voting of a SCOTUS before a COVID releif package is the problem here.
1320819864068653056 2020-10-27 04:09:29 +0800 <hboo711> @Xg2342 Personally I like Tyler.  He is from my home state.  I am voting for DaVonne because she is my all time favorite BB player.  She has given us the best of BB in three seasons.
1320816442674155520 2020-10-27 03:55:54 +0800 <hboo711> All my votes every day go to DaVonne.  The joy that she's given me in watching her in three seasons.  Her big heart and her advocating for change is why she has all my votes.  I want her to know I love her for all she is.  #BB22  https://t.co/fV6ddFJ9Jt
1320815928330883074 2020-10-27 03:53:51 +0800 <hboo711> @melbrown00 She is amazing and will get every single vote of mine every single day.  She's my favorite and she is an amazing woman.  She needs to know how much we love her.  I sure hope she get's this.  It will mean alot to her and to us because I want to show her she is loved...period
1320559407588118531 2020-10-26 10:54:32 +0800 <hboo711> @sam_thinking @mkraju It needs to
1320558835623436288 2020-10-26 10:52:15 +0800 <hboo711> @senatemajldr You have no Honor or Integrity.  We will work hard to get rid of you and eveyone who votes to put her through.  I'm sure your arrogance makes you think you can't lose.  You can I assure you.
1320558430009122816 2020-10-26 10:50:39 +0800 <hboo711> @senatemajldr Eush a SCOTUS through instead of releif and protections for our people suffering from COVID.  You are all supposed to represent the people and the people don't want you to choose a SCOTUS.  You lied and people are dying.  More will die when she is on the bench taking our rights.
1320557153044877312 2020-10-26 10:45:34 +0800 <hboo711> @tonyschwartz She is the worst pick.  She has already made comments about Justice Roberts.  Judges shouldn't be partisan.  Barrett will send interfere in the election, women's reproductive issues and take away healthcare.  She is Trumps tear up the US womens, minorities and LGBTQ+ rights
1320432018891689986 2020-10-26 02:28:20 +0800 <hboo711> Just another day in crazy Trump Land.  If you think this woman is Melania call your eye Dr.  What in the damn world?
1320431611041767426 2020-10-26 02:26:43 +0800 <hboo711> @DrBeauBeaumont Just another day in crazy Trump land.  It's obvious it's not Melania.  So how much did he have to pay this woman?  How much of her plastic surgery to make her look closer to Melania.  Just another dumpster fire.  FAKE garbage
1320357681744531458 2020-10-25 21:32:57 +0800 <hboo711> This is crazy
1320357451556884481 2020-10-25 21:32:02 +0800 <hboo711> Please keep distance from Pence as he spreads COVID around to everyone.  He is irresponsible for not cancelling his trips.  Another super spreader
1320045940712050689 2020-10-25 00:54:12 +0800 <hboo711> @GOP Why aren't you trying to help small businesses under 25 employees? U are killing our downtowns without help. Small businesses are one of the highest employers across the USA.  We need your help and we need it ASAP.  Just  weeks away from closing and unemploying my employees.
1320034955607609350 2020-10-25 00:10:33 +0800 <hboo711> @DearAuntCrabby @JoeBiden I have two friends who are married to Trumpers.  I talk to them about his record, show them his tweets and tell them about how he hates women.  Both told me that I don't want to hear anything negative.  So they bury their heads in the sand and just do their husbands opinion. Sick
1320034366035316737 2020-10-25 00:08:12 +0800 <hboo711> @GovMikeDeWine Testing only here and there in big cities while our rural people have limited to no access to testing.  While privledged rich people have stock piles of tests to use every day or whenever they want to have a get together.  How dare us not have testing everywhere.
1320033349302390784 2020-10-25 00:04:10 +0800 <hboo711> @TMZ I would never.We're out her not being able to be tested but his family got so much money they have their own stock of tests to make sure no one comes near them without a test first.  This was a sick thing to do while normal American's are struggling for their lives and livlihoods

Stop the nasty hate on players family's.  He went from being a personal trainer to working a job that requires short hair.  He's a very fit Vic
1319790329776738304 2020-10-24 07:58:29 +0800 <hboo711> @TheBigBroTea Victor is probably miserable watching someon he loves being called every nasty name in the book for three months and dragging Victor in and calling him nasty things even saying he isn't a strong latino man.  These really are just people.  How could it not cause hurt and sadness
1319771729707884550 2020-10-24 06:44:35 +0800 <hboo711> @nicole_franzel Nicole you are rocking BB again!  Always a fan and will keep rooting for you to be a 2 time winner.  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!  Get the W! #TeamCoconuts

My friends finally after 25 years were able to marry 5 years ago.  I cannot see this happen to them, you or anyone else in the LGBTQ+ Community.  You are not a criminal or even wrong for who you are.  Love is Love

1319443955310907394 2020-10-23 09:02:07 +0800 <hboo711> Just used all my votes today for @DayDaVonne_  #BB22 #BB22allstars

1319434269031354368 2020-10-23 08:23:38 +0800 <hboo711> @Ehllieyana_M Christmas and Enzo will not take Cody to F2.  LOL  They will lose against him.
1319433990235967493 2020-10-23 08:22:31 +0800 <hboo711> @JacobTh15708446 He has to know he will beat all of them in there right now.  No a big fan but he has played the better game in comp wins and never being nominated.
1319433086917107712 2020-10-23 08:18:56 +0800 <hboo711> @JCMoonves She only stands a chance vs Enzo.  I adore Nicole but I don't think she will win against anyone because the jury just wouldn't let someone win twice.
1319432816543883264 2020-10-23 08:17:51 +0800 <hboo711> I love Nicole.  Congratulations Nicole.  She cracks me up. #BB22

1319429827074641925 2020-10-23 08:05:59 +0800 <hboo711> @no_silenced Why does an American President have a bank account in China?
1319429617124605952 2020-10-23 08:05:09 +0800 <hboo711> @TeamTrump Why does an American President have a bank account in China?
1319425445440442368 2020-10-23 07:48:34 +0800 <hboo711> @BarackObama @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Thank you for your speach.  I was able to remember a time when I wasn't afraid.  Thank you sir.
1319425166892466178 2020-10-23 07:47:28 +0800 <hboo711> Yes.  We would really like to know why an American President has a bank account in China.  Did they not add enough to it for him?  Is that why he calls COVID the Chinese Virus. Hunter Binden isn't running for presient but I am very curious why a sitting President has this account
1319424540527726594 2020-10-23 07:44:58 +0800 <hboo711> @PeteButtigieg @JoeBiden You are amazing!  Go Pete!

1319418750949523457 2020-10-23 07:21:58 +0800 <hboo711> Give them the truth Pete!  Secret Chinese bank account.  Wow.  Our so called President?  Lock him up for treason.
1319418147544440833 2020-10-23 07:19:34 +0800 <hboo711> @RepsForBiden Mr Trump.  What's the secret bank account in China.  Did China stop putting money in it which made you call COVID the Chinese Virus?
1319416995893415936 2020-10-23 07:15:00 +0800 <hboo711> @MeidasTouch This suburban woman just voted for Biden.  Bye Bye Bye
1319416163668025349 2020-10-23 07:11:41 +0800 <hboo711> @TheRickWilson It was bad enough that we got one Trump (who lost by 3 million votes of course).  Then he brings his whole damn family in.  Really this will be a complete joke in the future.  Certainly not right now it's anything but funny.
1319415487835627522 2020-10-23 07:09:00 +0800 <hboo711> @noname66365339 @StaceyKillings @ABC There are good Republicans. I still won't vote for Trump he's not really a Republican, he is on his own island of wakadoo.  I have no problem with Biden picking Republicans for the Cabinet.  We need the goverment to work for all of us and stop dividing us.
1319414352655634432 2020-10-23 07:04:29 +0800 <hboo711> @Sam_Borley @ABC Why wouldn't Democrats boycott the vote?  There is nothing they can do to stop her from sitting on the court.  It's already handed to her. What are you talking about?
1319413390377439233 2020-10-23 07:00:40 +0800 <hboo711> @CNNnewsroom I'm glad Connie said it however we already know.  He has treated most all women badly or called them names.  He is disgusting and a sexist pig.  He's already slinging garbage about the woman moderator tonight.  I dread watching it like the last one. The crazy Train of Trump.

1319279330157981697 2020-10-22 22:07:57 +0800 <hboo711> @RepsForBiden Just Sickening.  Jesse is scared of Women.  What a misogynistic azzhole.  Not very smart are you Jesse?
1319278721765797890 2020-10-22 22:05:32 +0800 <hboo711> Ageism is alive and well in the USA. I tried to get a job after 30 years as a professional buyer at a very large automotive company as I wanted a change.  I used to present to the President so I knew I had great communications skills.  Spent 2 years and no one would hire me at 52
1319277795155955713 2020-10-22 22:01:52 +0800 <hboo711> @BillMcCurrach @ABC She won't and now Women and LGBTQ+ are going to be without any rights or healthcare for anyone.  Headed back to th 1950s.

1319096474014273537 2020-10-22 10:01:21 +0800 <hboo711> @RepsForBiden Killing actual Mom and Pop Small business.  Helping the spread of COVID.  Locking kids in cages and losing 500+ kids from their parents.  Paying only 750$ in taxes.  Acting like a 12 year old child at a debate, China bank accouny.  A racist and sexist. Tweeting like a fool
1319042213628809218 2020-10-22 06:25:45 +0800 <hboo711> Watching Obama reminds me of a time of feeling unafraid and knowing we had leadership that cared about us.  I miss Obama/Biden.  Now we have a President who is not even close to presidential and we are dying. #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything
1319041117422342153 2020-10-22 06:21:23 +0800 <hboo711> Don't believe the polls.  Please go vote.  Remember 2016 when the polls showed Hillary would win?  This is not over.  Please vote like your life depends on it.  We need a president that isn't a criminal #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica

He told Bob Woodward he knew earlier and didn't want us to panick.  Then he provided no national protection to fight this.  You and he have killed over 220,000 Americans.

You are lying and enabling Donald Trump and victimizing a child of Joe Biden who has lost his mother and brother and who has struggled with addiction which we are sympathetic about because it's all around

1319028685090021377 2020-10-22 05:31:59 +0800 <hboo711> @deadskulltweets I have him blocked.  He is disgusting.
1319028365400092680 2020-10-22 05:30:43 +0800 <hboo711> @SpeakerPelosi Actual Small Busines owners like I have only 8 employees need help. The last PPP was for 499 employees or less.  Please help us small Mom and Pop shops. I've owned it for over 5 years and it's sinking again.  I wasn't able to get it last time because business with 499 took it all
1318938760952881152 2020-10-21 23:34:39 +0800 <hboo711> While Trump &amp; his family can sit comfortably in Mar a Lago for the winter.Most of our families will be cold and freezing missing Thanksgiving and Christmas with our family.And Trump wants to discount women journalists and talk about Hunter Biden.COVID king Trump. #BidenHarris2020
1318937607804432388 2020-10-21 23:30:05 +0800 <hboo711> What's worse the COVID in Fall and even worse Winter. So much for seeing family for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Thank you Donald Trump for not fighting this at the national level and letting us know when you knew. #BidenHarris2020
1318919277282533382 2020-10-21 22:17:14 +0800 <hboo711> @OMAROSA Praying for her children.  14 years is not enough for murder.
1318917640455397376 2020-10-21 22:10:44 +0800 <hboo711> Why are we talking about Hunter Biden. This man lost his Mother and his Brother.  He has struggled with addiction and here people are distracting Trumps craziness to talking about Hunter Biden.  It's disgusting and needs to stop.  He isn't running for president.  #BidenHarris2020
1318625292529827842 2020-10-21 02:49:03 +0800 <hboo711> @SpeakerPelosi Help actual small business lower then 499 employees.  Actual small business are under 30 employees.  The busiess that the middle class created and are no being pushed into poverty.  People owning business of 200 + are divisions of companies or rich people. Save Mom and Pop
1318554679773679616 2020-10-20 22:08:27 +0800 <hboo711> I think there is nothing better then laughing so hard ou pee your pants.  I have't laughed like that since I was young.  Best Laughter ever.  #BB22
1318554261098201091 2020-10-20 22:06:48 +0800 <hboo711> @ArCade26 Nothing better then have such a hard laugh that you pee.  Seriously the best thing in the world.

1318469582198362113 2020-10-20 16:30:19 +0800 <hboo711> @HotNewHipHop Of course he does.  He doesn't want to pay equal taxes even thought his wealth didn't all come from performing.  He's the man that had alot of little people go steal tons of guns in small towns.  Criminal meet Criminal
1318468945595273216 2020-10-20 16:27:47 +0800 <hboo711> @mschlapp Impeach Thomas and Kavanah.  Both who have no respect to the constitution or women.  The are in the pockets of the GOP who loves to keep women unequal
1318468419910586368 2020-10-20 16:25:41 +0800 <hboo711> @mschlapp Judges are not supposed to be political.  John Roberts  shows bipartisonship while you freaks have stacked the courts to do everything for the GOP.  You are not serving this country.
1318467687799029762 2020-10-20 16:22:47 +0800 <hboo711> @RickSmithShow So funny when we vote for judges in our country they don't have a party affiliation by their names.  Clearly they do opperate on party lines.  Thank God for John Roberts who is our last bipartisan judge.  Amy Coney Barrett is a disaster to women and this country.
1318405293051662336 2020-10-20 12:14:51 +0800 <hboo711> @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Trump attacking Dr. Fauci who now has to have security detail.  Ridiculous.  Trump Trechery.
1318404454291562496 2020-10-20 12:11:31 +0800 <hboo711> We need Democrat volunteers at Polling stations!!!  The Trump Republicans are the ones at the Polls now.  Let's do our civic duty.  Keep the votes safe.
1318404157745909760 2020-10-20 12:10:20 +0800 <hboo711> @AVindman @AliAdair22 I will vote for #BidenHarris2020  How you and your family were treated was disgusting.  I'm voting for decency and our Military Families.  Go Bless your Family and thank you for your service and for your bravery.
1318403066291494913 2020-10-20 12:06:00 +0800 <hboo711> Please get out and vote.  Don't be complacent because we will lose so much if Trump wins again.  We need peace and healing.
1318394571315908613 2020-10-20 11:32:15 +0800 <hboo711> @Echo_L @MBHastings94 @ChitownKev My husband was born in Kalamazoo.  There are so many places in Michigan.  Weird question
1318394252909531141 2020-10-20 11:30:59 +0800 <hboo711> @ChitownKev Many I have family in Michigan but I would run out of characters.  Weird question
1318393704823050241 2020-10-20 11:28:48 +0800 <hboo711> Dear @GOP I am a republican.I'm voting for Biden because everyone knows Trump is mentally unstable.Some of u are distancing from Trump because u know that many of us Republicans have turned away from Trump.If you actually care about what the people u serve want do not vote Amy in
1318392603142967297 2020-10-20 11:24:25 +0800 <hboo711> I'm proud of John Roberts who follow the constitution.  He isn't liberal or conservative.  That's why even though he was appointed  by a Republican he is a non partison SCJ. Republicans (the new type) are losing thier minds over this. Makes it hard for them to cheat us again.
1318392051793338368 2020-10-20 11:22:14 +0800 <hboo711> John Roberts was picked by a Republican President. You are doing way to much to enable Trump and his disgusting treatment of the American People. Every voice and vote get's counted.  You should be worried because I'm voting for someone who will serve our district @ShannonFreshour
1318362220770807809 2020-10-20 09:23:42 +0800 <hboo711> Stop trying to make Moolan a thing.  Boring and nothing like Paul and Pablo.  ZZZZZZZ #BB22
1318292216138387458 2020-10-20 04:45:31 +0800 <hboo711> @carab1985 Best wishes and prayers on your journey.
1318285705366429697 2020-10-20 04:19:39 +0800 <hboo711> This is a group of Women marching and Jim Jordan wants us to be outraged.  Think again Jim.  This Ohio woman is voting for @ShannonFreshour You have been an enabler to Trump and haven't stated any problem with huge maskless events he have.  But a masked Women's event?
1318208075707330562 2020-10-19 23:11:11 +0800 <hboo711> @mmpadellan He married into a family that is very against Trump.  Even Arnold is against Trump
1318097394094006272 2020-10-19 15:51:22 +0800 <hboo711> @julialynnrubin @sharontharp You argued with me sis. You responded to my tweet.  I just gave you facts. Don't oppose someone if you haven't got the facts to back up your argument.
1318095849176633345 2020-10-19 15:45:14 +0800 <hboo711> @SeauxStarry @gibsonoma She is certainly not ready for a baby until she deals with her Mothers verbal abuse because she is verbally abusive as well.  Chris is a damn good man and very down to earth.  She needs to listen to him.  You just cant say the horrible things she says.
1318095159599484929 2020-10-19 15:42:29 +0800 <hboo711> @TheWorldAsIKno3 @gibsonoma @candeegal I think it's sad and wrong to hit your daughter with your purse. My mother would never do that when I'm a grown woman. Her mother needs individual help for what she did to C, and C needs to get her own couseling.  You just don't talk like that to people. Her mouth is a knife.
1318093631161585665 2020-10-19 15:36:25 +0800 <hboo711> @thisisbmc @iammrssamuels @gibsonoma It happens alot or we wouldn't have the saying snatch her wig
1318093070240501760 2020-10-19 15:34:11 +0800 <hboo711> @ThatDameLana I still love the show w the exception of 21.  It was the most repulsive I've ever seen and I can't believe anything coul beat BB15.  I think people really forget just how bad last year was.
1318092071270600704 2020-10-19 15:30:13 +0800 <hboo711> @julialynnrubin @sharontharp Maybe you should get your facts right.  Nicole is 28 born on June 13, 1992 and BB6 started on July 7. 2005.  She was 12. I have a daughter and a son.  Neither were the least interested in BB when I was wathin it.  Facts are a funny thing huh?
1318041640276234241 2020-10-19 12:09:49 +0800 <hboo711> @TMZ And that will be the first thing you have said that I will support you in.  GET OUT
1318040708520071168 2020-10-19 12:06:07 +0800 <hboo711> @RepsForBiden It's the peoples house not Donald Trumps.
1318040434980126720 2020-10-19 12:05:02 +0800 <hboo711> @RepsForBiden The FBI, CIA, Secret Service will need to be involved and move him out.
1318039043079327745 2020-10-19 11:59:30 +0800 <hboo711> @julialynnrubin @sharontharp They were like in Elementary school then.  🤣🤣🤣
1318037935304957952 2020-10-19 11:55:06 +0800 <hboo711> @CanstrCa @sharontharp That's just nasty to say.
1318037325134389248 2020-10-19 11:52:40 +0800 <hboo711> I cancelled my feeds two weeks ago because of the every Sunday night no feeds.  It will last until the finale and I was actully interested in a few of the shows online only.  But they have cut the feeds so much it's beyond normal @CBSBigBrother #BB22 It's the whole point of BB
1318036377288704000 2020-10-19 11:48:54 +0800 <hboo711> @ThatDameLana 90 percent of that cast was just amazing.  Such a missed opportunity for CBS.  It's my favorite to this day. (Except the sisters.  Hate the secret family thing) but outside of that just excellent
1318035730589995008 2020-10-19 11:46:20 +0800 <hboo711> @MarinaSauce3 Not even.  She showed up numerous events he was at (stalker vibes) and got a couple of photos with him.  At those events they don't even know who you are.
1318035125582659586 2020-10-19 11:43:56 +0800 <hboo711> @IntoTheSkyStorm Saying sorry isn't really important when someone is toxic always.  And he is.
1318033888048984067 2020-10-19 11:39:01 +0800 <hboo711> @TheWriteModel @KiZzy_LoU214 @DemetriTube Twice and she deserved it.  You just don't say that to a woman that she won't be married for long.. She says things that cuts the jugular.  God as my witness I would have slapped her for that crap.  Chris knows she goes to far
1318030910437138432 2020-10-19 11:27:11 +0800 <hboo711> Why does Candice still dress like a pagent girl?  Nothing wrong with pagent wear but not once our out of thee pagent world it looks childish. #RHOP
1318029324226908160 2020-10-19 11:20:53 +0800 <hboo711> Canice is lucky this is the first time someone has snatched her wig. She has said such horrific things to these women I've been shocked since she started. She's lucky this was the first time. Watch you mouth girl.  You can't talk to grown women like your momma talks to you #RHOP
1318027124108857346 2020-10-19 11:12:08 +0800 <hboo711> @gibsonoma She needs to listen to Chris.  She has bee raised by a women who speaks so mean and nasty and I understand she came by the behaviour that was modeled.  Chris is down to earth and needs to help her level out and get some serious counseling without her Mom.
1318026713557852161 2020-10-19 11:10:30 +0800 <hboo711> @iammrssamuels @gibsonoma What Candice says cuts deep. Ive seen it since she started &amp; I knew the way she spoke so horribly to these women would end up pushing someone over the edge. I have been shocked by the things she has said and she really needs some deep counseling because she behaves like her Mom.
1317844817196572672 2020-10-18 23:07:43 +0800 <hboo711> @JustLikeBecky @olhowling_husky @KateSmithAZ @EricTrump Sure do. $750 is only a pair of shoes for Melania
1317844318980349953 2020-10-18 23:05:44 +0800 <hboo711> @KateSmithAZ @EricTrump One of the most tacky places I've ever seen.  Trying to make it look like a palace.  Trumps have always had a warped sense of who they really are.
1317591490143653889 2020-10-18 06:21:05 +0800 <hboo711> @mistercecil I don't care if you know his people.  I talked to him about why he didn't return and he told me that Day plays a better game without him.  He is great friends with Day.

1317585769901531145 2020-10-18 05:58:21 +0800 <hboo711> @CheckinMyPage Sorry.  I was trying to be shady regarding Janelle having 4 shots and failing.  My ADHD got the best of me. 😳

1317584928217976832 2020-10-18 05:55:01 +0800 <hboo711> @carab1985 I'm hoping Nicole wins the Veto.  So she chooses F3
1317584616761458688 2020-10-18 05:53:46 +0800 <hboo711> By the was.  I want to Thank @CBSBigBrother for getting us a season this year during a very tough situation.  It has helped me get thru these 3 months and I will be so sad when it's over.  I've watched since BB1 and I will always love this game.  Thank again.  #BB22
1317584080318484486 2020-10-18 05:51:38 +0800 <hboo711> @DiedInTheSnap I hope so and their mics turned off if they try to drag any houseguests especially Nicole.  Nicole has gotten more hate then anyone which is disgusting.
1317583712469553153 2020-10-18 05:50:11 +0800 <hboo711> @CheckinMyPage Well it took one 4 season and didn't get anywhere near Nicoles stats.  Sorry couldn't resist.  I hope Nicole wins the Veto.  For her to win I think she has to let Cody go so she has a chance to win. Nicoles my hope
1317583107466366981 2020-10-18 05:47:46 +0800 <hboo711> @mistercecil He loves Day and is sticking up for her.  Why call him names? He was very entertaining on BB and BBOTT.  No one is perfect but he's not nasty or a little sheetheel.  He almost won one of the greatest seasons BBOTT but production did a set up and he came in 2nd. Stop the hate jeez
1317578980053188608 2020-10-18 05:31:22 +0800 <hboo711> @HighMachGamestr @CBSBigBrother I have to agree with you too except I won't say parasites.  Drama seeking for sure
1317578789342400514 2020-10-18 05:30:37 +0800 <hboo711> @LolBitYT @kcoll1313 @PandaNation_YT @realitygamehost @istanrockstar I have been a fan of Nicole's since Season one.  I was also a fan of Janelle.  I'm fans of many great women in BB.  You are right no one is perfect.  I just think it's awful how someone I love like Janelle has all this sucess would got so low as to still be trashing Nicole.
1317578219126751246 2020-10-18 05:28:21 +0800 <hboo711> @LolBitYT @kcoll1313 @PandaNation_YT @realitygamehost @istanrockstar She played a 50/50 role with David.  It was a game move.  I love Day and I wanted to see her win and was dissapointed.  I will still only vote Day for AFP
1317577950930272257 2020-10-18 05:27:17 +0800 <hboo711> @PandaNation_YT @kcoll1313 @LolBitYT @realitygamehost @istanrockstar He lied so well even crying.  But there were more converstions she had with David trying to help him and he disrespected her a couple of times. David also voted her out and she refused to vote against him so
1317577508452241414 2020-10-18 05:25:32 +0800 <hboo711> @PandaNation_YT @kcoll1313 @LolBitYT @realitygamehost @istanrockstar It was slut shaming.  Nicole being with 3 men and marrying one in 3 years is far from a slut and quite frankly it's no one's business how many people men and women sleep with. How sexist.
1317577110697988096 2020-10-18 05:23:57 +0800 <hboo711> @PandaNation_YT @kcoll1313 @istanrockstar @LolBitYT @realitygamehost Find your own clips from your feeds.  These people don't work for you and aren't BB Feed accounts.
1317576829058822144 2020-10-18 05:22:50 +0800 <hboo711> @kcoll1313 @LolBitYT @PandaNation_YT @realitygamehost @istanrockstar Sadly David had been the biggest reason Day didn't trust him because he has lied to her and disrespected her prior to that point.
1317576623022104577 2020-10-18 05:22:00 +0800 <hboo711> @LolBitYT @kcoll1313 @PandaNation_YT @realitygamehost @istanrockstar That is the only thing you have gotten correctly.  But like everyone it was a game move.  Nicole promised Day she would never put her up or vote her out and she stuck to that promise.
1317576353751945217 2020-10-18 05:20:56 +0800 <hboo711> @kcoll1313 @LolBitYT @PandaNation_YT @realitygamehost @istanrockstar This guy has no complete knowledge of the feeds I can tell.  He's just going off because he thinks it's popular to hate on Nicole.  He should be embarrased because he is uninformed (not watching all feeds) and trying too hard.
1317575786522644481 2020-10-18 05:18:41 +0800 <hboo711> @realitygamehost @istanrockstar @GabryelleGabbs @PandaNation_YT This person has not watched all the feeds because he is giving non facts.
1317575474378383362 2020-10-18 05:17:27 +0800 <hboo711> @istanrockstar @GabryelleGabbs @PandaNation_YT @realitygamehost Stay uninformed and ignorant to the facts.
1317574865839423491 2020-10-18 05:15:02 +0800 <hboo711> @HighMachGamestr @CBSBigBrother I wish I could look it up for you but I blocked them both because I love them both but the thread about them going off at Finale made me sad so I blocked them for now.
1317574350351028234 2020-10-18 05:12:59 +0800 <hboo711> @HighMachGamestr @CBSBigBrother Janelle said she was going to drag Nicole on Finale night and Bayleigh was cheering her on.  With a do it.  I don't think Bayleigh was attacking but she was supporting Janelle to do it.  It was about 3 weeks ago I'm guessing.

1317568008257142785 2020-10-18 04:47:47 +0800 <hboo711> @sydneytweetsbb I'm not the biggest fan but I'm no hater of anyone who plays this game.  It's a mentally hard game.  I can't imagine being away from the people who love and I trust unconditionally for three months.  An that's what these people have to go through and also fight to win.  It is sad
1317567305820286978 2020-10-18 04:44:59 +0800 <hboo711> @DavisDishing Yea.  I loved Dick his first season.  I just wish he wouldn't act like such a jerk now.  It's overboard.

1317564235979886594 2020-10-18 04:32:47 +0800 <hboo711> @Corner2016 Victor is far superior then Hayden and Corey.  Nicole has the best BB stats.  Season one she went to Jury.  Season 2 she won.  Current season Top 4.  She'll get more brand deals soon.  Even if she loses this season her BB stats are solid in 3 seasons as apposed to those with 4!
1317563776187682816 2020-10-18 04:30:58 +0800 <hboo711> @bb22allstars_ Nicole made every jury her first season.  Won her second season and is int he F4 her current seasonl   These people just want to hate her for everything from her hair to her clothes.  It disgusting.  Thanks for saying it!!!!!
1317563352042917889 2020-10-18 04:29:16 +0800 <hboo711> @istanrockstar There is where we have common ground.  Love Da'Vonne forever!  My favorite.
1317562894125498372 2020-10-18 04:27:27 +0800 <hboo711> @bagbrudder I'm fighting the Nicole haters too.  It's get's tiring.  Sadly Janelle used to be my favorite but not anymore.  She's a whole mess for being 40 years old.  She must be trying out for RH on Bravo?

At least I know my rough timelines.  That has nothing to do with what went down in the BB house on the feeds the first week.

Everyone was so focused on bulling her crying but Nic was crying because Janelle made it clear day one she didn't want anything to do with her and JP said it was because of Nics fight w/Rachel Reilly. silly
1317560439111360512 2020-10-18 04:17:42 +0800 <hboo711> @istanrockstar @GabryelleGabbs @PandaNation_YT @realitygamehost The first day.She went in to the key room and chose a bed where Janelle was and tried to talk to her and Janelle gave her the "don't even talk to me" direction.That's why Nicole was crying for the first couple of days.She loved Janelle and she was her BB hero.
1317559110112600064 2020-10-18 04:12:25 +0800 <hboo711> @istanrockstar @GabryelleGabbs @PandaNation_YT @realitygamehost Janelle has talked so much smack against Nicole constantly on twitter since she left.  Way more then Nicole has ever talked about Janelle. Nicole came into the BB house in hopes of working with Janelle because she was a fan.  Janelle gave her the hand.  Nicole was very upset.

1317558185406959618 2020-10-18 04:08:45 +0800 <hboo711> There has been the deepest of hatred and sexism towards Nicole and racist comments about Victor.  Don't give them a platform to do more harm to Nic and Vic.
1317557495267721216 2020-10-18 04:06:00 +0800 <hboo711> It's my sincere hope that @CBSBigBrother doesn't give Janelle and Bay the time to trash the houseguests.  The are prejury and are planning on trashing Nicole.  It's ridiculous and we want to hear from the jury and the F3. Please don't allow another Pre jury steal the time. #BB22
1317556634298843137 2020-10-18 04:02:35 +0800 <hboo711> @bigbrothvr Janelle although I've loved her is showing a lack of class.  It's bad enough that twitter has called Nicole everthing but a sweet girl from a small town and Victor has even been dragged. I'm so dissapointed in Janelle and toxic twitter.  Sexist, Racist and nasty people here

1317278183255953408 2020-10-17 09:36:07 +0800 <hboo711> Just watched a documentary about Rome and Caligula.  It reminded me of Trump.  Caligula was described as Cruel, Sadistic, Extravagant, sexually perverted and an insane tyrant. Unless you haven't been watching &amp; listening to him you are blind. #CaligulaTrump #BlameTrump

They did say at the beginning of the season that they would have alot less staff in and around the house and said comps would be different because of COVID.
1316926822999855104 2020-10-16 10:19:56 +0800 <hboo711> @interjention They did say before the season started that the comps would not be very over the top because they were trying to contol the amount of people working in the house and working on the comps because of COVID.  This does seem like a cheap season

1316895814740963329 2020-10-16 08:16:43 +0800 <hboo711> A KAYSAR visit!  Love it! #BB22
1316892702349365248 2020-10-16 08:04:21 +0800 <hboo711> @khloekardashian Yes I am. Twitter is a mess.
1316892362535292929 2020-10-16 08:03:00 +0800 <hboo711> #TwitterDown MAGA hacked it.
1316854529246343169 2020-10-16 05:32:40 +0800 <hboo711> @GovMikeDeWine No one I know is social gathering.  No one in my large family whom we haven't seen each other since February.  Do something.  It's worse now then in March.  No easy testing, no PPE.  You are failing. It's the Trumpies no wearing masks. How will you get reelected without them
1316853113672925184 2020-10-16 05:27:02 +0800 <hboo711> @GovMikeDeWine @metrohealthCLE We have more cases then in March. It's good to know you are dedicated to Trump instead of Ohioans at risk for COVID.  You are failing at protecting us Mike.  Serve your people not the President.  Don't be responsible for killing us.
1316766125120720898 2020-10-15 23:41:23 +0800 <hboo711> @thedailybeast Ok Mr. Murdoch do something about it.  Let Fox news stop their lying and defending of the undefendable crazed Trump.  Words are good actions mean more.
1316765655627169792 2020-10-15 23:39:31 +0800 <hboo711> @BadLuckCharmx We all saw the comics and every guest got a super hero muscles comic except 2 women.  Dani and Nicole got shit comics.  That's it.  After the end of the season they get their comics and who would be happy to have the comics Dani and Nicole got?  Like them or not. Super shady
1316763267143000065 2020-10-15 23:30:01 +0800 <hboo711> @ashleyj71284 @annwoodshive @DotsPola Her calling us ignorant is hilarious.  We know the facts and her ignorance is obvious.  She just can't leave it alone.
1316657641930870784 2020-10-15 16:30:18 +0800 <hboo711> @RudyGiuliani Oh Rudy.  You have killed your legacy.  The corruption is coming from you and Trump.  Please leave us alone with your racist and toxic lies.
1316584951366717440 2020-10-15 11:41:28 +0800 <hboo711> @bb_fan00 @JanellePierzina I love, love, love Janelle and I think she should be on television.  I just wish she would stop on the jabs.  She's beautiful and sucessful.  I would love to see her on TV again.
1316584588165210112 2020-10-15 11:40:01 +0800 <hboo711> @bb_fan00 @JanellePierzina Follow Janelle she has been going off about Nicole since she went home.
1316583488464789504 2020-10-15 11:35:39 +0800 <hboo711> @KrisNelson4TN @EvelDick @JanellePierzina All the comics had players with muscle body super hero types except Dani and Nicole. It was shady as hell.  Who gives a shit what Nicole wears?  She's a very cute country lady and Janelle is a very classy and glamorous city lady.  Trashing women is gross.  Clothes?  Seriously
1316582528501907456 2020-10-15 11:31:50 +0800 <hboo711> @AdamAndEvel @CBSBigBrotherLF are the worst of any season.  I cancelled my feeds two weeks ago after feeds being cut so much.  I've watched the feeds since day one and I've never seen this much disrepect towards feeders.  It's called big brother with 24/7 feeds.  Not even close this year.
1316567237688516614 2020-10-15 10:31:04 +0800 <hboo711> @hannahradecker @itsaboutnikki_ It's disappointing because I liked them both but Janelle has said wayyy more trash about Nicole here then Nicole has said about Janelle.  I really thought Janelle had much more class then that.  J is beautiful and sucessful why the constant Nicole hate
1316566505761505280 2020-10-15 10:28:10 +0800 <hboo711> @Jessica01323042 So she get's Cody out and puts her game in the hands of Memphis, Enzo and Christmas.  It would be a terrible game move.
1316565688690118657 2020-10-15 10:24:55 +0800 <hboo711> @MPtrooper @CBSBigBrother Oh yea and Memphis, Christmas and Enzo would have her back after that?  Come on  It's a game, you gotta think ahead
1316565127106375685 2020-10-15 10:22:41 +0800 <hboo711> @TheRealAZJhawks I love Janelle but she's still trashing Nicole way more then Nicole says or makes comments about Janelle.  It's pretty sad they everyone got super hero bodies and Dani and Nicole got shady comics.
1316564614235201536 2020-10-15 10:20:39 +0800 <hboo711> @CBSBigBrother How shady that you give muscles and super hero comics to everyone except Dani in Nicole.  Super Shady especially on a All Stars season.  Super sexist
1316560737729499136 2020-10-15 10:05:15 +0800 <hboo711> @CBSBigBrother People will never understand the mental mess that being in the house for so long can cause.  These are all just people.  Some I like, some I don't but hating and trying to destroy them on twitter is sad.  It hurts them and their friends and family.  Hate the game not the player.
1316559943865073664 2020-10-15 10:02:05 +0800 <hboo711> @Rafy122 To show us that it's important to take showers, wash out hands after goig to the bathroom and not wiping our nose with our hands.  I wish I knew.

1316555440508088320 2020-10-15 09:44:12 +0800 <hboo711> @BigBroTwee2 I love Janelle and always will.  I'm sadly surprised that that she is just constantly showing bad sportsmanship and trashing another woman. I hope she can move on soon.  She's successful and beautiful.  There's no need to keep trashing another woman or calling Day's vote pity
1316554547511398403 2020-10-15 09:40:39 +0800 <hboo711> @TaylorAllen133 Andy is always all over the place.  I used to like him alot until this year.
1316528152768847872 2020-10-15 07:55:46 +0800 <hboo711> @GeorgeTakei @duffynyc Never would watch him.  He makes me sick to my stomach
1316527981955870722 2020-10-15 07:55:05 +0800 <hboo711> @KamalaHarris I feel so hopeless that nothing can be done to keep her off the supreme court.  I'm tired of Toxic men saying I'm not equal and making laws about my body. Now this women will do the same against our healthcare, our bodies and the election.
1316527290139004931 2020-10-15 07:52:20 +0800 <hboo711> @DonaldJTrumpJr Ah, the little plan didn't work out?  Anyone whould investiate and fact check anything you, your family or Rudy would give them.  American people deserve the truth young man.
1316526280867811328 2020-10-15 07:48:19 +0800 <hboo711> @PressSec @Twitter Also I don't care what a child of a candidate did.  The GOP and Trump has been digging into this since Trumps Quid Pro Quo with the Ukrane.  Nothing could top Trumps 3 children and his son in laws dealings while right before the WH and the past nearly 4 years. #BidenHarris2020
1316525045016035330 2020-10-15 07:43:25 +0800 <hboo711> @PressSec @Twitter Not censorship, fact checking.  We are tired of the lied you help Trump spread.

1316401449492938753 2020-10-14 23:32:17 +0800 <hboo711> @bagbrudder Or tearing her fiance down and going after her business.  Stats are there.  People may not like how she plays but she is a very effective game player.

I know it's having a negative effect on him as he put their Podcast on hold.  Victor is still very handsome and a true Latino man.
1316220165172985857 2020-10-14 11:31:56 +0800 <hboo711> @MeanderingMarie @ezralevant You said nothing to be reported for. He blocked you because you spoke the truth.

There are no men in my life and I cannot respect a man in leadership who calls women and others names and touchs women without consent.  I'm 56 and I've never seen a more lying, horrible or dangerous President.
1316187157955043328 2020-10-14 09:20:46 +0800 <hboo711> @MeanderingMarie @ezralevant Because you gave him facts to go with his bullcrap comment
1316186529853775873 2020-10-14 09:18:16 +0800 <hboo711> @AmandaMarcotte This shows exactly why she is being appointed.
1316185040032849926 2020-10-14 09:12:21 +0800 <hboo711> @RepsForBiden This suburban women will not vote for Trump because he has no respect for women.  3 wives and children with each one and still cheats on all.  He can just kiss and grab a women without consent. He calls my fellow women monster, idiot, low IQ,.  Never ever will he get my vote
1316184248869695490 2020-10-14 09:09:13 +0800 <hboo711> @DanRather This suburban woman is voting for Biden and Harris.  I can never vote for a man that calls women names, and completly disrespects women in every way.

Even the address 113 E Ashland St.  I told you facts on what a cog test actually is and you're still not getting that Trump lied.  Of course I didn't fail but you're President did....Where's the address he was given?
1316116801043001344 2020-10-14 04:41:12 +0800 <hboo711> @MittRomney We r financially in a bad place from a President who hid the dangers early of COVID &amp; now 215k of our people r dead. Do the right thing Mitt in healing us.Don't let that lady on our SC and talk to your R friends.The majority of Americans are against this. Serve Country over party
1316115737514315778 2020-10-14 04:36:58 +0800 <hboo711> @MittRomney Mitt so many of us that feel unsafe w/the craziness of Donald Trump have lost hope and are hurting. It is sad that there is division &amp; anger like we've never seen.  It's because we are scared of the madman who is President &amp; who is putting someone on the SC who will do his bid

Small little restaurants, cosmetologists etc these similar need help for their loss.  I do agree no more help for business with 499 people and over.  That was BS.  True small under 25

Those aren't the type of words are neverused to do a cog. test Man, woman, persn, camera, TV lmao.  He calls women names. He failed to organize a national organization for th states to fight COVID and called it a Dem Hoax.

1315877377696772109 2020-10-13 12:49:49 +0800 <hboo711> @JaniJedi @girl_smeg Sure Jan.  Just like Cody and Nicole have won any puzzle comps.  Sorry I got kids and a business and I'm done for now so I can get some sleep.  I gave you balanced honest feedback but you have lost your mind in this game.  Keep going Janelle might add you as a friend.
1315876360204824576 2020-10-13 12:45:46 +0800 <hboo711> @JaniJedi @girl_smeg Yes Derrick was calling absolutely everyone.  So Derrick lied about that because Vic said he was calling everyone.  Vic does't lie and he got super upset when Derrick went from blowing up her phone and then his when they weren't supposed to speak due to NDA.  I believe Vic
1315875770556968966 2020-10-13 12:43:26 +0800 <hboo711> @JaniJedi @girl_smeg Sounds like you think Mommygate happened.  Cody has said several times he was so glad when he saw her.  He did not know she would be there but I guess we are gonna pin it on the Mommy's. 😂🤣🤣😂
1315875259229310976 2020-10-13 12:41:24 +0800 <hboo711> @JaniJedi @girl_smeg No she didn't.Vic doesn't lie.He was actually upset that Derrick kept calling Nicole and when she wouldn't answer he starting calling Vic.  They were afraid Nic would lose her place per the NDA.  Look back at Derricks tweet around when the cast was revealed.  He was pizzed at Nic
1315874457219629056 2020-10-13 12:38:13 +0800 <hboo711> @JaniJedi @girl_smeg I know that Cody's Mom and Nicoles Mom are friends. Not denying it like you say I'm delusional...never said they they weren't friends. Heard it on the feeds and from Vic. But I know that Derrick was pizzed that Nic didn't tell him she was playing. Oh we saying F@ck now. 😂
1315873429036380160 2020-10-13 12:34:07 +0800 <hboo711> @JaniJedi @girl_smeg I love Danielle and I respect opinions but I don't respect the constant hate, lies, trying to ruin Nicoles business' or attacking her for Victors hair cut.  This toxic hate  from day one tearing Nicole apart has been disgusting. Nic never spoke to D or D before coming on.
1315872586866327553 2020-10-13 12:30:47 +0800 <hboo711> @JaniJedi @girl_smeg All because of some beef between Rachel on TAR?  I'm still disappointed I don't see Janelle on the show.
1315872263011528704 2020-10-13 12:29:29 +0800 <hboo711> @JaniJedi @girl_smeg I'm only comparing comp wins.  Kaycee is more comparable.  For now Nicole has the best stats.  I also love Janelle. But is it a good game move to go in and instantly let Nicole she doesn't like her?  I wish Janelle would have faked it and made it further so I could still see her.

1315870727611068417 2020-10-13 12:23:23 +0800 <hboo711> @JaniJedi @girl_smeg Hello....  Dr Will, Kaycee? Her social reach to other guest got Dani and Tyler out.  Not a fan.  That's ok.  But her stats say otherwise. Like I said she has a very small chance at winnning. Just because you are a Janelle stan and she hates her but you go off
1315870059215151105 2020-10-13 12:20:44 +0800 <hboo711> @JaniJedi @girl_smeg You are delusional.  No pregame alliance but you believe your delusion.  Derrick was mad at her for not telling him she was playing because she was scared of losing her spot because she already signed the NDA. I can't speak for Memphis or Cody as I wasn't informed about them
1315868556647596032 2020-10-13 12:14:46 +0800 <hboo711> @DomScalise @Beautrotting So glad you spoke up.
1315868256268439552 2020-10-13 12:13:34 +0800 <hboo711> @CBSBigBrother Day and Janelle.  Disapointed that Janelle went in day one against Nicole instead of playing the game and getting close to her (fake it baby) instead of seeking some kind of weird revenge for Rachel that happened on TAR.  Because I wanted to watch Janelle!
1315867572789706759 2020-10-13 12:10:51 +0800 <hboo711> @JaniJedi @girl_smeg Everyone knows Nicole's chances of winning for a second time was/is a very small chance. However I do think Nicole should get some applause for her social skills.  She planted seeds constantly an then boom they were out.  3 seasons and made all 3  jurys.  She's no slouch

1315864367175536641 2020-10-13 11:58:07 +0800 <hboo711> @carab1985 100% Nothing to hide or say anymore.  I love this game and I'm not disappointed in it but I've never been so disapointed in the LF for 21 years.  Let us see the Feeds!!!!!! @CBSBigBrother @CBSBigBrotherLF
1315863535579271168 2020-10-13 11:54:49 +0800 <hboo711> @pekoeauts Elissa your BRAND is watching 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

1315862017744547842 2020-10-13 11:48:47 +0800 <hboo711> @marcellajay41 @PeteButtigieg In some cases it is live or death! What are we going to do with unwanted babies?The foster care system? Not one of you give a crap about these children the moment they are born. It would not be my personal choice but the gov't and U should no tchoose what women do w/ their body.
1315860235840561154 2020-10-13 11:41:42 +0800 <hboo711> @lindysegal @MattLummus Any man who understands the need for women to make our own health care choices is a REAL man.Instead of the Cave Men so many of us have to deal with. It's 2020 and they still could never vote to ensure women get paid equally. Men have no laws governing their bodies. We have 100s
1315858740298625024 2020-10-13 11:35:45 +0800 <hboo711> @BoKnowsNews @RepsForBiden I'm in Ohio.  You have my vote.  It's time to get rid of the Have and the Have Nots, Keep ACA, and keep Womens rights.  Going all Blue please help us.

1315856844280168448 2020-10-13 11:28:13 +0800 <hboo711> Canceled my live feeds.  They are cut all the time when the HG are outside and they play music in case of Wall Yellers. You were ineffective at wall yelling.  Thank you azzholes for ruining the live feeds.  They are also cut too often even when they are inside  #BB22
1315855234560913408 2020-10-13 11:21:49 +0800 <hboo711> @carab1985 I've never seen such a horrible year for feeds.  So when they get outside privledges they play loud music outside and shut down the feeds.  The music is to drown out wall yellers.  Wall yellers ruined our feeds.
1315853554482122752 2020-10-13 11:15:09 +0800 <hboo711> @ProjectLincoln COVID PIT!  Amazing how unintelliget this really is.  Stay out of my state you COVID Super Spreaders.  Ya'll think you going to get a team of Drs and some $100,000 X 2 test drug.  You won't.  All I can say is I love it!  Less people to vote for Trump when you are sick

1315820963712380928 2020-10-13 09:05:39 +0800 <hboo711> @ShinxBoy01 They should have content as much as they constantly shut down the feeds right @CBSBigBrother

1315819669958389760 2020-10-13 09:00:30 +0800 <hboo711> @tvshowmusings @BBObsessed1 Ah talking about "laundry"  That reminds me of Friends when Chandler and Monica were doing "laundry"  Even though no kiss, maybe somethin there with the laundry
1315817941162745856 2020-10-13 08:53:38 +0800 <hboo711> OMG Enzo I love ya but Nicole owes you nothing.  😂 You are being brought to the end because everyone except Nicole will beat you at F2.  #BB22
1315817474982662144 2020-10-13 08:51:47 +0800 <hboo711> @beynickic Enzo doesn't take showers often and even more gross he doesn't wash his hands after using in the bathroom.  He's fun and funny but ick

He did it without her knowledge.When they were engaged on Big Brother he shocked her &amp; showed up with his short hair. She has said at least 10 times she prefers his long hair but when you are a Michigan State Trooper it's a no.
1315814274825170944 2020-10-13 08:39:04 +0800 <hboo711> Hilarious to see Christmas copying the way Nicole is walking on the see saw #BB22

He makes his own decisions. I don't know what happed to Nicole F to make her feel so insecure in life but it's nothing I would make fun of.  Leave Vic out of it, it's sad
1315796629958647808 2020-10-13 07:28:57 +0800 <hboo711> @ButFirstRoxy Here you all are trying to mind F@ck his girlfriend who isn't in the game.  Good Job Twitter.  You're not toxic at all. So F@cked up. I don't even like them but I am sick of toxic twitter and BB.  It's a damn game get over it.

Amazing they think they will be just as ok as Trump after COVID however they won't have access to the high level of medication that won't be available to them or a big team of the best physicians not available to them

I thought that behavior would be beneath her. Guess not. Do I love Janelle on the show YES, but coming in with being upset with Nic over Rachel on a different show isn't playing the game
1315753676032663552 2020-10-13 04:38:16 +0800 <hboo711> @lorihall65 @NickyMouse710 @mariiiahkay Exactly!  Mephis was imitating the boy in The shining. He was standing and doing the finger bend motion and saying redrum.  Mephis was funny.  She laughed at Memphis.  She went out of her way to make sure Ian was comfortable even asking for a rocking chair when they were inside
1315752607273627648 2020-10-13 04:34:01 +0800 <hboo711> @JeremeFJackson @mariiiahkay I like Janelle. She walked n right away and Nicole was excited to team w/her . Janelle let her know Day 1 nope she wanted nothing 2 do with her. Bad game move. Then J and Kaysar played the safety suite at the same time. I'm disapointed in the continued hatred Janelle is sending.
1315750838107865089 2020-10-13 04:26:59 +0800 <hboo711> @kcoll1313 @mariiiahkay It was so popular on Twitter to hate and destroy Nicole F.  I have never blocked so many people in all my years on Twitter.  It was just out of control hatred.  It makes my heart happy to see so many people support her now.  I was attacked for all my NF positive posts.
1315750300020596736 2020-10-13 04:24:51 +0800 <hboo711> @mariiiahkay Thank you!  They have not only made fun of those things you stated but they said horrilbe things about her fiancee and they went directly to companies that support her.  Digusting.  Nicole F is good at this game.  Some may not like how she plays but she is effective.  It's a game
1315748882157056000 2020-10-13 04:19:13 +0800 <hboo711> @ashishkjha @hunter_chip We have 6 kinds in our K -12 with COVID right now and our kids only go partial days.  You are right we are overestimating the danger for our 50+.  I've had 3 friends die of COVID.

I recall my Grandmother with 7 kids getting beat and having no recourse because women couldn't get hired to jobs that paid good wages to men. No credit card.  So just a punching bag.
1315648454031486979 2020-10-12 21:40:09 +0800 <hboo711> @RepsForBiden Politicians stacking the SCOTUS againt women and the ACA.  A women to take away our already unequal rights to replace a great women who gave us rights. A women that critized John Roberts about his vote for the ACA. If you have kid under 26 or you need healtcare you should be mad.

1315531112232427520 2020-10-12 13:53:53 +0800 <hboo711> @TjStays Same!  No kiss.  People trying to hurt relationships is F@cked up.  And I can't beleive I"m defending them either. It's just hurting the innocent partners of these people.  Stupid

1315530134657654788 2020-10-12 13:50:00 +0800 <hboo711> @SamFlowers Not a fan of either one but there was a video and I watched it over and over.  I could hear Memphis quietly chuckling the entire time.  People sent all this to his girlfriend and are now saying she deleted his photos.  So wrong
1315529499749089282 2020-10-12 13:47:28 +0800 <hboo711> @JessWhalen87 A video was posted and I watched it over and over.  The whole time I can hear Memphis chuckling.  I couldn't hear Christmas but Memphis chuckles at everything she says even if it's stupid.  No kissing.  People trying to ruin relationships is messed up.  I'm not even a fan
1315528902085947392 2020-10-12 13:45:06 +0800 <hboo711> @jaysarbayday11 She got a little older and slimmed down.  She's a really cute young lady.  Looks exactly like the same person.  I have a daughter her age.  Just age and weight changes

1315527632939819009 2020-10-12 13:40:03 +0800 <hboo711> @callMeEarthling @Mafo_Nibo @BB22LiveFeeds She finished Nursing School and was/is a Nurse.  Perhaps not a practicing one. With that said it's been addressed that after BB18 she lost her senority and had to work a late night shift and she didn't want to do it after awhile.  She plays the game but Nicole F is sweet and kind
1315526847162200064 2020-10-12 13:36:56 +0800 <hboo711> I enjoy this game.  I have enjoyed every season except last season.  I still like #BB22 however @CBSBigBrotherLF the vast amount of feed cuts is a new record and it's not like Big Brother anymore.  I've never been more dissapointed in the feeds then this year.
1315525899710758912 2020-10-12 13:33:10 +0800 <hboo711> I've watched the video of Christmas and Memphis like 22 times.  They were not kissing.  The whole time I hear Memphis laughing (quietly chuckling) over something stupid that I couldn't hear Christmas say. I'm not a big fan of either but dang Twitter kill a relationship?  #BB22

I agreed with her and I was just saying I wish women supported each other out here in real life.  I adore Jessica and would never be unsupportive of her feelings.

My 25 year old Nephew who has been with his girlfriend for 5 years had his very first (a huge) wedding planned.  They got married with only 8 people in attendance. At 50+ years how sickening.

It was my nephew and his wife's first marriage and only their parents attended in June.  We were to have a party in November and they have cancelled it.   It's show a huge lack of respect for their guests in my opinion.
1315127513224544256 2020-10-11 11:10:07 +0800 <hboo711> @DannyPellegrino My Nephew got married with only 8 people there because of the pandemic.  I'm really dissapointed that Cynthia decided that it was ok to have a 250 person indoor wedding.  I will imply it as very irresponsable, reckless and a horrible mistake.  I'm really shocked she would do this

1315030431880941570 2020-10-11 04:44:21 +0800 <hboo711> @UnfazedKing Finally I find my Nicole F people.  I'm so happy.  I felt so alone at the start of the game I was attacked constantly for being a Nicole F fan.
1315030003260821506 2020-10-11 04:42:39 +0800 <hboo711> @bbdiana_ FINALLY my people!  Other then 3 other people I have been so sickened from the start of the game over the Nicole F hate!  It's gone overboard hurting her family, business' and I'm sure her when she get's out.  I have always and will always be a Nicole F fan.
1315029313704595456 2020-10-11 04:39:55 +0800 <hboo711> @hohweek @BB_Updates Of course she is.  It's a game for half a mil.  There isn't one person in this game that doesn't lie.  If she's not lying she's not good at this game and unpopular opinion she is good at this game just not in the way fan want.
1315023099386003458 2020-10-11 04:15:13 +0800 <hboo711> @elfitvic @DayDaVonne_ I'm proud of Nicole to sticking to her pledge not to put her up or vote her out.  I know people will not see it that way but I do.
1315022733512712192 2020-10-11 04:13:46 +0800 <hboo711> @jmilagrosplus I saw the celebration of 100 years women gettting the vote (White Women).  To me it was disgusting to celebrate because black women didn't get the vote until 1965. 65 years later!!!!!!  I wish someone could please tell me why we women can't be as tight as men in real life.
1315021052091805697 2020-10-11 04:07:05 +0800 <hboo711> @jmilagrosplus Nicole knows this is how life is. She has been mostly crapped on my Women in her 3 seasons.  Yea, she does the same.   So she plays the game according to how most women behave.  It is real life.   We need to figure this out in real life.
1315020487639142403 2020-10-11 04:04:50 +0800 <hboo711> @jmilagrosplus It's not just this game.........It's real life that Women do not support each other.  Most still try to tear women down.  I think it's sad but why is this our real life?
1315019662862802944 2020-10-11 04:01:34 +0800 <hboo711> @BB_Updates This is funny because they all think she is the best to take to the end because no one thinks or will allow one person to win BB twice. I hope I'm wrong. No sorry I hope Nicole wins for all the over the top hate I've seen for 3 months.
1315019269630029825 2020-10-11 04:00:00 +0800 <hboo711> @BB_Updates Christmas Mephis or you will not be in the house after Thursday.
1315018821359501312 2020-10-11 03:58:13 +0800 <hboo711> Yes Christmas Nicole is going to lie just like you do because It's a game for half a mil.  Nicole is a good player in her way.  Her way isn't popular with many but I have no problem with it.   #BB22
1315018441049419778 2020-10-11 03:56:42 +0800 <hboo711> Could Chritmas stop stalking Nicole?  I'm so tired of her up Nicoles butt.  Jeez  #BB22

1315015479522668558 2020-10-11 03:44:56 +0800 <hboo711> @JoeBiden 3 years older then Trump and looks 15 years younger then Trump.  #BidenHarris2020
1314785760810274816 2020-10-10 12:32:07 +0800 <hboo711> @UnfazedKing @RDicknsn Love to see all this support in this thread.  I felt pretty alone in cheering for her from the beginning of the season.  You Nicole fans are awesome
1314785487358435329 2020-10-10 12:31:02 +0800 <hboo711> @RDicknsn @UnfazedKing I'm pretty sure this is the last time.  She is getting married in December and wants to start a family right away.  She has played 3 amazing seasons and after seeing the hate from day one I would never blame her if she never returned but I would love it.
1314784818291499009 2020-10-10 12:28:22 +0800 <hboo711> @UnfazedKing @nitac02 Bingo.  I agree!
1314784253721432064 2020-10-10 12:26:08 +0800 <hboo711> @UnfazedKing I agree.  From day one I have blocked, have stood up for her.  I'm proud of her game. She's my favorite female player and I don't care what anyone says she is a great player!!! I don't use the word stan as I'm an older woman but I'm a huge fan.  Go @nicole_franzel Queen of BB
1314783191773966336 2020-10-10 12:21:55 +0800 <hboo711> @lorigspeaks @lacadri34 Because Trump got stem cells and he can't let anyone share that as it's not ok to be a Republican and use stem cells.  You know it's the only reason he is doing this well.
1314782685454389248 2020-10-10 12:19:54 +0800 <hboo711> @lacadri34 I'm far from a Trump fan but I hope he is ok.  Why aren't we hearing more about his condition?  7 days of hospitilization is not good.  Guess Trump left him out high and dry without the 200k worth of medicine that Trump got.  Trump the Super Spreader.
1314738027416215553 2020-10-10 09:22:27 +0800 <hboo711> @marklevinshow Trump had his chance to do a virtual debate and it has been done before.  No good reason for Trump to refuse.
1314737698817662976 2020-10-10 09:21:08 +0800 <hboo711> @SenatorDole @realDonaldTrump Sir JFK and Richard Nixon had a virtual Presidential Debate.  Why is it not ok for Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden to do a virtual debate?  Why did Mr. Trump refuse this.  Asking this question with respect.
1314732069323448321 2020-10-10 08:58:46 +0800 <hboo711> @thehill If he won't take the test, then he needs to stop moving forward with SCOTUS.
1314731190109298689 2020-10-10 08:55:16 +0800 <hboo711> @on1ytrama @Yelp They sure did show it. They could have done what I did was stop when you asked if we read it and I knew I didn't so I read it and it was right and I was wrong for what I said.  They showed much more then just being heartless they are.
1314729547452026881 2020-10-10 08:48:45 +0800 <hboo711> @chuckwoolery @gatewaypundit Who the F@ck cares?  She isn't on the 2020 ballot.  Oh you Trumpies are desperate.  I'm a Republican and now a NEVER Trump Republican as are most of my friends. Please treasure 2016.  2020 won't be a win for you.  #RepublicansForBiden
1314728858906656768 2020-10-10 08:46:01 +0800 <hboo711> @DeadlineWH @DonnaFEdwards @NicolleDWallace He's insane so why should we expect anything to change?  He's a racist, sexist, evil man who lies constantly and calls people names like a 5 year old.  Hate to break it to you Mike P and Trumpy you leaving. Former Republican voting against you and so are my friends.
1314728178011734017 2020-10-10 08:43:18 +0800 <hboo711> @GeorgeTakei I wasn't aware Hilary was on the 2020 Ballot but these Trumpers are getting Desperate.  I hope we get him out and let the scum racist have to go back and hide in their holes.
1314727753737031681 2020-10-10 08:41:37 +0800 <hboo711> @DearAuntCrabby Nobody cares Mike!
1314727460378947584 2020-10-10 08:40:27 +0800 <hboo711> @on1ytrama Very Sad but very true.  My business will never be greater then peoples safety.
1314726897109139457 2020-10-10 08:38:13 +0800 <hboo711> @on1ytrama I agree!  The virus is increasing like crazy in the US right now so it's going to get worse before it get's better.  Let the other two stay in their ignorance.  I decided  to fact check, read and learn better.
1314725940036018178 2020-10-10 08:34:25 +0800 <hboo711> @TheRevrendTruth @on1ytrama @SomebodysF @BellaMax12 @Yelp If I have to close again to prevent COVID I have 0 problems with it.  If it's your family it's one death too many.  COVID is on the rise and I will close if necessary temporarily.
1314725387214245894 2020-10-10 08:32:13 +0800 <hboo711> @SomebodysF @on1ytrama @TheRevrendTruth @BellaMax12 @Yelp If it's one of your family members 1 is too many.  How did a Yelp post turn into this kind of talk.  No one should keep kids in cages.  You must be joking if you think they get better food or medical care when our own citizens don't even get that.
1314724825475280901 2020-10-10 08:29:59 +0800 <hboo711> @TheRevrendTruth @on1ytrama @SomebodysF @BellaMax12 @Yelp I was wrong!!!!Reread it. It requires proof and I'm good with that. My business has  6 cameras video/audio.  If my employees act wrong I will have proof.Quite honestly I have the most diverse employees of any company in my city.  I went on Blast and did not read.  I support this
1314720394138484738 2020-10-10 08:12:22 +0800 <hboo711> @Alyssa_Milano @splcenter Oh let's not forget Nasty.  Never use these words about women.  Young ladies are listening, and hearing.
1314720145462435840 2020-10-10 08:11:23 +0800 <hboo711> @Alyssa_Milano @splcenter So tired of Women being called bitches but to see the President who WE all KNOW has no respect for Women tears me up for our young girls.  She is a Baller, a Winner!  Sexist women and men need to get a life and use better words.  Harris is Amazing!
1314719443008790528 2020-10-10 08:08:36 +0800 <hboo711> @RepsForBiden Yes I keep having to put their profiles on snooze. Just rhetoric, never facts. I can tell they are getting desperate. I can say I see only very few still supporting him now as opposed to 2016.  Many in my mostly R town have turned to R against Trump.
1314716930532573184 2020-10-10 07:58:37 +0800 <hboo711> @bblock29 More like an evil nightmare.
1314716633580154880 2020-10-10 07:57:26 +0800 <hboo711> @Bb3Danielle Me too!  No matter what.

As a business owner of over 5 years already being frustrated with Yelp I just went on blast.  I was wrong and I thank you for making me read it.  After reading it I have to agree with you it is fair and right. My apologies.  Thank you.

1314433950815789056 2020-10-09 13:14:09 +0800 <hboo711> @SistaFannie @W48Wo @girlsreallyrule It's a fantastic idea I agree.  But the way Yelp already works is they call a business and email them around 5 times a day asking for $$$$ and they will make your business look better.  It's extortion.  If Yelp wasn't already a horrible problem it would be great
1314426577413955587 2020-10-09 12:44:51 +0800 <hboo711> @DaVonnesWig Nah F@ck you

No one can say she's not a great player.  She may not play the game you like but the stats don't lie. Go @nicole_franzel  #BB22  https://t.co/mUx1hHBmgY

1314407034536816640 2020-10-09 11:27:12 +0800 <hboo711> @W48Wo @girlsreallyrule I thought I was confirming your point by saying Yelp is already a problem and how they want you to pay money....more details I thought.  Don't know why you are pressed about my comment.  I thought I was supportingit
1314404112864358400 2020-10-09 11:15:35 +0800 <hboo711> @W48Wo @girlsreallyrule It's already abused because they allow anon reviews so your competitors and their friends can knock your business down and then Yelp calls the business every other day wanting money.....sounds like blackmail?  Yelp is a disaster already.  Make reviews on all show their name
1314403672428818432 2020-10-09 11:13:50 +0800 <hboo711> @Hockeyhi765 @girlsreallyrule This is the exact problem with Yelp.  I think doing this is good as long as people have to show their actual names.  The way Yelp works now is they call at least 5 times a week for a business to pay as a sort of blackmail.  Even now people can anon try to kill business anon
1314403160681840640 2020-10-09 11:11:48 +0800 <hboo711> @Yelp Then don't allow anonymos reviews.  They must have real names.
1314403021468643331 2020-10-09 11:11:15 +0800 <hboo711> @BellaMax12 @Yelp Not the case.  Yelp calls business owners constantly for $$ to fix reviews.  Already they allow anon reviews where your competition and their friends can tear your business apart.  I like the sound of this but you have to know how Yelp works
1314402667318345729 2020-10-09 11:09:50 +0800 <hboo711> @Yelp Stop allowing anonymos reviews where competitors and their friends can deface a business.  When you do that then all is fair.  I like this however Yelp is already problematic when it comes to their anon reviews and tries to charge business owners to fix
1314402339399389184 2020-10-09 11:08:32 +0800 <hboo711> @JeremyBeim @girlsreallyrule Business owners have always hated Yelp.  Competitors and their friends can make anon reviews.  Yelp should make you show who you are before they do anything with their reviews.  No more anon reviews

1313179584662327308 2020-10-06 02:09:45 +0800 <hboo711> @Jim_Jordan Is this really your messaging.  I would never ever wish for the President to die.  I'm glad he's recovering and I hope all that get COVID recover.  All we hear is the extreme left and right saying insane things like this.  God Bless all suffereing and who have died from COVID.

1312983309727735808 2020-10-05 13:09:49 +0800 <hboo711> @TMZ @Fox411 Of course he will.  He's already driving around the hospital in a sealed car risking the lives of his Secret Service.  He is making COVID a joke and it's so far from a joke.  She is correct.  He will come out and say...."see it's nothing" While 210,000 Americans will be dead. 😰

1312973635536203782 2020-10-05 12:31:23 +0800 <hboo711> @thehill Reckless and Ridiculous.  Making a joke of COVID.  I always think you cannot hit any lower and then you do.  Know I know four more years of this man will be a threat to all our lives and human decency.
1312847857376997379 2020-10-05 04:11:35 +0800 <hboo711> @richard680news Why isn't there any Police outside of Walter Reed Hopital?  It's loud with supporters getting cars to honk constantly in front of the Hospital.  Where are the Police?  Move these people away from a Hospital.  People are under medical care.  Common sense please.
1312847198951026689 2020-10-05 04:08:58 +0800 <hboo711> Why are they allowing all the people and car honking in front of Walter Reid Hospital?  Trump isn't the only one in there.  These people are causing horribly loud and ridiculous behavior outside of a hospital.  It's disgusting.  Anyone still have any common sense? IT'S A HOSPITAL
1312839890829291520 2020-10-05 03:39:56 +0800 <hboo711> @mmpadellan Trump acting like he is just fine is like spitting in the face of people who have suffered horribly with COVID and who have died.  He has been given privedged health care.  This is all just a dog and pony show that seems fake as hell.
1312836693377126402 2020-10-05 03:27:13 +0800 <hboo711> @Maestro_ZMan We hate his guts because he doesn't serve the people of SC.  He serves Trump.  How dare you push through a SCOTUS!  You liar!  You cheat!  That why Jaime is getting all of our money Lindsey!
1312835885361246211 2020-10-05 03:24:01 +0800 <hboo711> @harrisonjaime @LindseyGrahamSC He's losing because he serves himself and Trump not his people.  Naming a SCOTUS is serving himself and Trump.  We are giving your opponant our money so someone serves the people not Trump.  You lied. You lied. You lied about naming a SCOTUS.
1312835139802722314 2020-10-05 03:21:03 +0800 <hboo711> The majority of "your"  people do not want a SCOTUS named until after the election.  You are supposed to work for us!!!!  You wonder why you're losing and why your opponent is getting so much money?  Stop the SCOTUS process!  Stop serving yourself. #LindseyGrahamIsLosing
1312762292870746113 2020-10-04 22:31:35 +0800 <hboo711> @WalshFreedom Such bull crap.  Trump didn't have to debate Chris Wallace.  Trump behaved like an unhinged child and Chris tried to get him to obey the rules of the agreed to Debate rules.  Not only were the debate rules ignored by Trump but the COVID testing before the debate.  https://t.co/fBihR1L4zW
1312594296458141696 2020-10-04 11:24:01 +0800 <hboo711> @deadskulltweets @TheBigBroTea I like you and always will. I don't blame anyone for not coming back to this game.  People are so nasty on Twitter.
1312590724475559937 2020-10-04 11:09:50 +0800 <hboo711> @Homsher @cnnbrk So this is what happened in the Ohio Suberbs today.  Pround Boys marching in New Albany and a Trump Parade on our busy Interstate 270.  #Ohio Trump obviously didn't get through to them.
1312514189399744513 2020-10-04 06:05:42 +0800 <hboo711> @Poshmarketer @TrumpGirlOH @LeesaBrown @danielgeldredge @GovMikeDeWine @ODOT_Statewide @OHPDPS Completely agree.
1312513762834829312 2020-10-04 06:04:01 +0800 <hboo711> @HenryTContreras Melania don't do the Christmas decorations because we don't care do you.  Seriously we really don't care if the White House has Christmas decorations at all.  We already know its all fake.  Leave it be
1312512772450648067 2020-10-04 06:00:04 +0800 <hboo711> @chipfranklin Yes!
1312512108056047617 2020-10-04 05:57:26 +0800 <hboo711> @DrDenaGrayson Knowing Trump had to be positive at the Debate why isn't Jim Jordan who flew with Trump to the debate not under quarantine?
1312511894914170880 2020-10-04 05:56:35 +0800 <hboo711> @DrDenaGrayson He also didn't take a COVID test prior to the debate per Chris Wallace because they "arrived late".  For Trump to have the symptoms he has the timeline means he had it at the debate.  The Trump family took off their masks and were offered masks and refused to wear them.
1312509954134171648 2020-10-04 05:48:52 +0800 <hboo711> @lindyli @MeidasTouch Lies &amp; Drama. Can't keep story straight. Never on Oxygen, on Oxygen?Never any transparancy.I'm having a hard time believing Trump is sick.He looked good for a change (No orange face) when he walked out to Marine One.  Of course tax payers paid for Marine One when most have driven
1312509243619123200 2020-10-04 05:46:03 +0800 <hboo711> Jim Jordan was on Air Force One with Trump going to the debate.  Jim has had one test and refuses to quarantine.  Don't let him get away with this.  He needs to isolate and keep testing.  #GOPSuperSpreaders

The parade is the Impending force causing the traffic and causing injuries and ambulances not being able to get through.  Who has a parade on an Interstate?  People like you are making me change my mind about Trump
1312504406034661376 2020-10-04 05:26:50 +0800 <hboo711> @TrumpGirlOH @LeesaBrown @danielgeldredge @GovMikeDeWine @ODOT_Statewide @OHPDPS Now you're going to deflect from your statement and my question. You insiuated that  BLM took over Ohio I 270 Blocking traffic, assaulting motorists and destroying vehicles. Never happened in Columubus on I270. I270 is a busy Interstate.  Parades are unnecessay

1312501795357290496 2020-10-04 05:16:27 +0800 <hboo711> @glamelegance @realDonaldTrump Nothing makes sense.  Several different stories coming out from Drs.  No transparancy is making me doubt all of his Trump drama.
1312501250475225088 2020-10-04 05:14:17 +0800 <hboo711> @SenRickScott @FoxNews Seriously?  Mispoke?
1312501033562640384 2020-10-04 05:13:26 +0800 <hboo711> @DrDenaGrayson Jim Jordan was on the plane with Trump to go to the debate.  Why is no one questioning why Jim Jordan refuses to quarantine?

1312494849761787904 2020-10-04 04:48:51 +0800 <hboo711> @LTrotsky21 I raised my son who is 18 to show women respect and to show that respect by opening doors for ladies.  When a woman or a man opens a door for me I see it as respect.  You do not speak for me Dear Katie
1312494203016900610 2020-10-04 04:46:17 +0800 <hboo711> @bilbo_bagns I open doors for people.  Shame on me showing my son how to respect women and open doors for them.  Not because he doesn't think women are capable but because he wants sto show respect Katie

1312389968325734400 2020-10-03 21:52:06 +0800 <hboo711> @ShannonFreshour Jim Jordan flew with Trump to the debate.  Is he in isolation?  Or is he going to be arrogant and spread it as well.  Let's vote him out on Nov. 3rd and vote for Shannon Freshour Ohio!  Haven't we had enough of the Trump enabler Jim Jordan?
1312388752883490819 2020-10-03 21:47:16 +0800 <hboo711> @thehill @AliAdair22 Refusing to wear them and coming too late to the debate there was no time left to test them.  Just disgusting.  I hope no one catches the COVID from the horrific debate.  I don't wish this virus on anyone the thing is their arrogance has risked so many others.

1312150829097345024 2020-10-03 06:01:50 +0800 <hboo711> @JRubinBlogger And why has the helicopter been sitting on the White house lawn FOREVER.

1312147429009969152 2020-10-03 05:48:20 +0800 <hboo711> @sandio5o9 @CatherineHatf19 @mmpadellan Exactly.

1312144220224811011 2020-10-03 05:35:35 +0800 <hboo711> @ScifiSpirit @mmpadellan Search Chris Wallace.  He is on tape stating this
1312142526631952386 2020-10-03 05:28:51 +0800 <hboo711> @kylegriffin1 He has no honor and I'm certain he already had it and he risked everyone lives at the debate.  Trump has NO HONOR. I don't wish he bad but if he's really been tested every day it's a lie and he shouldn't have been able to be on the stage without tests.
1312141978969104384 2020-10-03 05:26:40 +0800 <hboo711> @mmpadellan He didn't get tested for COVID before the debate because he arrived too late.  He risked everyone's lives at the debate.  Disgusting.
1312137528263143426 2020-10-03 05:08:59 +0800 <hboo711> @mmpadellan As with other Presidents there should be full Transparancy regarding Trumps health.  But we still haven't seen his taxes and he lies when he opens his mouth so it's no wonder it's hard for anyone to believe this.
1312136639662092288 2020-10-03 05:05:27 +0800 <hboo711> @JoannaDent1 @DanGheesling I enjoy the game but I'm more focused on politics outside of the house, that's real life

1311851646549479431 2020-10-02 10:13:00 +0800 <hboo711> So the line has been drawn in the sand now that the alliance is over????  Tyler and Christmas vs Cody, Nicole, Enzo and Memphis?  Memphis will play both sides and Enzo won't be happy until all women are out. #BB22
1311849980341223426 2020-10-02 10:06:22 +0800 <hboo711> @OMAROSA Just what he said to Biden.  No one at his rallys or visits does anyone get sick with COVID.  But we all know that Debate was just one bully lie after the other.  I'll never understand why Trump supporters don't see his lying dictator behaviour.
1311849471400120322 2020-10-02 10:04:21 +0800 <hboo711> @_daniellelickey Why women can't work together astounds me. It never happens.
1311849213903409154 2020-10-02 10:03:20 +0800 <hboo711> @DanGheesling People can say what they want about Nicole but she has been sewing seeds of doubt on Dani so she has been working 3 steps ahead.  She may not win comps but her social game is very good.  I don't think she can win even if she makes it to F2 but she is good. Just my opinion
1311844922249695232 2020-10-02 09:46:17 +0800 <hboo711> All POC out and soon all women out.  Dani made the first huge mistake in taking out Ian instead of Tyler and messed the hell out of her and Dani's game. I wanted Christmas and Memphis out so badly. Not mad at Enzo if he made a tie Memphis would have send David out.  #BB22
1311480139616866304 2020-10-01 09:36:46 +0800 <hboo711> @justins_hoh Yes Tyler Nicole is such a comp beast and you don't have the votes to get her out.

She deleted them all after she got out
1311166356952317952 2020-09-30 12:49:54 +0800 <hboo711> @bigbrother_josh 21 and have them understand that even if hey don't think they are racist or sexist look deep and see what bias' they hold.  Also not to ever act like that cast did.  Not obeying Have Nots etc.  21 is the worst I've ever seen and I've watched Season 1 to now all as an adult
1311136528027058176 2020-09-30 10:51:22 +0800 <hboo711> @mariashriver @GStephanopoulos It was. Trump refused to condemn white supremecist and supremecy.  He interupted and talked in circles until he made Chris scold him.  What a joke our country is with Trump leading it.
1311136068289392640 2020-09-30 10:49:33 +0800 <hboo711> @MikeDeWine @realDonaldTrump @cwru @ClevelandClinic Seriously Mike?!?! IT WAS THE WORST JOB EVER! Trump  was embarrasingly disgraceful and created chaos again. How can you say great job?  Trump was a petulant child. Didn't follow the rules, interupting constantly.   I've never seen anything so disgraceful. #PresidentialDebate2020
1311134485665247233 2020-09-30 10:43:15 +0800 <hboo711> Trump made this debate a chaos, shit show. Why couldn't he follow the rules. You hurt the Amerian people by this debate debacle.Make stricter rules for the other Presidential debates so we can hear each one without interupption.

1310781134633152519 2020-09-29 11:19:10 +0800 <hboo711> Don't let a new Justice be appointed before the election. Trump is worried about the election and wants this new Justice nominee because he knows Russia is helping but Americans don't want him.  He needs this justice to throw a questionable election to. #TrumpCrimeFamily

1310627310345891841 2020-09-29 01:07:55 +0800 <hboo711> Hunter Biden isn't running for President.  Now we have Russia and the Trumps desperate attempt to target him.  He is not running for POTUS.  Let's talk about the Trump family and Russia.  Stop deflecting
1310626050339110917 2020-09-29 01:02:55 +0800 <hboo711> @Jim_Jordan Really Jim?  You want to be on the side of Trump against the American People?  You know he is a criminal and you take his side.  Hunter Biden is up for election.  How despeate.

I'm so tired of all that garbage coming out of Cadiasses mouth and her throwing knives.  I hope Wendy rises above this becaue some of her talking points are nasty  #RHOP
1310388040423088128 2020-09-28 09:17:09 +0800 <hboo711> @WendyOsefo Words can break people.  Candace has had such a hateful way of tearing down people forever.  I agree it should never get physical however nasty words to someone can cut deep

1310364138720440321 2020-09-28 07:42:10 +0800 <hboo711> @big_newbie I had to just block his ignorance.
1310363642081271813 2020-09-28 07:40:12 +0800 <hboo711> Anyone who thinks this season is worst than last season....I don't get it?  Last season was a complete joke.  They took away have nots  because of racist Mitchie and his crowd of super racists?  It may not be the best seaon but it's still better then 15 and 21.  JMO #BB22

1309365470399782913 2020-09-25 13:33:49 +0800 <hboo711> @BBWriterCRD It's hair for gosh sakes.  Victor chose to cut it and so what. He's still hot and very down to earth.  This is a game, a social expeirence game.  Why bring Victor into any of this.
1308948492375777280 2020-09-24 09:56:54 +0800 <hboo711> @Lauren_Duclos Yea, I didn't think Nic would lie to Day.  Disappointed.
1308948169087221762 2020-09-24 09:55:37 +0800 <hboo711> @lsparks4 Tyler and David hang out.  Also Nicole told Day she voted Ian out not David which is a lie.  So Day no longer trusts David.

1308461512424673282 2020-09-23 01:41:49 +0800 <hboo711> @Yamiche @PressSec And Trump has lost this Republicans vote.  No more dictator and cheif and everyone who stands around and does NOTHING to stop him.
1308461056101175297 2020-09-23 01:40:00 +0800 <hboo711> @SpeakerPelosi Why can't anyone stop Trump?  Not even at the highest level.  As a US citizen I feel like toast and I'm not going to survive this life with Trump as the leader.  They will cheat again and we will never get rid of him.  Or he will lose and we will still not get rid of him. Doom
1308460496346058752 2020-09-23 01:37:47 +0800 <hboo711> @Yamiche @PressSec The sad thing is there is no decorum or dignity to even start talking about it or working towards it until RBGs funeral is over.  What have people become?  I'm a Republican and it makes me sick to see this insanity and hypocrisy.
1307484715553873920 2020-09-20 09:00:22 +0800 <hboo711> Mephis and Enzo the racist and sexist azzez #BB22
1307430221465911303 2020-09-20 05:23:50 +0800 <hboo711> @ThundaTundra He has given her some reasons to doubt him since the beginning when she talked to him.  He had some sexist issues but she got through to him.  I think when he used the disruptor power and she saw him crying to everyone and lying it made her distrust him. I think she will realize
1307124547469049857 2020-09-19 09:09:11 +0800 <hboo711> @senatemajldr How dare you say her name with such disrespect before even funeral services are arranged.  You are sick and void of any tact, professionalism and you and Trump only serve yourselfs not us
1307124158518693889 2020-09-19 09:07:39 +0800 <hboo711> @senatemajldr You aren't serving any of us.  Only yourself and Trump.
1307123676286988293 2020-09-19 09:05:44 +0800 <hboo711> @CNNPolitics She isn't in the grave and you are talking about this you nasty maggot.  God Bless RBG.  No justice should be voted on with less then 6 weeks from the election.  You stopped Obama you crusty little dictator.  You work for us but obviously you forgot that.

1307096801820979201 2020-09-19 07:18:56 +0800 <hboo711> @KingsXBarElPaso I think it's the jury house.  The first person Ian is a BB Legend.  It just makes sense with COVID not to send the jury outside of the sound stage.  Only  a theory

1307091127468806145 2020-09-19 06:56:24 +0800 <hboo711> @angelofmusic27 We fight racism and it's important to fight against it.  What is still ok with so many people is sexism.  Kemi and Day saw that in David and that's why they distrust David.
1307090577154998272 2020-09-19 06:54:12 +0800 <hboo711> @KatBBFIN Day and Kemi knows David can act sexist.  Sexism is an issue with Black and White Men.

1307089537873719296 2020-09-19 06:50:05 +0800 <hboo711> I do hope Day and David work things out.  But so many wonder why Kemi and Day distrust him.  It's because he is sexist.  #BB22

All week starting on Sunday the feeds were down for hours and hours.  All week like every few minutes they cut the feeds.  Such Bullsheet.
1306797377773330432 2020-09-18 11:29:08 +0800 <hboo711> Big Brother can shove their feeds up their arses.  We shouldn't have to wait for PT, we have to stay up so much later on ET.  Enough is Enough.  FU #BB22

1306766477966614531 2020-09-18 09:26:21 +0800 <hboo711> @melbrown00 She knew that she will go soon after Ian.  She just lost the game.  But she wouldn't have won against Ian

1306765460600487937 2020-09-18 09:22:18 +0800 <hboo711> @tmdangel Could be. Safe way to keep the COVID issue from moving out and the jurors catching it on the way or at the new place.  Could be
1306764915022200832 2020-09-18 09:20:08 +0800 <hboo711> @gllbertss I don't believe we will ever see blantant racist MICHIE on BB for a long time if ever.
1306764639934570499 2020-09-18 09:19:03 +0800 <hboo711> @itskasual She really tried like crazy this week to save him.  Last night she was told she would be the next target.
1306764306650890241 2020-09-18 09:17:43 +0800 <hboo711> @ellegee I would have made that fake b leat me go. That was so aggressive and nasty
1306763360806068225 2020-09-18 09:13:58 +0800 <hboo711> @Itisall_aboutme She isn't nearly as problematic as Memphis and Enzo who are both racist and sexist as hell.  It will now be all POC and women to go.  No need to worry about Nicole they will all get her out.
1306762910904000513 2020-09-18 09:12:11 +0800 <hboo711> @bbstopthat I agree.  It would have to be someone the majority of us like and entertaining.  I can't think of anyone?
1306762427208470535 2020-09-18 09:10:15 +0800 <hboo711> It has to be someone pretty entertaining to be the BB neighbor.  Liven things up here. #BB22

1306761314451312640 2020-09-18 09:05:50 +0800 <hboo711> There is no reason that paying feedsters can't watch the comp.  Edit Edit really isn't Big Brother.   #BB22

All I know is my father was barely around when I was growing up and I was very angry which could be like a brat.  It took me until 30 to let go of the anger which was just heartbreak
1306414010431082497 2020-09-17 10:05:46 +0800 <hboo711> @Bb20bay They are always down.  I've watched feeds since the begining, this the the worst amount of feed cuts I've ever seen.  It's awful
1306413550102024192 2020-09-17 10:03:56 +0800 <hboo711> @robbedqueeen I had to stop on watching them after the hours and hours of blocked feeds on Sunday and the every 2 minutes feeds cut on Monday and Tuesday.  The music itself is torture
1306412939063197698 2020-09-17 10:01:31 +0800 <hboo711> @PaulParmar1 It also get's me that he is a blatant racist and sexist and always cracking jokes about Ian to Memphis.  But we don't hear much about that.

I will never know what it's like to be in a house that long wihtout anyone you truly know or trust.  They will need to take responsibiliy for their actions and grow (I hope) but I won't hate

Mephis was acting out the little boy from The shining and bending his finger and talking in a weird voice saying redrum.  She never directly made fun of Ian but I agree she shouldn't have laughed.
1306304344644636673 2020-09-17 02:50:00 +0800 <hboo711> @StinaMonique @Nona_BB19 @_MindTeaz @AdamAndEvel @girlsmeg It is sad but sadly it's the same in the world.  But I don't see anyone giving a crap that people make fun of me being in a wheelchair.  They need to learn and hopefully grow from their behavior but calling them names, death threats and ruining thier business makes fans the same
1306268524931932160 2020-09-17 00:27:40 +0800 <hboo711> @Bitchesimback3 I find it weird that peole tun off thier comments.

1306258256373964800 2020-09-16 23:46:52 +0800 <hboo711> @Bitchesimback3 I would never.  But I don't think it's right for people to hound thema and try to destroy thier lives.
1306258035682226177 2020-09-16 23:45:59 +0800 <hboo711> @JokersBBUpdates I wish we got feeds 24/7.  They are blocking the feeds this year and trying to edit them.  Senseless

1306208230897577984 2020-09-16 20:28:05 +0800 <hboo711> @0hhcalamity She would need to start with Mephis and Enzo.  These two men have been the biggest racist, sexist and ableist on the show but Twitter is only insterested in attacking women.
1306207852395147264 2020-09-16 20:26:34 +0800 <hboo711> @IsraQM She feels deep inside that the white privleged bros are about to target all the women out.  All 4 white bros got off scott free on twitter while you all attacked the women.  I guess attacking women is still ok.
1306207188998909954 2020-09-16 20:23:56 +0800 <hboo711> @Brian_Scally And people wonder why we are getting so many feeds cut.  The feeds will come to an end because people are ruining HGs lives.  Bashing Nicole all season and letting Memphis and Enzo go unscathed when they are the most racist, sexist and ablest in the house. Attacking women 🙄
1306206530677739521 2020-09-16 20:21:19 +0800 <hboo711> @Nona_BB19 @_MindTeaz @StinaMonique @AdamAndEvel @girlsmeg Yea I agree that the feeds are going to come to an end because how the Twitter community takes things from the live feeds, some out of context and trys to ruin peoples lives.  It's sad really
1306050115057090561 2020-09-16 09:59:47 +0800 <hboo711> @Kate_Chastain   Hannah did apologize in her way by going to Kickos bunk. She can give ideas but the chef has to execute the high level of the idea.  Did you not see how upset she was about it? Yes, she should have used her words better but she loved him. Harsh u r #BelowDeckMed
1305971138187669504 2020-09-16 04:45:57 +0800 <hboo711> @levsin Average every 2 minutes. It sucks.  The feeds have been such a problem this year.
1305970758259269637 2020-09-16 04:44:27 +0800 <hboo711> Thanks dumb azz wall yellers for ruining our feeds. #BB22
1305970551773511680 2020-09-16 04:43:37 +0800 <hboo711> @hashtagrealitea So that's why we keep getting feeds cut every 2 minutes.  Dumb azzes
1305965642286276608 2020-09-16 04:24:07 +0800 <hboo711> @laurenofcarsley Great pay for 3 months or less
1305965257349881856 2020-09-16 04:22:35 +0800 <hboo711> @Bb20Nikki @CBSBigBrother It's the worst season ever for the constant every 2 minute feeds cut and the hours at time feed cuts.  And the music is like being waterboarded.  They need to stop
1305964567500128257 2020-09-16 04:19:51 +0800 <hboo711> @ahung @BB22LiveFeeds @TweetChik YES. We know they are editing the feeds and that's not how it's supposed to be.  I've never seen such a bad feeds season
1305964281251405825 2020-09-16 04:18:42 +0800 <hboo711> @CBSBigBrother Can the feeds stop getting killed every few minutes?  This is the worst season for feed cuts over nothing.  change the camera not cut feeds.  Dang I've had enough of this garbage.
1305963792765980673 2020-09-16 04:16:46 +0800 <hboo711> @IsraQM They are cutting the feeds over every single thing.
1305963619235098624 2020-09-16 04:16:05 +0800 <hboo711> @BB22LiveFeeds @TweetChik @ahung This is happening way to much.  Change the camera view etc.  Still feeds cutting constantly or for hours at a time is just over for me.
1305961059094867970 2020-09-16 04:05:54 +0800 <hboo711> @BrandonGHOSTED I don't like her but what would you call racist Memphis and Enzo?
1305960800901910530 2020-09-16 04:04:53 +0800 <hboo711> @Feeds_Bot The feed cuts this year are over the top too much
1305956314741444608 2020-09-16 03:47:03 +0800 <hboo711> @InTheNameofFilm @BB_Updates No human is a waste of space.  4 white men have been the most problematic (racist, sexist and ableist) in  that house but you sexist arse's just want to one again tear down women.  The last thing to be ok in this world is to tear women down.  disgusting
1305955705611001857 2020-09-16 03:44:38 +0800 <hboo711> @CBSBigBrother @CBSBigBrotherLF You are being way to extreme cutting the feeds. Why? It's too much and it's not a real "as advertised" 24/7 feeds, I do understand some have to be cut but it's been way to much these past 3 weeks.
1305954482417795073 2020-09-16 03:39:46 +0800 <hboo711> @ohmymariahhh Ian is only saying that in hopes to not get evicted (I hope)  I've never heard him speak bad about Day
1305954226691022850 2020-09-16 03:38:45 +0800 <hboo711> @ohmymariahhh Cannot believe she didn't put up Enzo, Memphis or Cody.  They will eliminate her especially Enzo and Memphis.  Dani needs to get Tyler out.  Start chopping up the white privleged men.  JMO
1305953703174823936 2020-09-16 03:36:40 +0800 <hboo711> @BB22LiveFeeds Day was right in using the veto.  No Dani you need to know better then to keep Tyler.
1305953448928653312 2020-09-16 03:35:40 +0800 <hboo711> @takeaseat9 Was totally with you until you called a woman out of her name.  Sexist.  It's ok that Memphis and Enzo are the biggest racist, sexist and ableist but no the women get called out of their name.  gross
1305952570976940032 2020-09-16 03:32:11 +0800 <hboo711> @Alwayscomplain2 Following one and one follow.  Mephis and Enzo have been the most racist, sexist and ableist in the entire house.  I want Day to win but sick of the sexist bull crap
1305950103971278849 2020-09-16 03:22:22 +0800 <hboo711> @juuustjoey Yea.  I totally agreed with your tweet except calling Nicole a name.
1305938133645766656 2020-09-16 02:34:48 +0800 <hboo711> @BBCaltoru No because we automatically lose 6 to 9 hours of feeds
1305937947745824774 2020-09-16 02:34:04 +0800 <hboo711> They are going to play block the feeds all day.  So sick of it #BB22
1305931197625913345 2020-09-16 02:07:15 +0800 <hboo711> @juuustjoey I love Day and want to see her win.  You do see how awful the white men are right?  Memphis, Enzo, being the worst racists and sexists.  But let's keep calling the women out of their name.  Makes you no better.
1305930440751173635 2020-09-16 02:04:14 +0800 <hboo711> @its_kayli_b Memphis has been dragging Ian since day one.  It's disgusting
1305930163021131783 2020-09-16 02:03:08 +0800 <hboo711> @McKenzie_JP Mephis and Enzo are the same person.  The most racist and sexist in the house and they hate Ian.  They have been doing this since the beginning but people would rather bash the POC and the women.
1305929781205258240 2020-09-16 02:01:37 +0800 <hboo711> @VeeVaehh @BB_Updates He's been doing it since week one.
1305929713085550593 2020-09-16 02:01:21 +0800 <hboo711> @BB_Updates I can't stand Mephis and Enzo.  The most racist, sexist, ableistic men in the house but everyone wants to beat the hell out of the women. Obviously Black/White women and Ian come in last to both of them.
1305929320066617346 2020-09-16 01:59:47 +0800 <hboo711> @AdamAndEvel Enzo has issues with women.  Not that I'm a fan of Christmas but I'm tired of twitter not seeing that Memphis and Enzo are the most racist, sexist and ableistic people in the house.
1305928942981976064 2020-09-16 01:58:17 +0800 <hboo711> @cat_bigbrother The two problematic twins.  Both racist, sexist.
1305928600009531392 2020-09-16 01:56:55 +0800 <hboo711> @BB_Updates Same Enzo from his season.  He will pick 3 white bros
1305856985280196609 2020-09-15 21:12:21 +0800 <hboo711> @Tooms_BB Enzo is making sure the two groups shoot at each other and not at him.  Enzo is funny but he is also a racist and a sexist.
1305856291659747332 2020-09-15 21:09:36 +0800 <hboo711> @vblack505 I don't know.  Victor is a snack.  I would never play around on him.  I don't think she would ever.
1305652559131168770 2020-09-15 07:40:02 +0800 <hboo711> F@ck the feeds.  I'm done. #BB22
1305651839506014210 2020-09-15 07:37:11 +0800 <hboo711> There has been too many feed cuts and too many cuts for hours and hours.  I've paid for life feeds since the day they started and now I'm going to cancel them.  No reason to have cut them off all afternoon and night last night.  It's happening too much #BB22
1305642291210661890 2020-09-15 06:59:14 +0800 <hboo711> @cherryiotus Ahead of her time.  She spoke on it.
1305591943049752578 2020-09-15 03:39:10 +0800 <hboo711> Day had to use the Veto.  It was a good game play.  Go Day! #BB22
1305591765022527489 2020-09-15 03:38:28 +0800 <hboo711> If BB twitter to the point of sending in wall yellers, death treats etc. we would not be losing so much of the feeds.  This has become the worse season for feed cuts.  Just cheer for your fav and bring up issues without calling nastly names etc.  #BB22
1305583745811075072 2020-09-15 03:06:36 +0800 <hboo711> @Brian_Scally Dani made the worst move by not targeting the white bruhs.  The women better fight for comp wins because the privleged  bruhs will be throwing them out ASAP
1305582565559078913 2020-09-15 03:01:54 +0800 <hboo711> @mainkpopgirl A twat.  Jesus you are stupid.
1305581757018918913 2020-09-15 02:58:42 +0800 <hboo711> @lovingjosie You are so out of the loop.  Jut going for the popular lets hate Nicole.  Old song and you don't know the whole story.  She's not perfect but hshe did not laugh at Ian she laughed at Memphis but you do you
1305377659120234496 2020-09-14 13:27:41 +0800 <hboo711> I will be voting for @ShannonFreshour for District 4 in Ohio.  We need to let Jim Jordan go.  He is not for us he is only to enable Trump and himself.  He doesn't care about us.  Vote for Shannon please
1305376749832867842 2020-09-14 13:24:04 +0800 <hboo711> @ShannonFreshour I'm voting for you!
1305375453444628480 2020-09-14 13:18:55 +0800 <hboo711> @RealityRobbed Nic has always said she will never put up Day or Ian  or vote against either one of them.   Until this week Dani wasn't on board with Nic on that but she is now for Day only.
1305370527985532933 2020-09-14 12:59:21 +0800 <hboo711> @thechallengeob1 Memphis and Enzo are nasty as hell when it comes to Ian
1305370262846799872 2020-09-14 12:58:17 +0800 <hboo711> @IsraQM No excuse for that creep
1305362569771786241 2020-09-14 12:27:43 +0800 <hboo711> @stardazed_18 🙏❤️
1305362461000896512 2020-09-14 12:27:17 +0800 <hboo711> @iammrssamuels I think everywhere you stay out of people's marriages but on all Housewives they seem to shout awful things out to keep getting that check.  I would never play with someones marriage even if I didn't like the person.  Never play with marriages or kids.
1305360905035710467 2020-09-14 12:21:06 +0800 <hboo711> @CBSBigBrother Memphis or Enzo.
1305360716463996928 2020-09-14 12:20:21 +0800 <hboo711> @stardazed_18 Thanks so much!  These fires are sad but I'm glad the HGs are safe.
1305358827844403200 2020-09-14 12:12:51 +0800 <hboo711> @ChannelOneiTV Yes it does thank you.  They are not in the zone.  Really sad about all the fires though.
1305357249003560961 2020-09-14 12:06:35 +0800 <hboo711> Where is the BB house close to.  Just checked the California wilfire map and there is an evactuation order  in parts of LA.  I'm not in Cali.  Anyone from Cali know where the BB house is in relation to the house? #bb22
1305352032883220480 2020-09-14 11:45:51 +0800 <hboo711> @BigBrotherBBJ No
1305351560780828672 2020-09-14 11:43:59 +0800 <hboo711> @technogaijin @causeway_chaos Yes and I want him out so bad
1305351353645043712 2020-09-14 11:43:09 +0800 <hboo711> @thearashow I won't pick any group with Enzo or Memphis in it
1305351187693264896 2020-09-14 11:42:30 +0800 <hboo711> @fenrisbeaumont Nicole has said over and over to Dani she will never put day up or vote her out.  Dani needs to own her own bias'
1305350796918362113 2020-09-14 11:40:56 +0800 <hboo711> @ghostklay @BabyGee444 @lilsebastianxx Dani is only saying it now because Nicole told her that she will never put Day on the block and never vote her out so now Dani is singing a different tune.  All the while the 4 white dudes are planning to get Dani, Nicole, Day and Christmas out.
1305348542450589696 2020-09-14 11:31:59 +0800 <hboo711> @Destiny_w101 I know they usually do.  I think Production may be trying to suprise them but I could be way off.  I'm for sure just guessing
1305348234433499136 2020-09-14 11:30:45 +0800 <hboo711> My sleep schedule is so f@cked up from the feed watching every year but I love it.  Thank goodness I'm self employed. But I have a child and he doesn't understand why I'm so tired but I can't admit to it.  lol   #bb22
1305347496227622912 2020-09-14 11:27:49 +0800 <hboo711> @ADarkenedBliss Dani and Nic need to wake up.  Cody dropped because he wanted the girls to get their hands bloody.  He's a douche.  The girls need to pivot and align with everyone agains the 4 white privleged men
1305346751356964865 2020-09-14 11:24:52 +0800 <hboo711> @sherriberri66 @UnfilteredFeeds Sadly those jerks will go after her no matter what.  Dani and Nicole should trust those 4 white butt heads either.
1305346472154726401 2020-09-14 11:23:45 +0800 <hboo711> @JustCallzMeKiri Probably not.  All the white dutes are going to evict all the women. The women should be gunning or the 4 white jerks  I guess only in my dreams
1305345782271352832 2020-09-14 11:21:01 +0800 <hboo711> @VoniVodka @CBSBigBrother They are doing the veto a day earlier I think because we hav a Tuesday episode this week instead of Wednesday.
1305345613295497216 2020-09-14 11:20:21 +0800 <hboo711> @Destiny_w101 Doing the veto a night early because there is a Tuesday episode instead of Wednesday.  The house didn't know so I'm sure they were shocked too.
1305344768243904513 2020-09-14 11:16:59 +0800 <hboo711> @sherriberri66 @UnfilteredFeeds I heard everyone talking on the feeds that 12 minutes it had to be thrown.  Then problematic Enzo kept saying she didn't deserve the veto.  He a crap person.
1305344250129846276 2020-09-14 11:14:56 +0800 <hboo711> @winniiew I love Day and I want her to win but it wasn't good acting.  She fell so early they all know she threw it.
1305343854435020801 2020-09-14 11:13:21 +0800 <hboo711> @WilliamJHammon Sexist jerk
1305343691511476225 2020-09-14 11:12:42 +0800 <hboo711> The house thought the veto would be tomorrow but it was moved to tonight because of the Tuesday episode.  Day wanted to talk to Dani first so I'm sure this was a suprise to all the HGs tonight.  Must all be scrambling. #bb22
1305343356185313282 2020-09-14 11:11:22 +0800 <hboo711> @imlaurax Look at you trying to be hateful popular
1305343246193881088 2020-09-14 11:10:56 +0800 <hboo711> @JustCallzMeKiri It is because she knows Tyler talked to Bay and Day about getting her out after Bay and Day told Dani.  So yes, she doesn't trust him.
1305342767804092417 2020-09-14 11:09:02 +0800 <hboo711> @TownChill123 Day knows that Christmas has one of the powers.  Yes she wants Christmas out but she understands why Dani won't put her up.
1305303963114315778 2020-09-14 08:34:50 +0800 <hboo711> @StabiH Told Bay and Day he wanted Dani out and they told her
1305302073383309313 2020-09-14 08:27:20 +0800 <hboo711> @FAN77BB I love Day and want her to win but I can't be ok about anyone that throws an HOH.  It was way too obvious
1305300809970843648 2020-09-14 08:22:19 +0800 <hboo711> Dani and Nic Cody is not your ally at all.  Pivot and put Memphis, Enzo or better yet Cody up. #bb22
1305299741731885056 2020-09-14 08:18:04 +0800 <hboo711> @UnfilteredFeeds I'm just not happy about it.  I love her and want to see her win but don't throw HOH comps when you have been targeted.  Now she's gonna put a target on herself because all know she dropped on purpose.  Ughhhhh
1305299025080582144 2020-09-14 08:15:13 +0800 <hboo711> @badley67 Makes no sense right?  I love Day but don't throw and HOH ever.
1305298343959109632 2020-09-14 08:12:31 +0800 <hboo711> @BusyBlu I get annoyed by people hating just to hate
1305298181513764864 2020-09-14 08:11:52 +0800 <hboo711> I don't understand why Day fell of the wall on purpose.  You can't throw the HOH.  She knows so many are coming for her with no good reason.  I'm glad she won the veto but don't throw an HOH.  #bb22
1305247618918907907 2020-09-14 04:50:57 +0800 <hboo711> Dani you talk to Enzo.  He will put you up.  I want him up so bad. #bb22
1305230437678276610 2020-09-14 03:42:41 +0800 <hboo711> No Dani Day should use the veto as much as I don't want Ian up.  Day knows there is 6 people in an alliance and she will use it.  Cody is lying he knows Tyler, Memphis and Enzo are coming for all three of you ladies.  #bb22
1305228965137833989 2020-09-14 03:36:49 +0800 <hboo711> So upset that Cody hasn't told Dani and Nic that Memphis and Enzo has talked about coming after you both.  #bb22
1305228799496380417 2020-09-14 03:36:10 +0800 <hboo711> Dani and Nicole Tyler, Mephis and Enzo are all coming after you.  Cody should have told you.  You are crazy not to put up Memphis or Enzo.  You need to pivot now.   #bb22
1305217175280594946 2020-09-14 02:49:59 +0800 <hboo711> @BigBrother_2020 Yes please
1305214380175511556 2020-09-14 02:38:52 +0800 <hboo711> Dani don't nominate Ian.  Nominate Mempis or Enzo.  They will put you on the block.  Ughhhh  I don't want to see Ian on the block #bb22
1305214122271834113 2020-09-14 02:37:51 +0800 <hboo711> Nicole is so upset about the thought of Ian going on the block.  I am too.  #bb22
1305212724067131392 2020-09-14 02:32:17 +0800 <hboo711> @HaniLee1 No one should be sending death threats to HGs.  I hope everyone who does gets caught.
1305212255097819141 2020-09-14 02:30:25 +0800 <hboo711> @carab1985 It's disgusting.
1305048179382026242 2020-09-13 15:38:27 +0800 <hboo711> @1998hhamdim Nicole has said at the very least 5 times she will never put Day up or vote to evict Day.  Mephis and Enzo always have Days name in thier mouth.
1305044077843537920 2020-09-13 15:22:09 +0800 <hboo711> @Jordanvaughnsc1 He deserves it.  He is the one that has been making fun of Ian every week as well as being agressive with David.
1305043597880893441 2020-09-13 15:20:14 +0800 <hboo711> @laurenjcoates Mephis being ejected would be wonderful

1304949682070843394 2020-09-13 09:07:03 +0800 <hboo711> @KikiBump @casperprincess9 @hohweek I agree.  Call out the racist, agressive, and ableist behavior but don't take it so far as to hurt thier life outside of the game.  People that do that are just as bad as the issues on the live feeds.
1304949071631781888 2020-09-13 09:04:38 +0800 <hboo711> @casperprincess9 @KikiBump @hohweek I'm not saying ruin someones personal life  I've just been watching the feeds and have heard the most vile things come out of Memphis and Enzo's mouth.
1304948795915075584 2020-09-13 09:03:32 +0800 <hboo711> @casperprincess9 @KikiBump @hohweek I'm just in 100% agreement with Taran. Nic get's dragged constantly on Twitter and the biggest nasty people are Memhis, Enzo and Christmas and I wasn't seeing much said about thier horrilbe behavior.
1304947973168787458 2020-09-13 09:00:16 +0800 <hboo711> @Cassie_Sherer @notyourmothers It was.  It wasn't the ususal hate it was funny.  👍
1304947564832264192 2020-09-13 08:58:38 +0800 <hboo711> @j_m_rayfeeee She laughed which is not I agree with is unacceptable but she did not enocourage the bahavior.  Yes she is wrong for lauging.  Buy Memphis, Dani, and Enzo have been racist and albeist every week and I want to make sure they are in this discussion as well. They are far worse.
1304919701550772224 2020-09-13 07:07:55 +0800 <hboo711> Use it Day.  Dani just told you everything you need to know that she is in an alliance with Enzo.  #bb22
1304893790516281345 2020-09-13 05:24:58 +0800 <hboo711> @girlsmeg You can't be serious!!!!!  Memphis and Thanksgiving are azzholes.  Memphis has been making fun of Ian since week one over and over.  Now Thanksgiving is joining in the mocking.  What dumb azzes.
1304892971637190656 2020-09-13 05:21:42 +0800 <hboo711> @Cassie_Sherer @notyourmothers I didn't make fun of anyones hair not even Justin Timberlakes????  I not a twitter stan of anyone.  Just thought it was funny to make fun of someones hair.
1304866853269970951 2020-09-13 03:37:55 +0800 <hboo711> @hizstry I would love to see Enzo and/or Mephis go.
1304866756998180865 2020-09-13 03:37:32 +0800 <hboo711> @ultbyusoo As well as he has made fun of Ian every single week.
1304866471256915968 2020-09-13 03:36:24 +0800 <hboo711> @Corner2016 Smart, beautiful and funny.  The whole package
1304866234803130368 2020-09-13 03:35:28 +0800 <hboo711> @QueenLauregui She's saying the same thing to Nic that Nic told her.  So I'm glad both of them are on the same page as each other.  But we need to get out Mephis, Enzo, to make sure they don't get put up.
1304865813300744192 2020-09-13 03:33:47 +0800 <hboo711> @bb22tears That's weird I don't get that.  That is weird
1304865594626519046 2020-09-13 03:32:55 +0800 <hboo711> @lalalalickit At this point he is under contract and will be charged alot of money if he goes home instead of jury.
1304859307486347270 2020-09-13 03:07:56 +0800 <hboo711> @KikiBump @hohweek 100%  Taran is so right
1304858609977880582 2020-09-13 03:05:10 +0800 <hboo711> @TEAMTYLER9 It varies.  But it will be today.  A few are at night

1304857213668859911 2020-09-13 02:59:37 +0800 <hboo711> @bbkaboodles @_arabella77 @JanellePierzina @karavferguson I agree with you there!
1304856722700464133 2020-09-13 02:57:40 +0800 <hboo711> @BCelebcouples I agree with calling their behavior out but that problem that twitter has taken it so far with death threats, business threats, nasty names is just equal to thier negative behavior.  I hope they learn better and do better.
1304856421016666112 2020-09-13 02:56:28 +0800 <hboo711> @BCelebcouples It isn't as bad as last year.  But in this day and age when we are better educated about BLM and being racist and biased I don't know how live feeds can keep going when twitter is raging.  These things happen on many other reality shows but we only see the edits.
1304855896439377920 2020-09-13 02:54:23 +0800 <hboo711> @bbkaboodles @_arabella77 @JanellePierzina @karavferguson Yes they talked to Memphis, Dani and Nic.  Nic seems to be the only one taking the messge in and doing better.  Memphis is still mocking David and being aggressive with him.
1304855545229324290 2020-09-13 02:52:59 +0800 <hboo711> @bbkaboodles @_arabella77 @JanellePierzina @karavferguson She did not "mock" Ian. Memphis was making fun of Ian and imitating the little boy on the Shining bending his finger and saying redrum.  Memphis has made fun of Ian since week one.  It's no excuse for Nic to laugh but just setting the stage correctly.  Memhis and Enzo are awful
1304854135876071435 2020-09-13 02:47:23 +0800 <hboo711> @DocNaismith Memphis, Enzo and Christmas and Dani are the worst. Nic has made sure that Ian or Day has not gone on the block.  Nic did laugh AT Memphis when he was mimicking the boy on the Shining bending his finger and saying redrum.Other then that she has done nothing to mock or make fun of
1304853471095664641 2020-09-13 02:44:45 +0800 <hboo711> @idfkmack I've known him and Enzo are for weeks now.  I'm glad that other tweeters are figuring him out.  They are both racist, sexist and ableists.  I want both of them to go so very bad.
1304853015011176453 2020-09-13 02:42:56 +0800 <hboo711> @Cassie_Sherer @notyourmothers A hair attack?  Like he can help that he has curly hair.  OMG hilarious and silly attack on someone hair.  https://t.co/CGV7x5XQn0
1304837352213356550 2020-09-13 01:40:42 +0800 <hboo711> @j_m_rayfeeee 100% true.  He is the one who has been racist and ableist week after week.  Finally some on Twitter are finally seeing who they are.  Nic never mocked Ian, she did laugh at Memphis and she was talked to and has changed.  Memphis was talked to and he's still doing it.
1304836589521113088 2020-09-13 01:37:40 +0800 <hboo711> @imissbb10 I wish Memphis and Enzo leave before David.  They are so nasty.
1304836465478729728 2020-09-13 01:37:10 +0800 <hboo711> @greencheekconur @Tooms_BB Memphis and Enzo are the instigators and they were talked to as well.  They don't care and aren't changing their behavior.  At least Nic took the warning and it made her aware.
1304835846298796035 2020-09-13 01:34:43 +0800 <hboo711> @SeraphinaRain They told Memphis and Enzo too but they don't care at all.  Both of those men are so racist and ableist over the top of everyone else.  At least Nicole took the warning to heart.
1304834377436758017 2020-09-13 01:28:52 +0800 <hboo711> @BreakdownBig He is a messy man and so is Memphis
1304833958866280449 2020-09-13 01:27:13 +0800 <hboo711> @Bigbrotherfanog Enzo has no room to talk.  His last season he never won an HOH.  He's just racist
1304833635003109377 2020-09-13 01:25:55 +0800 <hboo711> @alexmuselove Memhis and Enzo are horribly racist.
1304833213869756419 2020-09-13 01:24:15 +0800 <hboo711> @tinapearls Enzo and Mephis are the two straigt up racists.  I was wondering why it took so long for twitter to see it.  I'm so over Enzo YO YO YO f@ck that, this, He needs to go right with Memphis
1304773597014224897 2020-09-12 21:27:21 +0800 <hboo711> @LolaKent17 She didn't mock anyone.  She laughed at Memphis doing an imitation of the Shining where the little boy moves his finger and say redrum.  Yes she will learn and was talked to.  She taking it seriously while Memphis and Enzo get off scott free and they are the one targeting him
1304773035921113090 2020-09-12 21:25:07 +0800 <hboo711> @SeraphinaRain Memphis and Enzo the two worst were warned too but they don't care.  They are th two worst racist, sexist and ableist in the house.
1304699697953681408 2020-09-12 16:33:42 +0800 <hboo711> @Tooms_BB Finally they are figuring out he's problematic as hell.  He and Mephis are racist, sexist and ableistic.  And Enzo please wash your nasty hands after you go to the bathroom.  So gross and tired of your Yo yo you F@ck this, that etc.
1304695709216780288 2020-09-12 16:17:51 +0800 <hboo711> @usweekly Not a good investigation by these companies at all.  Cancel culture without a good investigation is ridiculous.  She did not mock Ian a man name Memphis did.
1304514331934064645 2020-09-12 04:17:08 +0800 <hboo711> @thotbrother Mephis talks garbage about Ian weekly if not more.  Memphis need to go.  Enzo too
1304512548809723907 2020-09-12 04:10:02 +0800 <hboo711> @shxxxmu At least she's apologizing.  Two of the worst at being racist, sexist and making fun of Ian (Memphis and Ian) don't give a sheet and make no apologies for their ugly behavior
1304511829134188544 2020-09-12 04:07:11 +0800 <hboo711> @ghostklay Dani isn't goint to put Day on the block.  It still upsets me she wants to put the two black men up.  She needs to think and get out Memphis and Enzo.  They are so toxic
1304511424417464321 2020-09-12 04:05:34 +0800 <hboo711> @bbfiIter He and Memphis both are racists, sexists and will always target women.  I want them both out.
1304511008745099266 2020-09-12 04:03:55 +0800 <hboo711> @AdrienneAurora @BPamcakes128 YES.  He and Memphis are the most racist and sexist and have said more things about Ian then anyone.  I really wish they would go.
1304510741425381380 2020-09-12 04:02:52 +0800 <hboo711> @BPamcakes128 You are 100% right.
1304510191141036032 2020-09-12 04:00:40 +0800 <hboo711> @JasmineLeeC And is racist and sexist.  He is so gross he never washes his hands after going to the bathroom.
1304509610053828609 2020-09-12 03:58:22 +0800 <hboo711> @TheOviKabir Yes please.  Memphis and Enzo are the worst.
1304509277520965637 2020-09-12 03:57:03 +0800 <hboo711> @otevspov No she isn't. But Memphis and Enzo who have been racist, microagressive, and ableist nearly every week or more in the house not caring is worse.  They do not care and they are the worst.
1304508231864197120 2020-09-12 03:52:53 +0800 <hboo711> @bb_fiend I'd love to see Memphis and Enzo up.  Dani why don't you see this.  UGH
1304507898568085504 2020-09-12 03:51:34 +0800 <hboo711> @ghostklay Enzo and Mephis are racist and say nasty things about Ian constatly!  Thank for calling it out!  They are the worst.
1304506504763105281 2020-09-12 03:46:01 +0800 <hboo711> @melbrown00 What gets me is Enzo and Memphis are honestly racist, ableistic and sexist but no one calls them out on twitter for it.  Thank you for pointing out his stupid garbage.  I'm thankful Day is safe this week but I want Memphis and Enzo out so badly.
1304505994211463168 2020-09-12 03:44:00 +0800 <hboo711> @realityrxbert But I'm all for Day staying!!!
1304505891891314690 2020-09-12 03:43:35 +0800 <hboo711> @realityrxbert Dr. Will doesn't hold the record.  Paul did but I think Nicole just took the record.
1304505372045127680 2020-09-12 03:41:31 +0800 <hboo711> @bbkaboodles Owning it doesn't excuse his constant nastiness towards Ian.  He didn't just say things that time he has said nasty things about Ian many time since it started.  I'm not excusing Nic an Dani but he is the only one ripping on Ian
1304504672632418305 2020-09-12 03:38:45 +0800 <hboo711> @darrell90210 @TulaneTerry He's already on the show.  He and Enzo both are severly microaggressive, ableists and sexist.  Memphis and Enzo suck but they get a free pass.
1304504036406833152 2020-09-12 03:36:13 +0800 <hboo711> @drpuella It's not just you I see it too.  Memphis says something nasty about Ian at the least every week an it horrible.  But they just drag the girls. It's so ridiculous that not more people have an issue with Memphis and Enzo as well.
1304503394313396224 2020-09-12 03:33:40 +0800 <hboo711> @bbkaboodles Yea she messed up.  But I don't see hardly anyone dragging Memphis who has made horrible comments about Ian the entire time of this season.  He is horrible in what he says about him.
1304502862911766532 2020-09-12 03:31:33 +0800 <hboo711> @darrell90210 @TulaneTerry Yea she laughed and she learned and will change.  Just one question why aren't people dragging Memphis?  He has made fun of Ian so many times it gross. He says the most horrific things about Ian it makes me sick
1304501970032644101 2020-09-12 03:28:00 +0800 <hboo711> @houseofallstars I wish it was Memphis and Enzo so badly
1304501658127396864 2020-09-12 03:26:46 +0800 <hboo711> @BadGirlsClubLvr They need to wake up because Memphis and Enzo will send them all out.
1304501418083131397 2020-09-12 03:25:49 +0800 <hboo711> It amazes me that Memphis and Enzo don't get dragged on Twitter for their constant microaggresions and their contant albeim.  They have done so much more of it then anyone in the house.  They do it every day.  #bb22

1304281837330747394 2020-09-11 12:53:17 +0800 <hboo711> @jiyongtea Memphis and Enzo are racist and bully Ian.  I want them out.
1304281577313230854 2020-09-11 12:52:15 +0800 <hboo711> @TeamPG16 @TheBigBroTea Everyone attacking Nicole and Dani on the Ian situation and no one attacking Memphis for being obsessive in his hate for Ian.  Memphis needs to go soon.  I'm sick of his bullying Ian
1304281215432822784 2020-09-11 12:50:48 +0800 <hboo711> @MissingMeows @GeselleKittens Pacific Time for some viewers.  They are 3 hours behind.  But you can't come to Twitter and not expect spoilers.
1304281032015908864 2020-09-11 12:50:05 +0800 <hboo711> @GeselleKittens Never check Twitter until you know from watching.  It's all spoilers
1304280647347908608 2020-09-11 12:48:33 +0800 <hboo711> @UnfilteredFeeds Would love to see Memphis and Enzo nominated.

She has and will pay for it.  Prodution let her know and she lost the companies she had deals with.  Zip it? lol Alrighty.
1304278767695810560 2020-09-11 12:41:05 +0800 <hboo711> @realDavidOnline He did
1304278652780195841 2020-09-11 12:40:37 +0800 <hboo711> @angel206 I can't speak to if Derrick talked to anyone else but I do know the story of the Derrick/Nicole situation.
1304278471745703937 2020-09-11 12:39:54 +0800 <hboo711> @angel206 This is fake!It is true Derrick was calling everyone to c who was going on.He did call Nicole several times but she wouldn't answer because of the NDA and was afraid to break it and not be on the show.  After Nic wouldn't answer he started calling Vic. Vic wouldn't answer either
1304276295853932546 2020-09-11 12:31:15 +0800 <hboo711> @MagicalyMcCrazy Yes she was wrong and I'm glad it's been brought to her attention and there is no excuse for it.  What you may have missed is when Kaysar was voted out Ian came to Nicole and admitted he had talked crap about her.  She was very upset and Ian asked if she would forgive him.
1304274452084068352 2020-09-11 12:23:56 +0800 <hboo711> @BBRubberDucky I wanted Day to win the HOH so badly.  If Dani puts up a woman or a POC I won't watch this week.
1304274109828919301 2020-09-11 12:22:34 +0800 <hboo711> @Melin_CBS I do agree that production should talk to them and make them aware of the wrong behaviours.  And yes I know that Twitter made sure to let any company associated with her tell the story.  She will learn.  We all learn from our mistakes.  None of us are mistake free.
1304273162218110977 2020-09-11 12:18:48 +0800 <hboo711> @sincyslegacy It is important for Production to say something so people learn to do better.  Trust me if you saw me in my wheelchair you would be the same as others, not looking at me or laughing because after 8 surgeries in 8 years to my back and legs led to weight gain.  You would judge it.
1304272577406398465 2020-09-11 12:16:29 +0800 <hboo711> @sincyslegacy She did laugh but at Memphis because he was imitating the kid on the shining with the finger motion saying redrum in a funny voice.  She did get hurt because Ian told her that he had said very negative things about her to Kaysar and he apologized.
1304269145941385216 2020-09-11 12:02:51 +0800 <hboo711> @sincyslegacy We make mistakes and we need to be accountable for them.  Growth isn't easy.  I'm sure she's just as dissapointed in herself as well. When we know better we do better.

1304267240833982464 2020-09-11 11:55:16 +0800 <hboo711> @elfitvic We all make mistakes.  I know that she is not that way and we learn from our mistakes. I know she will.  She really is a sweet lady Victor.

1304266129565773824 2020-09-11 11:50:52 +0800 <hboo711> Dani please put Memphis and Enzo on the block.  My dream come true but probably won't happen.  I do think Day is safe. 🙏#bb22

1304199286150832129 2020-09-11 07:25:15 +0800 <hboo711> @mtoeta He was treated very badly on the season he won.  I am hoping he feels better soon.  All the crazy stuff this week had him sick in bed.  I love Ian.
1304198919237369857 2020-09-11 07:23:47 +0800 <hboo711> @TheBigBroTea Enzos Yo Yo Yo....and every other word F@ck that, this, them etc.
1304198230855634944 2020-09-11 07:21:03 +0800 <hboo711> @J_Gallaugher People are sending her death threats so I'm sure she isn't in a great head space.
1304196790716162049 2020-09-11 07:15:20 +0800 <hboo711> @seanstentheye Yes it does bother me. I just won't throw hate at hate. I do vocalize about the ones I like and don't like but I just don't go deep into hate, calling them crude names, death threats or trying to destroy thier businesses. I do hope people watching realize their bias and do better
1304194946681970689 2020-09-11 07:08:00 +0800 <hboo711> @melbrown00 She is a beautiful woman.
1304194766599606281 2020-09-11 07:07:17 +0800 <hboo711> @deadskulltweets YES  https://t.co/phLXdbNAn2
1304194601193009158 2020-09-11 07:06:38 +0800 <hboo711> @JemjemJj59 It is for sure.  I hope that it will open some peoples minds in our society to see that they have bias that they are not aware of and they learn better and do better.  ❤️
1304192678729601024 2020-09-11 06:58:59 +0800 <hboo711> @JemjemJj59 After one houseguest got booed years ago when they have a studio audiance they are told they will be removed if they boo. It's a social expierement to see what groups of people will do while having no family, real friends and basically held prisoner for 3 months. It can't be easy
1304191299696893953 2020-09-11 06:53:31 +0800 <hboo711> @seanstentheye I would. I've watched this show from the begging from age 30 to now.  It's my favorite get out of my own head show that I wait for every year.  But Twitter is too toxic for it to go on and that makes me sad.
1304190471980408834 2020-09-11 06:50:13 +0800 <hboo711> @stalkme69 Yea and I don't want that to happen but it looks like it's going to go that way because of twitter.
1304187402836209665 2020-09-11 06:38:02 +0800 <hboo711> @AmanAdwin I want her to win HOH so badly
1304186686243581956 2020-09-11 06:35:11 +0800 <hboo711> @CoCoa_Puffs123 YES!!!!
1304186572238204928 2020-09-11 06:34:44 +0800 <hboo711> @stevenbrklyn @hohweek You nailed it on the head.  We know where it's coming from.
1304186434488872962 2020-09-11 06:34:11 +0800 <hboo711> @hohweek Yes especially when Memphis has been the one constantly making fun of Ian the entire time but put Nicole at the begining of the article.
1304185885278326787 2020-09-11 06:32:00 +0800 <hboo711> @seanstentheye Twitter is going to close this show up for good.  All of this stuff happens on other reality shows but we just get the edited not the live feeds.  Since Twitter can't handle it without destroying it I think it's days are close to the end
1304185452065443841 2020-09-11 06:30:17 +0800 <hboo711> @stalkme69 I agree with that but so much of the Twitter hate is real.  Ruining businesses, death threats, just nasty stuff.  This is the only reality show with live feeds so we are going to see the realities but people can't deal with it.  This is a social experiement. But I see it stopping
1304184634440331267 2020-09-11 06:27:02 +0800 <hboo711> @Tweets2Jme @martin_ellia @JulianSalinas They even told him he would have to pay them back for flights and the two week sequester.
1304184344727236612 2020-09-11 06:25:53 +0800 <hboo711> @breakdown_big Day!!!!
1304184274027982850 2020-09-11 06:25:36 +0800 <hboo711> @JPopStrikesBack Memphis needs to go.  He can take Enzo and Christmas with them.
1304183787039924228 2020-09-11 06:23:40 +0800 <hboo711> @iammatthew1997 Yes please!
1304183136310513665 2020-09-11 06:21:04 +0800 <hboo711> @RealityTVGirl21 And they are the worst ones.  Ugh  I really want them both out
1304182805195259905 2020-09-11 06:19:45 +0800 <hboo711> @TheOviKabir He really is horrible Ovi!  So sad
1304181693935497218 2020-09-11 06:15:21 +0800 <hboo711> @BigBNews He really is.  I hope he doesn't make himself sick.
1304180838100275202 2020-09-11 06:11:56 +0800 <hboo711> Hoping today is Days time for HOH.  If she doesn't anyone who won't target her.  #bb22

1304177689675390979 2020-09-11 05:59:26 +0800 <hboo711> @mmpadellan Nothing to help us keep a roof over our head and when we are homeless nearly nothing to help us.
1304177450675589120 2020-09-11 05:58:29 +0800 <hboo711> @mmpadellan Outrageous!!!!!
1304177196865671169 2020-09-11 05:57:28 +0800 <hboo711> @RealJerseyGirl2 I'm so sorry.  I agree he needs to be arrested for lying to us about this pandemic.  God Bless.
1304176619284725767 2020-09-11 05:55:11 +0800 <hboo711> @CharlesMBlow I hope so but I don't think Jim Jordan will ever have regret.  I'm certainly going to try to vote him out.
1304175854323408897 2020-09-11 05:52:08 +0800 <hboo711> @deadskulltweets @koreykuhl Otters are awesome 😂😂😂😂
1304165589297004544 2020-09-11 05:11:21 +0800 <hboo711> @corpse_daddy @jaqinthebox @LoveReality9 @EvelDick @CBSBigBrother Why are you sooo angry?  Get a life
1304134751964495872 2020-09-11 03:08:49 +0800 <hboo711> @OlaySkin @ver_sayce @ianterryforbb22 @goodamerican @Betabrand @Pantene @cvs @Walgreens @FabFitFun @Ruggable @310Nutrition @burstoralcare Twitter is toxic and people say things that aren't true.  Nicole never made fun of Ian.  A man name Mephis did.
1304134087951740933 2020-09-11 03:06:10 +0800 <hboo711> @jaqinthebox @corpse_daddy @LoveReality9 @EvelDick @CBSBigBrother No one is going to put their foot down and make any waves in this game. It is a game.  Nicole was laughing at Memphis.  She cares alot about Ian.  Why doesn't anyone hear the good things like her asking for a rocking chair for Ian when they are locked inside for so long.
1304133241163722755 2020-09-11 03:02:48 +0800 <hboo711> @corpse_daddy @jaqinthebox @LoveReality9 @EvelDick @CBSBigBrother Memphis did make fun of his rocking a few weeks ago.  But the latest showing Nicole and Dani laughing was Memphis talking in the voice of the little boy in The shining and doing the finger movement and saying redrum.  That's what they lauged at....Mephis. My son has it too.
1304131464053878789 2020-09-11 02:55:45 +0800 <hboo711> @bigbroaccess Day!!!!
1304131359875772418 2020-09-11 02:55:20 +0800 <hboo711> @jaqinthebox @corpse_daddy @LoveReality9 @EvelDick @CBSBigBrother Blaming NIcole for what Memphis did?  Mephis is the one making the nasty remarks about Ian.  I love Ian but you all are just out for all the women and sexist as hell.  Nic wasn't lauging at Ian, she was lauging because Memphis made a funny voice and said redrum.
1304130632742850564 2020-09-11 02:52:27 +0800 <hboo711> People calling the HG names, threatening thier lives, messing with thier businesses false narratives is disgusting.  When you do that you are the exact same as any behavior in the house.  Last year was the worst racist and sexist season ever.  This year is much better.  #bb22
1304129924333219847 2020-09-11 02:49:38 +0800 <hboo711> @loganBadair Only Memphis has made fun of him and mocked him. But let's be sexist and drag the women
1304129589908824065 2020-09-11 02:48:18 +0800 <hboo711> @Melin_CBS It was Memphis not Nicole.  Mephis has gone on and on since day one he doesn't like Ian and makes fun of him but go ahead tear all the women down.
1304129173556994048 2020-09-11 02:46:39 +0800 <hboo711> @American_Honey7 Is anyone going to rage about people with physical disabilites not being able to be on BB?  I'm in a wheelchair but I'm not angry I can't be in BB.  I love Ian but everyone blaming other besides Memphis is crazy.  Memphis has been the only one horrible about Ian.
1304128634630877185 2020-09-11 02:44:30 +0800 <hboo711> @linusvpelt Let me tell ya folks.  The hate you give will come back to you.  As if anyone is perfect.
1304128271278395394 2020-09-11 02:43:04 +0800 <hboo711> @creatorchar All this bull crap will do is stop live feeds.  If you don't think these things happen on other reality shows you're wrong.  But since there is no other show with live feeds.  I see all this Twitter hate, threats, name calling, business ruining live feeds forever. Good job haters
1304127775373176833 2020-09-11 02:41:05 +0800 <hboo711> @PopCrave @CBSBigBrother @agrodner22 Tyler didn't use BLM.  He's not a racist and it was Mephis who is making fun of Ian.  Twitter is just as bad.  Hateful comments, threats, name calling.  If you're doing this you are no better.  You are all ruining the only reality show with live feeds.
1304127071384416257 2020-09-11 02:38:17 +0800 <hboo711> @robbedqueeen I'm not a casual and I like Nic.  I also like Day, Bay, Ian and David.  Trust and believe that worse than this happens on other reality shows but we don't know of it becaue of Live Feeds. The twitter hate, bashing, death threats on twitter make people the same as HGs.
1304053725007409153 2020-09-10 21:46:50 +0800 <hboo711> @cassiejames9900 @janelIesveto @ianterryonlyman He was not rocking in the chair mimicking him.  Memhis is the leader of trashing Ian to be sure.  Memphis said in a funny voice that he feels like Ian follows him and just pops up like saying redrum and he made a finger gesture.
1304052759226966017 2020-09-10 21:43:00 +0800 <hboo711> @KaysarRidha It was Memphis who said redrum it was not Nicole.  He was ridiculous in what he was saying about Ian.  He is threatened by Ian because Ian beat a contestant that Memphis couldn't beat.  Memphis is the most aggressive against Ian and it is awful.
1303911919955443712 2020-09-10 12:23:21 +0800 <hboo711> @PopCrave @CBSBigBrother No he didn't.  This is a bunch of bull
1303908595667533830 2020-09-10 12:10:09 +0800 <hboo711> @barstoolsports She is under investigation. I will not watch this season.
1303907888956690433 2020-09-10 12:07:20 +0800 <hboo711> @CBSBigBrother I love this show.  Too many people are just too toxic and keyboard warriors criticizing this show.  Why don't the fans understand that this show is unlike anything else.  We get to see real situations because of live feeds.  Which makes your job harder. #bb22
1303905268351336448 2020-09-10 11:56:56 +0800 <hboo711> Time to say goodbye to the one reality show that has live feeds.  The world has become too screwed up to handle it.  All reality shows have more problematic people who you never know because they are edited. #bb22
1303904695556206592 2020-09-10 11:54:39 +0800 <hboo711> Tyler is not a racist.He really wanted out and not be a part of the ugly of last year.Yesterday he was sent to the Medic because he's still not eating.Stop with assumptions. As much as I love BB I think the time is over for any reality show to do a live feed. You ruined it. #bb22
1303783176767180802 2020-09-10 03:51:47 +0800 <hboo711> @BB_Updates Enzo is 100% as guilty as Christmas.  I hope she doesn't believe him.
1303782505254989826 2020-09-10 03:49:07 +0800 <hboo711> @girlsmeg I would have done the same.  The blanket turned fake.
1303781945193750532 2020-09-10 03:46:53 +0800 <hboo711> @edwardpeguero1 @chaelon06 @BB_Updates So is Enzo.  He will not let a woman in the final 4.  He is playing the exact same game as he did on his season.  He says all the right things to their face and craps on them behind their back.  He was loving the women fighting.
1303781545182932993 2020-09-10 03:45:18 +0800 <hboo711> @MelissaReevesS1 @chaelon06 @BB_Updates Enzo is lying.  He wanted Bay and Day out.  He wants all the women out.  He was so happy about them taking pot shots at each other.  I'm so over Enzo and Memphis.  They are my bottom 2
1303780009484709889 2020-09-10 03:39:11 +0800 <hboo711> @MelissaReevesS1 @BB_Updates He wanted Bay and Day to go up.  He also wants all the women out.  100%
1303779701845110786 2020-09-10 03:37:58 +0800 <hboo711> @JustinTrudeau This is GREAT!  One thing for you to watch is white men will get with black men and supply the money to make it a "black business"  I worked for years in the inclusion part of my company. Who were ignored?  Black Women.  Please focus on them because white and black men won't
1303777089448013829 2020-09-10 03:27:35 +0800 <hboo711> @darvin____ I know.  I thought she had it!!!!  I was so excited only to be let down.  Please let's get a Day HOH.  We need it so badly.
1303776641429254145 2020-09-10 03:25:48 +0800 <hboo711> @KeaghanKirk Check the clips he wasn't imitating Ian.  He was going off (with a funny wierd voice) on how he feels when he sees Ian (he said redrum and he made a bending motion) with his finger.   Memphis was grotesque.  He is so obsessed with Ian.  Nic and Dani were lauging at him not at Ian
1303775393242066949 2020-09-10 03:20:51 +0800 <hboo711> @amyyyy_amy I think it's all the twitter hate that ruins it.The hate, name calling, death threats.This show will have to end because no can take live feeds anymore without just losing thier minds at everything.  All reality shows has this going on but they don't have live feeds.
1303773797292683267 2020-09-10 03:14:30 +0800 <hboo711> @darvin____ I really want to see a Day HOH
1303773587678035970 2020-09-10 03:13:40 +0800 <hboo711> @amyyyy_amy @mandamlujan Enzo and Memphis are more toxic then everyone says.  They just go after Nic and Dani.  Enzo and Memphis need out.  They are the worst towards Ian.
1303772895005544448 2020-09-10 03:10:55 +0800 <hboo711> @BeththeCatLady She'll probably on say something to Nicole to please you all.
1303772688612290560 2020-09-10 03:10:06 +0800 <hboo711> @AceDawg19 @JanellePierzina Lauging at stupid Memphis not Ian
1303770798625378304 2020-09-10 03:02:35 +0800 <hboo711> @BB22LiveFeeds She needs to stop it.  Enough please.
1303770185808175104 2020-09-10 03:00:09 +0800 <hboo711> @evamarielola Could it be that they were lauging at how stupid Memphis is?  He is the issue, all he does is complain and freak out over Ian.
1303709049091952640 2020-09-09 22:57:13 +0800 <hboo711> @blondenbitchy13 I think people forget because he's funny.  He's only funny in the beginning.  His constant yo yos get old and his f@ck this and that every other word is old and tired.  He is not only racist he is also a sexist.
1303707686236835843 2020-09-09 22:51:48 +0800 <hboo711> @zingflop I agree with you on that.  I just think business reviews should be based on your expierence with the business.
1303702712194826240 2020-09-09 22:32:02 +0800 <hboo711> @zingflop I'm no fan of Christmas but ruining their business is an old and tired toxic behavior.

1303534594101260288 2020-09-09 11:24:00 +0800 <hboo711> @BabyYodasAuntie It is up to his family to decide if and when they want Production to tell him.
1303531536491388928 2020-09-09 11:11:51 +0800 <hboo711> @BuddyGott It is up to Cody's family if they let BB tell him or not.  Not production.

But Janelle and Nicole were pretty equal poo talking on each other.  The when Janelle got home she posed with Nic and Vics wedding invite with her $4,000 plus Chanel bag and made a comment she never planned to go.
1303523356340359168 2020-09-09 10:39:21 +0800 <hboo711> @KatyHensley12 @kkarra99 @jamesrhine I don't like Christmas.  Did she get a felony charge or Misdemenor?
1303523073463902210 2020-09-09 10:38:13 +0800 <hboo711> @kkarra99 @jamesrhine This season Bay has bragged about how she turned the jury against Tyler, how Angela lost her vehicle because of it etc.  All said with great glee.  I like Bay and I'm not a fan of Xmas but why does Bay say such mean things while laughing.
1303517944484442117 2020-09-09 10:17:50 +0800 <hboo711> @WillMyers18 First part is right. Xmas got more frustrated and loud and Day walks away. Very smart and classy on Days part. Bay and Christmas start arguing and Xmas tries to walk away from it but Bay chases after her still screaming at her.  There were several feet apart when Xmas started 👏
1303516299604221952 2020-09-09 10:11:18 +0800 <hboo711> @_bchaffman @tylercrispen He didn't use BLM as any tactic in this game.  The feeds were completely cut when he had his conversation with Christmas.  Until we see that we do not know his agenda but I know he is not a racist.
1303514953698209794 2020-09-09 10:05:57 +0800 <hboo711> @causeway_chaos She's pregnant, so is Rachel.  Would love to see Daniel Reyes!  There are some in the house that aren't all stars.  But I love this show.  It will end soon most likely becaue of all the Twitter hate and death threats which are lame.

1303509008196739072 2020-09-09 09:42:20 +0800 <hboo711> @iMikos_ She really would sell her soul to be on top.  She has to goooooooooooooooo.  It's horrible to watch this show with her on it.
1303508767896723458 2020-09-09 09:41:22 +0800 <hboo711> @TheRealGayHH Oh I hope.  Please take Rinna and Kyle with her.  All 3 need to go.
1303416023681568768 2020-09-09 03:32:51 +0800 <hboo711> @jackiepack @oprahmagazine I don't either.  There were no feeds on what Tyler said to Christmas.  I know he is not a racist but people are so toxic here
1303415578326192130 2020-09-09 03:31:04 +0800 <hboo711> @oprahmagazine The feeds were not on Tyler and Christmas when Tyler asked her to use the veto and put him up. No one saw anything on the feeds.
1303415422411329536 2020-09-09 03:30:27 +0800 <hboo711> @KlounV3 @oprahmagazine The feeds weren't on Tyler when he talked to Christmas.  How did you watch it?
1303415252118274051 2020-09-09 03:29:47 +0800 <hboo711> @oprahmagazine He did not use BLM to further his game.  Ridiculous
1303414201424187394 2020-09-09 03:25:36 +0800 <hboo711> @TheeRealNaim @mashmartin92 His Grandfather passed away
1303413314639335432 2020-09-09 03:22:05 +0800 <hboo711> @realDonaldTrump That was 2016.  No worries I'm voting in person
1303413056177876997 2020-09-09 03:21:03 +0800 <hboo711> @Shelley_OBR @BB_Updates I still want Enzo out.  So much fun to watch but he will throw our every woman.  Did it his season.  Very sexist guy.
1303412467901628417 2020-09-09 03:18:43 +0800 <hboo711> @DorindaMedley I'm going to miss you so much Dorinda.  You are the only housewife I can relate to.  I lost my husband and I see the greif and I understand you much better then so many.  God Bless your journey.
1303220250410971136 2020-09-08 14:34:55 +0800 <hboo711> @Sarahs_eyebrows Will be praying for an HOH for them instead.  I want a Day win.

1303218952131301376 2020-09-08 14:29:45 +0800 <hboo711> Christmas just now denied a hug from Ian!?  Nooooo  So wrong.  #bb22
1303217287688790017 2020-09-08 14:23:08 +0800 <hboo711> @CraftyAries @electric_93 I love Day and I'm not a Christmas fan however........  https://t.co/3XsCNzPvK6
1303217040073859072 2020-09-08 14:22:09 +0800 <hboo711> @Sarahs_eyebrows Christmas just made herself a target
1303216297002569728 2020-09-08 14:19:12 +0800 <hboo711> God please bless Day.  She is hurting and it's tearing me up so badly.  Love you Day!!!!!! #bb22
1303215983126097920 2020-09-08 14:17:57 +0800 <hboo711> @goofymov I agree time will tell.  I hope I'm right about Nic saying she will never vote Day out or put her up.  If I'm wrong I'll own it and be very unhappy about it.  Day changed her life and she does owe her.  Nicole can play but she will never win being a former winner and she knows it
1303215445026189312 2020-09-08 14:15:49 +0800 <hboo711> @BBfandom2020 Yes.Nicole did want Bay out. Nic never tried to get Day up or out. Nic tried to talk Christmas before noms to put up Bay and Tyler.  Christmas wasn't hearing it so Nic said then backdoor Tyler (trying to keep Day safe).Nic may try to cover her tracks to save Day but she loves her
1303214612750520326 2020-09-08 14:12:30 +0800 <hboo711> @goofymov I agree.  If she doesn't do what she says I will be very upset.
1303214265923522560 2020-09-08 14:11:08 +0800 <hboo711> @stanningbay NF isn't.  She will never vote Day out or nominate her.  You will see.  I can't say the same for Dani or Cody because I have never heard them talk like friends like NF and Day do.
1303213050443563010 2020-09-08 14:06:18 +0800 <hboo711> @goofymov Franzel is loyal to Day.  I know it's not easy for people to see because people hate NF but she is loyal to Day.  Won't vote her out and won't put her up.
1303211739174105088 2020-09-08 14:01:05 +0800 <hboo711> @BBfandom2020 Nicole tried to get Christmas not to put up Day.  When Christmas wasn't hearing it Nicole said then backdoor Tyler.  I know it's hard for the Nicole haters to believe it but Nicole is loyal to Day.
1303211161312276480 2020-09-08 13:58:48 +0800 <hboo711> Day did the right thing.  She walked away from the Christmas nonsense.  I pray that Day stays.
1303207474015731713 2020-09-08 13:44:08 +0800 <hboo711> @hardass_hank Same for me.  It's not racist when you see bad character in someone if they are black or white.  I'm not a fan of Christmas but Bay went way over the top.  Day didn't
1303206066843537409 2020-09-08 13:38:33 +0800 <hboo711> @BB_Fanatics Yep.  It's about behavior i.e. Character.
1303205596284489730 2020-09-08 13:36:41 +0800 <hboo711> @hardass_hank She takes great pride in it.  Lauging at turning the jury against Tyler.  Saying she caused Angela to see her vehicle and blaming them for her miscarriage.  She's such a beautiful girl why be so mean and nasty?
1303205079332335616 2020-09-08 13:34:37 +0800 <hboo711> @MyLadyKat @bb_fiend Day did the right thing she walked away from the fight.  Bay would let Christmas walk away and kept screaming at Christmas.  This is a game.  I don't like seeing Bay/Day on the block it's ok to walk away to de escalate the situation.
1303200830284337153 2020-09-08 13:17:44 +0800 <hboo711> The person who walks away from an argument is doing the right thing to de escalate it.  If you follow them, call them names then you are the agresser and making the situation worse.  Psych 101  #bb22
1303163649968701442 2020-09-08 10:50:00 +0800 <hboo711> @tennyson_jones They just want to crap all over Tyler.
1303163377284509697 2020-09-08 10:48:55 +0800 <hboo711> @IonlyVetoQueen Get a life!
1303163110333743105 2020-09-08 10:47:51 +0800 <hboo711> @cal3xic0 Get a fkg life
1303153506187186177 2020-09-08 10:09:41 +0800 <hboo711> @gallymeroreboot Sadly there was a ton of information that we didn't get because the feeds left the view of the HOH when Tyler talked to Christmas.  We do not see everything on the feeds.
1303153196916002817 2020-09-08 10:08:28 +0800 <hboo711> @kcoll1313 @gallymeroreboot On his season he was one of the most sexist men I've ever seen play.  He is entertaining to watch but he wants only men in the top 4 to 6.  He is who the women need to get out.
1303152108640899072 2020-09-08 10:04:08 +0800 <hboo711> @BryceLennon Steven Covey.  But it's true
1303151985584205831 2020-09-08 10:03:39 +0800 <hboo711> Why the constant feed cuts?  Nothing is being said.  New SKIPPY?!  Every minute!!!!!!!!!! #bb22
1303150954808836096 2020-09-08 09:59:33 +0800 <hboo711> @vintagewingnut That comes from Steven Covey training.  It's a good way to live
1303140681989468162 2020-09-08 09:18:44 +0800 <hboo711> @StructuredSucc I have ADHD so does my son.  Both of us through Executive Functioning counseling were able to get off of Adderal.  I had to get off of Adderall because I'm 56 and have high blood pressure.  No one that age should be taking Adderall.
1303139921834790913 2020-09-08 09:15:43 +0800 <hboo711> @CBSNews I don't understand this.  My son is a singer and just performed with his group last week.  They all wore masks and sounded wonderful.  How can his supporters not see his constant negativity
1303061297957933056 2020-09-08 04:03:17 +0800 <hboo711> @AngelaRummans2 I hope you can find some comfort. It has to be hard being without your love but twitter can make it all worse.  Any haters just mute or block.  Wishing you and Tyler the best.
1303060919426134023 2020-09-08 04:01:47 +0800 <hboo711> Twitter is such toxic trash for #BB22allstars  To all spreading hate I hope it comes back to you
1303027604463775747 2020-09-08 01:49:24 +0800 <hboo711> Bay doesn't think Christmas is going to take Tyler up on nominating him.  She thanked him for trying.  So things changed #bb22
1303017232801378304 2020-09-08 01:08:11 +0800 <hboo711> @quinnster64 It's not right now but coming soon.  They shut down the feeds to tell them to get ready.  It's usually an 1 hour warning.  Most likely feeds will go down for the veto in 30 minutes or if people are talking about things they don't want us to hear right now.
1303016508566708230 2020-09-08 01:05:19 +0800 <hboo711> @MariaPerezTW The ratings are pretty high.  Alot of people are casuals (not knocking them).  My 75 year old Mother is a casual and she has never missed it.  Twitter is pretty toxic but I'm sure CBS looks at it.
1302866442472353792 2020-09-07 15:09:00 +0800 <hboo711> @BBKayJay4 BB twitter is the majority.  Not just talking about Tyler.  Calling the women nasty names and calling all the houseguests and BB racist is THICK on BB Twitter.  It's has ruined the game
1302866018835017730 2020-09-07 15:07:19 +0800 <hboo711> @hashtagishani @AngelaRummans2 He &amp; Angela are happy. They have a good life together. He has purpose and a great love waiting for him at home.  He doesn't want to be a part of a situation that he feels will be seen as racist or having racial overtones. He is no racist. As toxic twitter was calling him for days
1302864564741189632 2020-09-07 15:01:32 +0800 <hboo711> @BBKayJay4 It's pretty loud.  People I've followed for years called him all kinds of names.  Make fun of his hair on and on.  Any BB fan twitter hate makes me sick.
1302864015018909696 2020-09-07 14:59:21 +0800 <hboo711> @taylorryates If he just leaves everything stays the same.  They just cancel the double eviction next week.  That is why he is doing it this way
1302863405959843840 2020-09-07 14:56:56 +0800 <hboo711> @PinsTrading @kingbear100 He's being the very opposite of being racist.  Toxic Twitter at it again..
1302863003369562113 2020-09-07 14:55:20 +0800 <hboo711> @LegalSojourner He is blaming himself.  He's not blaming either ladies
1302862416955535360 2020-09-07 14:53:00 +0800 <hboo711> @mariahsdiscog @BB_Updates Bay and Day are super happy about it.
1302861985831358465 2020-09-07 14:51:18 +0800 <hboo711> @taylorryates He's leaving.  It's ok for him to leave the way he wants.  He doesn't want any part of the racism in the house.  He said exactly that in the beginning when David was put up.  If he self evicted they would just cancel the double eviction next week and he would have not helped them
1302861032847745025 2020-09-07 14:47:30 +0800 <hboo711> @hashtagishani @AngelaRummans2 He will be ok when gets home to his girlfriend and stays off social media.  He truly is a good man.
1302859977460191232 2020-09-07 14:43:19 +0800 <hboo711> @KaysarRidha @SwaggyCTV Tyler has their backs.  He's going to be nominated so they stay.
1302859156597157888 2020-09-07 14:40:03 +0800 <hboo711> @stinaknits He can't do anything right for so many people. He's over being dragged and this show.  I'm sad to see him go but glad he won't continue to get dragged.  I grew up around him.  He's a much nicer man then people even know.
1302858505456680961 2020-09-07 14:37:28 +0800 <hboo711> Tyler grew up in my hometown.  I've had to listen to so many people trash him for a season and a half.  He truly is a very big hearted man.  I'm not surprised he doesn't want anything to do with all of this.  Especially how bad he was attacked in his first season. Stop hate #bb22
1302857377755156480 2020-09-07 14:32:59 +0800 <hboo711> @ThePennywink @PhilipAlanPhoto Tyler has been clear since David was put on the block that Tyler didn't want anything to do with racial implications this season.
1302857101077815301 2020-09-07 14:31:53 +0800 <hboo711> @loribelle74 @ThePennywink @PhilipAlanPhoto It's used mostly in the Military.  Drop on Request.  For BB it would be a self evict.
1302813065222778880 2020-09-07 11:36:54 +0800 <hboo711> @bbyrihmani Yea, that box didn't look like a box.  Looks better now
1302812824457097217 2020-09-07 11:35:57 +0800 <hboo711> @TiannaLifee Nicole did not say was that even a punishment.  The stupid lies.  too funny
1302812501260865537 2020-09-07 11:34:40 +0800 <hboo711> @leafsweetie No.  A few years ago we had a real insider called Vegas.  Twitter made sure to destroy her.  She was actully in production and would let us know how long feeds would be down lots of good stuff.  But we can't have good things when twitter get's jealous and goes after someone.
1302811857321852928 2020-09-07 11:32:06 +0800 <hboo711> @ivyIegion No she isn't.
1302811649053687808 2020-09-07 11:31:16 +0800 <hboo711> @BBKayJay4 They can try to talk him out of it but they cannot stop him.  There is a button/door in the DR and they can self evict at any time.
1302811415342972928 2020-09-07 11:30:21 +0800 <hboo711> @visababe @agrodner22 Tyler is not a racist.
1302811186673655812 2020-09-07 11:29:26 +0800 <hboo711> @JerryDaponte After she talked all kinds of trash about Tyler.  But I would love to see the ladies go far.
1302810984462069761 2020-09-07 11:28:38 +0800 <hboo711> @Jordan_Chapman_ Tyler want to save Bay and Day.  You are right he really didn't want to play again.  I hate for him to do it but if it's how he feels I get it.  He was sickened last year by the racist game play and he wants no part of it.  I think he's actually a good guy but it's sad
1302809072257900546 2020-09-07 11:21:02 +0800 <hboo711> Learn to change channels skippy when you don't want us to see a converstation.  There are 4 "cameras"  Jeez #bb22
1302808293694468096 2020-09-07 11:17:56 +0800 <hboo711> @BB_SexStool @CBSBigBrother I agree.  I just know why they are doing it.  That's why I will always prefer BBOTT.
1302808061267017730 2020-09-07 11:17:01 +0800 <hboo711> @Huntypoops It has nothing to do with two black women.  He wants to go home.  Nothing to do with Production.
1302807783167975425 2020-09-07 11:15:55 +0800 <hboo711> @UnicornWithAPen @CBSBigBrother Bullcrap.  Leave it the way it is and play the game
1302807326924079105 2020-09-07 11:14:06 +0800 <hboo711> @BeOurGuestMike I agree.  Don't do it.  Play the game.
1302806921687322630 2020-09-07 11:12:29 +0800 <hboo711> I understand they need to take the feeds down because this Tyler wanting to leave they need for the episode on Wednesday.  Tyler wants out to save Bay and Day.  Ridiculous #bb22
1302806537266659328 2020-09-07 11:10:58 +0800 <hboo711> @BB_SexStool @CBSBigBrother They want it for the episode Wednesday.  He wants her to put him up (Tyler) to save Bay and Day.
1302805701786468353 2020-09-07 11:07:38 +0800 <hboo711> @peaceloveGen He still shouldn't try to get evicted
1302805074436120578 2020-09-07 11:05:09 +0800 <hboo711> @expensivekordei Because Tyler wants Christmas to use the Veto and put him up because he feels guilty about Bay and Day and wants to leave.  Ughhh
1302804697284313090 2020-09-07 11:03:39 +0800 <hboo711> Do not do it Tyler or Christmas.  Please don't.  Feeds are blocking us from the convo  #bb22
1302793861761249283 2020-09-07 10:20:36 +0800 <hboo711> @AniThompson @CBS @CBSBigBrother Then don't watch it.  It is so much better this year then the horrific racism last year.  They created a more inclusive cast then ever and I don't see all the racism so many others are saying.
1302787796827099136 2020-09-07 09:56:30 +0800 <hboo711> Plese don't self evit Tyler.  I hope no one self evicts #bb22
1302772768547758080 2020-09-07 08:56:47 +0800 <hboo711> @brittrosenthal Her name is Dani and you can hate her game.  It's no joke to call her by her Dad's name when he abandoned her and her brother.  They only got back together when they played together and then he messed it up and now they don't speak.  Have you ever had a Dad abandon you? 💩
1302767713371262976 2020-09-07 08:36:41 +0800 <hboo711> @peaceloveGen I think it's disgusting to talk about a womans hair especially black womens hair.  Tell them apart is f@cked up.
1302763701573955584 2020-09-07 08:20:45 +0800 <hboo711> @ccc_chercar She knows that.  She would have put her on the block had she won HOH
1302763238283767810 2020-09-07 08:18:54 +0800 <hboo711> @LoversNme @BB22LiveFeeds They are fixing her costume.  Something in it broke
1302763059124080644 2020-09-07 08:18:12 +0800 <hboo711> @BB22LiveFeeds Nicole said on the feeds about an hour ago they are fixing her costume, something is wrong with it.  She is allowed to swim without it as well.
1302762840693059584 2020-09-07 08:17:20 +0800 <hboo711> @silvercat96 If you read the thread or hear the feeds they are fixing her costume.
1302762703329599489 2020-09-07 08:16:47 +0800 <hboo711> So my hope for a Woman alliance is over.  If Day would have won she would have put up Dani and Nicole.  So that dream is over.  Ladies Enzo and Memphis will put you all out if you don't win HOH and Vetos.  Enzo is fun but he's also a sexist. #bb22
1302636678574739463 2020-09-06 23:56:00 +0800 <hboo711> @RepVernonJones @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Let's attack a widow you say.  Sickening.  Beyond the pale
1302636416824938496 2020-09-06 23:54:58 +0800 <hboo711> @PalmerReport Attacking widows just more low garbage from Trump.  I'm a widow so that tells me all I need to know about Donald Trump.  Lying azzhole
1302635998350843904 2020-09-06 23:53:18 +0800 <hboo711> @realDonaldTrump I'm a widow too.  Is this bash widows day?
1302494110717227014 2020-09-06 14:29:29 +0800 <hboo711> @jamesg626 @endemolshine @EndemolShineUS @CBS @CBSBigBrother @agrodner22 This season is no where close to the horrific season last year.  It doesn't make it right but obviously why not just end BB.  They try to do better this year but no one is happy. There is bias, racism,  sexism and misogynistic behaviour all over but I'm not blasting the creators

1302491644214816769 2020-09-06 14:19:41 +0800 <hboo711> @ShadyLady2500 All the Nicole haters trying to be popular on twitter.  Really a twat?  GFY
1302491244224901130 2020-09-06 14:18:06 +0800 <hboo711> @bbcan14x I guess I won't vote for Bay for AFP since you can't do anything but be a hateful toxic twitter person.
1302491021725626368 2020-09-06 14:17:13 +0800 <hboo711> @CocoChanelaBean Production was fixing the wig.  But go on with your hateful self
1302490763427749889 2020-09-06 14:16:11 +0800 <hboo711> @BB22LiveFeeds Really the ugliest and crappiest BB costume I've ever seen.  Looks super heavy
1302490257519243264 2020-09-06 14:14:11 +0800 <hboo711> @_aIecIightwood For mine I'm going to need you to shut up with this trying to be popular crapping on Nicole.
1302490075666812928 2020-09-06 14:13:27 +0800 <hboo711> @Josie02210 You are so stupid.  She's not even looking at Bay.  She's upset because she got the heaviest costume in BB history.  I'd be pissed off too.  She was kind enough to support Day and give her $5,000.  I love Janelle but she didn't wear her cute sexy outfit.  Now this mess

1302488957276610561 2020-09-06 14:09:01 +0800 <hboo711> @katcrazee @EARTHD0GBB She actually is a nice person.  But it's popular to diss her so rock on
1302488822115074051 2020-09-06 14:08:28 +0800 <hboo711> @EARTHD0GBB She gave Day the $5000 she got but go on keep making her a villian

1302228267181760513 2020-09-05 20:53:07 +0800 <hboo711> @deagirlfriend @MonicaWard3 @BB_Updates Actually she didn't want Christmas to put up Bay and Day she wanted Christmas to go after guys.  Christmas was dead set on Bay and Day and couldn't be talked out of it.  Dani and Nicole wanted Tyler out.
1302015481902227457 2020-09-05 06:47:35 +0800 <hboo711> @blaquecranes I want a Womans alliance so badly

1302014461566423041 2020-09-05 06:43:32 +0800 <hboo711> @LoversNme I would love this
1301981086248034309 2020-09-05 04:30:55 +0800 <hboo711> @stacystories_ Nicole will be loyal to Day.  So I'm happy about that.  I wanted Day to win the HOH
1301980640544518146 2020-09-05 04:29:08 +0800 <hboo711> @ayedriahhnuhh I was 40 but still love him and Janelle together.
1301980471308562433 2020-09-05 04:28:28 +0800 <hboo711> @RealiteaStubley She wasn't an alternate she was booked to be on this season.
1301980205473562626 2020-09-05 04:27:25 +0800 <hboo711> @bullythat_ho3 Only two ror three of them were Trumpies
1301979885880172545 2020-09-05 04:26:09 +0800 <hboo711> @MissOpsie I can't speak for Cody but in Victors podcast he said that Derrick called Nicole and him several times and they wouldn't answer.  Nicole knew he wanted to know if she wa playing but since they signed NDR she was too afraid to get kicked off the season.  Fake rumor
1301979044276310016 2020-09-05 04:22:48 +0800 <hboo711> @HollywoodTony28 @CBSBigBrother I love it.
1301976926765092866 2020-09-05 04:14:23 +0800 <hboo711> @BB_Livefeedster So many people have always said they hate twists.  So if the twist don't turn out good for your faves....it will be said again.
1301976599076667394 2020-09-05 04:13:05 +0800 <hboo711> @LoveLeviXO I know it's popular to hate Nicole however it's very unlikely she would win beause she has won before.  The jury won't do that.
1301975983457800193 2020-09-05 04:10:38 +0800 <hboo711> @vysuys @gallymeroreboot That is so stupid.  I'm not a republican and I have watched every single season since the first.
1301975431353192451 2020-09-05 04:08:27 +0800 <hboo711> @chimaexpelled Got hooked Season one.  It's changed alot!
1301975172371619840 2020-09-05 04:07:25 +0800 <hboo711> @chimaexpelled Season one until this season plus Celebrity and BBOTT.  I have always been an adult watching the show.
1301973545484980224 2020-09-05 04:00:57 +0800 <hboo711> @davonnedayton I don't stan anyone I like so many of them.  There are a few I don't like but I will never hate someone I don't know.
1301972391707512834 2020-09-05 03:56:22 +0800 <hboo711> @karaeklein Nah.  She has more fans.  It's just super popular this year to tear down former AFPs and winners.  Hating people you don't know is weird to me.  I love Nicole, Janelle, Paul and most of this years houseguests.   There are a couple I'm not loving but hate is stupid
1301972011212828675 2020-09-05 03:54:51 +0800 <hboo711> @bigbrotherwikia @nicole_franzel I love her!  I also love Janelle and Paul.  So all three are great in my opinion.  I love the game.
1301968255330988041 2020-09-05 03:39:56 +0800 <hboo711> @AlberthBDR @hohweek I don't know why Nicole is so insecure which is why I think she crys.  But Yea I agree with you it's a game and I like most all of the players.  Before this season Paul A held the record, then Janelle got it this season and now Nicole just passed it.  I dould be wrong about Paul
1301967165374042113 2020-09-05 03:35:36 +0800 <hboo711> @kcoll1313 @IsKaysar Plus I'm 98% sure that Nicole would always pick Day over Bay.  Nicole really does care about Day.
1301966219466153986 2020-09-05 03:31:50 +0800 <hboo711> @BeysAngel_ It is very clear that some people in the house as well as BB Twitter are racist and/or biased.  There are also players and BB Twitter that is sexist and misogynistic as hell.  They and we must all learn and do better.  So let us stop the hate, the bias, the misogynistic bull 💩
1301965037670666245 2020-09-05 03:27:08 +0800 <hboo711> @Realitykirby It seems the them for BB Twitter to love a player then to tear them to shreds.  This is a game for half a million dollars.  Everyone of them will backstab, overplay, lie to be the one to win.  Hating people we don't even know is childish.  I love almost the entire cast.
1301964552465195008 2020-09-05 03:25:13 +0800 <hboo711> @AlberthBDR @hohweek I love Janelle and I love Nicole.  The hate and disgusting crap people put up on Nicole is gross.  How can you hate someone you don't know?  It's a game.  Everyone will lie, cheat and backstab at some point.  They all do it.
1301963326541398017 2020-09-05 03:20:21 +0800 <hboo711> @JanMassey78 @diorxric Jan you are right.  She is not going to put day up or vote day off.  They will see.
1301962880930263041 2020-09-05 03:18:34 +0800 <hboo711> @TheBigBroTea She looked very pretty.
1301962008514920449 2020-09-05 03:15:06 +0800 <hboo711> @rinsaysthings You are just a professional hater..  Get a life new account troll
1301961737558781953 2020-09-05 03:14:02 +0800 <hboo711> @rinsaysthings Hating someone you don't even know.  Hate the game not the player.  Grow up
1301960981657063424 2020-09-05 03:11:01 +0800 <hboo711> @elfitvic It's got to be tough on you and her.  ❤️
1301863973231505408 2020-09-04 20:45:33 +0800 <hboo711> I'm really disapointed that Christmas is targeting both Bay and Day.  #bb22
1301633889115475970 2020-09-04 05:31:17 +0800 <hboo711> Please @CBSBigBrother  don't cut the feeds after the show ET.  Pretty please.  #bb22
1301629283027353601 2020-09-04 05:12:58 +0800 <hboo711> @Slytheryan I have the same issue in reverse.  I refuse to hate on any houseguest because I don't know them personally.  So I block everyone who calls Nicole nasty and hateful names or makes up lies about Victor.  I like everyone but a few  in the house but I will block anyone hating anyone
1301627928531398656 2020-09-04 05:07:35 +0800 <hboo711> @BackwoodSweeti3 You are an idiot.
1301625489942024192 2020-09-04 04:57:54 +0800 <hboo711> @JENisJUICY @DukeTheBBDuck @kivi2323 She doesn't even come close to comparrison of the Jacks.  I can't find any reason to hate someone I don't know but I do hate racist behavior.  What are you thoughts on how much Enzo is a sexist?  Fun to watch but he is a complete sexist.  No proof Nic hates women
1301624791309443072 2020-09-04 04:55:07 +0800 <hboo711> @GrumpyCardsFan For me just 15 and 21.  The rest I did find some fun redeemable things to watch.  but respect others opinions.  I just hated all the disgusting racism.
1301624463625195520 2020-09-04 04:53:49 +0800 <hboo711> @Joek72 He's the douche.  She dated him for a year and a half and he cheated.  Slut shaming is stupid and untrue
1301624003640127488 2020-09-04 04:52:00 +0800 <hboo711> @GrumpyCardsFan Fair
1301623892063248385 2020-09-04 04:51:33 +0800 <hboo711> @jorgebdamian Ok.  I didn't watch last night.  So I missed that.
1301623506560602114 2020-09-04 04:50:01 +0800 <hboo711> @AngeloftheSeize @CBSBigBrother @JCMoonves His last season he was the same.  Fun to watch but a sexist and biased man.
1301623008482729984 2020-09-04 04:48:02 +0800 <hboo711> @Peckapalooza BB15 and BB21 say hello
1301622686125371399 2020-09-04 04:46:46 +0800 <hboo711> @JoleenBB22 Isn't a Karen a middle aged white woman racist?
1301622476640858112 2020-09-04 04:45:56 +0800 <hboo711> @jorgebdamian I think it's Dani but that's just what I get from the feeds.
1301622341877870597 2020-09-04 04:45:23 +0800 <hboo711> @msjuliechen It's bull 💩  No one outside should have that effect on the players.  Everyone would be singing a different tune if it was about Janelle or Kaysar (Whom I love)
1301621992454590464 2020-09-04 04:44:00 +0800 <hboo711> @GrumpyCardsFan I do wish she didn't come back though.
1301621888565809152 2020-09-04 04:43:35 +0800 <hboo711> @GrumpyCardsFan Season 15 and 21 say hello
1301621386297978881 2020-09-04 04:41:36 +0800 <hboo711> @Tooms_BB Christmas sucked for saying that.  It's ok to get frustrated when you work as hard as Bayleigh did in the comp.
1301621004461113359 2020-09-04 04:40:05 +0800 <hboo711> It's pretty sickening if true that 2 wall yellers and a banner attacked Nicole.  I hope #CBSBigBrother can fix this mess.  #bb22
1301620634091429891 2020-09-04 04:38:36 +0800 <hboo711> @GlowESTBoss @WASMINYGRANDE I don't think she will win in F2 in any situation.  I like her but I don't see her winning twice.
1301619869436252161 2020-09-04 04:35:34 +0800 <hboo711> I wish all the girls and Ian would get together as an alliance. They will all get picked off one by one.  Enzo is entertaining but he will never take a woman past 5 people left.  I can dream of a womans allicance but I'm pretty sure it's not happening. #bb22
1301549761158414336 2020-09-03 23:56:59 +0800 <hboo711> @RealityRants2 Nicole
1301547018389778433 2020-09-03 23:46:05 +0800 <hboo711> @SilverShadough So many have talked about having to get help after thier season.  I'm sure with the nasty bullying from Twitter it is amplified.  People hating who they don't even know.
1301546291068104705 2020-09-03 23:43:12 +0800 <hboo711> @kunoichi4ever It seems to still be ok here to be nasty to women.  It's gross really
1301545674132127745 2020-09-03 23:40:44 +0800 <hboo711> @ShirleyWhel07 It's just so out of hand.  I've watched this show since it started.  I was 35 when it started and I've never seen so much nasty hatred.
1301336413158412291 2020-09-03 09:49:13 +0800 <hboo711> @EARTHD0GBB None of us know why.  I expect some kind of Trauma.  I'm just not going to hate anyone on this show.  I enjoy this show too much.  Is it troublesome at times yes but I love it.
1301335893601669120 2020-09-03 09:47:09 +0800 <hboo711> @survivorcbs You must cast @JanellePierzina  from #bb22 It would be amazing to see!  Please!
1301335207489032193 2020-09-03 09:44:25 +0800 <hboo711> @JanellePierzina @AmanAdwin It's obvious Dani was/is a big fan of Janelle's but why she worked against her is sad.  I really hope we get to see  Janelle on Survivor.  You reality TV career has to continue in some way.  It's so great to have you on our TVs
1301172314667614208 2020-09-02 22:57:09 +0800 <hboo711> @TVGuide Another bad idea is not having an All Stars type season for 14/15 years more like the way Survivor does it.   Just my opinion.
1301171906020864000 2020-09-02 22:55:31 +0800 <hboo711> @TVGuide The issue is that BB hasn't had an All Stars in 14/15 years.  In that time they had about 230 plus houseguests they could have chosen to bring back however they bring back houseguests from All Stars 7 which of course are beloved.  It created a mess.  Then add in David.  not good
1301144213531381761 2020-09-02 21:05:29 +0800 <hboo711> @Variety Dancing with the Stars is over.  What a joke
1301140142917324801 2020-09-02 20:49:18 +0800 <hboo711> @emkatemom I don't have a problem with being called righteous.  I'm glad you have been responding for kindness and the stop of bullying.  I just block anyone who goes over the top with hatred.  I'm just thrilled to get a season this year.
1301058028058415104 2020-09-02 15:23:01 +0800 <hboo711> @notallstan Vegas has been gone since before last season.  Toxic Twitter went after her and ruined it.  Just like it is ruining this season.
1301056259198681088 2020-09-02 15:15:59 +0800 <hboo711> @loloinggg You do realize we don't hear everything right?
1301054069222633472 2020-09-02 15:07:17 +0800 <hboo711> @B_B_House You are not wrong.  So toxic to the hourseguests, their families and to production.  We finally get a inclusive cast with very fair comps and we still have so many bullies and cancel culture warriors. It was a miracle we even got a season and this toxic mess is ruining it.
1301053262091759618 2020-09-02 15:04:04 +0800 <hboo711> @loloinggg The same thing happened a few days ago when there was someone who yelled over the wall.  Also the point is the hate is out of hand.  These are real people with families.  It's a game and it doesn't deserve all the nastiness.
1301051870341935104 2020-09-02 14:58:32 +0800 <hboo711> Maybe if people stop being such hateful trolls and being nasty when we actually got a season which is a miracle in itself and be grateful we wouldn't lose feeds constantly.  Wall yellers ruin the game and we lose the feeds.  Let's all be grown ups and be kind. #bb22
1301050895292133376 2020-09-02 14:54:40 +0800 <hboo711> @wittlebambi_ @EARTHD0GBB @robbedqueeen Many of us love this show.  If you don't stop watching and bit@hing.
1301050619025817602 2020-09-02 14:53:34 +0800 <hboo711> @NAlexa1919 @Tamrizzle @robbedqueeen @CBSBigBrother @agrodner22 @CBS We were lucky to even get a season.  Let the game playout.  If it bothers you stop watching it for goodness sakes.  Twitter BB fandom has gotten so toxic and messy it's no wonder CBS and Grodner are sick of ya'll
1301050020867825664 2020-09-02 14:51:11 +0800 <hboo711> @GiannaDemarcoXO @kaylalee_ox @robbedqueeen Then stop watching it
1300999548563841024 2020-09-02 11:30:38 +0800 <hboo711> @bbhgit You are a ho yourself
1300997241541464064 2020-09-02 11:21:28 +0800 <hboo711> @bigbroaccess Ruins the game and most irritating is it kills the feeds.
1300996195444236289 2020-09-02 11:17:18 +0800 <hboo711> @robbedqueeen So stupid. Ruins it for our feeds
1300995668849430528 2020-09-02 11:15:13 +0800 <hboo711> Wall yellers ruining peoples game.  And causing stress and greif to others.   I know most of you are happy but it's so wrong.  #bb22
1300937372176134144 2020-09-02 07:23:34 +0800 <hboo711> @bubbywub Well sadly she can't pull on your micro penis
1300936786013806592 2020-09-02 07:21:14 +0800 <hboo711> @aliciaw17 @AmberlynnMacey At least post original content.  That has made the rounds 4 times already.
1300875755522580482 2020-09-02 03:18:43 +0800 <hboo711> @drewrealitytv Like her or not these are words she and the most of the houseguests are called.  They all have a right to do what they can to deal with it the best they can.  I have heard many houseguests who have to have therapy after being in BB.  The hate is sad really towards anyone.
1300790993961324552 2020-09-01 21:41:55 +0800 <hboo711> @rinsaysthings The bullying and the hatred of all the houseguests on Twitter is disgusting.  Most all of them are called all those sickening names.  I don't understand why people just can't stop the hate.
1300789853727186951 2020-09-01 21:37:23 +0800 <hboo711> @DerekKoloski @DerrickL You are delusional.  Ian is playing the game.  The hate is ridiculous and I hope Derrick blocks you.
1300789371528937485 2020-09-01 21:35:28 +0800 <hboo711> @whitneyhogg If you listen to Victor on his podcast he said that Derrick constantly messaged him and Nicole to find out if she was playing.  Victor even said it was uncomfortable that he was contacting them so much but they never answered him.   Nicole did not pregame with Derrick or Dan.
1300786713028108288 2020-09-01 21:24:54 +0800 <hboo711> @RealityRealm Is that why Derrick was mad at Nicole because she refused to tell him she was playing?  He contacted her and Vic numerous times and they would not respond.
1300786167185641472 2020-09-01 21:22:44 +0800 <hboo711> @powerofcheeto2 Da'Vonne is right on how this will end if they don't start getting Enzo and Mephis out.  Come on ladies get those HOHs please.
1300783910998224897 2020-09-01 21:13:46 +0800 <hboo711> @CBSBigBrother  Please don't give American any choice or power for this game.  The fandom on twitter is toxic and I just want to see this game played.  I've watched from the age of 35 to now.  A bit older and still love it!  #bb22
1300783580935786502 2020-09-01 21:12:27 +0800 <hboo711> CBS did say that the comps would be different this season due to the pandemic.  All the comps played so far have been able to have been won by anyone so I think as far as comps go they have been very fair.  Good job @CBSBigBrother #bb22
1300783063069323266 2020-09-01 21:10:24 +0800 <hboo711> @gaysinthelife I would go and pay for it.
1300782047166976000 2020-09-01 21:06:22 +0800 <hboo711> If any of the women want to get far in the game they will need to get Enzo and Memphis out as soon as they can.  Both men are biased and in their seasons made sure no women made it close to them at the end.  #bb22
1300780650908323840 2020-09-01 21:00:49 +0800 <hboo711> @elfitvic Memphis and Enzo
1300780013873254402 2020-09-01 20:58:17 +0800 <hboo711> @elfitvic You got that right Victor!  But they don't want to hear the truth.  BB fandom is hypocritical as heck.
