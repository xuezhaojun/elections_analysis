Ex: 200k illegal ballots in WI, just testified to by a WI judge. Dead people voting, I believe is fraud. And ballots for Trump found in the trash or buried in a field?

1340164563543621632 2020-12-19 13:18:25 +0800 <joycele52632962> @maggmountains The governors shut down the states. Trump told them to reopen in April, and has repeatedly told them to reopen since then. If your state is still closed, let your governors know you want it reopened. If they refuse, recall them. Don't blame Trump.

If Trump hadn't been robbed of many of his votes, he would have ben declared winner. Many of us, who are about to leave your channel, want his votes restored.

Trump has stated many times over he's ready to sign a realistic relief bill. He even suggested approving the relief checks separate from the rest of the bill.

But,two days ago, Pence had a roundtable with people from the CDC. The CDC people indicated that was not the case. Has anyone heard anything about this?

I believe most of those will be used in court, not published online b4 that. I think most of us will find much of it shocking, based on what has been said.
1331706908978208769 2020-11-26 05:10:43 +0800 <joycele52632962> @jyoteen @kristens0109 @ktmapleston @davidmweissman @RandyRRQuaid The above quote came from  https://t.co/mBsizpZIo8. So if a person, for some reason cannot physically appear in court, they can give a sworn affidavit. You can affirm that this "whatever" was your experience. That is not hearsay, which is "I heard such and such. . .".

Can be done from anywhere.  Check out Sydney Powell's home page or youtube.

And that's only one special thing Prez Trump has made possible. There are times when you have to blow your own horn. This is one of those times for him because the MSM will not give him credit due, and we won't know what's out there.

Not that some didn't go to college before this, but now more can take that option. Others can start a business. The sky is now darn near the limit. Look up what Dr. Carson has done.

But this is tearing you apart inside isn't it? Please consider what I have said. You don't have to like him but please let go of that falsehood. My brother loves Trump, and so would my dad if he were here.

Next - he has given military personnel pay raises and made sure our vets have good healthcare in a timely manner. I doubt he would have done those things if he thought the troops were losers and suckers.   https://t.co/D1Cj5tKLgJ

What I've found out is the Secret Service would not let him visit that cemetery because of security risks. The Paris police also asked that he not go because his motorcade would cause a huge traffic jam while going thru Paris.

But let's look at several things - that "quote" came from the Atlantic, which is very anti-Trump, and it surfaced close to the 2016 election if I remember correctly. According to the article, Trump refused to visit a military cemetery of our soldiers, outside Paris.

I understand where you are coming from, Pat, and nothing can replace the love of your life. I am so sorry for your loss.

And I'm sure they could find a very nice local hotel for their getaways, and how about traveling regular airlines rather than private. And all the other perks that we don't get. Next, lots of money wasted in govt depts.

We make unapproved payments for both of those every paycheck as long as we work, and even when we retire. Of course, you know that. How about Congress pay back the funds they appropriated

How it must break his heart to see so many children victimized by traffickers (800,000 a year). Prez Trump's border wall has significantly cut into  that number, and will continue decreasing it. You should thank God for Trump.

Drug prices are already dropping significantly, my healthcare provider told me last week, EO protecting pre-existing conditions, signed (did that in the vid I posted). Amazing, actually how much he has done despite the haters.

And in case you are not aware, he is not the only senator for Calif. Most of the Calif senators are Dems. Also, the Speaker invited everyone to visit China Town. She's Dem.  Hmmm.

But I'm sure he will do everything he can to make that process move much faster than it does. I am also aware people are not given anything if sick. That's on the governors who refuse to approve HCQ use in their states.

And Mexico has 27,000 troops guarding the border, at Trump's request. So they haven't handed over cash as far as I know, but those troops, I would bet, are costing a whole lot of money that we aren't paying.

1312761652677287936 2020-10-04 22:29:02 +0800 <joycele52632962> @SaraCarterDC Yes, definitely try virtual rallies. Then everyone can attend. It won't be the same as in person, but neither was the RNC. It would also give him a lighter schedule which he needs right now.  The crowd's feedback is energizing for him. Is there a way  we can do that virtually?
1312536083360440321 2020-10-04 07:32:42 +0800 <joycele52632962> @JoeyaLowe I know. Concerns me (all of us I'm  sure).  Don't want him to have a relapse.
1312534803325939713 2020-10-04 07:27:37 +0800 <joycele52632962> @JoeyaLowe There was a tweet posted much earlier that said he had had a very concerning morning. I had just watched the vid you posted,  went back to it, and saw it was posted recently. Went back to check the other tweet, cannot find it now. Crazy. Anyhow, that's why my question to you.

As you said, though, there is much to be done but if you go back to work too soon you could have a relapse. We love you, FLOTUS, and your family.  God bless you all.  Please rest.

Thursday, abt 10:20pm, my Twitter app received his tweet that he and FLOTUS tested positive. Thats about 48 hours. Doesn't mean its in cement that debate wasn't the infection point, but he had many meetings within 4-5 days.

Also, for sure one of the children was at school in class, the other getting on a bus (after all day wearing mask at school?) And, the virus is so small it can get thru the  masks available to us.
1311176128237694977 2020-09-30 13:28:44 +0800 <joycele52632962> @FrankAmari2 @realDonaldTrump Absolutely fine with that! I don't want to pay taxes either. If I, and most others, had the money we paid in taxes over the years, we would be wealthy rather than struggling to make ends meet. BTW, you left off the rest of his sentence. We caught that.

He promised long ago to help seniors with medical costs, and now he is doing it. He would also have had stimulus checks distributed long before now but the usual politicians are holding that up for no good reason. Glad we can have a civilized talk.

We are also being paid now for protecting other nations. Also there's the matter of seizing assets of traffickers. And he is giving much of that money to us. Might be nice to thank him.
1309355406225940481 2020-09-25 12:53:50 +0800 <joycele52632962> @grantholm @eibrac1226Irene @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Excuse me - who was it that let a lot of seniors die? Oh that's right, the democrat governors that mandated infectious seniors be put in nursing homes. That's where we lost a lot of seniors.

They often must choose between food and medication. Take a look at your chart - see that blue line? That represents the Silent Generation (war babies) which came b4 the boomers. What does that line tell you?

Lived thru the sixties and seventies riots. They also weren't taught a lot of garbage in school. And their tax money paid for Gen X ,Y, and now Z. You're welcome.

Billions a month from China, lots more from all the nations we protect (which has not been paid to us until President Trump insisted). On top of that, all the assets from traffickers who have been arrested. And more that I am not thinking of.

Continued - companies stateside lined up to produce the supplies, he made sure states got what they needed ASAP. Remember - last administration left this one with empty shelves. Newsom and Cuomo both said they got what they needed immediately. They even got hospital ships.

Forest service has said they "rake" forest ground to remove dead leaves, etc. I heard him tell states to procure those supplies because they would be able to get them faster and for less money.

Who was it that said it would not work and was dangerous? Why is it so difficult to get now? Last count, 53 studies have demonstrated it does work. Yet FDA will not approve it.

He has done it via TV, press briefings, Twitter, and telephone. The blue state governors and mayors have told him to stay away. Oh but they will take federal money so they can clean up the mess they allowed to happen.

A lot of traditional Dems walking away from their party due to dissatisfaction with their leaders. The shutdowns in Dem run states has forever lost many of them. Plus   increased taxes and regulations = major opportunity for GOP. Email, call Trump.
