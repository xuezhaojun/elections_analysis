In other words, blacks are often involved.

1337552977326796801 2020-12-12 08:20:54 +0800 <Inductivist> The populist Right needs to respond to disappointment by replacing establishment GOP step-by-step, not by giving up. That is a Democrat dream come true.
1337550874369912833 2020-12-12 08:12:33 +0800 <Inductivist> SCOTUS' decision shows that the Left and the establishment Right Federalist Society frequently do not serve our interests. We have to work toward an institutionalized populist Right.

1337212508998782978 2020-12-11 09:48:01 +0800 <Inductivist> Since this is household income, I suspect Jews to a small degree and definitely Mormons benefit from a higher percent married. Jews also have a high SD, so they're a diverse group in terms of income.
1337207744508510209 2020-12-11 09:29:05 +0800 <Inductivist> What seems to be the common ground of these establishment types who hate Trump so much? Love of perpetual war.

1336544190256189441 2020-12-09 13:32:21 +0800 <Inductivist> According to Baris, categories of votes will vary in their splits (e.g., mail-in 70% Biden, 30% Trump, reverse election day) but the split within a category does not usually change with time. Mail-ins were increasingly in favor of Biden the later they came in.
1336539563158736897 2020-12-09 13:13:58 +0800 <Inductivist> According to Baris' data, Wayne and Kent counties had much higher rates of illegal ballots cast compared to other MI counties.

1336405640198033408 2020-12-09 04:21:48 +0800 <Inductivist> The election has made it clear that election officials are generally unconcerned with transparency and voter concerns. It's the typical govt bureaucrat, "F*ck you."
1336405639141027842 2020-12-09 04:21:48 +0800 <Inductivist> One of the best ways to reduce crime is to have eyes on a person's behavior. Not a single step in a ballot chain of custody should happen without others watching.

1336145932010672128 2020-12-08 11:09:49 +0800 <Inductivist> @Thegfactor2 @Go321D It looks like there might be a problem with rejections for all reasons. The article quotes Ballotpedia: rejected 6.42% of mail-in ballots in total in the 2016 general election and 3.10% in total in the 2018 midterm. Here it says 0.2% of 2020 mail-ins:  https://t.co/levjAtBEkR
1336127917160480768 2020-12-08 09:58:14 +0800 <Inductivist> @Go321D Yes, _much_ more widespread, so the total number of rejected ballots should be much higher. But rejection numbers have actually been very low this election, indicating that election officials were allowing a lot of bad ballots to get through.
1336119100825718785 2020-12-08 09:23:12 +0800 <Inductivist> Since we're talking a lot about signature verification, a legal experiment in NV election showed that the machines failed to catch forged signatures 89% of the time.   https://t.co/OWfTt2Ybkd

1335670274012790784 2020-12-07 03:39:43 +0800 <Inductivist> I'll admit just how delicious it is that, after four years of baseless claims by Democrats that Trump was given the election by Russians, Biden will have tens of millions of citizens who believe that he is not a legitimate president. It's a beautiful thing.

1335056911880712199 2020-12-05 11:02:26 +0800 <Inductivist> In other words, we need to take advantage of covid to expand open borders and other progressive policies.
1335054597816078336 2020-12-05 10:53:14 +0800 <Inductivist> Yes, but it is incorrect to say he did better against Biden than Hillary practically everywhere.
1335046417199427584 2020-12-05 10:20:44 +0800 <Inductivist> I'm not a lawyer, but if this is the law, it sounds unconstitutional. The Constitution says state legislatures control elections, period. If the winner is in doubt, they decide.
1335016548247822339 2020-12-05 08:22:03 +0800 <Inductivist> AZ House Speaker seems to be saying that state law compels them to go with current results even if it's filled with illegal votes.
1335004580984209409 2020-12-05 07:34:29 +0800 <Inductivist> But, Jim, it's 50 million of the kinds of Americans who don't matter. They're dumb and delusional, and what they deserve, like any fascist, is a good punch in the face and then some re-programming to get their minds right.

I'm sure GA law clearly states that, "Ballots shall be placed in suitcases and hidden under tables until GOP poll watchers are dismissed, whereupon they shall then be counted."
1334992221234327552 2020-12-05 06:45:23 +0800 <Inductivist> We don't need a circular firing squad. We all need to agree that deciding against voting in the runoff is precisely what Democrats want you to do.
1334990902935183360 2020-12-05 06:40:08 +0800 <Inductivist> To GA GOP: Dominion has machines in 30 states, yet Republicans often win in those states, so don't sit out the runoff election because you feel like your vote won't count. If you want to _guarantee_ a result, stay home.

1334923557940330497 2020-12-05 02:12:32 +0800 <Inductivist> Exactly. The Media don't educate us. They are at war with us.

1334922128802496512 2020-12-05 02:06:51 +0800 <Inductivist> Ordinary people vote Democrat to get things like affordable healthcare. What they get immediately instead are policies that are psych ops against their children.
1334920813196103685 2020-12-05 02:01:38 +0800 <Inductivist> It's encouraging that more Hispanics voted for Trump, but unfortunately, establishment GOP will twist this into, "Hispanics are natural conservatives, so let's flood the country with them." Guess what--the unusual 10 points over baseline is still less than 50%.
1334918932730277888 2020-12-05 01:54:09 +0800 <Inductivist> They don't want to do it since it is the one straightforward method that is likely to show widespread illegality.

1334641110291865601 2020-12-04 07:30:11 +0800 <Inductivist> All this "the judge is a Trump appointee" means little to nothing. The Federalist Society is establishment GOP, and many of them are only too happy to stab Trump in the back so the cocktail party invitations keep coming.
1334637498044039170 2020-12-04 07:15:50 +0800 <Inductivist> In addition to being motivated to increase votes for Biden, the MI hearing yesterday revealed that election officials ignored the law in order to ease and hurry up the counting. It's likely that election officials did the same thing in other states.
1334630969320460288 2020-12-04 06:49:53 +0800 <Inductivist> What is the originalist position on who controls elections? The Constitution says state legislatures do.
1334629512772952064 2020-12-04 06:44:06 +0800 <Inductivist> Obama said something the other day about how the Right is benefitting by telling white men they are discriminated against, but history doesn't support that.

1334297698103558145 2020-12-03 08:45:35 +0800 <Inductivist> Maybe I'm just an evidence nerd, but why do Republicans high and low focus on speculative allegations of voter fraud, or vulnerabilities that _might_ have led to fraud? These are easy to attack, and it enables the other side to dismiss _all_ claims, including the strong ones.
1334296594422763521 2020-12-03 08:41:12 +0800 <Inductivist> The good news is that there is a good chance that They are going to get fired. Despite being two people, They cannot get Their research done.
1334293277688778752 2020-12-03 08:28:02 +0800 <Inductivist> I'm afraid there is a tendency among our Mormon brothers similar to our Catholic brothers: the border isn't _that_ important since the Church is universal. Guess what: a person can probably worship God easier in their own country than in She/Her/They America.
1334268107125211136 2020-12-03 06:48:00 +0800 <Inductivist> @SR71999 Good question.
1334257224080744448 2020-12-03 06:04:46 +0800 <Inductivist> That does it. I now have a "they" colleague. I need to find a new line of work.
1334220708646318080 2020-12-03 03:39:40 +0800 <Inductivist> A cancer grows.
1334220020226789376 2020-12-03 03:36:56 +0800 <Inductivist> The suggestion by Sidney Powell that there are circumstances under which Republicans should refuse to vote is insane. Never ever boycott voting!! I'm sure Democrats love that idea.
1334217288648511488 2020-12-03 03:26:04 +0800 <Inductivist> Lin Wood's right: Our strategy should be the non-violent MLK model. The Right needs to learn from the successes of the Left.
1334216700040921089 2020-12-03 03:23:44 +0800 <Inductivist> I can't see the crowd at Lin Wood/Sidney Powell press conference, but it sounds loud and big.
1334035512764448770 2020-12-02 15:23:46 +0800 <Inductivist> Republican leaders like this guy seem pretty clueless about the mood of their voters. The _last_ thing Republicans want to hear is that swing states have election systems so awesome they need to be bragged about. Start looking for that cash-in job, pal. You're an amateur.
1334005340765966336 2020-12-02 13:23:52 +0800 <Inductivist> Of course, she's a man. She always got the smart parts.
1333981789757399041 2020-12-02 11:50:17 +0800 <Inductivist> People are talking about how election fraud was coordinated across swing states since there is a lot of commonality, but the simpler explanation is that officials tended to have the attitude of "count any and every vote, by hook or by crook."
1333965828056772608 2020-12-02 10:46:51 +0800 <Inductivist> Have people seen many reports of businessmen killing themselves after losing businesses this past year? Financial failure is a common reason for male suicide.
1333929633616592896 2020-12-02 08:23:02 +0800 <Inductivist> Our decent Republican institutionalists.
1333928502358278145 2020-12-02 08:18:32 +0800 <Inductivist> Good list. Not true that Biden only did better than Hillary in 4 places. Of 30 large co., he did a little better in: Tarrant, Oakland (MI), Dallas, Dane, Pima, Maricopa, Bexar, Washoe, Allegheny, San Diego, Milw, Riverside, Wayne, Sacram, Orange. He did a little worse in Philly.
1333923031199084544 2020-12-02 07:56:48 +0800 <Inductivist> "We have gathered ample evidence of illegal voting in at least 6 states, which they have not examined. We have many witnesses swearing under oath they saw crimes being committed... Not a single one has been interviewed by the DOJ. The DOJ hasn’t audited any voting machines."
1333912907189350400 2020-12-02 07:16:34 +0800 <Inductivist> When it comes to election fraud, I take the same approach as with ordinary crime, or perhaps even organized crime: I assume it's fairly unsophisticated, unsexy, and pathetic.
1333895802482147328 2020-12-02 06:08:36 +0800 <Inductivist> @TheRealRoseRose Many of them submitted affidavits.
1333885185905999872 2020-12-02 05:26:25 +0800 <Inductivist> She a lesbian, but lesbians are so 1990s. Ellen Degeneres is like, what, 60?
1333884548866732032 2020-12-02 05:23:53 +0800 <Inductivist> The frustrations the Right are feeling right now should be channeled into activism and organizing, not disillusionment or illegality. Along with election integrity, let's focus on the GA Senate races. It'll be hard for them to steal it if we're watching every move they make.
1333875700550418433 2020-12-02 04:48:43 +0800 <Inductivist> I'm not sure that widespread failure to follow ballot-processing rules by election officials is criminal, but it is certainly is not following the law, and it undermines confidence in the outcome.
1333872870938746880 2020-12-02 04:37:29 +0800 <Inductivist> According to state records, there are 214 m reg voters in the US. The 2018 Current Population Survey estimated there are 154 m. Millions were signed up 2018-20, but these numbers suggest very dirty rolls--tens of millions of erroneous registrations.  https://t.co/JoxlGpvi81
1333863443741380608 2020-12-02 04:00:01 +0800 <Inductivist> The widespread harassment and intimidation of Republican poll watchers is Third World shit. It's Tammany Hall BS.
1333861733744603137 2020-12-02 03:53:13 +0800 <Inductivist> The clearest violation in these swing states is that election officials did not follow the rules which allowed tens of thousands of improper ballots to be counted; thus, we cannot have confidence in the outcome. Any disenfranchisement is on them.
1333860194023927809 2020-12-02 03:47:06 +0800 <Inductivist> The establishment, in their corrupt way, is going to focus on the hardest-to-prove evidence so they can ignore the solid, down-to-earth evidence.
1333850766688174080 2020-12-02 03:09:39 +0800 <Inductivist> What a f*cked up country America has become, and it ain't our fault.
1333849597383303168 2020-12-02 03:05:00 +0800 <Inductivist> The #MichiganHearing is a very long list of sworn witnesses to the shameful performance by Wayne County. What a banana republic we've got going on. No wonder the establishment types don't want us to see how the sausage gets made in these Democrat-run cities.
1333646110997450752 2020-12-01 13:36:25 +0800 <Inductivist> I agree with the Arizona state senator today who said at the hearing that Republicans just like to go to work, live their lives, and not make any waves. That has got to end.
1333643077903294465 2020-12-01 13:24:22 +0800 <Inductivist> The Epoch Times has been good on the election fraud. Consider subscribing or giving it as a gift. Support alternative media.   https://t.co/7Q0LCZvnNI
1333629368266944515 2020-12-01 12:29:53 +0800 <Inductivist> @Hail__To_You 170 m might even be a little high. If it's lower, of course, the percent having voted gets even higher. If registered voters is 167 m, for example, the percent voted is over 93%.
1333626382966878209 2020-12-01 12:18:01 +0800 <Inductivist> @Hail__To_You I have not found a good source for the denominator thus far. Please help us out if someone does have a source. The best I found was the 2018 Current Population Survey which estimated 154 m. Robert Barnes said ~170, so I went with that.
1333608446931845120 2020-12-01 11:06:45 +0800 <Inductivist> @MaleHumanPerso1 My numerator was not reg voters who voted. It was total votes cast.
1333606762939781129 2020-12-01 11:00:04 +0800 <Inductivist> Here's the turnout since 2010 for Australia for Senate and House.  https://t.co/5U3aJ9Y3eP
1333604447826558976 2020-12-01 10:50:52 +0800 <Inductivist> The BBC has an article of tell-tale signs of voter fraud. One is voter turnout that is near the # of reg voters. Australia has compulsory, enforced voting, &amp; it reaches 90-95%. The US has ~170 million reg voters, &amp; 156 million voted for pres. That's 92%.  https://t.co/tOd9k0kuHr
1333524067748433920 2020-12-01 05:31:28 +0800 <Inductivist> Robert Barnes: It's either Trump or die, Republican Party.
1333510478048370694 2020-12-01 04:37:28 +0800 <Inductivist> These guys are great.
1333507245812813824 2020-12-01 04:24:37 +0800 <Inductivist> The morning session of the AZ hearing reinforces a pattern in the swing states: election officials, mostly Democrats, tended to disregard the rules designed to ensure ballot counting integrity. I imagine the "every vote must count" justified, in their minds, breaking the rules.
1333506314979352577 2020-12-01 04:20:55 +0800 <Inductivist> I deny ever seeing this woman before.
1333308912003530752 2020-11-30 15:16:30 +0800 <Inductivist> Lots of folks sympathize with the offenders when they should be focusing on victims. The black community needs to have its killers incapacitated.
1333244169230245893 2020-11-30 10:59:15 +0800 <Inductivist> I guess there really is a female communication advantage.
1333237857482280960 2020-11-30 10:34:10 +0800 <Inductivist> Wow, critics give it a 4.7 out of 10, the audience gives it 4.1 out of 5.
1333188725078048769 2020-11-30 07:18:56 +0800 <Inductivist> See, diversity doesn't mean heterogeneity, it means no white men.
1333179204876128258 2020-11-30 06:41:06 +0800 <Inductivist> When it's Democrats, the problem is framed as the failure of institutions. When it's Republicans, it's, "They're detached from reality, they're minds are rotten."
1333170162271354880 2020-11-30 06:05:10 +0800 <Inductivist> Someone start an explicitly non-woke college, and I'll be the first to apply.
1333166945772814337 2020-11-30 05:52:23 +0800 <Inductivist> Dislike income inequality? This new study provides evidence that mass immigration can decrease support for programs to reduce inequality.  https://t.co/0LktuHWNNp
1333163638979379200 2020-11-30 05:39:15 +0800 <Inductivist> How does a Christian not know how to pronounce 'psalmist'?
1333161708450242562 2020-11-30 05:31:34 +0800 <Inductivist> We need to learn more about Miami-Dade. It swung 22 (!) points toward Trump 2016-2020.

1332440425878097920 2020-11-28 05:45:27 +0800 <Inductivist> Join us on the Right:  We are the normal people.
1332423591367831552 2020-11-28 04:38:34 +0800 <Inductivist> The consequence of George Floyd: more black-on-black homicides and more to come.
1332213927304781826 2020-11-27 14:45:26 +0800 <Inductivist> Reich is telling billions of people around the world that the US cannot refuse them if they move here. And you know they want to come.
1332173882678079489 2020-11-27 12:06:18 +0800 <Inductivist> Clark has a message that should get him canceled, but he has not been, and he even has the audience laughing. How does he do it?
1331839845488939008 2020-11-26 13:58:58 +0800 <Inductivist> This finding contradicts Plato's view that people behave badly because they're ignorant as well as the view that education reduces crime through moral improvement.
1331834398719676417 2020-11-26 13:37:19 +0800 <Inductivist> I pray this is true for every one of these guys who is liberal on race, immigration, and who wants to invade every corner of the planet.
1331821532117487617 2020-11-26 12:46:11 +0800 <Inductivist>  https://t.co/VUPYq2Ay6e, people.
1331817675673071617 2020-11-26 12:30:52 +0800 <Inductivist> What I said of the military can be said of Christianity: Many of the fighters on our side are Christians. It's a key source of strength.
1331816425200128001 2020-11-26 12:25:54 +0800 <Inductivist> "Gender-based violence" is bulls*t. Men don't kill women because they're women. They kill them for the same kinds of reasons they kill men: to get revenge, jealousy, to save face, to eliminate a witness, etc.
1331797256505180160 2020-11-26 11:09:44 +0800 <Inductivist> I agree, but I wish they were worthy of respect.
1331795640800530433 2020-11-26 11:03:18 +0800 <Inductivist> Have you noticed how many of the guys fighting for election integrity are military men? At least somebody's got  balls on our side.
1331693291008532481 2020-11-26 04:16:36 +0800 <Inductivist> There is no epidemic of violence against women, unless you're referring to the huge spike in homicide against both genders in the past 6 months committed by George Floyd Mourners.
1331691525395283968 2020-11-26 04:09:35 +0800 <Inductivist> Far more men are murdered than women. Not even close.
1331690463946887169 2020-11-26 04:05:22 +0800 <Inductivist> This shows the wisdom of conservatism in our current situation and the foolishness of leftism. The conservative says, "Look at what we've inherited." The leftist says, "I'm looking, and it's awful."
1331689771156992001 2020-11-26 04:02:37 +0800 <Inductivist> This seems pretty clear cut. Biden has more votes because rules were not followed.
1331494510862290944 2020-11-25 15:06:44 +0800 <Inductivist> According to @Barnes_Law, many judges are unlikely to make decisions in favor of Trump because they don't want to be the guy exposing the corruption in the system. They have been successful in that system. Elites of all types seem to want to put on a good face for the world.
1331488442237108224 2020-11-25 14:42:37 +0800 <Inductivist> In other words, in 2024 he wants the Democratic candidate to win with legal votes.
1331486444762742784 2020-11-25 14:34:40 +0800 <Inductivist> After completing his massive voter integrity project and based on his data and no other, Matt concludes that this election is not like 1996 or 2008 or 2012: We simply cannot tell who won. There is enough evidence of widespread irregularity to undermine any confidence.
1331361131164704769 2020-11-25 06:16:43 +0800 <Inductivist> Interesting idea that, like Andrew Jackson, Trump could turn a stolen election into a powerful movement.
1331298817094733824 2020-11-25 02:09:06 +0800 <Inductivist> Did I miss it? How many polling firms have been fired? Has Fox fired their people? Why don't you fire incompetent people? Maybe you like misleading polls?

1331118570483302401 2020-11-24 14:12:52 +0800 <Inductivist> Shocker.
1331114523588116480 2020-11-24 13:56:47 +0800 <Inductivist> This year's election fraud seems to support my general hypothesis: boring/pedestrian is usually closer to the truth.
1331113735352590338 2020-11-24 13:53:40 +0800 <Inductivist> @ramzpaul Not even pretty for a man.
1331113585750077441 2020-11-24 13:53:04 +0800 <Inductivist> Imagine not only hating like that but with such commitment.
1331087105192206336 2020-11-24 12:07:50 +0800 <Inductivist> Anything short of signature match doesn't cut it.
1331085118736191488 2020-11-24 11:59:57 +0800 <Inductivist> And what number of precincts had more voters than registered voters? Lots.
1331084416395821056 2020-11-24 11:57:09 +0800 <Inductivist> And the mismatch/rejection rate was close to 50%. And for the 2020 election: a fraction of one percent. Obviously, the rules were ignored this time.
1331083261439660032 2020-11-24 11:52:34 +0800 <Inductivist> @ChadBuffingtonV Odds are against it but sounds like the best shot is to convince the Supreme Court that the irregularity total is larger than the margin of victory, so it is unknown who won. Then get as a remedy that the state legislatures (majority GOP) decide the election. It's a Hail Mary.
1331047107839488000 2020-11-24 09:28:54 +0800 <Inductivist> These two are awesome.
1330975361287372800 2020-11-24 04:43:49 +0800 <Inductivist> How does Trump, widely considered an illegal immigrant hater, do better among Hispanics than immigration-loving Bush?
1330710097819942912 2020-11-23 11:09:45 +0800 <Inductivist> Latinos should fight leftist imposition of Latinx. You have a beautiful language. Don't let idiot liberals ruin it.

1330640229607239682 2020-11-23 06:32:07 +0800 <Inductivist> Obama has a very insightful read on us conservatives: We voted for Trump because we got freaked out that a _black_ man of all people somehow snuck into our beloved White House. It's called White House for a reason, people.
1330636008153485312 2020-11-23 06:15:21 +0800 <Inductivist> Just sounds like some guy with lots of vocal fry talking to himself😉
1330629995731959808 2020-11-23 05:51:27 +0800 <Inductivist> Why are most decisions going _against_ transparency in a time when tens of millions of people don't trust results?
1330629087207989249 2020-11-23 05:47:50 +0800 <Inductivist> Who can we point to for undermining confidence in our democratic process? In 2020, every ballot, every signature should have had Republican (and Democrat) eyeballs on it.
1330625883002945536 2020-11-23 05:35:06 +0800 <Inductivist> I agree that the 2020 election is another thing that makes the rest of the world not want to follow our model, but I get the feeling that the global lack of confidence is more important to our elites than Trump voter lack of confidence.

1330617340749201408 2020-11-23 05:01:10 +0800 <Inductivist> You'd think Fox could take a less lazy path on allegations of election fraud than merely inviting a Dominion lawyer to say there's nothing to see here. His one interesting point is that e-tampering would be exposed by a paper ballot count.
1330615669197422593 2020-11-23 04:54:31 +0800 <Inductivist> I suspect the wise course for a company who gets Twitter attacked is... beautiful, elegant silence. Ignore the Twitter mob. They matter less than you think.

1330610092094365696 2020-11-23 04:32:22 +0800 <Inductivist> Why push big claims that are easily mocked and seem like they would be very hard to prove, and prove quickly? Dershowitz makes sense when he says the smaller, solid claims are not likely to produce the fraud numbers to overturn the election.

1327367887087013888 2020-11-14 05:49:00 +0800 <Inductivist> This post got me wondering how many Asian Indians are atheists. On the one hand, Indians are religious as a group, but those in America have a high average IQ, which is associated with disbelief. Of the 183 Indians interviewed (GSS), 3.3% do not believe in God. Natl %: 3.2.
1327365126622572544 2020-11-14 05:38:02 +0800 <Inductivist> Trump just said in his press conference "whoever the next administration" is. Doesn't sound like a dictator.
1327362650334920705 2020-11-14 05:28:11 +0800 <Inductivist> then we have to believe 99.3% were Biden-to-Purdue, and 0.7% were Trump-to-Ossoff. Does that seem likely?
1327362649424764928 2020-11-14 05:28:11 +0800 <Inductivist> It claims the Biden-only thesis is wrong since it ignores that many people vote president for one party and cross over for down-ballot candidates. But if we assume Pres/Senate gaps are due to cross-overs--&gt;
1327362648543956992 2020-11-14 05:28:11 +0800 <Inductivist> This analysis claims to debunk the hypothesis that many ballots in Georgia were fake Biden-only ballots, but I don't think is quite succeeds.  https://t.co/pMXx8gsyyt
1327355073635049472 2020-11-14 04:58:05 +0800 <Inductivist> Isn't the most obvious reason why we see a below-average rate of ballot rejections, even when 10s of millions of them were mail-in, is that officials around the country loosened the checks because they wanted "every vote to count" (i.e., they wanted Trump to lose)?
1327353139125600256 2020-11-14 04:50:24 +0800 <Inductivist> Ever get the feeling that ordinary people (mostly white) on the Right don't matter to elites? We have to reflect deeply &amp; change our ways if blacks are pissed off about police brutality. We need to list our pronouns to reassure transgenders. 73 m pissed off Trump voters? Yawn.
1327350432532860928 2020-11-14 04:39:38 +0800 <Inductivist> I hope @johnfund is writing a book to sort out all this voter fraud mess.
1327345658852823041 2020-11-14 04:20:40 +0800 <Inductivist> Interesting. Which white groups outscore Jews? White Quakers and Unitarians.

1327330349991424001 2020-11-14 03:19:50 +0800 <Inductivist> Our opponents are not stupid and they're not principled. It's smart as hell to have the attitude that, "Just do whatever is needed to get the counts to win, then put the (practically impossible) burden on the GOP to show it's not a win. Getting the count produces inevitability."
1327328658432790528 2020-11-14 03:13:07 +0800 <Inductivist> Full audits are the only way the establishment has a chance to persuade Trump voters that the vote was legit. Regular recounts produce the same result as the original count. They're basically pointless.
1327327258038595585 2020-11-14 03:07:33 +0800 <Inductivist> Even if these kinds of efforts are unsuccessful, the evidence can be used as ammo in court or legislatively to keep the Dems from ruining our voting system permanently.
1327326323946049536 2020-11-14 03:03:50 +0800 <Inductivist> @Mementos1234 Right, he was a classical liberal. I remember his interview with Jared Taylor. It was clear he didn't think like Taylor at all.  That way of thinking seemed completely foreign to him.
1327325157388472320 2020-11-14 02:59:12 +0800 <Inductivist> @thebhgg The hypothesis is that operatives needed, for example, 10k completed ballots pronto, so they zipped them off for Joe only to save time. It's consistent with Dems' unique hatred for Trump. I could see a _tendency_ among real voters--hate Trump, don't care otherwise--but not this.
1327163379866165249 2020-11-13 16:16:21 +0800 <Inductivist> I just don't know how you explain this other than fraud. Why  would everyone who votes only for Prez vote for Biden? A tendency is obviously possible, but this?

1325541882231836672 2020-11-09 04:53:06 +0800 <Inductivist> What did the Nazis do with Communist actors?
1325323319625674752 2020-11-08 14:24:37 +0800 <Inductivist> Maybe this is premature, but Dems condemned Trump, suggesting his reckless words would cause us to act violently. I think they have us confused with their base.
1325278602317885440 2020-11-08 11:26:55 +0800 <Inductivist> Bring back burning at the stake? Will they at least require two witnesses before roasting us alive?
1325274772666683394 2020-11-08 11:11:42 +0800 <Inductivist> How does Fox differ from other networks on the endless identity politics--going on and on and on about the first black/Indian/woman vice-president, and what this means for little girls?
1325273965607096320 2020-11-08 11:08:30 +0800 <Inductivist> I was hoping Biden's first move was going to be to reach out to the GOP to start working on a Covid relief or an infrastructure stimulus, for example, but he immediately rubs our noses in it.
1325258740619042816 2020-11-08 10:08:00 +0800 <Inductivist> Fox has got time to luxuriate in Biden fireworks, but no time for Guiliani's presser presenting 50 vote inspectors who were denied access in Philadelphia?
1325256096215302144 2020-11-08 09:57:30 +0800 <Inductivist> I'll give some Biden credit for saying, "We're good people."

1325222609076695040 2020-11-08 07:44:26 +0800 <Inductivist> If you asked me Western civilization's greatest achievement, I'd answer the scientific method. If you agree, we are allies. If you are like many of my colleagues and are undermining science, I'm afraid we are opponents.
1325217891185119233 2020-11-08 07:25:41 +0800 <Inductivist> My 13-year-old son just finished the first 150 pages of his right-wing adventure story. He says his next one will be a dystopian novel. His favorite book is 1984. Maybe there is hope for Gen Z.
1325202592641638400 2020-11-08 06:24:53 +0800 <Inductivist> Trump might follow Heroine Hillary's advice: Do not concede under any circumstances.
1325201254935527425 2020-11-08 06:19:34 +0800 <Inductivist> Bet that the legal claims will fail, Trump will concede like Gore did after more than a mo., &amp; he will act like Hillary &amp; go on for yrs making excuses &amp; denying the loss, &amp; yet will actually have evidence to support it. But Trump will be the only one demonized for his actions.

1325152909739257858 2020-11-08 03:07:28 +0800 <Inductivist> Damn right it's stronger, people. We've got to organize, draw on all our strengths, pick the right leaders, and imitate Democrats on tactics that work. An army of 70 million that can get much bigger. It's ordinary Americans vs. the Coalition of the Woke.

1324933315011383297 2020-11-07 12:34:53 +0800 <Inductivist> My Democrat colleagues are very different about grading students than voting. For voting, it's trust, trust, trust. For students' exams &amp; papers, it's watching them like hawks, running every paper through  https://t.co/fzDbQh2YFj, and kicking cheaters out of programs.

1324926827186409473 2020-11-07 12:09:06 +0800 <Inductivist> Why did Biden say tonight that we are opponents when he was unwilling to say that about China? They are competitors.
1324922469380050944 2020-11-07 11:51:47 +0800 <Inductivist> Perhaps more people voted for Biden, but our side is larger than France or the United Kingdom.  https://t.co/A3T2ybq4lt

1324870357296140288 2020-11-07 08:24:42 +0800 <Inductivist> Research shows that something like 80% of students have cheated on exams even though we're looking over their shoulders the whole time. But the experts assure us that unsupervised voting is very rarely dishonest.

1324868481263697920 2020-11-07 08:17:15 +0800 <Inductivist> It's like the country's elites got together a few years ago and said, "Surveys indicate that Americans are losing trust in their institutions. What can we do over the next few years to make it much worse?"
1324867651194159104 2020-11-07 08:13:57 +0800 <Inductivist> @ChadBuffingtonV @Wizard_Predicts @SidneyPowell1 Powell could be right. It needs to be investigated like all these credible accounts of election misconduct. The government has got to be pro-active and diligent to maintain its legitimacy in the eyes of 10s of millions of citizens.
1324865469472411649 2020-11-07 08:05:17 +0800 <Inductivist> America should not have ANY lists except for a list of assholes, and Rubin should be at the top.
1324756635118563329 2020-11-07 00:52:49 +0800 <Inductivist> Trump should concede four years after Hillary does.
1324738257557491712 2020-11-06 23:39:47 +0800 <Inductivist> Where's the count?
1324616156930404357 2020-11-06 15:34:36 +0800 <Inductivist> These ballot counters are typical government bureaucrats, if not outright cheaters. People are genuinely concerned about the integrity of the vote count, and their attitude is like what you get at the DMW: "I couldn't give a shit what you're concerned about."
1324614513015050241 2020-11-06 15:28:04 +0800 <Inductivist> Workers were more worried about not being recorded (their claim about protecting voter info seems bogus) than instilling confidence in the public that they are transparent? None of these people seem to be concerned about reassuring tens of millions of suspicious citizens.

1324563031443955712 2020-11-06 12:03:30 +0800 <Inductivist> The media had four years to figure out Trump voters. They completely blew it.  https://t.co/v5343oQ2Yu via @reason
1324518264815329280 2020-11-06 09:05:37 +0800 <Inductivist> @LManticora Maybe, but the conventional wisdom is that the Republicans tend to do better in low turnout elections.
1324474358174162944 2020-11-06 06:11:09 +0800 <Inductivist> Seems like this is a key moment for GOP leaders and entities like Fox. You'd better keep the angry Right happy or you will suffer the consequences.
1324471861241995264 2020-11-06 06:01:13 +0800 <Inductivist> GOP voters are upset because they believe in rules (and like everyone, they don't like to lose) but my take is different. If cheating gives Biden the win, then the Dems do politics better than us. We want to follow the rules, they want to win. Trump comes from their world.
1324455902368313346 2020-11-06 04:57:48 +0800 <Inductivist> @beta_npc You might be right.

1324444018135105537 2020-11-06 04:10:35 +0800 <Inductivist> It's looking less and less like Trump's going to make it. If so, how do we explain the Senate and the House GOP doing better than he has?
1324438692719591424 2020-11-06 03:49:25 +0800 <Inductivist> It's discouraging to know that whoever wins the election, we're still ruled by the same people.
1324396935990554624 2020-11-06 01:03:30 +0800 <Inductivist> Research doesn't show that there are honest and dishonest people, it shows that there is a range of how dishonest people are. Cheating on tests, for example, is commonplace, but there is one area where human nature is perfectly pristine: voter fraud.

1324139728887672832 2020-11-05 08:01:27 +0800 <Inductivist> God hates me. Rather than an obvious winner, contrarian polls made me think Trump had an underdog's chance for months. Always behind, but just maybe. Then early votes for Biden cont'd feeling of underdog hope. Then a narrow path yesterday. Narrower even now, but still a chance.

1324135456733229056 2020-11-05 07:44:28 +0800 <Inductivist> @Mementos1234 I think the story is that they had to let workers rest.
1324134805039058944 2020-11-05 07:41:53 +0800 <Inductivist> @Mementos1234 Me neither. My guess at this point is 268 Trump, 270 Biden. Squeaker, and maybe dishonest.
1324134141722460160 2020-11-05 07:39:15 +0800 <Inductivist> @Mementos1234 Right.
1324132675284684800 2020-11-05 07:33:25 +0800 <Inductivist> Biden's doing well in AZ because he's currently getting 52.3% of Maricopa Co-- Hillary got only 45.7% -- and he's doing well in NV because he's currently matching Hillary's performance. She won 52.4% of the county, he's winning 52.9%.
1324129950882914305 2020-11-05 07:22:36 +0800 <Inductivist> In the 10 critical PA counties, Biden (compared to Hillary) is currently underperforming in 5 and overperforming in 5. Importantly, Hillary won Philadelphia County with 84.3% of the vote, Biden's getting 79.6%.
1324123264017338368 2020-11-05 06:56:01 +0800 <Inductivist> Yes! GOP needs to learn from this. Trump's message is basically right, but his personality flaws get in the way. Being a fighter, good. Turning off all the nice people -- not so much. Reagan had this part right. Good-natured warrior.
1324122136546430976 2020-11-05 06:51:33 +0800 <Inductivist> @QuasLacrimas Nope, you're right. I thought WI 2016 had a high turnout, but all I need to do is look at the damn numbers to see it didn't! And I looked it up: WI's 2020 early vote was only 67.1% of its total 2016 vote--_below_ the national level of 73.4!
1324118738753388544 2020-11-05 06:38:02 +0800 <Inductivist> @QuasLacrimas 120% over 2016, not over the average year.
1324117743105290240 2020-11-05 06:34:05 +0800 <Inductivist> Keep in mind that 2020 had about 120% of the votes cast nationally in 2016. ~160 million this time around. It was a monster turnout.
1324109585989267456 2020-11-05 06:01:40 +0800 <Inductivist> If Trump loses, I'll be looking on the bright side: We keep the Senate, and we got Amy Coney Barrett. Two out of three ain't bad.
1324109349636112385 2020-11-05 06:00:44 +0800 <Inductivist> @jacobahinson @benshapiro Tough road to be able to win. If we lose, I'm looking on the bright side: We keep the Senate and we got Amy Coney Barrett. Two out of three ain't bad.
1324108515699425280 2020-11-05 05:57:25 +0800 <Inductivist> @jacobahinson @benshapiro Probably, but it's still possible for Trump to win PA, NV, and AZ to hit 285.
1324107611642322944 2020-11-05 05:53:50 +0800 <Inductivist> @LManticora @PpollingNumbers GOP has flipped 7, Dems 2, and 25 races are still too close to call. People say GOP could pick up 10 net.
1324105693847171072 2020-11-05 05:46:12 +0800 <Inductivist> @LManticora @PpollingNumbers Right, 52.
1324104859973373954 2020-11-05 05:42:53 +0800 <Inductivist> Winning 58% of the remaining vote will be tough.
1324104432531861505 2020-11-05 05:41:12 +0800 <Inductivist> @LManticora @PpollingNumbers It looks like Purdue (R) is over 50%. The other special race will need to be a runoff, but the Republican should win.
1324100831948529664 2020-11-05 05:26:53 +0800 <Inductivist> Fox is showing its incompetence. They said Trump can't win AZ because most of the remaining early votes are from Dem-leaning Maricopa Co. They fail to realize that the last week of early votes tilted heavily GOP--enough to turn -5 to +1 for early votes.  https://t.co/a7MeXXOEdm
1324087614920482817 2020-11-05 04:34:22 +0800 <Inductivist> @Mementos1234 I see, you're right.
1324069887178797056 2020-11-05 03:23:55 +0800 <Inductivist> @Mementos1234 Yes, it looked big, so Trump needed a big turnout yesterday. Did he get it? I don't know.
1324069691917152256 2020-11-05 03:23:09 +0800 <Inductivist> @Mementos1234 He needs NE-CD2 for that scenario, but he lost that electoral vote, right? But he won in ME-CD2.
1324069231923654656 2020-11-05 03:21:19 +0800 <Inductivist> @Mementos1234 According to models of early voter data, he got something like 66% of the early vote.
1324068458208718848 2020-11-05 03:18:15 +0800 <Inductivist> 50 + 2, I think.

The proportion for Dems is .254, GOP .175, other .016, unaffiliated (meaning no party plus data unavailable for 21 states) .555. Those numbers make it look bad for Trump.

1323488581210402817 2020-11-03 12:54:01 +0800 <Inductivist> Looked at three new natl polls (Quinn, YouGov, Zogby) to see the % of Trump voters voting tomorrow rather than early versus the % of Biden supporters doing the same.

1323382233974013952 2020-11-03 05:51:26 +0800 <Inductivist> @DavidSharp84 Yes, but now that the Dems have banked big numbers, the GOP has got to have a great election day to surpass those votes.
1323380880165924865 2020-11-03 05:46:03 +0800 <Inductivist> I count 11 states with early votes at more than 90% of the 2016 final count. Hawaii is at _111%_ and TX 108%. Doesn't that suggest a big total turnout (which Trump probably needs to win)?

1323072169182547968 2020-11-02 09:19:21 +0800 <Inductivist> @SR71999 Yes, and it could hurt us, but I wonder if Dem enthusiasm has expressed itself in high early votes. I'm not sure an excess number of Dems want to vote in person. And some experts are saying Trump draws lots of low-propensity voters on election day. We know GOP enthusiasm is high.
1323070339371266049 2020-11-02 09:12:05 +0800 <Inductivist> @defi9er @HippoHbd @WokeFree @athein1 There has got to be 2 million, easy.
1323066915602927616 2020-11-02 08:58:28 +0800 <Inductivist> Wow, Hawaii is already at _111%_ of 2016 final vote total. And Texas is at 108%. This suggests tremendous enthusiasm. 2016 saw 137 million votes. Could easily be over 150 million this time. If so, that's more than a third of all voting happening on election day--should favor GOP.
1323062209535123456 2020-11-02 08:39:46 +0800 <Inductivist> The belief that we're all equally competitive at everything if given equal resources, etc., is something I'm not surprised by from a teenager.

1322988904962613248 2020-11-02 03:48:29 +0800 <Inductivist> Such dumb symbolism. The # of people killed with "assault rifles" with high-capacity magazines is a drop in the total homicide bucket. If you want to "end gun violence," confiscate the 300 million guns of all types (good luck) &amp; then we'll kill each other the old-fashioned way.

1322972175645564928 2020-11-02 02:42:00 +0800 <Inductivist> With AZ having 92% of the total number of votes compared to 2016, GOP is behind by only 1 point in early votes. (The early vote ended Fri.) 65% of Dem reg. voters have voted. For GOP, it's 58%. We should be able to pass them up on election day.  https://t.co/pEErMuW0IM
1322964341990121472 2020-11-02 02:10:53 +0800 <Inductivist> Yes, I agree that it's simple: We win if enough of our people show up to vote on Election Day.
1322957248453177345 2020-11-02 01:42:42 +0800 <Inductivist> @SR71999 I'm still assuming that the GOP will outperform the Dems on election day, so the current numbers are encouraging. It's not surprising that it's gotten a little closer. In most swing states, the GOP has been creeping up on Dems.
1322953757546569728 2020-11-02 01:28:49 +0800 <Inductivist> Republicans are now only 1.1 points behind Dems in early votes in FL.  https://t.co/uXT4zFpYV4

From all the states I've looked at so far, independent voters have not been voting early at the rate of Dem and GOP voters. Does this mean less enthusiasm, or are many waiting for election day? In some states, they are a third of reg. voters, so they could impact.
1322406852739567616 2020-10-31 13:15:37 +0800 <Inductivist> @SR71999 @athein1 The experts have been saying that we'll get 150-170 million total votes (10-25% more than 2016) and 88 million have already voted, so that's 62-82 million left. With close to half left, and the historical fact of GOP coming out big on election day, it looks like we can still win.
1322354727842058245 2020-10-31 09:48:29 +0800 <Inductivist> What's the highest percentage of registered voters that ever voted? The highest I could find was 78.8% in MN in 2004. Just to compare, 64.9% of registered Dems in AZ have already voted.
1322352237192994816 2020-10-31 09:38:36 +0800 <Inductivist> The number who've already voted in FL is 82% of the 2016 final number, and it's surprising that the % of registered GOP who have already voted is slightly _higher_ than Dems: 57.1% vs. 56.9% (44.6% of others).

It's surprising that GOP is close to Dems in % of registered voters who've already voted: 60.4% of Dems and 59.3% of GOP (50.8% of unaffiliated).

1322198834882080768 2020-10-30 23:29:02 +0800 <Inductivist> Early voting data makes me worry that in the states of AZ, NC, and FL, the GOP might not have enough voters left to overcome Dem leads. We'll soon reach 2016 vote levels.
1322197793016967168 2020-10-30 23:24:53 +0800 <Inductivist> I don't see why there couldn't be more atheist conservatives. Both show a tough-mindedness, an anti-utopianism.
1321916274461474816 2020-10-30 04:46:14 +0800 <Inductivist> @ToBePrudential Website says 51, 50, and 60% of reg voters of those counties have voted.  https://t.co/xaVGSeT7eM
1321912059735412736 2020-10-30 04:29:29 +0800 <Inductivist> @ToBePrudential There might be some error somewhere. At the state's website, I calculate that 50% of registered voters have voted ~8.5 mill/~17 mill. Big difference from 95% of all who voted in 2016. Only 8.9 mill voted in 2016? I know many Hispanics don't vote.
1321910751955542016 2020-10-30 04:24:17 +0800 <Inductivist> @SR71999 Don't have info on that, but I'll look.
1321908355829428224 2020-10-30 04:14:46 +0800 <Inductivist> Amazing that the early vote in TX is 95% of the 2016 final number. At least in some states, it looks like many Republicans are voting early, so we should see lower numbers on election day. Last early day is tomorrow in TX.  https://t.co/5MRASIruyG

1321869327285383168 2020-10-30 01:39:41 +0800 <Inductivist> @JamesWeitz4 Given that the GOP typically comes out in big numbers on election day, this looks good, but a follower told me that in 2016 and 2018 the GOP actually led early in AZ, so that makes these numbers look bad. We have to keep in mind that 2020 is weird, so it's hard to know.
1321854006000455681 2020-10-30 00:38:48 +0800 <Inductivist> Here are AZ early votes. GOP not behind Dems by much.  https://t.co/DBvUPaGfug
1321844853039230976 2020-10-30 00:02:26 +0800 <Inductivist> The Dem/GOP early vote numbers in the 5 swing states for which we have data are converging. Here in FL, GOP is now only 2.8 points behind. If election day vote is anything like normal, GOP is likely to overtake Dems.  https://t.co/2BgaI6Jyr2
1321700866181656577 2020-10-29 14:30:17 +0800 <Inductivist> Not relevant. What is relevant is whether Joe is crooked or not, but you won't look into it.

1321680613129166848 2020-10-29 13:09:48 +0800 <Inductivist> @Balkan_Aussie For the 5 states with data, independents are 9-29% of early voters. I read somewhere they're tilting toward Trump, but I haven't seen data.
1321672903981559808 2020-10-29 12:39:10 +0800 <Inductivist> Actually, data are available in 5 states, and Dems are now falling short in all five of them: FL, NC, IA, NV, and PA.
1321663633189859328 2020-10-29 12:02:20 +0800 <Inductivist> I keep seeing posts about the collapse of American religion, but I wondered about changes in "private religion."

1321592950439075840 2020-10-29 07:21:28 +0800 <Inductivist> Trafalgar was the most accurate predictor of battleground wins in 2016 Trump v. Clinton, and Emerson (leans Dem) was a distant 2nd. So this map is based on most recent Trafalgar polls, and Emerson or 2016 results if Traf hasn't polled there or there is a tie (PA).  https://t.co/hvxC67eHWt

1321580154984960001 2020-10-29 06:30:37 +0800 <Inductivist> I want to understand them, and my guess is they did it because they believe white people are to blame for police shootings and looting (supposed) white stores is payback.
1321573271599341569 2020-10-29 06:03:16 +0800 <Inductivist> Half the reason I want Trump to win is to see all the elite forces manipulating the will of the voters fail, again. It might not happen, but I'll admit it would be truly delicious.

1321541192392142848 2020-10-29 03:55:47 +0800 <Inductivist> Lack of enthusiasm for Uncle Joe?
1321541016042659840 2020-10-29 03:55:05 +0800 <Inductivist> Same situation for NC: 22.2% of the state, but only 20.0% of early voters thus far.
1321539509708709888 2020-10-29 03:49:06 +0800 <Inductivist> Georgia is 30.5% black, but only 28.0% of total early voters are black, so they're underperforming. You'd think they'd have higher numbers since more Dems vote early.

While many battleground states are very close, the polls make it seem like Trump is not breaking through (yet anyway) in PA, MI, WI, MN, or NV, and he needs to win the close states and at least PA or MI or a combo.  https://t.co/zV6lfKAeMk
1320614217171386368 2020-10-26 14:32:19 +0800 <Inductivist> @la_chatte_verte My point is that the liberal view is not to look at the brain to determine someone's gender identity. It's determined by asking the person, right?
1320599699515002882 2020-10-26 13:34:38 +0800 <Inductivist> This trans issue has a parallel with the abortion issue. With both, the liberal view is that properties of the mind--consciousness, self-awareness, identity--are essential, while the body is not important.

(I don't know since I can't find 2016 info.) The national gap is much bigger this time: about 8 vs. 3 points.

1317972385220288512 2020-10-19 07:34:38 +0800 <Inductivist> The Russians somehow knew that a clueless computer repairman whose first move was to take the laptop to the FBI would somehow, someway make sure it gets into the hands of Russian agent Guiliani who was waiting a year for it?

1317934716532654086 2020-10-19 05:04:57 +0800 <Inductivist> I watched the clip, and the sticker or whatever it is looks real, but the "86 45" could simply mean kick Trump out of office. Politicians use ambiguous language all the time that can be interpreted as violent if you're so inclined, but the Media usually attack Republicans for it.
1317927388362141699 2020-10-19 04:35:49 +0800 <Inductivist> @mgsholaas Right. I read Hunter went there at least twice. People make a lot of the fact that the tech is legally blind, so he didn't see Hunter's face clearly. Evidently, he has some kind of proof that Hunter's lawyer called to get the laptop returned.
1317926596712394753 2020-10-19 04:32:41 +0800 <Inductivist> Well, one would hope that pollsters like being accurate and have improved their methods, but, on the other hand, you might think journalists would have wanted to correct themselves after 2016, but instead they have simply double-downed.

1317899147828031488 2020-10-19 02:43:36 +0800 <Inductivist> It's wild that there are either 2 or 3 laptops, only one of which is Hunter's, being held by the FBI that involve Hunter's activities. The FBI, the Media, and Big Tech are going to have to break all records to suppress this flood.

1317599259605180417 2020-10-18 06:51:57 +0800 <Inductivist> It all makes sense to me now. The repairman got recruited by the Russians who knew Hunter would leave &amp; abandon his laptop there. The repairman/agent then contacted the FBI to _look_ like he was a patriot, knowing the FBI would ignore the disinfo. _Then_ he fed it to Rudy.

He could win. We could use him since, you're right, Gardner is down an average of about 8 points.

1315402519577731072 2020-10-12 05:22:54 +0800 <Inductivist> @DoctorOcelot Yes. I've also read that hardcore Republicans are less willing to participate in surveys, and those who get included are more moderate and more inclined to vote for Biden.

1315357232788172800 2020-10-12 02:22:57 +0800 <Inductivist> Biden is lying that replacing Ginsberg is unconstitutional. Hell, packing the Court is not unconstitutional, it's just on a completely different level of assholery. It's "you killed one of ours, so we kill 10 of yours."
1315355784297938944 2020-10-12 02:17:11 +0800 <Inductivist> This "court packing" stuff shows a common type of deception by pols.

1314686556179849216 2020-10-10 05:57:55 +0800 <Inductivist> There was a jukebox in John Lennon's head. Problem is, it didn't leave room for much else.
1314685534237650950 2020-10-10 05:53:51 +0800 <Inductivist> No, it wouldn't. All it would do is push us from dislike to really dislike.

1314679920509947904 2020-10-10 05:31:33 +0800 <Inductivist> Random Oct thought: I don't know the hx, but is it the case that legends of werewolves &amp; vampires grew of out real crimes by serial killers, &amp; legends of witches grew from disagreeable women who tried to get autonomy through mastery of natural abortifacients &amp; magical revenge?
1314647567779524608 2020-10-10 03:22:59 +0800 <Inductivist> Look how Sweden has a lower average household size than the rest of Europe: about 1.8 persons. No wonder it's Covid numbers have been comparatively low. The #1 place for transmission is in the home. The average size in America is 2.52.  https://t.co/nkjTW4IVM7

1314422814917550080 2020-10-09 12:29:54 +0800 <Inductivist> Amen. Living in a small town, it's not easy to get the music you want on the radio. With SiriusXM, I'm in heaven. Heck, I'll even admit to something I find embarrassing. My favorite station is 1st Wave. I can listen all day.
1314400974945935360 2020-10-09 11:03:07 +0800 <Inductivist> Ooh, this could be helpful. I'll make sure and patronize the restaurants that get stigmatized.

1314385111761129473 2020-10-09 10:00:05 +0800 <Inductivist> China shuts off the transmission when Pence starts to blame them for coronavirus, Twitter shuts off a federal official when they don't like his message. Not much different.
1314323700779425792 2020-10-09 05:56:03 +0800 <Inductivist> @jcd1974 Right.
1314313173151834112 2020-10-09 05:14:13 +0800 <Inductivist> When asked how about Kamala's performance, Willie Brown said, "She sucked."
1314312366016753664 2020-10-09 05:11:01 +0800 <Inductivist> Might be good.
1314307358156222465 2020-10-09 04:51:07 +0800 <Inductivist> It's encouraging to see the FBI thwarting plots rather than hatching them.
1314302553178345472 2020-10-09 04:32:01 +0800 <Inductivist> Let's face it, nature's a bitch. We are a product of this harshness, which means we are naturally tough, not fragile like the social workers claim. Embrace the iron will within. (And it goes without saying that this is _not_ an endorsement of infanticide.)
1314295961057804288 2020-10-09 04:05:50 +0800 <Inductivist> Kamala said one thing about diversity that was less absurd than the normal cant. She said, "Diversity is beautiful." Rainbows can be beautiful, but then again, so can monochromes.
1314291574977646592 2020-10-09 03:48:24 +0800 <Inductivist> Isn't Rush's audience about 100 bazillion people?
1314290705087389696 2020-10-09 03:44:57 +0800 <Inductivist> Lee says we might be headed for a one-party system for decades and cited the PRI in Mexico as an example. If Trump loses, I pray we can keep the Senate to check Democrat power.
1314285969944715264 2020-10-09 03:26:08 +0800 <Inductivist> What is she talking about? They think Trump is dying from Covid? That he's crazy and must be replaced?
1314284926045360129 2020-10-09 03:21:59 +0800 <Inductivist> Trump told law-and-order right-wingers to let the police do their jobs, but, according to Whitmer, these nut jobs heard an order to kidnap the governor.

1314082404391297024 2020-10-08 13:57:14 +0800 <Inductivist> Instead of wasting our time with all their biased coverage, couldn't the Media reduce it all down to one, very short story: "Our story, yesterday, today, forever is that we hate Trump."
1314079598733262848 2020-10-08 13:46:05 +0800 <Inductivist> I fully expected Kamala at some point during the debate to call in a group of kids that she would start dancing with.
1314077588449443841 2020-10-08 13:38:06 +0800 <Inductivist> Let me expwain it to Wittle Petey Boy: Pown is a itty bitty sin. Aboshun on demand, big, big sin.
1314074297367838720 2020-10-08 13:25:01 +0800 <Inductivist> @ToBePrudential Amen.
1314074173057110016 2020-10-08 13:24:31 +0800 <Inductivist> Was anyone like me? I tried not to, but when Kamala piously said she was a person of deep faith, my mind flashed an image of her stretched out under Willie Brown. I'm awful.
1314072593452810241 2020-10-08 13:18:15 +0800 <Inductivist> We won't get an answer, so I think we have to go with Pence's claim: Silence means yes.   Hey, try to spin this positive. Think of the court-packing as providing more jobs to citizens during a rough economic time.
1314070506639773696 2020-10-08 13:09:57 +0800 <Inductivist> Kamala claimed "torture and murder."

1314049978537406467 2020-10-08 11:48:23 +0800 <Inductivist> If the polls are to be trusted--big if--it's a very close race in TX. If Trump ends up losing TX, what would the GOP conclude? Trump was terrible, it's his fault? And then not take a serious look in the mirror, find out what Americans want, and learn how to win?
1314048122738282498 2020-10-08 11:41:00 +0800 <Inductivist> New MN poll has Biden ahead by 7 points.  https://t.co/2PfoTzWQPK

1314041844444000256 2020-10-08 11:16:04 +0800 <Inductivist> No, not "a lot of people." Hardcore feminists saw that.   Ideology doesn't just describe reality. It gets involved and _affects_ reality.

1313964342488956928 2020-10-08 06:08:06 +0800 <Inductivist> @HbdNrx @hbdchick @AliceTeller Yes, I wonder if Covid-19 is going to change public health-related culture; that we need to get _serious_ about fighting disease.
1313962540284616704 2020-10-08 06:00:56 +0800 <Inductivist> If your audience accepts your view that Trump is a mass murderer (and Trump supporters consequently are his accomplices), what will they feel needs to be done to all of us to get justice?
1313961472007966720 2020-10-08 05:56:41 +0800 <Inductivist> Murder _requires_ deliberate intent, but at least your commentary is restrained.
1313960439965904896 2020-10-08 05:52:35 +0800 <Inductivist> If we want lots of people to get the vaccine when it becomes available, Gates would be wise to shut the hell up and stay out of it.
1313959012392554497 2020-10-08 05:46:55 +0800 <Inductivist> That's just what we need. Tens of millions of Americans now distrusting whatever comes out of the New England Journal of Medicine because it's partisan.
1313953516105342976 2020-10-08 05:25:04 +0800 <Inductivist> Outlier polls tend to receive the most press coverage, which is more evidence that you should not go to the Media to get a better sense of reality.
1313936939993632768 2020-10-08 04:19:12 +0800 <Inductivist> It's interesting that among the little pollsters, there are plenty that lean GOP, but among the biggies that conduct most of the polls, they're 80% Dem-leaning.

1313909856374411266 2020-10-08 02:31:35 +0800 <Inductivist> Trump has the positive effect of peeling the veneer of civility off of these snakes in suits.

1313699564864499712 2020-10-07 12:35:58 +0800 <Inductivist> Sean Penn thinks Trump faked Covid as a ploy to get sympathy. QAnon nobodies get purged from social media for nutty ideas, but Hollywood movie stars--people with actual pull--it's crickets.
1313696968082817024 2020-10-07 12:25:39 +0800 <Inductivist> Is the new immigration push going to be for refugees over families or immigration based on skills? What would the impact be on America? It would be disproportionately Middle Eastern, Muslim, and black, right?
1313693017782448128 2020-10-07 12:09:57 +0800 <Inductivist> Trump is so unique, if he loses and is out of the picture, it would be a prime opportunity for Dems to reach across the aisle and take serious steps to end the hyper-partisanship that is damaging the country. "Let's really start anew." What is the probability of that? 1%?
1313632867738509313 2020-10-07 08:10:56 +0800 <Inductivist> They'll be coming for us soon enough. In the eyes of elites, the HBD (human biodiversity) community probably has about as much credibility as QAnon.
1313628201944453120 2020-10-07 07:52:24 +0800 <Inductivist> A LE of 78 is for newborns, not older people. If you're 75, you've survived many years of risk. Your LE is _not_ 3 more years. It's significantly more.
1313628201109745664 2020-10-07 07:52:23 +0800 <Inductivist> Tucker Carlson's my man, but he made an error in yesterday's show. He said the median age at death for Covid is 78 and life expectancy (LE) is 78, suggesting Covid isn't causing any extra loss of life. ---&gt;
1313587334969847808 2020-10-07 05:10:00 +0800 <Inductivist> Funny how the two surveys showing the most extreme Biden leads were conducted by the two orgs that seem to dislike Trump the most--CNN and NBC.  https://t.co/AItBcwpvpj

She would probably govern much the same as a male progressive, but citing a President as evidence that discrimination is no longer a big thing is quite effective.

1312071029250912256 2020-10-03 00:44:45 +0800 <Inductivist> This is appreciated, but I'd be more convinced that you want to bring the country together by promising not to pack the Supreme Court.

1311886453924745219 2020-10-02 12:31:18 +0800 <Inductivist> Using the same FBI data (plus Census data), I calculated the murder ratio for younger vs. older adults (18-39 vs. 40 plus). Certainly, age has got to be the strongest demographic correlate of murder, right? The ratio is 4.3.
1311879317618454530 2020-10-02 12:02:57 +0800 <Inductivist> Amazing. I've said before that when it comes to homicide, blacks are the male-like group, but that needs revision: When it comes to homicide, men are the black-like group.
1311877517897158657 2020-10-02 11:55:48 +0800 <Inductivist> Research demonstrates that all psych traits are heritable. Does this argue for a Big Therapeutic State?

The Fat Cats keep their economic system in exchange for enabling Wokeism to prevail culturally? If true, those of us who dissent will have to shut up and go away or pay dearly.

1311547160882675717 2020-10-01 14:03:05 +0800 <Inductivist> @das2gate No. It would be white supremacy if laws prohibited individual blacks from advancing.
1311407787092500480 2020-10-01 04:49:15 +0800 <Inductivist> As always, this "stand by" scandal is idiotic. In response to Wallace asking if Trump should tell the Proud Boys to stand down--Wallace putting that term out there--Trump was trying to say it's the police's job to control violence, so get out of the way so they can do their job.
1311402609983459330 2020-10-01 04:28:41 +0800 <Inductivist> @expeedee Again, relying on the plain words, I would define Western chauvinism as being strongly pro-West.

1311187955889790977 2020-09-30 14:15:44 +0800 <Inductivist> Many folks were turned off by the ugliness of the debates, and I can agree, but I'll make a confession: I thought it was fun as hell. My son and I laughed a lot. You can shoot me now.
1311187257915658240 2020-09-30 14:12:57 +0800 <Inductivist> I can think of one way the debate might help Biden. I suspect undecideds were turned off by the ugliness and might not vote, and at least in 2016, undecideds tended to vote for Trump.
1311184209386459136 2020-09-30 14:00:50 +0800 <Inductivist> Chris Wallace displayed the typical elite bias on questions related to race. I swear these people are incapable of straight thinking on racial issues.
1311183241626357760 2020-09-30 13:57:00 +0800 <Inductivist> The "Fine People" hoax was debunked a long time ago, so why did Chris Wallace basically repeat it? If he's the top of his class, journalists are an embarrassment.
1311173740189810688 2020-09-30 13:19:14 +0800 <Inductivist> Interesting how Biden tried to downplay Antifa by calling it an ideology, while Christopher Wray seemed to say that white supremacists are the biggest threat because of ideology.

1311164065058705408 2020-09-30 12:40:48 +0800 <Inductivist> I could criticize Wallace on multiple points, but not challenging Biden (4 times like he did with Trump, for example, on climate change) on refusing to oppose stacking the Supreme Court and not condemning BLM and Antifa by name shows he failed to do a professional job.
1311159708351250433 2020-09-30 12:23:29 +0800 <Inductivist> I disagree that Trump totally botched the Critical Race Theory question, at least terms of strategy. Rather than turn it into a b-w issue, he made his typical move to focus on the country: He said it teaches people to hate America. Patriotic non-whites shouldn't like that either.
1311156875468001280 2020-09-30 12:12:13 +0800 <Inductivist> Can you believe Chris Wallace, an anchor for _Fox_, treated Critical Race Theory as if it is a helpful thing?!
1311057693709201408 2020-09-30 05:38:07 +0800 <Inductivist> In 2020, it's hard to imagine taking the view that America will get better and better. At this point, I think the most hopeful we can be is that it could possibly reach functional.

I assume Mormon leaders in the 19th century did not see black men as leaders, and churches, especially conservative ones, change slowly.
1311037525364858880 2020-09-30 04:17:58 +0800 <Inductivist> @Go321D @Starktruthradio Mormons go after anyone who will listen, and people of color, especially Hispanics, listen and respond. Their goal is very simple: convert as many souls as possible. I suspect the consequences are as you suggest.

1310967597785964545 2020-09-29 23:40:06 +0800 <Inductivist> It's so easy to imagine the Dems going this way. Why wouldn't they think that GOP voters cannot be trusted? After all, they put Trump in office, and they want to do it again. You don't play fair with fascists.
1310788389801586689 2020-09-29 11:48:00 +0800 <Inductivist> It's silly to think that Wall Street owns the GOP and not the Dems. Wall Street gave a lot more to Obama than McCain, for example.

1310408355513421824 2020-09-28 10:37:52 +0800 <Inductivist> Looking at 2016 poll trends, Trump got a really big bounce the second half of October in most swing states for some reason. It wasn't due to Comey reopening the email probe since he did that at the end of October. What would have caused the big bounce? The debates?

1310309333733797888 2020-09-28 04:04:24 +0800 <Inductivist> Yes. Respect. I, for one, felt very respected when Biden said we we're going to put black people back in chains.

The total listed by the FBI is 6,570 total homicides, but according to the CDC, there are about 19.5k murders per year. According to the FBI source, 8% of murders are black-on-white, so that would be a total of ~1,500. Still rare

1310071849410162688 2020-09-27 12:20:43 +0800 <Inductivist> I see "WE BACK" is trending. Should I take the professor's view that many cultures drop the verb, or the jerk's view that "WE BACK" sounds really stupid?
1310070705778638848 2020-09-27 12:16:10 +0800 <Inductivist> The difference between progs and us on criminal justice: They fret about the criminals, we fret about the victims.
1310068476292206594 2020-09-27 12:07:19 +0800 <Inductivist> Interesting, and a state that has experienced rioting.
1310068107868741637 2020-09-27 12:05:51 +0800 <Inductivist> Mr. Kendi, you have a point: Separation is the way to go.
1309987500337709056 2020-09-27 06:45:33 +0800 <Inductivist> Why do Twitter and the Media go with Leftist self-descriptions, but they insist on labeling everyone to the right of Biden the "far right"?
1309987499008122880 2020-09-27 06:45:32 +0800 <Inductivist> Twitter is calling the rallies today "anti-fascist." The use of this term is a lie. These people hate cops, they hate the Establishment, they hate capitalism, and they hate conservatives, but please show me an opponent of theirs who's is big fan of Mussolini.
1309984672617701397 2020-09-27 06:34:18 +0800 <Inductivist> Have the Dems calculated that the Affordable Care Act is more popular than protecting abortion? That surprises me.
1309940900596822016 2020-09-27 03:40:22 +0800 <Inductivist> Okay, this was meant to be a joke, right, but Biden flubbed it because he's reading from the teleprompter and not ready for what's coming next.
1309940157508771840 2020-09-27 03:37:25 +0800 <Inductivist> Point taken, Joe, but what's your view on the heritability of all psychological traits, including intelligence?
1309935281974333440 2020-09-27 03:18:03 +0800 <Inductivist> I like her already.

1309917474620547072 2020-09-27 02:07:17 +0800 <Inductivist> @ILoveKittens79 So true.
1309915806461878273 2020-09-27 02:00:39 +0800 <Inductivist> The newest poll (Suffolk, leans Dem) has Biden up by 6.
1309909215582928896 2020-09-27 01:34:28 +0800 <Inductivist> Joe Biden's strategy seems to be to wait out the clock with the hope that his supposed lead will last through the election. It might work, the Media certainly abets it, but I'm not so sure.
1309897152047374336 2020-09-27 00:46:32 +0800 <Inductivist> Ironic how officials of the state side with revolutionaries against forces who want the state/law to be respected.  https://t.co/mBX5mwLbiM

1309676000259661824 2020-09-26 10:07:45 +0800 <Inductivist> According to research, blacks are more likely to be executed because they commit capital crimes (e.g., killing witnesses) at much higher rates. On the other hand, blacks typically kill blacks &amp; jurors tend to feel less emotional connection to black victims, which lowers the risk.
1309669935354843136 2020-09-26 09:43:39 +0800 <Inductivist> New poll (ALG, leans Dem) puts Biden at 47% and Trump at 43% in NV.  https://t.co/laI6z4mxrX

1309667003406319616 2020-09-26 09:32:00 +0800 <Inductivist> 1968 Democrats.
1309666448483082241 2020-09-26 09:29:48 +0800 <Inductivist> @doctorzirk Those are proportions, not percentages. To make them percentages, you need to move the decimals two places to the right.
1309623971768184832 2020-09-26 06:41:01 +0800 <Inductivist> @expeedee @BenWinegard At first, I thought it was funny, but then I heard the subsequent two comments. He said something like "This is a dull bunch." And "They must be slow," in a tone, so now I'm not so sure it was good-hearted.
1309621119352074241 2020-09-26 06:29:41 +0800 <Inductivist> This should be a central goal, people.
1309620678971158528 2020-09-26 06:27:56 +0800 <Inductivist> Here comes more slime than Nickelodeon. At least it won't be boring.
1309614746707009536 2020-09-26 06:04:21 +0800 <Inductivist> Dems willfully distort Trump. He's not a fascist. He tries to win over Americans by criticizing foreigners and sweet-talking citizens, just the kind of thing you would expect from a politician.
1309607721067409409 2020-09-26 05:36:26 +0800 <Inductivist> Hot damn.
1309581899271032832 2020-09-26 03:53:50 +0800 <Inductivist> It looks like Fox got the numbers wrong. Journalists can't do math.
1309570870692556805 2020-09-26 03:10:00 +0800 <Inductivist> Question: Roughly 10 citizens are killed for each officer killed in the US. What should the ratio be, or is that even a useful question to ask?
1309569624195784704 2020-09-26 03:05:03 +0800 <Inductivist> The endless protests/riots seem to be escalating without leading to police reform. What will their next escalation be?
1309569165003374592 2020-09-26 03:03:14 +0800 <Inductivist> There are hundreds of blacks killed by police each year. If there are multiple, nationwide protests/riots for each one, well, you do the math.
1309549216159510528 2020-09-26 01:43:58 +0800 <Inductivist> @JayMan471 That kid is so damn cute, I think the actual effect of the ad is to increase fertility.
1309547768189345793 2020-09-26 01:38:12 +0800 <Inductivist> Seven swing states have seen huge increases in gun sales, and many of those are "assault weapons" so the GOP needs to remind voters that Biden wants to ban those kinds of guns.
1309543359287975936 2020-09-26 01:20:41 +0800 <Inductivist> Why hasn't Moderate, I-Will-Restrain-The-Left Joe Biden: 1) condemned Antifa and BLM by name, and 2) promised to oppose ending the filibuster, court-packing, and US Senate seat expansion? This signals who's going to run the show if he wins.
1309536304636391424 2020-09-26 00:52:39 +0800 <Inductivist> @karl_taranis Right, what did he get--over 400 years in prison, something like that.
1309530853928628225 2020-09-26 00:31:00 +0800 <Inductivist> @365_Guards I agree.

1309368619709509634 2020-09-25 13:46:20 +0800 <Inductivist> Please explain to me why the person in the Prius was arrested.
1309365559293652993 2020-09-25 13:34:10 +0800 <Inductivist> A rioter who hits a cop with a bat should rot in jail.
1309364532133810177 2020-09-25 13:30:05 +0800 <Inductivist> _Everybody_ knows Prius owners are white supremacists.
1309351140153147392 2020-09-25 12:36:53 +0800 <Inductivist> Interesting how you are much, much more likely to be killed by a cop than the state.

1309203322616705026 2020-09-25 02:49:30 +0800 <Inductivist> @jcd1974 Exactly. Racism doesn't cost America, but race does.
1309201062276997120 2020-09-25 02:40:31 +0800 <Inductivist> I hope this is a trend among the Left.
1309194998009622528 2020-09-25 02:16:25 +0800 <Inductivist> @SlavLives I wouldn't do it, but then again, I'm not a gambler.
1309193608654761984 2020-09-25 02:10:54 +0800 <Inductivist> It's nice to know imagination is not dead in America.

1309001709730050048 2020-09-24 13:28:22 +0800 <Inductivist> Why didn't the journalists ask which white supremacist group did the shooting?
1308999358902415360 2020-09-24 13:19:01 +0800 <Inductivist> Evidence of police improvements over the past few decades: In the old days, I'm not sure the suspect would last long.
1308994812813676545 2020-09-24 13:00:57 +0800 <Inductivist> According to my experience, Hispanics overall feel less social distance from whites than blacks.

1308992712130146306 2020-09-24 12:52:37 +0800 <Inductivist> Given a stop, whites are just as likely to be arrested. Given an arrest, whites are just as likely to be charged. Given a charge, whites are just as likely to be convicted. Given a conviction, b's are more likely to do time &amp; get a longer sentence bc they have longer rap sheets.
1308986678263066626 2020-09-24 12:28:38 +0800 <Inductivist> I'll make a prediction. University researchers who have been so objective in developing policing science over the past 50 years will throw all that work out the window for Wokeism. You will no longer see serious research in the area.
1308983348375752704 2020-09-24 12:15:24 +0800 <Inductivist> The officers were shot at by Ms. Taylor's b/f before they returned fire. Ms. Taylor got caught in the exchange. The officers were not charged because it is perfectly legal and right to return fire when you are shot at. The b/f admitted to shooting w/o knowing what was going on.
1308974669446475777 2020-09-24 11:40:55 +0800 <Inductivist> @NathanM_Bassist Spot on.

1308902325562605568 2020-09-24 06:53:27 +0800 <Inductivist> I think I will make an awesome political prisoner: "It goes without saying that The Supreme Leader is the Source of All Wisdom and Truth. I recite the Ten Principles of Monolithic Ideology each night before bed."
1308898896689664008 2020-09-24 06:39:49 +0800 <Inductivist> Leaders worry all the time about the cops looking and acting too bad ass toward Leftist protesters/rioters, but they never seem to worry about the possibility that a cowardly acting police leads to widespread public fear, then this👇
1308896624870121473 2020-09-24 06:30:48 +0800 <Inductivist> The thoughts of a Lefty upon seeing this: "Huh, guys with AR-15s. Wouldn't it be cool if I ran over there and bashed one in the head with my skateboard?!"
1308878537529712641 2020-09-24 05:18:55 +0800 <Inductivist> Of course, if you look at a book on political prisoners in the US, you learn immediately they are only on the Left. Funny how all the terrorists are white supremacists, and they're all on the loose, but all the political prisoners are Leftists.

1308845792590004225 2020-09-24 03:08:48 +0800 <Inductivist> Officials undermine their credibility with statements like this. Where are the crimes? Ideology is irrelevant if nobody ever does anything. NYT writes about Emmett Till all the time, &amp; that happened 65 yrs ago. WS crimes are going to get Media attention.  https://t.co/zUZOcVXm3f
1308822378147848193 2020-09-24 01:35:46 +0800 <Inductivist> This is suspicious language. It makes it sound like Trump ritualistically says the same exact phrases any time he gets off the phone with a Jewish lawmaker. BS election manipulation.

According to the law, shooting at an armed mob that hunts you down and assaults you on the ground is _self-defense_, not 1st degree murder.
1308651619064578048 2020-09-23 14:17:14 +0800 <Inductivist> To make it look like they're doing something, Biden and the Dems want to target mostly white, mostly legal guns that will help no one instead of illegal, mostly black guns (think Bloomberg) that actually saves lives.

1308621613491875841 2020-09-23 12:18:00 +0800 <Inductivist> @BombPuddle I'm at a loss. I thought the rioting would shift the country Right a few points, especially in states hit with riots like MN, but you are absolutely correct. The drift seems leftward in MN, MI, and WI. Maybe the polls are screwy. Maybe those states are really worried about Covid.
1308620350083575808 2020-09-23 12:12:59 +0800 <Inductivist> Are we witnessing the emergence of two new parties: The America Firsters vs. the Globalists? I hope so.
1308618334477250560 2020-09-23 12:04:58 +0800 <Inductivist> Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you.
1308617524284514304 2020-09-23 12:01:45 +0800 <Inductivist> Yes, we need to pursue a New Southern Strategy. Not racial, but a strategy that incidentally protects the interests of white folks.  Despite what many now say, they're people, too.
1308616063433629696 2020-09-23 11:55:57 +0800 <Inductivist> Watch the video clip with Senator Hatch.

I seem to recall him pushing hate crimes legislation.

1306805944999841792 2020-09-18 12:03:11 +0800 <Inductivist> #ImVotingForBiden because, while he is suffering from cognitive decline and probably won't be able to complete a single term, at least he's not a bombastic blowhard.
1306804555024195584 2020-09-18 11:57:39 +0800 <Inductivist> Nancy, what are you responding to? Some tough congressional races somewhere? The peak of the destruction was _months_ ago.
1306775773047451648 2020-09-18 10:03:17 +0800 <Inductivist> You are delusional. No one will fall for the "it's actually Trump who's suffering from cognitive decline" trick.
1306764809812152320 2020-09-18 09:19:43 +0800 <Inductivist> Joe, you seem to be fighting for the people who work hard at trashing our cities and attacking our cops.
1306760072513556480 2020-09-18 09:00:54 +0800 <Inductivist> Right, ironic though that Park Avenue is more interested in what we want than Scranton is.
1306758794685288448 2020-09-18 08:55:49 +0800 <Inductivist> If race is a social designation, then the only way it can be faked is if the audience doesn't buy it.
1306738413094150144 2020-09-18 07:34:50 +0800 <Inductivist> Folks, please guide me to polls that ask whites if they feel they should dominate other races. I've never seen this asked before. Ever. Why never asked? I suspect that researchers know the numbers are too low to bother.
1306736893443207169 2020-09-18 07:28:48 +0800 <Inductivist> New poll (Monmouth, leans Dem) has Kelly over McSally 50% v. 46%.  https://t.co/orQw8hglmM
1306733907392344065 2020-09-18 07:16:56 +0800 <Inductivist> White-self esteem ranges from "I'm as good as anyone" to "My race is cancer," but not even 0.1% think the white race should dominate others.
1306728277369733120 2020-09-18 06:54:33 +0800 <Inductivist> Folks, I'm confident that the FBI relies on the absolute gold standard to understand the domestic terrorism threat: The Southern Poverty Law Center.
1306727644751212544 2020-09-18 06:52:02 +0800 <Inductivist> Every time I do business with people, I don't advocate for myself. I deal with people strictly as a disinterested observer. How well do you think I'm doing?
1306721993727721473 2020-09-18 06:29:35 +0800 <Inductivist> Any country that can't take its own side deserves what it gets.
1306721487944966144 2020-09-18 06:27:35 +0800 <Inductivist> Clearly, we don't see the myriad rightist terror activities going on because they get covered up by the white supremacist Media.

1306642907873468416 2020-09-18 01:15:20 +0800 <Inductivist> Let's see, 1997 is 23 years ago. Who can calculate the odds that this news came out by coincidence 6 weeks before the election?
1306641371625746438 2020-09-18 01:09:13 +0800 <Inductivist> Doesn't the Left think we're fascists because we feel we're being dispossessed and have a problem with that?

1306277373415833600 2020-09-17 01:02:49 +0800 <Inductivist> LeBron lies and encourages cop executions by saying "We're being hunted." Officer/citizen encounters are responses to calls in over 90% of cases, you moron. Here we have _actual_ hunting taking place, hunting down the police. Step up, LeBron, and match the reward money.
1306274780824305670 2020-09-17 00:52:31 +0800 <Inductivist> They both suck. Ideology kills science, and which ideology dominates science these days? It ain't conservatism.

1306271140164165635 2020-09-17 00:38:03 +0800 <Inductivist> If Trump can win battlegrounds where polls say it's within 2 points--GA, TX, OH, NC, FL; if he can pull off PA where supposedly he's down 4-5 points; and if he can pick off one small state where he's supposedly down about 5 points--AZ, NV, NH--he squeeks out a win.
1306264862058713093 2020-09-17 00:13:06 +0800 <Inductivist> You can't trust polls. Yesterday, Morning Consult had Biden ahead 3-4 points in MN. Today, with basically the same time frame, ABC/WP finds he's up by 16-17 points in MN. Which is it?  https://t.co/o6i2UfVlhL
1306105858854498309 2020-09-16 13:41:17 +0800 <Inductivist> I'm not responsible for her ancestors owning slaves either.
1306102267662143488 2020-09-16 13:27:01 +0800 <Inductivist> They haven't respected guns for self-defense for a long time. They see two purposes for guns: 1) to hunt (they don't like that either); or 2) to use in the commission of a crime. "Kill someone to protect yourself? Barbaric." "Target shooting for _fun_? Scary."
1306000750338666497 2020-09-16 06:43:37 +0800 <Inductivist> Please. Biden recently claimed that Trump _wanted_ tens of thousands of Americans dead. Biden can survive the suggestion that he's a pedo. It's politics in 2020.
1305999961776037888 2020-09-16 06:40:29 +0800 <Inductivist> Elite institutions are obsessed with vilifying whites, so when whites understandably defend themselves, they get called obsessive.
1305979853200482304 2020-09-16 05:20:35 +0800 <Inductivist> Let's be honest. In 2020, if there is some pundit or writer who has _not_ been called a racist, sexist, or homophobe, they're not worth reading.
1305959971608121345 2020-09-16 04:01:35 +0800 <Inductivist> @Tuesday81865744 Surveys are typically not designed to produce county or city estimates. Researchers use the proxy of % of suicides committed with guns to get a county-level measure, but it is indirect.
1305906497222619136 2020-09-16 00:29:06 +0800 <Inductivist> And you wonder why conservatives tend to be skeptical of your findings. It's been obvious for a long time you are a part of the Left.

1305738892763525120 2020-09-15 13:23:06 +0800 <Inductivist> I haven't followed this, but I have seen twitter followers post QAnon stuff. I didn't get the impression that the villains are supposed to be Jewish. Did I miss that?
1305696301237985283 2020-09-15 10:33:51 +0800 <Inductivist> Maybe this if how the Dems will "reimagine" policing. Cops won't be able to use lethal force under any conditions, at least against minorities. How long would it take criminals to kill the country's police force (~800k)?
1305671749866905600 2020-09-15 08:56:18 +0800 <Inductivist> Makes sense for Trump to move away from law and order and stress the economy--one of the few areas where he leads Sleepy Joe.   https://t.co/I3sv5wga3v
1305670068554985473 2020-09-15 08:49:37 +0800 <Inductivist> Evidently, senior citizen support is down for Trump, which helps explain why he isn't leading against Sleepy Joe. I suspect many of them want a tougher Covid approach from Trump.  My conservative parents are scared.  https://t.co/VnEmQrT8sj

1305608381961363456 2020-09-15 04:44:29 +0800 <Inductivist> The focus there is outcomes, not process. Why don't we ever hear about studies about _how_ exactly unfair treatment unfolds? The answer is because it doesn't happen. The process _is_ fair. The outcomes are different because groups are different.
1305608380988309505 2020-09-15 04:44:29 +0800 <Inductivist> I've noticed that progressives were traditionally interested in ensuring a fair _process_. Qualitative researchers criticize quantoids for focusing on social structure rather than the dynamic of social process. That is until the subject turns to inequality.---&gt;
1305605976041467904 2020-09-15 04:34:56 +0800 <Inductivist> There tends to be an arms race among gangs. In "West Side Story," they used to rumble with fists, knives, and chains, then it was cheap guns in the 70s, then it was expensive guns with real killing capacity in the 80s as drug money made them affordable.
1305604995459424256 2020-09-15 04:31:02 +0800 <Inductivist> One important factor for elections is "likability" and Joe is more likable than Hillary.
1305603339149737984 2020-09-15 04:24:27 +0800 <Inductivist> @ConceptualDoc @Go321D There is no doubt that guns are correlated with wide-open spaces. This is true around the world, not just the US.
1305602492906926080 2020-09-15 04:21:05 +0800 <Inductivist> @Steve_Sailer @robkhenderson Black gangbangers used fists or knives prior to the Black Panthers. Some have hypothesized that in the 70s dads weren't around to teach black boys to fistfight, so they turned to guns--at first cheap, then expensive--to handle disputes.
1305600292415705089 2020-09-15 04:12:21 +0800 <Inductivist> You might respond that Vermont is white, gun-owning, and blue, but the gun ownership rate there is actually slightly lower than the national average at 28.8%.
1305597878010748928 2020-09-15 04:02:45 +0800 <Inductivist> Interesting that NM is one of the top gun-owning states in the country, but seems reliably blue. You'd think widespread guns indicates conservatism, but perhaps demographics overwhelms all else. The state is, what, 40% Hispanic? Same story for Hawaii. Many guns, nonwhites, blue.  https://t.co/PV3Hr8iCq4
1305541458145943553 2020-09-15 00:18:34 +0800 <Inductivist> As a parent, you look around for heroes to teach your kids about. A big thank you to the Left for giving us a new set of heroes.  https://t.co/33dBV1CruE
1305388764143910913 2020-09-14 14:11:48 +0800 <Inductivist> Something like 950 suspects who threaten cops with guns or knives are killed each year. To bring down the numbers, we need fewer criminals charging cops with knives and guns.

1305367003545313281 2020-09-14 12:45:20 +0800 <Inductivist> Joe lies. Progressive Duke University Philip J. Cook, perhaps the leading gun researcher in the country, concluded with others that the ban was ineffective.
1305365106356748290 2020-09-14 12:37:48 +0800 <Inductivist> Folks, it's getting harder and harder to tell parody from reality.
1305363926087991296 2020-09-14 12:33:07 +0800 <Inductivist> Ha! This guy pulled a Larry David. Three men robbed him, so he pretended to have a heart attack. But then comes a gentile twist. He faked in order to get his gun,  then he shot one of the criminals.  https://t.co/hOxOMQFAhw
1305362110357016582 2020-09-14 12:25:54 +0800 <Inductivist> Even liberal researchers admit the 1994-2004 assault weapons ban did not lower violent crime. Dems just like to screw their political opponents.
1305361021503025155 2020-09-14 12:21:34 +0800 <Inductivist> Translation: We're fine with our constituents rampaging with illegal handguns through American cities, but you law-abiding Trump supporters shouldn't legally own those scary-looking rifles. Our violence is fine. Your peaceful self-protection is unacceptable.
1305356919217897472 2020-09-14 12:05:16 +0800 <Inductivist> Let me guess. BLM and Antifa will trash Lancaster, then Biden will go up 5 points in PA.
1305344626782420993 2020-09-14 11:16:25 +0800 <Inductivist> Hey Joe, our side is with you if you want to aggressively confiscate guns from criminals, but you folks seem to dislike law-abiding people owning guns, and so nothing gets done. Or you let rioters run all summer, and out of fear Americans buy guns by the millions.
1305318214914637824 2020-09-14 09:31:28 +0800 <Inductivist> @OverDerHill I'm reminded of the movie "Hell or High Water." The two brothers are robbing a Southern bank, a good ol' boy is at a counter, and one brother says, "Are you carrying?" The old guy answers, "Of course, I'm carrying."
1305316233110151168 2020-09-14 09:23:36 +0800 <Inductivist> It looks to me like conservatives are very constrained and aggressive BLM types are not very smart. At least in less restrictive states, I bet as much as 10-20% of conservative men carry a concealed weapon in approved public spaces.
1305314373846482945 2020-09-14 09:16:12 +0800 <Inductivist> Am I right that whites that work closely w lots of blacks, are married to blacks, etc., tend to absorb their attitudes on race? Blacks are passionate, so whites say, "I'm uncomfortable w this, they seem so sure," as if having been hassled once makes you an expert on policing.
1305221560005869568 2020-09-14 03:07:24 +0800 <Inductivist> Unbelievable.   https://t.co/HpG1d3PzM4

1305181896582725632 2020-09-14 00:29:47 +0800 <Inductivist> According to battleground state polls (they slant Dem), Biden's slim lead generally been very steady since April, but there has been a gradual widening in WI, PA, and MI.  https://t.co/ajzqFMcugS

This study reported 7% as their conservative estimate of the % of all men who are pedophiles, and 5-21% of male college students admit to sexual interest in children.
1304640273050300416 2020-09-12 12:37:34 +0800 <Inductivist> I sense skepticism. I just tracked down a random article to back up my claim (based on previous reading). It reports that studies find from 4-50% (!) of childcare workers have sexually abused kids. An expose of Choate Boarding School found 10% of its faculty were guilty of ---&gt;
1304627338492010496 2020-09-12 11:46:10 +0800 <Inductivist> I see people tweeting that most pedophiles are in church. Typical liberal libel.

1303040355340673024 2020-09-08 02:40:04 +0800 <Inductivist> If Biden wins, we won't return to "normalcy." In the minds of many Dems, the election of Trump just proved that half the country is fascist, and strong measures are needed to make sure the fascists don't take power again.

1302744405833428992 2020-09-07 07:04:04 +0800 <Inductivist> I get the sense that since American Marxists were unsuccessful with a socialist revolution, they've schemed to find conflicts other than class that might be more effective at getting people to revolt.

1302712896703442946 2020-09-07 04:58:52 +0800 <Inductivist> @LTF_01 Right, cops in the 60s were really worried about what college kids thought.
1302694767009042432 2020-09-07 03:46:50 +0800 <Inductivist> Surveys do not indicate that a high percentage of whites think their racial identity is important, but this study supports the view of "under the hood" (no pun intended) identity or "implicit whiteness."

1302681193398239232 2020-09-07 02:52:53 +0800 <Inductivist> If I'm right about this, Dems are stupid people, or they're pretending to take Trump's language (or alleged language) seriously to try to gain political advantage.

Trump says nasty things when he gets attacked, but his affection for the military/cops seems real.

1301018737219231744 2020-09-02 12:46:53 +0800 <Inductivist> An offender's race plays no noteworthy role in the likelihood of arrest for the crime of forcible rape. These findings suggest that the disproportionately high arrest rate for black citizens is most likely attributable to differential involvement in reported crime rather than to
1301018736376164353 2020-09-02 12:46:53 +0800 <Inductivist> Multivariate logistic regression results show that the odds of arrest for white offenders is approximately 22% higher for robbery, 13% higher for aggravated assault, and 9% higher for simple assault than they are for black offenders.--&gt;
1301018735466000384 2020-09-02 12:46:52 +0800 <Inductivist> The baseline model for these comparisons is the equiprobability hypothesis that relative to violation frequency as reported by crime victims, the likelihood of arrest for white and black offenders is roughly equal.--&gt;

1300900295140978689 2020-09-02 04:56:14 +0800 <Inductivist> There is a downside to widespread legal gun purchases. Many criminals get their guns from law-abiding owners: they steal them (&gt; 200k/yr), buy or borrow them, or get them as gifts. They sell them to other criminals. And the black community has a higher % of criminals.

In their admirable objectivity and desire to douse the flames of violence, the Media say "black man" when it's an armed black man, and "unarmed black man" if he's unarmed and perhaps driving at officers with a vehicle.
