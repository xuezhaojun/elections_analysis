1327284150144032768 2020-11-14 00:16:15 +0800 <breakfixbreak> It's a DNA altering mRNA vaccine. Wait until the long term effects start crop up. Although, I suppose they can always just blame those effects on COVID25 as they give us another shot.

Handing out money and requiring you spend it and not have a chance to save/ invest is completely different however.   The biggest benefactors of this aren't going to be the people. It'll be big business. It's a cooperate stimulus package.

With a name like #BlackLivesMatter and backing from the #DNC, #CNN, and most the rest of the #FakeNewsMedia it makes it feel a lot more legitimate than say Boko Haram.  Either way terror shouldn't be allowed any foothold foreign or domestic.

Just look at John Podesta, he served under Bill Clinton, advised Obama, and ran Hillary's campaign. This is the kind of art he hangs on his wall. Strange sick stuff...  https://t.co/C8CB0qx91m

1308791623967539202 2020-09-23 23:33:33 +0800 <breakfixbreak> @Steve_Zowietje Nudity isn't overly problematic in and of itself. However, being willing to expose yourself on display in front of children isn't normal.   On nudists I'm not aware of studys that go over the outcomes for children vs non nudists. Regardless this is not that.

1308085294948921352 2020-09-22 00:46:52 +0800 <breakfixbreak> This needs to stop. The normalisation of this is getting far too out of hand.  #UltraStripsDown #SaveOurChildren #ChildrensLivesMatter   https://t.co/tBn109JbdS

Outrightly dismissing Serrapeptase when it can and does help a lot of woman suffering with this specific condition is bizarre.   Supplements are an extremely broad umbrella.
