1316047782835298308 2020-10-14 00:06:57 +0800 <jo_USA_> @Johnny_Lethal @AaronBlake @seungminkim Because Republicans controlled the Senate, and Democrats did not have enough votes to confirm. They could have held the vote and all voted no, just like the Democrats will now. So to save time they told Obama they would NOT vote to confirm, so no hearing were necessary.

1301720368307208198 2020-09-04 11:14:55 +0800 <jo_USA_> @schlorp23 @bryceaz03 Why would a 24 yr old be with a 14 year old? I don't care how mature anyone thinks a 14 yro is, a 24 yro should NOT be having sex with them. It's a big leap from a 16 yro with a 19 yro, or 17 with 20.  10 years is just wrong.
