The mob fired shots at the time of the bag video. Kyle stopped to see who was shooting and was then assaulted. A 17 year kid running and facing multiple lethal threats. I have huge admiration for his defence against this mob of armed thugs.

He only shot violent criminals when assaulted.  You are defending a rioting anarchic mob that caused over $2million in damages. Every shot victim had violence records. Kyle had none.

Britain would mount huge rescue missions which became a new wave of border movement to protect established industry at the border. Enterprise paid the bills and needed protecting.

They had all the means to go out onto a mostly savage world(not India) and develop wealth via industry. Large scale wars were rare, mostly frontier policing.

Extreme poverty is the real reason the rate dropped to 2+. Foreign aid very likely accelerated that direction. Bangladesh is one of the most densely overpopulated places on earth today.

If you have 5% inflation you need a 10% rise for your experience. It becomes painfull around 2-3%. Each percent rise is exponential.

1330600884515037187 2020-11-23 03:55:46 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @piloting @AnnCoulter None the less, it only takes a small percentage of antisocial imports to upset a stable community and tip it into crime or poverty. The poor areas suffer not the nice ones we live in. Legal migration avoids that real risk.
1330596123367632900 2020-11-23 03:36:51 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @piloting @AnnCoulter Illegal ones are not. They include people on the run, mental health issues, illiterates, people who slip into petty crime etc . Legal ones have no such issues generally.

1326289852774682625 2020-11-11 06:25:16 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @AbriiD @SaraBoschiJones @afneil Trump got Senate Supreme Court and 10 more house seats. Bye bye crazy Nancy.
1326288975947034629 2020-11-11 06:21:47 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @afneil And what if 60,000 are falsely included provisional Biden ballots?

1326244151193722881 2020-11-11 03:23:40 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @JuliaHB1 @LozzaFox Count illegal votes? Not really.

1326226756790005761 2020-11-11 02:14:33 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @livinginmarseil @LBC First to mention race is always the racist, mr racist.
1326226508818604032 2020-11-11 02:13:34 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @helterskelter49 @LBC Hence the corruption. Dems are still counting very late unknown ballots apparently to go past the  .5%. Court will decide. Large scale ballot manipulation on eg provisional votes may come to light.
1326211568422498306 2020-11-11 01:14:12 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @henrybutcher56 @LBC Counting illegal votes cast long before and after voting is the betrayal of democracy. Can smell this rat from Mars.
1326210940149391363 2020-11-11 01:11:42 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @gregshum @PardesSeleh Lets wait and see. It's only a few predictable states so depends on the scale of fraud and how quickly they find it.
1326210185107542019 2020-11-11 01:08:42 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @livinginmarseil @LBC Indeed. But the (D) fraud is  exponentially higher in the corrupt inner cities.
1326209754033745920 2020-11-11 01:06:59 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @henrybutcher56 @LBC Bad news for you then. They have the senate, supreme court, and more house seats meaning Crazy Nancy will be voted out soon. Half her own team despise her.

1326206913722408961 2020-11-11 00:55:42 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @helterskelter49 @LBC That's Wisconsin. Penn and Georgia are .5%.

1326160922902224898 2020-11-10 21:52:57 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @henrybutcher56 @LBC Oops. There must be some evidence then. Your bad.  https://t.co/MZRtTBfbhJ

1326135330286809088 2020-11-10 20:11:15 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @LBC Good. Fraudulent votes should be exposed even if he still loses a recount.
1326135010966073344 2020-11-10 20:09:59 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @dave_saul1 @DAaronovitch @MaajidNawaz Its irrelevant if you adore Biden or not. The result should not be declared by one side alone so early if it is in dispute. If a big tranche of fraudulent votes are exposed then others come into question too. Needs at least weeks to resolve not days.
1326125517838446592 2020-11-10 19:32:16 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @quadzeus @MaajidNawaz Republicans are exactly are saying the court will decide. Not just Trump. Illegal votes, premature declarations of winning and censorship erode democracy.

1326104281758527488 2020-11-10 18:07:53 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @dave_saul1 @DAaronovitch @MaajidNawaz Are you serious. Did you forget Russiagate? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Selective memory.  And courts very much do decide elections. Any council can rig elections without them.
1326099716334039040 2020-11-10 17:49:44 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @Cantor_Omen @iamjasonface @MaajidNawaz Not sure if thats actually true. After all the MSM keeps lieing about Trump's "some are good people" quote. If MSM says it,  it's probably out of context to suit a narrative.
1326098302853591040 2020-11-10 17:44:07 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @quadzeus @MaajidNawaz It is still democracy. You can argue Trump is a poor politician as are all. But that is part of valid working trustable democracy. Censorship is not.
1326097205510500352 2020-11-10 17:39:46 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @DaveARichards @iamjasonface @MaajidNawaz Incredibly, the MSM narrative is claiming not even minor frauds happened which happen in every election. Clear falsehood.
1326096626067386373 2020-11-10 17:37:27 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @quadzeus @MaajidNawaz ..which is censorship. Maybe there was grand fraud we dont know this early. It's been 3 days and evidence takes weeks minimum. Let the discussion happen. That is good democracy.
1326095652921757696 2020-11-10 17:33:35 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @Sclarkeo @iamjasonface @MaajidNawaz 80% vote by aged home voters fir Democrats is abnormal. 100k provisional votes is astronomically abnormal.
1326095204923953152 2020-11-10 17:31:49 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @MaajidNawaz Indeed. And the MSM narrative of "no evidence of fraud" is clearly false. Fraud exists in EVERY election.  The question should be how much and is it increasing.
1326093944720076801 2020-11-10 17:26:48 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @SmartBusSol @KonstantinKisin @MaajidNawaz Depends on what levels of vote fraud come out and how fast. If industrial fixing is revealled in just one State it questions others.
1326093368183676928 2020-11-10 17:24:31 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @KonstantinKisin @MaajidNawaz We have reached a point where even questioning the ascension of Jesus Biden is becoming blasphemous.
1326092591813824512 2020-11-10 17:21:26 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @MaajidNawaz Indeed. If a few billionaire MSM owners can idustrially hide electoral fraud then it corrodes our trust in democracy.
1326090854830923776 2020-11-10 17:14:32 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @DAaronovitch @MaajidNawaz But the media have ACTUALLY crowned a man before the opposition concedes defeat or before the result is legally recognised by courts.  That is dangerously corrupt imo. A few billionaire media owners are attempting to control power.
1326088445190664192 2020-11-10 17:04:57 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @DickDelingpole @MikeSwadling Billionaire run MSM.
1326088135902711809 2020-11-10 17:03:43 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @MaajidNawaz The MSM lemmings think voter fraud comes out instantly. It takes time to gather that evidence.
1326087507772125184 2020-11-10 17:01:14 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @iamjasonface @DaveARichards @MaajidNawaz "Documented". Places times dates.
1326085748613844993 2020-11-10 16:54:14 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @MaajidNawaz The media should at least be open and investigate claims rather than censoring all mention. Really bad like living in a one party state.
1326085148744544256 2020-11-10 16:51:51 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @DaveARichards @iamjasonface @MaajidNawaz There are websites listing hundreds of documented irregularities if you look. Dont expect the billionaire owned MSM to show you.
1326084668656119808 2020-11-10 16:49:57 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @iamjasonface @MaajidNawaz The evidence is in eg 100k provisional votes accepted in Pennsylvania. Normally there are a few hundreds. The lop sided 80% Biden absentee vote in Democrat areas is also not normal.
1326083837470846978 2020-11-10 16:46:38 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @quadzeus @MaajidNawaz If we dont discuss fraud, it expands no matter how big or small. Censorship is totalitarian.

1325869002099486720 2020-11-10 02:32:58 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @jeremy_farage Random google search there. Chicago had 100+ black on black crime deaths on fathers day. Are you even aware that violent crime rate is highest by blacks in America? Dodging the fact?
1325845044037816321 2020-11-10 00:57:46 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @jeremy_farage Disingenuous. You ignored the obvious maths that higher rate of shootings is in proportion to higher rate of black crime.

1323733410263740416 2020-11-04 05:06:53 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @IanKirkEllis @Jacob_Rees_Mogg Agree on that.

And anyone not making an effort to better themselves can't be encouraged. I'd have tougher controls on globalist billionaires behaviour not their profits.

Uncontrolled billionaires think nothing of importing wage poverty if it raises their profits 1% for example. But trickle down does work and Bezos and Gates deserve every penny given the vast number of jobs and wealth they create.Every town competes for amz depots.

But there is a limit when that development means too many people and concrete leading to lower quality of life in tinier spaces. Billionaire globalists importing mass wage slave workers is a by product.

Countrys like Zimbabwe Zambia Malawi had a few hundred thousand in total before industrial farming and medicine arrived. The land was empty.

The Philistines were the Sea peoples, a confederation of Greek islander people from Cyprus to Sardinia. They had developed ships and probably new iron weapons which they used like AK47s to destroy the old Bronze Age empires.

Smaller states do protect their citizens more effectively than big ones. The economic advantages of big states become less desirable as social issues arise. eg increased crime and violent protest.

1318180845748953088 2020-10-19 21:22:58 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @BrexitIsSilly @montie Yes but faith that nothing exists is in some ways an even more dangerous belief some could argue. We dont know. At least Christians have a reference point. Atheists don't so literally anything goes. Hence the creeping erosion of the family unit for example.
1318179896213049348 2020-10-19 21:19:12 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @JuliaHB1 You get similar views at Llanethli and there's no 6 hour queuing at the airport though.

1318176439104131072 2020-10-19 21:05:28 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @BrexitIsSilly @montie Indeed and thus by the same token extreme liberal judges who believe in things miraculously popping out of space also should not use those views to influence judgements. Balance is best. Hence 9 judges not 1.
1318161294508412930 2020-10-19 20:05:17 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @BrexitIsSilly @montie By the same token you may believe that everything miraculously popped out of nothing 15 billion years ago but thats no better qualification to judge especially on the family unit, eroded by liberals.  And your tweet is a contradiction as you clearly want Christian judges outlawed

1316263470560575488 2020-10-14 14:24:01 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @RachelBreman @PainGuruDC @SausageFierce @goosemagoo @NEJM Thats not reparations. That's compensation to living people directly affected by nazis. Slavery ended 7 generations ago. People who never owned slaves shouldn't be forced to fund people who were never slaves based on mutual skin colors.

It tars people with one skin colour as somehow handicapped. They aren't. Reality is individuals suffer consequences based on life choices. Treat people by character not skin colour. Stop othering.

Midlands speaking Punjabi is a concerning sign of non integration. Too many women culturally locked in and not let out imo.

Laland Scots is pictish descent. Gaelic is technically an imposed colonial language from Ireland. It was always a minority ruling elite language over a Pictish speaking illiterate peasant majority.
1315193161791295488 2020-10-11 15:30:59 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @Afterthefallsc1 Was it 9th century though. The sun cross was a pagan symbol and Christians had a habit of smashing all pagan stones except those with crosses that remain.

So called "Scythians" raided the Romans  from Hadrian's wall to the Black sea. Scythian was the Roman generalisation of all Gothic peoples. "Saxon" was the later British name for them. "Germans" is Caesar's name for them.

Cattle and copper were their power over aboriginals whoever they were. Probably also earlier PIE agriculturalists from anatolia. Goths were North Black Sea. Latin/Celts from South.

Again you state schoolboy false assumptions. 80% of Shetlanders have Scots DNA indicating the Norse as a ruling minority like Romans. We dont speak Latin despite 4 hundred  years of rule.

That is why almost all language today is related. Khoisan may be a remnant of hunter gatherer primitive languages that missed civilisation.

Our culture evolved around the black sea. We adopted it as did almost every person world wide today who writes, eats dairy, corn or uses metals. Religion is also irrelevant to genetics.

Name one majority who adopted a minority language. Ever. People HATE learning foreign languages. Not one country speaks Latin today despite 4 to 8 hundred years of rule. Latin was a ruling elite language like Gaelic.

The only written language was the elite educated Gaels who were a migrant ruling minority from Ireland. Much as the Angles were from Schleswig Holstein.

Hence cops ignored him when he really could not breath. The body cam shows minutes of hysterical play acting prior to the tragedy.

It would be interesting if they offer to revert back.

So even the key is not really their's. Many herded goats and sheep across empty common land shared by all. The population was small back then. Few deeds exist to prove land ownership. That's why they show keys which actually prove nothing.

Look up the Palestine riots in 1930s when hundreds if Jews were massacred in Jerusalem for wanting to worship at their ancient temple wall which is under a newer Mosque.

1302938661512675331 2020-09-07 19:55:58 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @ikeepnoticing Culture is different. Genetics are irrelevant because we are all mixed. Europe was civilised by Bronze age Minoan/Phoenician people millenia ago who were a Euro Semitic mix. That's why  eg Steffi Graf has a prominent Roman type nose. You wont find any in Slavic countries.
1302936474502004736 2020-09-07 19:47:17 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @ikeepnoticing The fact remains that the Philistines disappeared without trace after Hamurabi enslaved  or annihilated them. We know no kings of Philistine. It was around Gaza only. Continuous Jewish culture/existance is well documented throughout history unbroken from the time of Moses.
1302935241368244224 2020-09-07 19:42:23 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @ikeepnoticing So you are a geneticist who thinks people are permanently attached to a single land of ancient ancestors. You dont realise we all have different levels of European Semitic and other blood in us. Roman noses are semitic and common across Europe. Blond hair is found in Syria.

Are you saying all converted muslims and Christian's are not muslims and Christian's? The Philistines were a small tribe of Greeks who disappeared under Hamurabi.

The name itself is Greek not Arab and was chosen by colonial powers not indigenous people. "Palestine" was a British colonial protectorate not a country. Turkey called Israel South Syria.

1300876161048875012 2020-09-02 03:20:20 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @71Elvis77 @ghosted_often @AnnCoulter He was defending a car lot against a large violent nightime mob of thugs. Of course they are are armed , it would be suicide otherwise. He shoots in clear self defense of his life.  https://t.co/pZR2APFUOb
1300863700514082816 2020-09-02 02:30:49 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @71Elvis77 @ghosted_often @AnnCoulter Nope. Seen the videos. He put out fires scrubbed graffiti and defended car lots from violent destructive criminals. All 3 he shot had long criminal record of violence and radical left anarchy. He is clearly hunted by a mob in the videos.

1300830120693948417 2020-09-02 00:17:23 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @stillgray And don't resist arrest. Not hard either.
1300828146967678981 2020-09-02 00:09:33 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @DouglasKMurray @ferrino100 CNN is anti Trump propaganda from dawn to midnight.

1300706031492886528 2020-09-01 16:04:18 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @MrAndyNgo The governor and mayor do not want their lawless voters locked up. Flaw in democracy.
1300705361561825281 2020-09-01 16:01:38 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @MrAndyNgo @ClackCoSheriff Its unbelievable how they release rioters time and again. If they permanently lock them up once, the riots end.

1300701891509264385 2020-09-01 15:47:51 +0800 <andyblueskyz> @mehdirhasan Because the Arabs still treat 4th generation Syrians and Lebanese as "refugees" if they have a Palestinian ancestor. They cant work. Apalling oppression of their Arab brothers.
