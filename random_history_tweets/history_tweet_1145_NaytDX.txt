1327835435775778816 2020-11-15 12:46:52 +0800 <NaytDX> @Gn3tX The media widely reported Bill Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky case back in the 1990s. It's a case where the media reports both Dems and Repubs.  Journalism is self-correcting, meaning that if there is a story, then someone will pick up on it.

1327104321226477568 2020-11-13 12:21:41 +0800 <NaytDX> @NBCPolitics How can Trump accuse several states of election fraud? Why didn't he question the 2016 election? Why didn't he question the 2020 election for congress? What is his evidence for voter fraud? #Alito
1327101666814996480 2020-11-13 12:11:08 +0800 <NaytDX> @JennaEllisEsq No it's not. Target Corp. reserves the right on what products it will sell to the consumer. One reason it may be removed is because it's not making any money. The consumer is still allowed to read it borrowing it from the library (if it's available). #RandPaul

1327093596592500736 2020-11-13 11:39:04 +0800 <NaytDX> @DineshDSouza If you advance a claim (i.e. voter fraud), then the burden of proof is you.

1327086591169490946 2020-11-13 11:11:14 +0800 <NaytDX> @JennaEllisEsq Biden also won the electoral vote, which is usually based on the popular vote. That's why Trump is trying to overturn the voting results. Bush v. Gore 2000 is not relevant to this issue.
1327084985233383427 2020-11-13 11:04:51 +0800 <NaytDX> @MotherJones So far, Biden has five million more votes than Trump.

If he's trying to overturn the election for his second term (not likely), then in 2024 would be his third term and not eligible to run.

1325949910328483841 2020-11-10 07:54:28 +0800 <NaytDX> @WashTimes I think the moderates of both parties and liberals can unite to make America stronger. The right wing extremists, neo-Nazis, religious zealots, and corporate elitists are a lost cause. #AmericaRises
1325947503351656448 2020-11-10 07:44:54 +0800 <NaytDX> @thehill At least that would be a legal act (hope nobody tells him that 2024 would be a different time than 2016).
1325946740588023809 2020-11-10 07:41:52 +0800 <NaytDX> @haaretzcom start a referendum in NK and Armenian areas of Azerbaijan and begin a peaceful transfer to establish good will. The remedy for Azerbaijan would be free passage through Armenia to separated territory.
1325946351620943873 2020-11-10 07:40:19 +0800 <NaytDX> @haaretzcom The Soviets transferred Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan in order to encourage infighting and deflect from the Soviet power structure. As a result, there have been wars between ARM and AZE. Armenia's occupation is illegal, but was stolen from them. The proper thing to do is...
1325944464301502465 2020-11-10 07:32:49 +0800 <NaytDX> @seankent and then, I wonder if people would put him on a catapult, which throws him over the horizon while he is screaming, "I'm still president!"
1325943992933093384 2020-11-10 07:30:57 +0800 <NaytDX> You have a greater chance of lying on VA Beach on a hot summer day, and a sea monster comes out of the water, hangs you upside down, smashes you against a pole, and throw you in the trash than Trump winning the election. #AmericaRises
1325943440849432578 2020-11-10 07:28:45 +0800 <NaytDX> @Lrihendry false analogy. The votes have been counted and the winner has been declared. AZ has only 2% votes left to be counted and GA only 1%, both in favor of Biden. You have a greater chance of winning the lottery than Trump winning the election. #AmericaRises
1325942731059949569 2020-11-10 07:25:56 +0800 <NaytDX> @JohnKasich With a changing America, I think that Donald Trump pretty much killed the GOP. I think the Democrats will replace the Republicans and become centrist while the Green Party will become liberal.

1325564417178734593 2020-11-09 06:22:39 +0800 <NaytDX> @USRealityCheck 99% of WI votes have been counted. Trump does not have enough votes to catch up. I doubt it's going to change the outcome of the vote.
1325558122119880705 2020-11-09 05:57:38 +0800 <NaytDX> @WashTimes The far left is communism, a fringe group, and will not be endorsed by the Democrat Party. Unlike Trump who has supported the far right, fascism. #AmericaOrTrump
1325557350623752192 2020-11-09 05:54:34 +0800 <NaytDX> @govkristinoem Most Trump lawsuits have been dismissed and legal scholars say the rest are deemed frivolous. Eisenhauer was the last great Republican president. What happened to your party, man? #AmericaOrTrump
1325556811613810688 2020-11-09 05:52:26 +0800 <NaytDX> @JennaEllisEsq IMHO, George W. Bush was the 2nd worse president in modern times, but even he recognizes the need for America to continue the peaceful transfer of power. #AmericaOrTrump
1325556098854694918 2020-11-09 05:49:36 +0800 <NaytDX> @RyanAFournier With 3% left, not likely. Even Melania and Jared Kushner are talking to Trump about conceding. #AmericaOrTrump

1325241733395918850 2020-11-08 09:00:25 +0800 <NaytDX> @NPR I am extremely happy today. The job will be tough when you have Republicans in congress that have undermined Clinton, Obama, and now Biden. But Biden is up to the job and will do well. America needed change.
1325240879087554560 2020-11-08 08:57:02 +0800 <NaytDX> @TheStarHound @literaryebooks Which is also how they felt in Victory celebrations after World War Two, in which Return of the Jedi might have been inspired.
1325238277222391813 2020-11-08 08:46:41 +0800 <NaytDX> @nypost Not sure if the Republicans will have any credibility left after the Trump presidency being marked the craziest in American history. #America
1325237618263601152 2020-11-08 08:44:04 +0800 <NaytDX> @fwtoney I definitely would not like it and undermines the credibility of the justice system. I am more happy that Trump will be out of office.
1325235353867972610 2020-11-08 08:35:04 +0800 <NaytDX> @JennaEllisEsq This is what your president done: #America  https://t.co/DKwd0msuSz

1325233362064334848 2020-11-08 08:27:09 +0800 <NaytDX> @ABCPolitics I wasn't too crazy about him at that time, but at least he had class, respected the opposition, and ensured a peaceful transition of power.
1325230890658754564 2020-11-08 08:17:20 +0800 <NaytDX> @NewsHour I am not going to miss it for the world. It's been a long time since I've heard a president (soon to be) speak professional, like a normal adult, looking after America.
1325230083079106564 2020-11-08 08:14:08 +0800 <NaytDX> @AVindman @realDonaldTrump I was thinking about after Biden takes office.

1325227932541988872 2020-11-08 08:05:35 +0800 <NaytDX> @RepMikeJohnson The Republicans have been undermining the election process through voter suppression, Russian interference, gerrymandering, violence and intimidation, slowing down the mail ballots, losing ballots, misprinting ballots etc. #America Trump is done, dude.
1325225043190804486 2020-11-08 07:54:06 +0800 <NaytDX> @NBCNews @ImpactDemocracy Democrats usually fix the mess that Republicans create.
1325221230618796034 2020-11-08 07:38:57 +0800 <NaytDX> @FoxNews Like the other lawsuits, it will be dismissed. #America
1325221021956395010 2020-11-08 07:38:07 +0800 <NaytDX> @Newsweek The election was deep. It is survival for America, and the Trump followers don't realize this. This goes beyond party, beliefs, opinions. We have to get this tyrant out of the White House for the sake of the United States. Everything else, such as politics is at the back burner.
1325220091231920134 2020-11-08 07:34:25 +0800 <NaytDX> @thehill The frivolous kind, no doubt, that will eventually be tossed out.

1325219016705781760 2020-11-08 07:30:09 +0800 <NaytDX> @NewsHour The Trump followers have taken Donald Trump's con hook, line, and sinker.

1325155749492715523 2020-11-08 03:18:45 +0800 <NaytDX> @DailyCaller President Trump's approach is to falsely claim that the pandemic was a democratic hoax and it's going away. Ten months later, America is approaching 10 million cases and 240,000 deaths. #Election2020Results America has spoken.

1324907775739240454 2020-11-07 10:53:23 +0800 <NaytDX> @DineshDSouza There is flaw in your argument. Biden does not need nor is he able to prove a negative. If Trump claims voter fraud, then he has the burden of proof. Republicans have engaged in voter suppression and gerrymandering. #Election2020Results
1324903522928893952 2020-11-07 10:36:30 +0800 <NaytDX> @thehill So Trump is feeling that he is being cheated out of electoral votes. If it makes him feel any better, he is losing the popular vote to Biden by over 4 million votes. #Election2020Results

1323454943995506688 2020-11-03 10:40:21 +0800 <NaytDX> @TheSkillson @DailyCaller It's one thing to support Blue Lives Matter, but at that point, when tensions are high, the best approach is the leave the scene. Even if it's a valid self-defense claim, it's not worth putting yourself in that situation. Legal fees are expensive, you have the risk of losing...
1323453322737684483 2020-11-03 10:33:55 +0800 <NaytDX> @TheSkillson @DailyCaller If the KKK was to go to a black neighborhood, and they have arms, and they provoked someone in that neighborhood, and that person reacted and ended up shot, I don't think the self-defense argue would be strong. His actions caused the death in the first place.
1323452940246491137 2020-11-03 10:32:24 +0800 <NaytDX> @TheSkillson @DailyCaller The one question that would come up is what happened before Rosenbaum was chasing Rittenhouse? What provoked Rosenbaum to go after Rittenhouse?
1323451980384215042 2020-11-03 10:28:35 +0800 <NaytDX> @TheSkillson @DailyCaller Just giving an example of a possible scenario where a self-defense claim might be stronger. Of course every situation is different and people have to make sound judgement, but have to prepare for the consequences if they don't have a strong case.

1323450712613888001 2020-11-03 10:23:33 +0800 <NaytDX> @TheSkillson @DailyCaller you are unable to escape, you fired warning shots against him, and you had absolutely no choice but to use lethal force. In Rittenhouse case, the circumstances would be mitigating, but the question is what was he doing there? intent and interested party. Again, just an opinion.
1323450246433824768 2020-11-03 10:21:41 +0800 <NaytDX> @TheSkillson @DailyCaller Any history would be background information, but not relevant to the case. A possible valid self defense claim (IMHO) would be that you are in your house, you are in fact being threatened, this person has a history of violence, he has a weapon, he is coming after you...
1323448871113117697 2020-11-03 10:16:14 +0800 <NaytDX> @LoveAmerica615 @MamaMiaNOSharia New Mexico? In case you haven't noticed, the majority of New Mexico are Latinos and Native Americans, people that Donald Trump despises.
1323448423387901956 2020-11-03 10:14:27 +0800 <NaytDX> @TheSkillson @DailyCaller you really really really have to make dang sure it is for self-defense. If you have an altercation, a "reasonable person" must have fear of his life, was he able to escape, what was his intent. Because prosecution is going to scrutinize everything.
1323448021506547712 2020-11-03 10:12:51 +0800 <NaytDX> @TheSkillson @DailyCaller According to what I'm reading, there is probably a reasonable fear for his safety when he was being chased by Rosenbaum (accounts say he was trying to take his gun, which is not the best approach). And when he trip being followed by multiple protesters. If you kill someone...
1323446704990048256 2020-11-03 10:07:37 +0800 <NaytDX> @TheSkillson @DailyCaller If you provoke action, and the opposing party takes action, and the result is that you shoot someone, they you are liable, albeit your shooting was needed for self defense. That's where the intent comes in.
1323446434281230336 2020-11-03 10:06:33 +0800 <NaytDX> @TheSkillson @DailyCaller Not necessarily. If you are a business owner and you are at your business being attacked, then you are an interested party. If you are a security guard, then you are an interested party. Your belief system does not make you an interested party. That's where he messed up.
1323445328775970816 2020-11-03 10:02:09 +0800 <NaytDX> @TheSkillson @DailyCaller I have watched the footage and the question comes, what is the intent? The fact that he cross state lines, joined other armed right wing militias at a protest zone fails in protecting businesses, when he is not an interested party.
1323444882371989506 2020-11-03 10:00:23 +0800 <NaytDX> @TheSkillson @DailyCaller Why would anyone cross state lines and go to a protest zone with armed protestors? That's where he got himself in trouble. It's a big difference if he was at his own property and being attacked and lethal attack was the only option.
1323444190089412608 2020-11-03 09:57:37 +0800 <NaytDX> @TheSkillson @DailyCaller After all, law enforcement was stating their appreciation for right wing militias for being present. The intent was to cause problems, not protecting property.
1323443946740162560 2020-11-03 09:56:39 +0800 <NaytDX> @TheSkillson @DailyCaller Armed rioters? Why wasn't there a blood bath? Rittenhouse has no legal basis because he intentionally went to a protest zone with an AR-15, which is designed to kill multiple people in a short time. If he was claiming self-defense, why did law enforcement arrest him?...
1323442490586923010 2020-11-03 09:50:52 +0800 <NaytDX> @TheSkillson @DailyCaller He would be liable for the shootings since he was not an interested party to businesses (as he claim he was protecting). What was he doing bringing an AR-15 to a known protest area? What were armed right wing militias doing in the protest zone?

1323438090170621952 2020-11-03 09:33:23 +0800 <NaytDX> @TheSkillson @DailyCaller Only if you believe in right wing conspiracy theories.

1320565068665364481 2020-10-26 11:17:01 +0800 <NaytDX> @WonderBitchToo @thehill The State Department has an agenda to promote a positive image.

1320564348776009731 2020-10-26 11:14:10 +0800 <NaytDX> @WonderBitchToo @thehill It's called propaganda.
1320564183168094209 2020-10-26 11:13:30 +0800 <NaytDX> @WonderBitchToo @thehill Diversity training is a disclaimer designed to promote a positive image of DOS, while at the same time, deny promotions to Blacks and Latinos and retaliate against those who complain.
1320563615880065024 2020-10-26 11:11:15 +0800 <NaytDX> @WonderBitchToo @thehill That's a State Department link, so of course they are going to promote concepts for public relation purposes.
1320563415526592513 2020-10-26 11:10:27 +0800 <NaytDX> @WonderBitchToo @thehill Since the article was about DOS, it is not a feasible solution to ignore the issues at that organization because it happens everywhere.
1320562787584802817 2020-10-26 11:07:58 +0800 <NaytDX> @WonderBitchToo @thehill There is a basis. You don't see alot of Blacks and Latinos in senior management positions and diplomatic positions at the State Department.
1320562528448032769 2020-10-26 11:06:56 +0800 <NaytDX> @WonderBitchToo @thehill This was before Trump, and it is ingrained with corruption and racism. If you complained, you get terminated. If you are a buddy of a certain person, you get promoted. Largely ineffective organization at taxpayers expense.

1320561583085551617 2020-10-26 11:03:10 +0800 <NaytDX> @WonderBitchToo @thehill There are 20,000 employees in DOS, and you worked in one office. The DOS is a bloated organization and deserves to have it's funding cut until effective reforms are made.
1320561250686951424 2020-10-26 11:01:51 +0800 <NaytDX> @WonderBitchToo @thehill Are you sure you are not a State Department manager or attorney? You seem to defend the DOS strongly.
1320561001184612352 2020-10-26 11:00:52 +0800 <NaytDX> @WonderBitchToo @thehill But still largely ineffective if the management takes to action to end racial harassment, deny promotions to racial minorities, grant promotions to their buddies, and retaliate against those who complain.

1320560400207908864 2020-10-26 10:58:28 +0800 <NaytDX> @WonderBitchToo @thehill The Diversity training is nothing more than a disclaimer saying that yes, I provided training to employees, but when they do, as a supervisor, I will do nothing.
1320560072708284418 2020-10-26 10:57:10 +0800 <NaytDX> @WonderBitchToo @thehill That shows there is a problem with the culture of the State Department and their claims of diversity and inclusion are faulty.

1320558783962243074 2020-10-26 10:52:03 +0800 <NaytDX> @WonderBitchToo @thehill There was another employee making over $100,000 salary for doing basically nothing - he got that promotion based on cronyism and preferential treatment.
1320558518735351808 2020-10-26 10:51:00 +0800 <NaytDX> @WonderBitchToo @thehill According to reports, many Blacks and Latinos are underrepresented in promotions. In EEO reports, there are employees who made racial slurs, jokes, and harassments against the few Black and Latinos employees.
1320558108561854464 2020-10-26 10:49:22 +0800 <NaytDX> @WonderBitchToo @thehill She told me one employee who worked there for over 20 years, had multiple disabilities, and filed a union grievance for being denied promotions, and was terminated based on claims of faulty performance after she field a grievance.

1315751198209781764 2020-10-13 04:28:25 +0800 <NaytDX> It is my understanding of the #Holocaust that gave me a red flag that Donald Trump is going to be a horrendous president.
1315750992940544001 2020-10-13 04:27:36 +0800 <NaytDX> We should also learn the horrors of World War Two and the aftermath when German civilians and POWs were facing brutal revenge atrocities. #Holocaust
1315750759041040384 2020-10-13 04:26:41 +0800 <NaytDX> We should expand #Holocaust education in the public schools.
1315750648147857417 2020-10-13 04:26:14 +0800 <NaytDX> It is people like Donald Trump that incites and initiates genocidal campaigns. #Holocaust
1315750475761963015 2020-10-13 04:25:33 +0800 <NaytDX> The death of 13 million people, of which half were Jewish, is irrefutable. #Holocaust

Cuban natives heard the Europeans were arriving, they prepared a feast for them. When they arrived, they massacred the natives. That is celebrating Columbus Day. #Holocaust
1315746961639829504 2020-10-13 04:11:35 +0800 <NaytDX> @realDonaldTrump Is the election of Donald Trump, the angry right wing followers last stand against incoming and inevitable change happening in Amerika?

1315465749369155584 2020-10-12 09:34:09 +0800 <NaytDX> @bostonherald The Republicans made a complete turn around in denying Obama's right to appoint a SC justice because of the need to wait for the election the following year, meanwhile, they are rushing for ACB appointment.

There is a reason for the protest, because there is lack of accountability and transparency in law enforcement.

1301282049102405633 2020-09-03 06:13:11 +0800 <NaytDX> @abc7newsbayarea They should change it to "In Reason We Should Trust."
1301281335777132544 2020-09-03 06:10:21 +0800 <NaytDX> @eliehonig @2LipsinHolland Remember when Omarosa said the Trump was "racial," but was not a "racist?" Ja, sure.
1301281052175069190 2020-09-03 06:09:14 +0800 <NaytDX> @WhiteHouse Trump avoided serving in the U.S. military during Vietnam War by claiming bone spurs. #BillBarr

1301279315527639042 2020-09-03 06:02:20 +0800 <NaytDX> @HuffPostPol The beauty of democracy. One can freely publish something offensive and one can freely ignore something offensive. #Pelosi
1301278881509511168 2020-09-03 06:00:36 +0800 <NaytDX> @DailyCaller At least #Pelosi didn't ignore intelligence reports that Russia was offering bounties to the Taliban to murder American troops as Trump did.
1301278557893808129 2020-09-03 05:59:19 +0800 <NaytDX> Biden is going to make Trump look like a fool in the debates. #ChrisWallace
1301278141248348160 2020-09-03 05:57:40 +0800 <NaytDX> @realDonaldTrump You are gradually turning Amerika into a dictatorship under advice from Vlad Putin. Too bad your followers don't have a clue. #Pelosi
1301276532145557505 2020-09-03 05:51:16 +0800 <NaytDX> #SarahSanders and #KimJongUn make a perfect couple. Hope she moves to North Korea on the first flight permanently.

1301275395803750401 2020-09-03 05:46:45 +0800 <NaytDX> @DailyCaller Trump appointee for Secy of State Pompeo, congratulated the newly elected president for Guyana in a "free, fair, credible, and transparent electoral process." Too his administration doesn't feel the same for Amerika. #BillBarr
