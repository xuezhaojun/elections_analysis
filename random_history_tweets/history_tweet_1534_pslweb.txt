It can shut down production and the capitalist economy as a whole. It is the vast majority of humanity and has vast potential power.

1343769997009567744 2020-12-29 12:05:07 +0800 <pslweb> Society's great wealth is the product of natural resources and the labor of working people. Yet that wealth is  the private property of those who produce nothing — the tiny class of capitalists. This irreconcilable conflict defines life for vast majority of people in the world

1342577587512492032 2020-12-26 05:06:55 +0800 <pslweb> The words of the socialist Internationale, written 150 years ago and translated into nearly every language, continue to inspire the fight of the oppressed for emancipation: “The earth shall rise on new foundations; we have been naught, we shall be all.”
1342577586686230528 2020-12-26 05:06:55 +0800 <pslweb> History did not cease in 1989. Capitalism’s restoration in Romania and the former Socialist Bloc has brought with it all its inherent contradictions. It is bound to reignite mass struggle.
1342577584651993089 2020-12-26 05:06:54 +0800 <pslweb> The socialist Romanian government transformed a largely agrarian society, and made great gains in industrial production.

1342537207492448256 2020-12-26 02:26:28 +0800 <pslweb> The U.S. slave owning elites passed racist laws that broke all  treaties, igniting warfare and forced removal of Native people. Seminoles fled south to seek independence. Africans who had earlier escaped bondage welcomed them to Florida and offered them a safe haven.
1342537206229946368 2020-12-26 02:26:27 +0800 <pslweb> The Seminole people lived freely on the southern Atlantic coast before U.S. and European colonial powers brutally pushed them out of their homes and into Florida.  https://t.co/oa9wieArnQ

1338269854260813826 2020-12-14 07:49:31 +0800 <pslweb> Workers from all industries saw the struggle of the typographers as directly connected to their own. They also understood that solidarity with Soviet Russia, which the typographers had undertaken, was the fight of all workers in the country.
1338269853258432512 2020-12-14 07:49:31 +0800 <pslweb> Yet despite the increased hardships, the typographers continued their strike, and the movement grew. The government’s attack only further provoked workers into action. Typographers flooded into the unions by the thousands, and the many separate unions joined together.
1338269852184825857 2020-12-14 07:49:31 +0800 <pslweb> When the columns reached the Theater, the army attacked. When the first round of soldiers balked, fresh troops were brought in. Soldiers stabbed men, women, and even children with swords. They slaughtered more than 100. Many thousands were wounded, or arrested and tortured.
1338269851131944961 2020-12-14 07:49:31 +0800 <pslweb> Finance minister Vasile Cancicov wrote about this incident with panic: “Are we on the eve of Bolshevism? ...the Ministry of Industry [was] completely surrounded, from the court to the street, by a turbulent multitude of people. They were the strikers. No sign of the authorities.”
1338269850183987205 2020-12-14 07:49:30 +0800 <pslweb> On Dec. 13, 1918, 600 typographers left the printing presses. They were met by 15,000 workers from other industries. The workers organized themselves into columns, and began marching towards the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to hand the minister their list of demands.
1338269849202520064 2020-12-14 07:49:30 +0800 <pslweb> As socialist Gh. Cristescu wrote, “Every worker is turning their sights towards the sunrise in Russia. We can see our salvation through the destruction of capitalist society. We are surrounded by revolution, and we do not believe that we will remain isolated like an island.”
1338269847809970179 2020-12-14 07:49:30 +0800 <pslweb> The October Revolution just one year before showed that it was possible to create a workers’ state. Typographers were instrumental in tripping up the development of the anti-Soviet campaign, refusing to print the government’s slander against Soviet Russia.  https://t.co/2yshGbzdB3
1338269844915941376 2020-12-14 07:49:29 +0800 <pslweb> The situation for urban workers was difficult. Workers––including children as young as six––worked from 12 to 16 hours per day. In many factories owners would physically beat their workers, and when this was not enough military prisons were set up alongside industrial factories.  https://t.co/xXcOGcDJU9

1334283676964716544 2020-12-03 07:49:53 +0800 <pslweb> While the John Brown raid failed in its immediate aims, it was the opening salvo in the civil war which culminated in the revolutionary defeat of the slave system.

1334263520331001857 2020-12-03 06:29:47 +0800 <pslweb> Instead of presenting a community in crisis, internal turmoil searching for answers to ending 500 years of oppression, it presents a passive community of poor, and suffering masses with little agency or alternatives other than waiting to see if the Great White Father delivers.
1334263519425015817 2020-12-03 06:29:47 +0800 <pslweb> Now, as the struggle for Black liberation renews and grows, it is calling into question that leadership along with its definition of “progress” and its answer to national oppression.   The “Black voters save America” plot line flattens all of this.
1334263518556811266 2020-12-03 06:29:46 +0800 <pslweb> All these data points together reflect the abject failures of the post-Civil Rights-era Democratic Party leadership to address the needs of Black America.
1334263517625638919 2020-12-03 06:29:46 +0800 <pslweb> In a muddled way this dissatisfaction even manifested in the various controversies around voting that cropped-up around various entertainers like Ice Cube, the debut of the Black Party and a growing Black conservative presence.
1334263516702838785 2020-12-03 06:29:46 +0800 <pslweb> There is now an increasingly dense network of Black anti-capitalist militants at the heart of the social movements coursing through the country. A significant number of younger Black people supported Bernie Sanders and the election of Cori Bush.
1334263515742425091 2020-12-03 06:29:46 +0800 <pslweb> Many of these were located in Democratic-run cities where the same mayors and elected officials campaigning for Biden were months earlier defending abusive police, repressing the movement and thwarting calls for reforms.
1334263514890952715 2020-12-03 06:29:46 +0800 <pslweb> The signs of this dissatisfaction are all around us, and are most pronounced in light of the rebellions this summer.
1334263513972416513 2020-12-03 06:29:45 +0800 <pslweb> Of course voter suppression plays a role in some of this, but the trend of a declining Democratic vote share in majority Black areas is too widespread to be explained without placing dissatisfaction with Democratic Party elites at the center of the analysis.
1334263513095737345 2020-12-03 06:29:45 +0800 <pslweb> In North Carolina the poor performance in majority Black counties clearly played a significant role in Biden’s failure to win the state.
1334263512135299073 2020-12-03 06:29:45 +0800 <pslweb> But the “Black people saved Biden” narrative obscures that in a number of crucial states this vote was not decisive in flipping them. In Pennsylvania and Wisconsin it certainly was a less significant factor than the suburban surge in the direction of the Democratic Party.
1334263510763704320 2020-12-03 06:29:45 +0800 <pslweb> The entire pre-election discourse around “the Black vote” was whether there would be turnout in the necessary numbers. It largely did not happen.   Black voters are still foundational to Democratic successes, returning large majorities in majority Black areas.
1334263509845237763 2020-12-03 06:29:44 +0800 <pslweb> In Virginia too, Danville, Petersburg and Portsmouth all increased their vote total for Biden as compared to Clinton. Baltimore, Maryland also saw a noted increase as did Saginaw City, Michigan. However, these are generally exceptions.
1334263508880551941 2020-12-03 06:29:44 +0800 <pslweb> Clearly the Democratic campaign in Georgia was driven by the past several years of well-organized voter registration and community organizing activities in Black communities.
1334263507899068417 2020-12-03 06:29:44 +0800 <pslweb> The principal exception is Georgia. Eight out of 11 majority Black counties increased their votes for the Democratic presidential ticket — notably in Rockdale county which saw a nine percentage point surge.
1334263506909138950 2020-12-03 06:29:44 +0800 <pslweb> In Dallas County, Alabama (home to Selma) and Lake County, Indiana (home to Gary) roughly the same percentage of people showed up to vote, as is true in Essex County, New Jersey (home to Newark) and Prince George’s County, Maryland.
1334263506020028418 2020-12-03 06:29:43 +0800 <pslweb> All over Chicago’s South Side — the ninth, 15th, 16th and 17th wards — the same vote loss trend appears.
1334263504984023043 2020-12-03 06:29:43 +0800 <pslweb> In all of them Joe Biden lost raw votes, percentage share or both compared to the Democrats’ 2016 effort. In Mississippi, in 14 of 17 majority-Black counties the same result held true. This is also true for Tuskegee, the county seat of Macon County, Alabama.
1334263504036114437 2020-12-03 06:29:43 +0800 <pslweb> This is true in Detroit, Philadelphia, the majority Black wards of Milwaukee, every majority Black county in North Carolina and Arkansas, and all but three majority Black counties in South Carolina.
1334263503071432705 2020-12-03 06:29:43 +0800 <pslweb> This narrative, which has a kernel of truth in that Black voters remain overwhelmingly in the camp of the Democrats, obscures the facts. All across the country, in both urban and rural settings, Joe Biden lost votes compared to Clinton in 2016 in majority Black areas.
1334263502148677635 2020-12-03 06:29:42 +0800 <pslweb> The principal narrative being produced by a large portion of non-right wing commentary on the election is that the “Black vote” saved Joe Biden.
1334263500429004800 2020-12-03 06:29:42 +0800 <pslweb> The idea that “Black voters saved America” during the 2020 elections is a distortion.  Read this thread to find out why.  Article here:  https://t.co/Iolst0HFET  https://t.co/v6PPA4w0vJ
1334258134915960836 2020-12-03 06:08:23 +0800 <pslweb> If a white worker making $102,000 working at a fracking site and a white worker making $29,000 working at Wendy’s, and the former votes for Trump, the latter for Biden, who is more representative? Is the white working class Trump’s “base” or just a certain sector of it?
1334258134056132612 2020-12-03 06:08:23 +0800 <pslweb> Depending on what age-group we are talking about anywhere from 40-60% of low wage workers are white.   So, what white workers are we talking about?
1334258133196300295 2020-12-03 06:08:22 +0800 <pslweb> To start, Trump got a significant chunk of support from people on the higher end of the income scale. For instance, in North Carolina, Michigan, Nevada and Ohio, Trump won the majority of voters making over $100,000 and lost the majority of voters making less than $50,000.
1334258132298690570 2020-12-03 06:08:22 +0800 <pslweb> Instead we have two stand-ins: whether or not you went to college and how much money you make. Leaving aside how inadequate that is, what can we learn from these stats?
1334258131518558208 2020-12-03 06:08:22 +0800 <pslweb> Do you work for a living? Or do you pay people to work for you to make your living? That is the basic class distinction in capitalism.
1334258130650271750 2020-12-03 06:08:22 +0800 <pslweb> The first question is then, what do the results really tell us? Is the white working class Trump’s base? Our first problem is, there are no real “class” statistics for U.S. elections. Class isn’t about income, but relationships.
1334258129761169408 2020-12-03 06:08:22 +0800 <pslweb> Supposedly they are his “base” and in a related sense are presented as so irredeemably racist and hateful that most liberal and some “left” analysis views them as being worth only of mockery, certainly not a target for organizing.

1325182885150695431 2020-11-08 05:06:35 +0800 <pslweb> Si Trump deja la presidencia, pierde su inmunidad en las persecuciones que los estados pueden hacer respecto a crímenes financieros. Este será el futuro de Trump y él lo sabe. La clase dominante no va a sacrificar la legitimidad de su sistema político por proteger a Donald Trump.
1325182884034957312 2020-11-08 05:06:34 +0800 <pslweb> La motivación de Trump es bastante limitada y personal. Si pierde las elecciones, él y su familia serán sujetos a múltiples persecuciones criminales y cargos judiciales en varios estados por evasión de impuestos, fraudes financieros, así como otros crímenes de esta índole.
1325182882927636480 2020-11-08 05:06:34 +0800 <pslweb> Esto evita la tensión y el conflicto, lo que haría el dominio de la clase dominante más complicado e inestable.

1325149584948015113 2020-11-08 02:54:15 +0800 <pslweb> The fact that it was a close election at the presidential level at a time of the biggest healthcare catastrophe and mass unemployment in living memory shows how little the Democratic Party has to offer the masses of people.
1325149583849086977 2020-11-08 02:54:15 +0800 <pslweb> The 2020 presidential election was a referendum on Trump. The Democrats did very badly in the rest of the election. They lost seats to the Republicans in the House and they failed to win the Senate.
1325149582775365632 2020-11-08 02:54:15 +0800 <pslweb> The fact that Fox News and the Wall Street editorial board have turned against him in his quest to condemn the election process is a clear indication that his fate has been sealed.
1325149581563232257 2020-11-08 02:54:14 +0800 <pslweb> Trump has spent the last days trying to use ultra-right, and fascist mobilizations to stop the vote count. But he has become increasingly isolated. His base of support within the capitalist establishment is crumbling and that will continue.
1325149580489416706 2020-11-08 02:54:14 +0800 <pslweb> If Trump becomes a civilian, he loses his immunities for state-based prosecutions on financial crimes. This will be Trump’s future and he knows it. The ruling class will not sacrifice the legitimacy of its political system to protect Donald Trump in his post-presidency life.
1325149579470278657 2020-11-08 02:54:14 +0800 <pslweb> Trump’s motivation is very narrow and personal. If he loses the election, he and his family will be subject to multiple criminal prosecutions and civil legal cases in many states on issues related to tax evasion, financial fraud and other such crimes.
1325149578455232512 2020-11-08 02:54:14 +0800 <pslweb> “Democracy” is the preferred form of class rule because achieving legitimacy with a significant sector of the working class and intermediate strata makes the system easier to maintain. It avoids the tension and conflict which makes class rule more complicated and unstable.
1325149577477976065 2020-11-08 02:54:14 +0800 <pslweb> Every system requires either undiluted brute violence that is routinely dispensed on oppressed classes, or it relies on its legitimacy with a sector of the population which is then, of course, supplemented by the threat of violence and state coercion.
1325149576391655427 2020-11-08 02:54:13 +0800 <pslweb> Trump broke the cardinal rule of U.S. capitalist politics when he denounced the election system as a fraud. Maintaining the image of a peaceful transfer of power between the two ruling class parties for over a century has been a core element of American capitalist governance.
1325149575347269632 2020-11-08 02:54:13 +0800 <pslweb> ...in Pennsylvania, Georgia and other states it is crystal clear that Trump in fact has lost the electoral college vote in a very narrow contest that almost exactly replicates the narrow outcome in 2016 but with the margins reversed.
1325149574323867649 2020-11-08 02:54:13 +0800 <pslweb> Donald Trump insists that he will fight on. He argues that he is the true winner of the election and the only reason that he might not be president is because of widespread election fraud. This is not true and as more and more of the mail-in vote arrived ...
1325149573120061441 2020-11-08 02:54:12 +0800 <pslweb> It is noteworthy that Fox News, which has been so vociferously cheer-leading for Donald Trump during the last four years, also called the election for Biden and dramatically changed the tone of its coverage to be very supportive of Biden and the campaign he ran.
1325149572033736704 2020-11-08 02:54:12 +0800 <pslweb> This morning the major corporate-owned media networks all announced that Joe Biden had sufficient electoral college votes to become the next president of the United States.

It took a candidate as weak as Biden to give the right wing the opportunity to attempt to tip the scales with racist intimidation.

1324489838347710464 2020-11-06 07:12:39 +0800 <pslweb> For over a year, the Democratic Party elite crowed that only Joe Biden was “electable” and could beat Trump. Biden spent 47 years in political office fraternizing with segregationists, championing racist mass incarceration, crafting the foundation of the PATRIOT Act,
1324489837366272000 2020-11-06 07:12:39 +0800 <pslweb> As we stand up to racist voter disenfranchisement, it is also necessary to point out that these tactics carried out by the far right only have an opening to sway the outcome of the election because the results are extremely close.
1324489836456157184 2020-11-06 07:12:39 +0800 <pslweb> In Atlanta today, Trump supporters, including some armed militia members, descended on State Farm Arena. Atlanta is a majority Black city, and the clear aim of this mobilization is to intimidate those counting the mail-in ballots that could decide Georgia’s final election result.
1324489835558563841 2020-11-06 07:12:39 +0800 <pslweb> Some vote center workers and media had to be escorted to their cars under threat from the protesters. Arizona is a stronghold of the white supremacist “militia movement”.
1324489834614849536 2020-11-06 07:12:39 +0800 <pslweb> Meanwhile in Arizona, where Trump is trailing but gradually closing the gap as more votes are reported, the right wing’s demand is the opposite. Hundreds of armed demonstrators  gathered at the counting center in Maricopa County chanting “Count the votes!”
1324489833570471938 2020-11-06 07:12:38 +0800 <pslweb> The racist character of the protests is clear considering Detroit is a city that is 79 percent African-American. On Nov 5. the Michigan Court of Claims denied the lawsuit, and counting is expected to continue for now.
1324489832102465536 2020-11-06 07:12:38 +0800 <pslweb> In Detroit yesterday a crowd of right wingers stormed a vote counting center to demand that absentee ballots not be tabulated, chanting “Stop the count!” The Trump campaign filed a lawsuit to halt vote-counting.   https://t.co/76wSvrTsgW

The country appears to be headed for a protracted legal and political battle that could usher in a profound crisis.
1323878374649991168 2020-11-04 14:42:55 +0800 <pslweb> We’re wrapping up our live coverage for tonight — thank you to all our readers who followed the results with us on this tumultuous night. The election is still too close to call.
1323870767814111232 2020-11-04 14:12:42 +0800 <pslweb> Despite trailing substantially, Biden claimed he would win Pennsylvania. Large numbers of mail-in ballots are yet to be counted. #LiberationLive2020
1323870766786514945 2020-11-04 14:12:41 +0800 <pslweb> Both Trump and Biden have now spoken on the results so far.  Speaking in Wilmington, Delaware, Joe Biden told supporters to “keep the faith”, in what appears to be an attempt to manage the expectations of his supporters as Trump leads in several key states. #LiberationLive2020

Trump leads with over 53% of recorded votes in IA, OH, and GA; 52.2% in TX; and roughly 51% in FL and NC. These leads point to the possibility of another upset Trump victory.
1323865117553946624 2020-11-04 13:50:14 +0800 <pslweb> This vote is widely considered a reflection of the shift in consciousness brought about by this summer’s uprising against racism. #LiberationLive2020

It could then be possible for Louisiana to fully ban abortion, even in cases of rape and incest
1323864259638390787 2020-11-04 13:46:50 +0800 <pslweb> This law does not make abortion illegal in the state, but will now make it even more difficult for poor and working people, people of color, young and LGBTQ people who face barriers to getting a safe and affordable abortion. #LiberationLive2020

1314300649786482697 2020-10-09 04:24:28 +0800 <pslweb> Read the full excerpt and analysis here from our socialist women’s magazine, @breakchainsmag    https://t.co/WpgFhYVenn
1314300648557555712 2020-10-09 04:24:27 +0800 <pslweb> Women and all of the oppressed need a new system, with new mechanisms for justice, if we are to truly live with safety and security.
1314300646204547085 2020-10-09 04:24:27 +0800 <pslweb> The reality is women’s safety is simply not a priority to the current justice system, and this is doubly true for women of color, LGBTQ people, those suffering from mental illness, and prisoners.
1314300644870811651 2020-10-09 04:24:26 +0800 <pslweb> The justice system has long been aware of this fact, and women continue to risk their lives to expose their abuse, but little is done to end the abuse.
1314300643495026688 2020-10-09 04:24:26 +0800 <pslweb> In a society where women are constantly subjected to violence and abuse, the very forces that are supposed to “protect and serve” in fact harbor some of the most dangerous predators women can encounter.
1314300642140266518 2020-10-09 04:24:26 +0800 <pslweb> The Coleman suit is only unique because 14 women came forward with their full names, 7 of whom are still incarcerated. Women have long testified to a culture of rampant abuse in jails &amp; prisons, that suggests the U.S. justice system as a whole functions as a sanctuary for abuse.
1314300640995221529 2020-10-09 04:24:25 +0800 <pslweb> Their abusers monitored their emails and phone calls, warned them they knew where their families lived and transferred anyone who spoke up to the more restrictive county jail, which cost them progress they had made in their training and work programs.
1314300639837650945 2020-10-09 04:24:25 +0800 <pslweb> Officers used the wooded paths on the prison grounds as secluded places to take inmates to rape them or force them to sunbathe topless for guards’ enjoyment. If the women complained, they were punished.
1314300638189301760 2020-10-09 04:24:25 +0800 <pslweb> The plaintiffs describe in chilling detail how officers coerced, threatened and stalked them into submission, how they were trapped and assaulted in private offices or remote sheds with no surveillance cameras.
1314300636331208704 2020-10-09 04:24:24 +0800 <pslweb> In December 2019, 14 women, both former and current inmates at the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex, filed a lawsuit accusing the Florida prison of creating a “sanctuary” for sexual abuse.  https://t.co/LwLHUTRxxx

1308598951164014592 2020-09-23 10:47:57 +0800 <pslweb> These three fighters for justice — Lillian, Joel and Eliza — are the most giving of themselves and their time and energy; they are the most dedicated and self-sacrificing. They will never give up the fight for justice for Elijah McClain.  THAT is why they were arrested.  https://t.co/jEWkRRaS2H
1308598950341926912 2020-09-23 10:47:57 +0800 <pslweb> Eliza tells us she has written a full agitational speech in her head while inside. Joel has gotten others in his pod to donate to the legal and political fund and to commit to contacting the PSL when they get out so that they can become organizers.
1308598949545091074 2020-09-23 10:47:56 +0800 <pslweb> Every time we talk to the locked up activists, we tell them how hard we are fighting for them. Lillian told us, “you all better be just as angry as us when we get out.”
1308598948756480001 2020-09-23 10:47:56 +0800 <pslweb> Joel is concerned for the multiple men in his unit who are going through severe opiate withdrawals, and for the men who are sole breadwinners for their families.
1308598947854929923 2020-09-23 10:47:56 +0800 <pslweb> Lillian is particularly concerned about pregnant women in the unit, who are given the same low-quality food and no adequate medical attention.
1308598946944544768 2020-09-23 10:47:56 +0800 <pslweb> Eliza told our legal team that we need to be working just as hard to release her cellmate as we are for her, because her cellmate is also unjustly incarcerated on false charges.
1308598946093129728 2020-09-23 10:47:55 +0800 <pslweb> Despite their conditions, the organizers are still thinking of others — constantly telling us about the conditions of cellmates and others, agitating for their release.  All three say they are not the only ones unjustly incarcerated—this the norm in the jail and not the exception
1308598945090646017 2020-09-23 10:47:55 +0800 <pslweb> Both Lillian and Eliza have dietary restrictions, and because of this in addition to the extremely low quality of the food neither of them has been able to eat more than about 300-500 calories a day. Multiple requests to accommodate dietary restrictions and has been ignored.
1308598944025341953 2020-09-23 10:47:55 +0800 <pslweb> And remember, this is jail — no one has even been convicted of a crime yet.  Yesterday, Eliza told us that although her “out” time had started, the guards did not open up the door for nearly 20m, leaving only 20m for her to make calls to us, her family and her lawyers.  https://t.co/pt1gURpiY1
1308598941592596481 2020-09-23 10:47:54 +0800 <pslweb> Lillian House and Eliza Lucero are isolated with a single cellmate for 23h20m a day. Both say this isolation is one of the most difficult parts of being inside. This facility would rather torture inmates with near-solitary confinement than test for COVID.  https://t.co/kwlgwkEyol
1308598940271390720 2020-09-23 10:47:54 +0800 <pslweb> The targeted activists have been inside since Thursday, meaning that they have been held without being able to post bond, or even have a hearing before a judge, for six days. This is a violation of the 14th Amendment, which is supposed to protect the right to due process.
1308598937884880896 2020-09-23 10:47:54 +0800 <pslweb> Joel Northam is in a pod with 7-8 other men for 23h20m a day. Although there have been COVID cases, he was given only one face mask. Joel's phone calls with us and his were family cut off before his time ran out, no warning or explanation.  https://t.co/H5UAL23daF

1303187605048053761 2020-09-08 12:25:11 +0800 <pslweb> Militarism has proved itself to be more than an emergency measure to defend capitalism from socialism: It has morphed into a pillar of the current social order.

1303187602753773569 2020-09-08 12:25:11 +0800 <pslweb> The Pentagon war machine is the biggest dumper of hazardous materials and medical waste pollution.

1303187601344536577 2020-09-08 12:25:10 +0800 <pslweb> The Pentagon has 800+ military bases in 135 countries.   Militarizing the globe is the single most expensive exploit in all of human history: destroying countries, killing tens of millions and enriching a tiny group of capitalists in the U.S. and other imperialist countries.  https://t.co/4HsVTixy8e
