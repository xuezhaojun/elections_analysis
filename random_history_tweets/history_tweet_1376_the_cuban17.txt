Nobody had enough Electoral College votes, so it went to Congress to decide.  The history of what happened is interesting.
1325937452100562944 2020-11-10 07:04:57 +0800 <the_cuban17> 8/Then there is MAGA-nation.  71 million voters who are about to get a civics lesson that their state legislators can certify this obvious electoral fraud by certifying the current fraudulent vote or they can put in their own electors, or they can just choose to sit it out.

1325934655879733248 2020-11-10 06:53:51 +0800 <the_cuban17> 7/The mainstream media and Big Tech almost unanimously deliver the message that "Biden won, it is time to come together, let's move on."  That would have worked before, but it is not going to work now.
1325934655032455169 2020-11-10 06:53:51 +0800 <the_cuban17> 6/It is only going to get uglier every day as more people come forward with fraud testimony, photos of trucks delivering ballots, and records of software that stops in the middle of the night.
1325934654105530375 2020-11-10 06:53:50 +0800 <the_cuban17> 5/The Democrats way overplayed their fraud hand.  Scores of bloggers are publishing lists of the Dead Vote.  Statistical algorithms used to identify voter fraud in third world countries, applied to this vote, show massive fraud.

1325934652373282817 2020-11-10 06:53:50 +0800 <the_cuban17> 3/Trump's legacy is the opening of the political system to millions who never voted before, minorities who for the first time broke Republican, and more women Republican representatives in Congress.

1324465347764912128 2020-11-06 05:35:20 +0800 <the_cuban17> You shouldn't have to do this, of course. You should have sailed into re-election with well over 300 Electoral votes and a booming economy.
1324465346875691009 2020-11-06 05:35:20 +0800 <the_cuban17> As a result, Mr. Trump, now is the time to really fight, and fight like you've never fought before. Tell Ivanka and Jared and the consultants to sit down and shut up. Time 4 u 2b u. Now is the time 4 the straightest, toughest, and most real unvarnished talking you have ever done.
1324465345994858498 2020-11-06 05:35:20 +0800 <the_cuban17> Oddly, he backed off of that fight for about seven months -- possibly at the behest of NYC focused Ivanka and Jared or wimpy GOP consultants, but that's a discussion for another article and another day.
1324465345139298304 2020-11-06 05:35:20 +0800 <the_cuban17> Something inside was telling him that letting a narrowly focused bureaucratic scientist who hadn't treated a human patient in 40 plus years rule the world's economy was not a good idea.
1324465344140972032 2020-11-06 05:35:20 +0800 <the_cuban17> And in the past four years, Trump has rarely disappointed on the fighter front. His instincts back on March 22nd were to push back against Tony Fauci, to not let "the cure be worse than the disease" regarding COVID, and he was right.
1324464363340730369 2020-11-06 05:31:26 +0800 <the_cuban17> 2/Then there is the "it" factor that Trump has, a once in a lifetime gift upon the political scene.  The brilliant Cruz was admittedly a bit weak on all of that.  Okay, more than a bit..
1324464362363457537 2020-11-06 05:31:26 +0800 <the_cuban17> Like many, as I was transitioning from supporting Ted Cruz in the summer of 2016 to making peace with supporting Donald Trump, the main comfort I had was that Trump was a fighter, one who seemed fearless, and one who talked like a real guy instead of a political drone.
1324464176941715456 2020-11-06 05:30:41 +0800 <the_cuban17> 2/Donald Trump has won all four, and now he must successfully defend all four wins from the very mail-in shenanigans he (and all of us) predicted would happen months ago. This is flesh and blood people versus theoretical pieces of mail. The people must win this.
1324464176123858944 2020-11-06 05:30:41 +0800 <the_cuban17> The presidential election is going to come down to a nasty street fight of lawyers, public relations spin, and positioning involving four states.

1324463710824529920 2020-11-06 05:28:50 +0800 <the_cuban17> 2/Compete in the future? Michael Steele who was a failure as a Republican party chairman, Mitt Romney, Jeff Flake and the likes are never going to achieve anything with anyone of the millions that voted for Trump.
1324463709859811336 2020-11-06 05:28:50 +0800 <the_cuban17> So, the election is being stolen from President Trump in real time. The only Republican President who has brought together a coalition of people of all color and races and yet you have these RINO's claiming to reconstruct the Republican party to compete in the future.

So the people who squandered American freedom&amp; prosperity 4 safety or because they don't like Trump's personality, are basically voting for a figurehead, to be replaced by guess who.
1324075346635952135 2020-11-05 03:45:37 +0800 <the_cuban17> Speaking of a Biden presidency, if he were to win, odds are he would not finish out his first term. Vice President Kamala Harris would become president, a person who dropped out of the Democrat primaries before a single vote was cast based on her lack of voter support,

1324075005739753474 2020-11-05 03:44:16 +0800 <the_cuban17> The senile &amp; corrupt Joe Biden could finish so strong speaks to either the gullibility or unseriousness of far too many Americans. Biden obviously has mental acuity issues and has a history of corruption, but that did not seem to be a big deal to the Americans who voted for him.
1324074400971399168 2020-11-05 03:41:51 +0800 <the_cuban17> 2/ Globalists, corrupt voting officials and the deep state are most likely in on this skullduggery. Through this coordinated effort, along with the media, the race is close and the stage is set for either stealing the election for Biden, civil unrest, or both.
1324074400187121664 2020-11-05 03:41:51 +0800 <the_cuban17> States like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania declaring they need more days to count their votes also raises the specter of voter fraud.
1324074319169937409 2020-11-05 03:41:32 +0800 <the_cuban17> 5/ Fox News should be shunned by all conservatives from this day forward and they should throw viewership to OANN (One America News Network) and Newsmax.

1324074316334616585 2020-11-05 03:41:31 +0800 <the_cuban17> 2/ By sitting on the results of states like Georgia and North Carolina, states that, of this writing, showed Trump with narrow leads with 99 percent of the precincts in, Fox allowed Biden to gain momentum while slowing Trump's dominance.
1324074315407654913 2020-11-05 03:41:31 +0800 <the_cuban17> Fox News should be forever viewed by conservatives as the enemy. Its early calls for states for Biden that had not finished voting such as Arizona and Virginia and their slow walking of states which Trump decisively won like Florida, Texas and Ohio, was an absolute disgrace.

1312872671995142145 2020-10-05 05:50:11 +0800 <the_cuban17> 2. I then ask what is it about trump they hate? Most say he's un-presidential! What does that mean, what president would you consider Presidential? Well Obama of course. So, Obama was presidential and what did that do for you?
1312872671223468034 2020-10-05 05:50:11 +0800 <the_cuban17> I have 1069 associates that I interact with 5 days a week and about 70% say they identify as Democrats. As a Hispanic and Black which most of them are I ask why? Do they like Biden? They say Biden is terrible but hate Trump.
1312051373345837058 2020-10-02 23:26:38 +0800 <the_cuban17> Joe Biden is a puppet of these idiotic people and if elected President you will experience what I have and once that happens in the United States the world will be affected.  The Cuban
1312051372469223425 2020-10-02 23:26:38 +0800 <the_cuban17> 4. A part of me would like to see all ignorant people who clamor to be like the disaster that I experienced in Socialism, Communism and Dictatorship suffer under it. But my love for freedom and capitalism keeps me from wishing it even upon the idiots of this country.
1312051371735166976 2020-10-02 23:26:38 +0800 <the_cuban17> 3. There will come a time when Trump will not be President and then what? Do you think they will regain their respect. I say not!
1312051370900545538 2020-10-02 23:26:38 +0800 <the_cuban17> 2. The Democrat operatives in the United States which are the likes of CNN, FOXNEWS, MSNBC, NBC, CBS, NPR, and ABC among many more have lost all credibility with the people that will eventually matter, the consumer.
1312051370019696643 2020-10-02 23:26:38 +0800 <the_cuban17> So many happy faces and gibberish expressed at the political malpractice of journalism which has spread throughout the world. True Journalist report on fact and are never compromise reputation for personal vendetta.
1311782122483580930 2020-10-02 05:36:44 +0800 <the_cuban17> Never forget that Obama made endless promises to the Latino community he never kept, and if Biden becomes President it will be much worse for our community.  The Cuban
1311782121716019201 2020-10-02 05:36:44 +0800 <the_cuban17> 4) and in all of that, when he panders to you like Obama did, ask him how he's going to achieve it and when?
1311782120927440897 2020-10-02 05:36:44 +0800 <the_cuban17> 3) What about DACA?
1311782120227057666 2020-10-02 05:36:43 +0800 <the_cuban17> 2) Why doesn't any Hispanic media individual ask Biden if he's going to deport Illegal Immigrants at the rate Obama did, which was historic?
1311782119232995330 2020-10-02 05:36:43 +0800 <the_cuban17> 1) Are you better off with Trump economically than you were with Obama? After all that's the reason you came to the United States, to leave the misery behind. Biden is much worse than Obama was to us.
1311782118360571906 2020-10-02 05:36:43 +0800 <the_cuban17> So, the debacle of the so called debate took place and of course the predictability of the dishonest media. I encourage all Hispanics, Latinos or Latin X whatever the heck that means in all to ask yourself this question:
1310919822876835840 2020-09-29 20:30:16 +0800 <the_cuban17> So, today is the debate between (as NPD Rachel Martin described this morning), Trump The entertainer and Joe Biden the perjurer who has never accomplished anything with out stealing it.  The Cuban
1310589141617438720 2020-09-28 22:36:15 +0800 <the_cuban17> The owner @realDonaldTrump  didn't volunteered it, Congress hasn't obtained it, so that means some1 stole it &amp; the NYT is reporting on stolen legal documents. The first amendment does not protect against committing theft to report unverified &amp; anonymous source stories.  The Cuban
1310589140518473728 2020-09-28 22:36:15 +0800 <the_cuban17> The NYT is reporting unverified and more than likely untrue reports concerning Trumps taxes, but Journalism be damned.  Let's give them the benefit of the doubt and the report although not verified is true, who stole it and who's going to pay the criminal price for it?
1310588290593153024 2020-09-28 22:32:52 +0800 <the_cuban17> The media is corrupt and used by communist China in their anti-America format. Remember Hitler's Germany and what it did to Europe? The Europeans never learn and are headed in the same direction with China.  The Cuban
1310588289674604544 2020-09-28 22:32:52 +0800 <the_cuban17> The foolish media believes China when it says it is going to attack climate change and become fossil fuel free by 2060, while building coal plants at a rate doubling all other countries combined throughout the world.

1309858046978461696 2020-09-26 22:11:09 +0800 <the_cuban17> Isn't that what H.Clinton suggested 2 Biden 2 do by stating that he should not concede? I will say this, "The Democrats have been resisting the fact that Trump defeated them &amp; the stupid so called Republicans that call themselves never Trumpers.
1309857478050484226 2020-09-26 22:08:53 +0800 <the_cuban17> The Democrats usually have one or two republican that go along with their oppressive fascist demands and call it bipartisan. Democrats bipartisanship is fascism and it is time the all un-democrats see that and resist it.  The Cuban
1309857477207511044 2020-09-26 22:08:53 +0800 <the_cuban17> Fascism, you are a fascist when you refuse to accept anyone else's opinion as fact and only yours matters. Isn't that exactly what Democrats are today? Bipartisan agreement, what does that mean in American politics today.
1309857171463700483 2020-09-26 22:07:40 +0800 <the_cuban17> Isn't it troubling that although you see what's really happening in society, and are aware of its history; the radical violent socialist Democrats choose to ignore it as if it is fiction of an unimaginative imagination.  The Cuban
1309541372031102978 2020-09-26 01:12:47 +0800 <the_cuban17> 3. I was always leery of people like Steven Spielberg, who profited more than what his investment was if he was truly with Madoff for more than 20 years. His return was greater than his investment. All of the people defrauded were Millionaires at the very least.  The Cuban
1309541367643877378 2020-09-26 01:12:46 +0800 <the_cuban17> 2. I must tell you that these people were aware of the scheme, but greed kept them from accepting it. No one gives you 10% return on anything the way it was done, and in fact if they were investors they would have known the irregularity.
1309541363273392129 2020-09-26 01:12:45 +0800 <the_cuban17> Investors who profited from Bernard Madoff's massive Ponzi scheme even though they knew nothing of it must still pay back their profits, an appeals court decided Thursday.
1309509753488527361 2020-09-25 23:07:09 +0800 <the_cuban17> Now comes along a decrepit old failure promising 2 do things he promised be4 &amp; never did. Joe Biden has been in government for 50 years &amp; was catalyst in destroying the minority class with his true racist actions. He is the true historical racist in the 2020 for President race.
1309509450332602370 2020-09-25 23:05:57 +0800 <the_cuban17> An unnecessary shut down that crippled the hot economy for a while and now is coming back Americans of all color, race and creed working and prospering.

1309508845732016128 2020-09-25 23:03:32 +0800 <the_cuban17> A common trend I'm seeing among the anti-America "never trumpers" and the Socialist Democrats is that they love to accuse the @realDonaldTrump  of the things that they are actually doing.  The Cuban
1309507893457231872 2020-09-25 22:59:45 +0800 <the_cuban17> What many do not know is that these individuals were catalyst in invoking the insurrection act of 1807 to use the military in 1992 against race rioters in Los Angeles.   The Cuban
1309507892706455558 2020-09-25 22:59:45 +0800 <the_cuban17> are among the more than 100 former "intelligence" officers who are critical of the President for mentioning the insurrection act.

1309507407152852998 2020-09-25 22:57:49 +0800 <the_cuban17> American's ignorance and lack of concern regarding what is happening with BLM and Anti-fascist  who are really the fascist, is making America extremely vulnerable to people who's aim is to destroy it.  The Cuban
1309505894829481985 2020-09-25 22:51:49 +0800 <the_cuban17> This isn't a gloom and doom prediction or rhetoric, look around you and pay attention to what's taking place America, you are on fire.  The Cuban
1309505893969559554 2020-09-25 22:51:49 +0800 <the_cuban17> A civil war today would produce 6,500.000 dead, or 2% of the U.S. population. The population during the Civil war was 31,443.321  and 620,000 died. Today's U. S. population is 328,200,000 which is more than 10 times the population during the American Civil War.
1309505893126602753 2020-09-25 22:51:49 +0800 <the_cuban17> America is bitterly divided, prominent observers are discussing the possibility of a second Civil war, in 2019 a Georgetown University poll showed that 2/3 of Americans believe "the U.S. is on the edge of civil war"

1308447228177059840 2020-09-23 00:45:03 +0800 <the_cuban17> The Cuban: Is that not Fascist? The fascist Democrats are threatening the people with violence, and anarchy if you don't choose their way. Is that not what they accuse POTUS of doing although he never has?
1308447226650415104 2020-09-23 00:45:03 +0800 <the_cuban17> Democrats are threatening impeachment of President Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr.  And Democrats are even threatening to block access to the Republican senators from entering the US Senate Chamber in the US Capitol Building.

1307810502144397312 2020-09-21 06:34:56 +0800 <the_cuban17> I say goodbye for now, but know I will see both again, and this time no one will be able to separate  us for there will be no end. Your First Born  https://t.co/EMv6ssSI3P
1307810501146144775 2020-09-21 06:34:56 +0800 <the_cuban17> I blame myself today for not being able to be there, but there will come a day when God will bring all things to bare.  I know I wasn't there when you needed me the most, but with God's help and His strength I know that which is true  will be shown.
1307810500038852610 2020-09-21 06:34:55 +0800 <the_cuban17> because I could not be there  for the people that were their for me all of my life. My Mom Nela and my dad Juan are the greatest people I've ever known. Now I find that their end of life was one filled with pain, and surrounded by people that say they cared for them.
1307810498449223680 2020-09-21 06:34:55 +0800 <the_cuban17> I'm more than 6 feet tall, 220lbs strong with a body fat index of 9% Muscular and fit, strong in musculature and people say I look almost half my age. However today I feel like the weakest person on earth,
1306333535276617733 2020-09-17 04:45:59 +0800 <the_cuban17> That way when the clown speaks ur supporters can boo him &amp; when u speak you can be cheered. This way the fake news media can't say that u refused, but they would b the one's that refused. You stand ur ground Mr. President, Biden can't stand for 15 minutes much less over an hour.
1306333533540155397 2020-09-17 04:45:59 +0800 <the_cuban17> @realDonaldTrump  and the Trump campaign if the Democrats come in at the last minute trying to change the debate format to virtual, you should agree by stating that Joe Biden can do it virtually while you are at one of your Rallies.
1306332837331730432 2020-09-17 04:43:13 +0800 <the_cuban17> The American idiot that clamors for socialism are unable to understand why it is that people die to come to this country?
1306332836518076417 2020-09-17 04:43:13 +0800 <the_cuban17> I guarantee you that after a week without social media, and the inability to go out to the store and buy whatever it is you want you will be crying for your Mommy or Daddy to come get you out of there.
1306332835721216001 2020-09-17 04:43:13 +0800 <the_cuban17> It is said that over 70% of millennial approve of socialism, although they can't describe what it really is. I have a suggestion to all of you ignorant people, why don't you go to live in a socialist country for one month and than make your decision.
1306215915957223426 2020-09-16 20:58:37 +0800 <the_cuban17> No wonder they hate him, he's making them look like the incompetent never do nothing politicians that they are, have always been, and if elected Biden is and will be.
1306215915017601025 2020-09-16 20:58:37 +0800 <the_cuban17> Now this inexperienced orange hair crazy man according to them who promised to move the US embassy to Jerusalem and did it, and now brokers a historic peace agreement.
1306215914010943490 2020-09-16 20:58:36 +0800 <the_cuban17> The Cuban: Isn't amazing to see how the Democrats and never Trumpers who have always promise to bring peace to the Middle East and were never able to do anything because they have always been about talk and no action.
1306215912970817536 2020-09-16 20:58:36 +0800 <the_cuban17> History was made today at the White House as leaders from Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain met with President Trump and signed the Abraham Accords, which will normalize diplomatic relations between Israel and the two Arab nations.
1305973447093346308 2020-09-16 04:55:08 +0800 <the_cuban17> So I asked, and who do you sell the crack to? "Because I know no whites or Latinos go into the hood or trap houses? "The N word" they said! Wait, then your statement should not be "BLM", it should be "BLDM" Black Lives Don't Matter!
1305973445835055104 2020-09-16 04:55:07 +0800 <the_cuban17> So, I was in the midst of BLM supporters that are encouraging what they call protest which are really riots and this is what I heard. "In the hood if you have several trap houses you can easily make $100,000 per day" followed by "You know what I'm saying"
1305972432595976192 2020-09-16 04:51:06 +0800 <the_cuban17> What they do care about is global economic domination by knocking America off our pedestal.  Biden's energy plan would give President Xi Jinping and his fellow communists a big assist.
1305972107168354305 2020-09-16 04:49:48 +0800 <the_cuban17> Under the Biden plan, it sure looks like we will have to get it from Russia, Saudi Arabia and even China, which is planning to build hundreds of coal plants over the next decade. The leaders of Beijing could care less about climate change.
1305972106245607425 2020-09-16 04:49:48 +0800 <the_cuban17> So, Biden is telling us we are going to bring jobs back home by decapitation our energy industry. Wind and solar account for about 5% of our energy consumption today, so even if we double their output, we still need to have access to other energy.
1305972105331257345 2020-09-16 04:49:48 +0800 <the_cuban17> Because of fracking, we passed Saudi Arabia in output. In other words, oil and gas IS made in America now, thanks, in no small part, to President Donald Trump's all-in strategy of making the USA energy dominant.
1305972104408584192 2020-09-16 04:49:48 +0800 <the_cuban17> How the left ever thinks it will turn Texas blue by promising to ban oil is one of life's great mysteries. Liberals must really believe Texans are stupid people.  The Wall Street Journal reports that, in 2019, the U.S. led the world in oil and gas production.
1305972103531945987 2020-09-16 04:49:47 +0800 <the_cuban17> -- the kind that Biden laughingly says he wants to bring back home to America -- and hundreds of thousands of them are in battleground states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Colorado.
1305972102604955648 2020-09-16 04:49:47 +0800 <the_cuban17> There are a lot of them. The oil, gas and coal industry accounts for somewhere between 5 and 10 million jobs, depending on how you count them. These are almost all high-paying blue-collar jobs
1305972101698990084 2020-09-16 04:49:47 +0800 <the_cuban17> Given that we currently get about 80% of our energy from oil, gas and coal, according to Daniel Yergin, a world expert on energy, getting down to zero is going to be a gut-wrenching experience for blue-collar workers.
1305972100776243203 2020-09-16 04:49:47 +0800 <the_cuban17> This, of course, is a de facto ban on fracking, because if we aren't going to use the energy, why would anyone drill for it? That Biden zero-carbon emissions target requires a glide path to no fossil fuel production and consumption 15 years from now.
1305972099798970369 2020-09-16 04:49:47 +0800 <the_cuban17> But what is unambiguous and in big, bold writing in the Biden "buy America" plan is his signature pledge to the climate change crusaders to end fossil fuel use in America by 2035.

1304472041895202816 2020-09-12 01:29:05 +0800 <the_cuban17> Lindsey Graham: Did Mueller's team obstruct justice by 'wiping' phones? Senator Lindsey Graham discusses how members of Robert Mueller's team 'wiped' their phones during the Trump investigation
1303731178638389248 2020-09-10 00:25:09 +0800 <the_cuban17> The Cuban: That's evident and only news to those who are too blind to see that with their own eyes. Democrats are willing to have him elected to implement the destruction of America.
1303731177807806465 2020-09-10 00:25:09 +0800 <the_cuban17> "That's not Joe Biden. That's a shell of his former self," Mike McCormick, who worked as a White House stenographer for 15 years and with the former vice president from 2011 to 2017.
1303688371143835648 2020-09-09 21:35:03 +0800 <the_cuban17> What the hell happened to America in the last 25 years? The Cuban: The Democrats is what happen to America!
1303688369529139200 2020-09-09 21:35:03 +0800 <the_cuban17> That was then. This is now. The city is Kenosha or Portland or Seattle. The neighbors under attack r police officers or business people or any white people. The attackers r BLM activists or antifa. The average people standing up to hate are   for the most part missing in action.
1303688368577032198 2020-09-09 21:35:03 +0800 <the_cuban17> The town was Billings. The neighbors were Jewish, Black and Native American. The attackers were white supremacists. The average people standing up to hate were, for the most part, white people who, like most people of all colors, were offended by racism and anti-Semitism.
1303688367687847941 2020-09-09 21:35:02 +0800 <the_cuban17> It was 25 years ago when the average people of a small city in Montana "joined together to stand up to hate when their neighbors were under attack," as the Not in Our Town website reminds us.
1303687501891207169 2020-09-09 21:31:36 +0800 <the_cuban17> In fact, the improvement in the overall unemployment rate to 8.4% surpasses what forecasters expected to see by the end of the year, let alone by the end of August.
1303687500574138368 2020-09-09 21:31:36 +0800 <the_cuban17> The unemployment rate fell 1.6% points for Africans Americans, 2.4% points for Hispanic Americans, and 1.3% points for Asian Americans. It also dropped 2.1% points for women and an impressive 2.8% points for Americans without a high-school diploma.
1303454121203245057 2020-09-09 06:04:14 +0800 <the_cuban17> It is Donald Trump who has build it to what it is today. The Democrats can't defeat Donald Trump with this "Walter" look alike Character so they must spread lie with the hope that some will believe it.  https://t.co/UAQPpwIcj1
1303454071676899328 2020-09-09 06:04:02 +0800 <the_cuban17> The Cuban: For all of those that are able to process facts, I will not ask you to believe or not believe the Atlantics hit job, I just want you to seek out the basic facts. Under Biden's 8 year term with Obama the military was decimated.
1303454066618650624 2020-09-09 06:04:01 +0800 <the_cuban17> it was a coordinated hit job involving the press, Democratic operatives, and associated leftist groups connected to the military, executed with impeccable timing.  The Atlantic is building a name for itself for its uncorrected false stories, and this one's not at all different.
1303454061899939840 2020-09-09 06:04:00 +0800 <the_cuban17> The evidence is piling up that the easily refutable, anonymously sourced so-called story, claiming that President Trump disparaged veterans, wasn't really an Atlantic news story at all;
1303454057206632455 2020-09-09 06:03:58 +0800 <the_cuban17> To get a sense of how low the Biden campaign is going to go in its quest to oust President Trump, the Atlantic hit job from Thursday is a pretty good indicator.
1303452206608330755 2020-09-09 05:56:37 +0800 <the_cuban17> Now, though, even the scripted appearances can't cover for his mental decline. The Democrats are, therefore, trying to level the playing field by launching false attacks against Trump's cognitive abilities.  https://t.co/HogU8ZRb51
1303452104560979970 2020-09-09 05:56:13 +0800 <the_cuban17> The rumors about Biden's mental competence began concerning the debates. For the Democrats, the Wuhan virus was a blessing because it allowed them to hide Biden from the public, except for scripted appearances from his home.
1303075183679373313 2020-09-08 04:58:28 +0800 <the_cuban17> What America is is free, and that's why people like us are able to speak freely, you couldn't do that In China which censored the NBA because an American spoke freely and you Lebron James did not come to his defense. Oh how hypocritical we truly are
1303075182827970560 2020-09-08 04:58:28 +0800 <the_cuban17> Lebron James says that America is racist, what color are you, and who is it that has given you a chance? How many people of our race play for Russia, North Korea, Iran, or even Germany? Now compare that to the United States, can you truly say America is racist?
1303075015815028737 2020-09-08 04:57:48 +0800 <the_cuban17> Are you cheering for America? Are you a racist, fascist, xenophobe? If one is than all are!
1303075015038992384 2020-09-08 04:57:48 +0800 <the_cuban17> The media calls people that call themselves Patriots because they choose America first as their slogans as  Fascist, racist, xenophobic among others. How many Americans watch The Olympics, or the woman's world cup; or any International event where the United States is involved?
1303075014254759936 2020-09-08 04:57:48 +0800 <the_cuban17> Have you noticed how popular it is for the media and their misinformed follower to call taking pride in being American Extreme? "If you fly the flag and stand for the National Anthem you're a right wing extremist"
1302621534700417024 2020-09-06 22:55:50 +0800 <the_cuban17> @thehill @JuliansRum Says the man who can not formulate a sentence anymore, Mr. Biden you sir need a mental health check!
1302620194485960704 2020-09-06 22:50:30 +0800 <the_cuban17> If there is a conspiracy to remove @realDonaldTrump  from office even if he wins, they’re telling you about it precisely to get you ready for it, so that when it happens you won’t think it was a conspiracy; you’ll blame the president. Don’t be fooled.
1302620016207167490 2020-09-06 22:49:48 +0800 <the_cuban17> Count on it. He’s going to need a way to talk to the American people and he has to find the means, now. For the rest of us, the most important thing we can do is raise awareness.
1302619896510132224 2020-09-06 22:49:19 +0800 <the_cuban17> The T.V. channels, with the likely exception of Fox News, will refuse to cover anything he says.
1302619895335710720 2020-09-06 22:49:19 +0800 <the_cuban17> They also need to set up or shore up—now—communication channels that don’t rely on the media or Big Tech. Once the ruling class gives word that the narrative is “Trump lost,” all the president’s social media accounts will be suspended.
1302619761961037825 2020-09-06 22:48:47 +0800 <the_cuban17> They should also be talking to people inside and outside of government whom they absolutely trust to get a clearer sense of who on the inside won’t go along with a coup and who might.
1302619760409169921 2020-09-06 22:48:47 +0800 <the_cuban17> Here’s 1 thing they could do: play their own “war game” scenario so as to game out possibilities &amp; minimize surprises.
1302619595556225029 2020-09-06 22:48:07 +0800 <the_cuban17> Oust a leader—even an elected one—through agitation and call it “democracy.” The events of the last few months may be interpreted as an attempted color revolution that failed to gain enough steam, or as a trial run for the fall. Is the Trump Administration prepared?
1302619528732516353 2020-09-06 22:47:51 +0800 <the_cuban17> “Trump must go.” I.e., what’s come to be known as a “color revolution,” the exact same playbook the American deep state runs in other countries whose leadership they don’t like and is currently running in Belarus.
1302619527453212673 2020-09-06 22:47:51 +0800 <the_cuban17> In other words, a repeat of this summer, only much, much bigger. Crank the propaganda to ear-drum shattering decibels and fill the streets of every major city with “protesters.” Shut down the country and allow only one message to be heard:
1302619385169940488 2020-09-06 22:47:17 +0800 <the_cuban17> Barring all that, what’s left? Remember that phrase from the Dem war game: “street fight.”
1302619384041668610 2020-09-06 22:47:17 +0800 <the_cuban17> On the other hand, were they to believe he did lose and was refusing to leave  scenario I find impossible 2 imagine but the Democrats insist is just around the corner—it’s possible the Service might act.
1302619221344636929 2020-09-06 22:46:38 +0800 <the_cuban17> I’ve seen the Service up close; it really is (or strongly appears to be) apolitical. It has a job to do: protect the president, whoever that is. Officers take that job very seriously. If they don’t believe Trump lost, I don’t think they can be counted on to oust him.
1302619140394450944 2020-09-06 22:46:19 +0800 <the_cuban17> thinking by people like Jeffrey Goldberg in his recent Atlantic essay. Can the Dems rely on the Secret Service to drag Trump out? I have my doubts on this one.
1302619139304034305 2020-09-06 22:46:18 +0800 <the_cuban17> The aforementioned Chairman has already stated that the military will play “no role” in the outcome of the election. That’s probably not a feint, but one wonders if it will hold given the obvious attempt to influence military
1302618992947929088 2020-09-06 22:45:44 +0800 <the_cuban17> Still and all, determining the outcome of an election would be the most open political interference possible from our allegedly apolitical military, and it’s plausible that the brass won’t want to make its quiet support of the ruling class agenda that overt.
1302618991542898688 2020-09-06 22:45:43 +0800 <the_cuban17> There are reasons to fear they might. The Obama administration spent a great deal of political capital purging the officer corps of anyone not down with the program and promoting only those who are.
1302618786324000774 2020-09-06 22:44:54 +0800 <the_cuban17> that’s exactly what every Democratic politician and media organ will shout. Stop the Presses What then? The Podesta assumption is that the military will side with the Dems.
1302618785061523457 2020-09-06 22:44:54 +0800 <the_cuban17> I.e., in blaring from every rooftop that “Trump lost.” At this point, it’s safe to assume that unless Trump wins in a blowout that can’t be overcome by cheating and/or denied via the ruling class’s massive propaganda operation,
1302618578781380609 2020-09-06 22:44:05 +0800 <the_cuban17> [who could] establish pre-commitments to playing a constructive role in event of a contested election.”
1302618577632219140 2020-09-06 22:44:05 +0800 <the_cuban17> The third piece is to get the vast and loud Dem-Left propaganda machine ready for war. That leaked report exhorted Democrats to identify “key influencers in the media and among local activists who can affect political perceptions and mobilize political action…
1302618442139303938 2020-09-06 22:43:32 +0800 <the_cuban17> streams of stories and social media posts “explaining” how, while on election night it might look as if Trump won, close states will tip to Biden as all the mail-in ballots are “counted.”
1302618440805613568 2020-09-06 22:43:32 +0800 <the_cuban17> Of course, that will not stop the Dems from insisting that they won. The public preparation 4 that has also already begun:
1302618187050242048 2020-09-06 22:42:31 +0800 <the_cuban17> would be results in a handful of states that are so ambiguous and hotly disputed that no one can rightly say who won.
1302618185871523840 2020-09-06 22:42:31 +0800 <the_cuban17> to tip close states, or else dispute the results in close states and insist, no matter what the tally says, that Biden won them. The worst-case scenario (for the country, but not for the ruling class)
1302618184688848896 2020-09-06 22:42:31 +0800 <the_cuban17> Never mind the pesky detail that the president would refuse to leave only if he were convinced he legitimately won. Remember: Biden should not concede under any circumstances. The second part of the plan is either to produce enough harvested ballots—lawfully or not—
1302617922284683264 2020-09-06 22:41:28 +0800 <the_cuban17> Why r Democrats, publicly talkin about conspiracy? Cause they know that, 4 it 2 succeed, it must not look like a conspiracy. They need 2 plant the idea in the public mind, now, that their unlawful and illegitimate removal of @realDonaldTrump  from office will somehow be his fault
1302617346289340417 2020-09-06 22:39:11 +0800 <the_cuban17> The second rule of conspiracy is, you do not talk about the conspiracy.
1302617345152745474 2020-09-06 22:39:11 +0800 <the_cuban17> But for all of them? I’m not so sure. In his famously exhaustive discussion of conspiracies, Machiavelli goes out of his way to emphasize the indispensability of “operational security”—i.e., silence—to success. The first rule of conspiracy is, you do not talk about the conspiracy
1302617242526507008 2020-09-06 22:38:46 +0800 <the_cuban17> For some of them, no doubt that’s true.
1302617241440129024 2020-09-06 22:38:46 +0800 <the_cuban17> The Cover-Up in Plain Sight These items are, 2 repeat, merely a short but representative list of what Byron York recently labeled “coup porn.” York seems 2 think this is just harmless fantasizing on the part of the ruling class and its Democratic servants.
1302617062100078593 2020-09-06 22:38:03 +0800 <the_cuban17> This doesn’t sound like the rhetoric of a political party confident it will win an upcoming election.
1302617060946644997 2020-09-06 22:38:03 +0800 <the_cuban17> About a month later, Hillary Clinton declared publicly that Joe Biden should not concede the election “under any circumstances.” The old English major in me interprets the word “any” to mean “no,” “none,” “nada,” “niente,” “zero,” “zilch” “bupkis”…you get the idea.
1302616952905629698 2020-09-06 22:37:37 +0800 <the_cuban17> Over summer, 2 former Army officers,  prominent in Democrat-aligned “national security” think tank 🌏, wrote open letter 2 the Chairman of  Joint Chiefs in which urged him 2 deploy  82nd Airborne Division 2 drag Trump from the Oval Office at precisely 12:01 PM, January 20, 2021.
1302616209427443712 2020-09-06 22:34:40 +0800 <the_cuban17> November election would be “a street fight, not a legal battle.” Two more data points (among several that could be provided).
1302616207846191104 2020-09-06 22:34:40 +0800 <the_cuban17> take care of the rest. The leaked report from the exercise darkly concluded that “technocratic solutions, courts, and reliance on elites observing norms are not the answer here,” promising that what would follow the
1302616206692823041 2020-09-06 22:34:39 +0800 <the_cuban17> One such outcome was a clear Trump win. In that eventuality, former Bill Clinton White House Chief of Staff John Podesta, playing Biden, refused to concede, pressured states that Trump won to send Democrats to the formal Electoral College vote, and trusted that the military would
1302615916325240836 2020-09-06 22:33:30 +0800 <the_cuban17> Over the summer a story was deliberately leaked to the press of a meeting at which 100 Democratic grandees, anti-Trump former Republicans, and other ruling class apparatchiks got together (on George Soros’s dime) to “game out” various outcomes of the 2020 election.
1302615915058601985 2020-09-06 22:33:30 +0800 <the_cuban17> Another former Vice President, Al Gore, publicly agreed. One might dismiss such comments as the ravings of a dementia patient and a has-been who never got over his own electoral loss. But before you do, consider also this.
1302615816102449152 2020-09-06 22:33:06 +0800 <the_cuban17> has not once, not twice, but thrice confidently asserted that the military will “escort [Trump] from the White House with great dispatch” should the president refuse to leave.
1302615814856732673 2020-09-06 22:33:06 +0800 <the_cuban17> His implicit message was: “Mr. President, don’t tell us to do that, because we won’t, and you know what happens after that.” All this enthused Joe Biden, who threw subtlety to the winds. The former United States Senator (for 26 years) and Vice President (for eight)
1302615676369154048 2020-09-06 22:32:33 +0800 <the_cuban17> hint at. Then, as nationwide riots really got rolling in early June, the sitting Secretary of Defense himself all but publicly told the president not to invoke the Insurrection Act.
1302615675102523393 2020-09-06 22:32:33 +0800 <the_cuban17> But it’s happening. It started with the military brass quietly indicating that the troops should not follow a presidential order. They were bolstered by many former generals—including President Trump’s own first Secretary of Defense—who stated openly what the brass would only
1302615547977314306 2020-09-06 22:32:02 +0800 <the_cuban17> You might have missed it, what with the riots, lockdowns and other daily mayhem we’re forced to endure in this, the most wretched year of my lifetime.
1302615546631008257 2020-09-06 22:32:02 +0800 <the_cuban17> Democrats are laying the groundwork for revolution right in front of our eyes. As if 2020 were not insane enough already, we now have Democrats and their ruling class masters openly talking about staging a coup.
1301980633246375937 2020-09-05 04:29:07 +0800 <the_cuban17> Trash can only fool trash and our veterans hero aren't trash.
1301980632403369984 2020-09-05 04:29:07 +0800 <the_cuban17> 4. Your trash trashes the America that these men and women fought and so many thousands have died for, and all of the sudden you're going to write something to benefit them? They know it is falsehood garbage because of who you are.
1301980631547686916 2020-09-05 04:29:06 +0800 <the_cuban17> 3.  However the article is written with the intent to discourage veterans and convince them that Trump is not their man. Except here's the problem Atlantic, these men and women to whom we owe our freedom, know that your trash doesn't match what President Trump has done for them.
1301980630557880322 2020-09-05 04:29:06 +0800 <the_cuban17> 2. So, they claim President Trump made derogatory remarks towards veterans, and there is a certain portion of the population that will be believe it, for they eat out of the same toilet.
1301980629572214785 2020-09-05 04:29:06 +0800 <the_cuban17> Have you ever read The Atlantic Magazine trash? God bless you if you never have, for toilet paper is less trash worthy. If you have than you know it is a Socialist anti-American propaganda garbage.
1301979826635649024 2020-09-05 04:25:54 +0800 <the_cuban17> He wasn't pulled over or selling cigarettes, Please look up the reason that the police was called and tell me if the Democrats even know and ignoring it. What happen to the "ME TOO MOVEMENT?"
1301979825612226566 2020-09-05 04:25:54 +0800 <the_cuban17> The Cuban: We know that Joe Biden spoke and visited Jacob Blake and his family, did he visit Jacob Blake's victim? Why isn't anyone speaking of the reason why the police encountered Jacob Blake?
1301646735266197504 2020-09-04 06:22:19 +0800 <the_cuban17> particularly with past Republican leaders and presidential candidates. The trend keeps rising.
1301646734402162688 2020-09-04 06:22:19 +0800 <the_cuban17> He has that way of reading the reality.  And Unamue's completely right that these voters are moving to Trump. Solomon cites a two-point rise in pan-Latino favorability to 32%, according to a new Hill-HarrisX poll, a steady rise from far lower numbers in the past,
1301646733584347142 2020-09-04 06:22:19 +0800 <the_cuban17> Just when the Democrats thought it was safe to go back into the leftist Latinx narrative, out comes the Goya CEO, Bob Unamue, and he's warning that "hatred and destruction" from the riotous destruction of small businesses are driving Latino voters to President Trump.
1301644781534277635 2020-09-04 06:14:33 +0800 <the_cuban17> @RealEye67473465 @washingtonpost hahahaha A fitting assessment for The Washington compost
1301130070682152960 2020-09-02 20:09:17 +0800 <the_cuban17> Do they really believe that China, Russia, Iran or any of this Anti-Trump bad actors would actively be working to help Trump? You must think the American public is stupid, ignorant and uninformed. Or are we? We shall see on November 3, 2020.
1301130069776236545 2020-09-02 20:09:17 +0800 <the_cuban17> So, it has been reported that Facebook and Twitter are intercepting Russian misinformation campaign to benefit Donald Trump. Does anyone with a brain truly believe that?
