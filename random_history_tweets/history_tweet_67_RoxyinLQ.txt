1340268439957475329 2020-12-19 20:11:11 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @FoxNews Who cares about Hunter Biden. What you should be doing is talking about the vaccine and how California needs it the most and how Congress shouldn’t be getting vaccines.

But they are ASPCA, Animal Samaritans, Coachella Valley Rescue Mission, Martha’s Village, Wounded Warriors Project this year. Also, donated to Biden/Harris this year.

1335796790965063681 2020-12-07 12:02:27 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @iamcardib She can buy the purse she wants. People you definitely don’t have to support her and buy her music. Everyone can do want they choose.

1333185845717733376 2020-11-30 07:07:29 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @briantylercohen Right. I have said this all along.

1333082712064753665 2020-11-30 00:17:40 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @waltshaub If you pay for my Masters then I’m all for it.

1333081414154108928 2020-11-30 00:12:31 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @jbee_texasblue @waltshaub Also, maybe the interest they have paid can go towards the principal. I’m ok with that also.
1333081211120488453 2020-11-30 00:11:42 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RlozTF @waltshaub UBI is the best.

1333078285471760384 2020-11-30 00:00:05 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @frogcycle @waltshaub It’s the government. You have to look at the budget. It kind of is.

1333066742944260097 2020-11-29 23:14:13 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @waltshaub So then let’s give back the money for the people who paid for their education also by giving up many things to pay it off.

1333059189699006464 2020-11-29 22:44:12 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom Actually the Republicans deserve to be ruled by any other party from this point forward.

I paid foe both myself and my son by saving. I do think that what he has paid in interest should go towards the loan and the remainder can be zero or 1 percent.
1330152913872826371 2020-11-21 22:15:42 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @dlmoore921 @Joe80870144 @factcheckmatter @RepAdamSchiff I agree the rich should be taxed at a slightly higher rate, however you should pay your student loans. What I will say is that what you have paid in interest can be put towards the loan and the rest should be at zero or 1 percent interest.
1330152366721671169 2020-11-21 22:13:31 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @dlmoore921 @KevinPalmerJoss @factcheckmatter @RepAdamSchiff It needs to be for everyone not just for people who took out education loans and want relief now.
1330151902676455425 2020-11-21 22:11:41 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @dlmoore921 @RepAdamSchiff No. I say put what you have paid in interest towards the loan and have zero interest from this point on. But it needs to be fair and equitable for everyone not just you.
1330151430590750721 2020-11-21 22:09:48 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RepAdamSchiff @Vaw511 I won’t vote foe another democratic if you do this.
1330151353289682945 2020-11-21 22:09:30 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RepAdamSchiff @Vaw511 Then pay back those who already paid. This isn’t fair and we need to be as fair as possible right now.

1330137451415941122 2020-11-21 21:14:15 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @SenSanders What works is taxing the rich at a slightly hire rate and taxing corporations and taxing churches.

1328561701160062977 2020-11-17 12:52:47 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RealTonyGunk @CuriouslySmooth @EdMarkey Nah. Has to be equitable. Help the poor who don’t have student debt.
1328560856074862592 2020-11-17 12:49:26 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @EdMarkey I won’t vote for another democratic if they do this.
1328560445779701761 2020-11-17 12:47:48 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @EdMarkey Be mad foe the inequality I have been fighting for. What are they doing foe the people who worked two jobs and paid for an education?
1328553169324888065 2020-11-17 12:18:53 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @ShayGirl88 @Goal__Diggah Location location location.
1328551553523871744 2020-11-17 12:12:28 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @evets60 @Goal__Diggah La Quinta too.
1328551143182454785 2020-11-17 12:10:50 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @HuffmanForNC @RepTedBudd No they should not have their loans paid off. However, if you do you can pay me back for two people in my family.
1328540308418691073 2020-11-17 11:27:47 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RAHolmes2 @RepPressley I’m not wealthy and I worked two jabs and paid to get me son through college with no debt.
1328516667475783680 2020-11-17 09:53:50 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @ossoff Yes they should for two years of a four year degree.
1328509713588256768 2020-11-17 09:26:12 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AOC You need to understand that most people are against this and work to come up with a solution.

1328509092558643200 2020-11-17 09:23:44 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @TkaczAdam @therealMaryKat @SenWarren Let them do it. What would be your solution?
1328472768816431105 2020-11-17 06:59:24 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @TkaczAdam @therealMaryKat @SenWarren The government.
1328466340122746881 2020-11-17 06:33:51 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @abigailm1971 @mgundarso @SimplySwole @Scaramucci I was lucky enough to have 529 account for my son and then paid cash each semester at state school. It was tough though.
1328465790996148224 2020-11-17 06:31:40 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @mgundarso @abigailm1971 @SimplySwole @Scaramucci Interest should be zero or 1 percent. Also, interest you have already paid should go towards loan.
1328454032285863936 2020-11-17 05:44:57 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @KatieHill4CA I’m not an asshole because I think they should pay for their own loans. Interest free of course.
1328453246705225729 2020-11-17 05:41:50 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @GavinNewsom Which really is not restrictive.
1328441972655149058 2020-11-17 04:57:02 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @abigailm1971 @mgundarso @SimplySwole @Scaramucci No. Two years free with a certain gpa. Then you could go to state school for last two years interest free.
1328440723927044097 2020-11-17 04:52:04 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @giniponder @DaljiImara @Interstella4L @SenWarren Pay your own bills. I can agree to interest free.
1328440417512087553 2020-11-17 04:50:51 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DaljiImara @Interstella4L @SenWarren Because you wanted that education and you need to pay for it just like other who saved, worked two jobs.
1328440214109310976 2020-11-17 04:50:02 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Interstella4L @SenWarren Yep
1328439772218490880 2020-11-17 04:48:17 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Ms_Kikii @SenWarren So why would you have done that?
1328439671051849728 2020-11-17 04:47:53 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @CMaguire3 @SenWarren Agree. However, they need to do something with interest free loans and affordable colleges.
1328438965985181696 2020-11-17 04:45:05 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @therealMaryKat @SenWarren So I agree if you have paid the value of your debt through interest then it should be. People need to pay zero percent interest on loans from this point forward.
1328438428401233920 2020-11-17 04:42:57 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @LynneHillman3 @ScathachWarrior @SenWarren Cancer is not a choice.

1328437782423822337 2020-11-17 04:40:23 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @smsee33 @SenWarren It should be fair.
1328437578211549185 2020-11-17 04:39:34 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @SenWarren NO NO NO. CANCEL THE INTEREST. MAKE SCHOOL AFFORDABLE. THEY NEED TO PAY JUST LIKE I DID.
1328435939295694849 2020-11-17 04:33:03 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @abigailm1971 @mgundarso @SimplySwole @Scaramucci Not four years. Maybe a 2 year community college.
1328435755933331456 2020-11-17 04:32:20 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @mgundarso @abigailm1971 @SimplySwole @Scaramucci Because people need to pay for an education just like I did for myself and my son. I would agree to no interest loans and if you have already paid enough in interest to equal the actual loan amount then it should be paid off.
1328435084345577472 2020-11-17 04:29:39 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @tyson_mary @Scaramucci Right. No interest.
1328434979966074880 2020-11-17 04:29:15 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Scaramucci Yep!
1328434064022376450 2020-11-17 04:25:36 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RaRaAvisPress Yes, multiple.
1328433396834439168 2020-11-17 04:22:57 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @KLGLASS2 A big yes.
1328430418614337536 2020-11-17 04:11:07 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @LouDobbs Glad you found your safe space where you can lie.
1328426783763415041 2020-11-17 03:56:40 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom He is an awful human being so really stop trying to tell him to be better. He can’t!!
1328423827362041856 2020-11-17 03:44:56 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AOC I disagree with you on this. I wouldn’t have worked two jobs. They need to pay back student loans with no interest.
1328423416811044864 2020-11-17 03:43:18 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @realDonaldTrump They’re crooks!!
1328423135025065984 2020-11-17 03:42:10 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AndrewYang No. They need to pay back the loan but interest free. If they have already paid enough interest that exceeds the amount of the loan then they should not pay anymore.
1328422253088837632 2020-11-17 03:38:40 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @ananavarro Oh my!
1328421191476858881 2020-11-17 03:34:27 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @BillOReilly Yeah “grab em by the pussy”.
1328420785820553216 2020-11-17 03:32:50 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @LfactorAnn @BillOReilly Or maybe if Trump didn’t sexually assault women.

1328336173874352128 2020-11-16 21:56:37 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> No. He didn’t have the election stolen from him and he needs to accept he lost!

We are not talking about any media right now. Don’t you see maybe you are a problem when you think Trump is so great and does nothing wrong?
1328184535234723840 2020-11-16 11:54:04 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom Trump and all his enablers are un-American.

Not sure that would be considered govt. running their lives, but whatever. You can fix stupid, but not a stupid Republican.

Just because Trump had his little rallies with the same type of nonsensical followers attending doesn’t mean he was more popular. Biden supporters didn’t have to attend rallies to prove anything. They just got things done.

1325569303706443777 2020-11-09 06:42:04 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @GeraldoRivera Trump makes me throw up, but I just let it all out!!
1325563291066793984 2020-11-09 06:18:11 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @_StacyDollar_ @Timodc @megynkelly So Did I hear you say anything about all that Trump did?
1325561996821975040 2020-11-09 06:13:02 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @megynkelly Didn’t Trump demean you? Damn, you are weak!!
1325561155100700672 2020-11-09 06:09:41 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @megynkelly What is your problem?  Trump was awful to you and you support him. Get a grip. Trump is so UnAmerican.
1325559639065337857 2020-11-09 06:03:40 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @LunaApollo @NikkiHaley @standamericanow If they would just read Biden’s plan online they might understand. Lol!
1325528320973307904 2020-11-09 03:59:13 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @NikkiHaley @standamericanow They do not want to defund police. This is ridiculous.
1325485784334364674 2020-11-09 01:10:11 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlanBar64975211 I miss traveling and concerts and dancing and eating inside (we can eat outside now). I feel optimistic more so now.
1325480150679482368 2020-11-09 00:47:48 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlanBar64975211 I hope a vaccine is out soon. A safe one of course.

1325471601521905664 2020-11-09 00:13:50 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom Joe, what is wrong with their brains that they believe this crap??
1325471118258438144 2020-11-09 00:11:55 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom He is an insipid, small handed, small minded, POS man child!!

1325454570080804864 2020-11-08 23:06:09 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DanCrenshawTX You really do not have a grasp on reality or how the average person thinks. So sad!  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
1325409040575295491 2020-11-08 20:05:14 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MeidasTouch The thing is it says a lot about him that he supported Trump. I am done with Trump supporters. They crapped on this country!
1325407551660290048 2020-11-08 19:59:19 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @GOPLeader Damn, you are awful.
1325406897067892736 2020-11-08 19:56:43 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @iheartmindy @JoeBiden Only in a warped mind would anyone think their is voter fraud.
1325405910534029312 2020-11-08 19:52:48 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom Just think about all the girls and women. So exciting for us. Decency is back!!
1325405473193951232 2020-11-08 19:51:04 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @ChuckModi1 @Vaw511 The thing is it always going to happen.

1325402534211547138 2020-11-08 19:39:23 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @chuckwoolery All of you are delusional!
1325400401743544320 2020-11-08 19:30:55 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @TheDrunkenMick So when you say a restaurant voted for Biden, I am assuming you mean the owners voted for Biden? Well good foe them. They are patriots and smart people. Everyone should support them!!
1325399347157065728 2020-11-08 19:26:43 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @steel8883 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump America is great!!

1325397814059229184 2020-11-08 19:20:38 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Marc_DAmico Glad you read the responses. The thing is did you hold Trump and his followers to the same?  Did you tell them to the be decent and kind! Did you tell them to choose words wisely? Trump was never a leader and you seemed to be ok with that.
1325394364500045825 2020-11-08 19:06:55 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Mike53305498 Maybe since you are up, you should put some kind of photo in your profile.

1324697977991000066 2020-11-06 20:59:44 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AudacityofGoats Pete seems to be playing the only way he can. It’s hard getting old, but he is still happy.

1324356992463302656 2020-11-05 22:24:47 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Franklin_Graham You are so so so hypocritical! Trump has been such an immoral person and you support him. Crazy!

1323812957965283330 2020-11-04 10:22:59 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Dr_Crater The problem is there are more of them than you. Keep trying. Maybe hers down the road things will change.
1323811843408760832 2020-11-04 10:18:33 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom Trump is going to win unfortunately. I’m just going to live my life and not care about anything anymore.

1320913398033313792 2020-10-27 10:21:10 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom Most Republicans have always been. Kind of weird that you are just seeing this. But glad you are and I appreciate you speaking up now.

1320823844198739968 2020-10-27 04:25:18 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AOC I don’t agree with this. Maybe community college free with high gpa. Do not cancel student debt. Maybe you can cancel interest on loan only.

1320352357029298176 2020-10-25 21:11:47 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MSNBC Hard hard hard pass.
1320351712046059520 2020-10-25 21:09:13 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @CagneyPowers @scottdbravo So what about Trump and his children?  Are there any issues here?
1320350989967257600 2020-10-25 21:06:21 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @mamapade @evanasmith @PhilipRucker @dallasnews @UTTyler @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump There are Trump supporters like that here in California I think. I hope Biden wins, however because of the Electoral College System, I think it could be a problem. I would like to see the House and the Senate go Dem also. It is going to be interesting.
1320346802919329792 2020-10-25 20:49:43 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DanScavino @realDonaldTrump Trump has a devoted cult so he might win. I can say he is a good con man.
1320345995117379585 2020-10-25 20:46:30 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @mamapade @evanasmith @PhilipRucker @dallasnews @UTTyler @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump I suppose we can hope.

1320342442579652614 2020-10-25 20:32:23 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DeaconBlues0 @judevwellness @Knuckleboy2 @Crankyb4covfefe @TakeAimAndVote @MarineRusty @Flushtheturdno1 @Vets4Biden Thank you for your service. You voting for Biden gives me hope because when I was taking to a vet the other day he said no combat vet would ever vote for Biden. I thought that was interesting he said that.
1320341477310910465 2020-10-25 20:28:33 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @evanasmith @PhilipRucker @dallasnews @UTTyler @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Stop, Trump will win Texas. It’s unfortunate though.
1320340808541691904 2020-10-25 20:25:54 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @foxMsn @UnionLeader If you haven’t known Trump was a crook this whole time, then really your judgement can’t be trusted anyway.
1320334488400850949 2020-10-25 20:00:47 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Cathyshomes @kellythiebaud I agree. Catherine O’Hara has always been one of my favorite funny people to watch. The actors are really good in this series.

1320132960289386496 2020-10-25 06:39:59 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @IngrahamAngle And Biden doesn’t act like Trump. He has insulted and demeaned so many people.
1320111858083262465 2020-10-25 05:16:08 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @sasysis @jbm32753 This why they like him.

1320105478932738049 2020-10-25 04:50:47 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @nancyjoneill @natemax @DeLowDown I think the American flags are shy supporters of Trump. Although, two of my neighbors are NOT Trump supporters and they have flags.
1320104946985922560 2020-10-25 04:48:40 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DeLowDown You need to stay away from these people. It is not worth your life.

1320064729084096517 2020-10-25 02:08:51 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom Always whining and playing the victim. His followers feel the family is picked on.

1320000150731771905 2020-10-24 21:52:15 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Deadpool650 @JoeBiden Trump might win. If he does just live your life in the best possible way you can.

The bar is set so low!  Trump is still the same POS that you supported 4 years ago. He has no grasp on reality for the average pers.

So you have been in a hotel room having a drink with, who you thought was, an underaged reporter letting her take your mic out of your pants and then you lay down on a bed to tuck your pants in?? OMG people!!

1319075273476767744 2020-10-22 08:37:07 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Stop using our taxes to hold your rallies.
1319073623475277824 2020-10-22 08:30:33 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom @FBI Where do you see that?

1319050615058690048 2020-10-22 06:59:08 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @donwinslow @BarackObama Don, you need to get The Apprentice tapes.

1319049648703635456 2020-10-22 06:55:17 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @FoxNews It’s true. Nothing to prove Hunter did anything. On the other hand, there is a video of Rudy. SMFH!! Also, there is a video of Trump!! Doesn’t matter if they profited off of name. Trump has done so much worse.
1319046927871213568 2020-10-22 06:44:28 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump More lies!
1319045630812016640 2020-10-22 06:39:19 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> 😂
1319045181493030912 2020-10-22 06:37:32 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RudyGiuliani Why would you even do that?  🤷‍♀️
1319015252927729665 2020-10-22 04:38:37 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @FoxNews It’s true. Nothing to prove Hunter did anything. On the other hand, there is a video of Rudy. SMFH!! Also, there is a video of Trump!!
1319007498620207105 2020-10-22 04:07:48 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @EvanMcMullin But Rudy is ok!!
1319007210471518209 2020-10-22 04:06:39 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @mschlapp This is such a lie!
1319006937288040448 2020-10-22 04:05:34 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @CaslerNoel Yep
1319006138663272448 2020-10-22 04:02:24 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @PlayaSharon @TrueFactsStated Did he try has hand at acting?
1318988428134895617 2020-10-22 02:52:01 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @TrueFactsStated @PlayaSharon What is this from?
1318987879033434112 2020-10-22 02:49:50 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @ProudSocialist Damn, that is too bad, you should hear the Trump supporters.
1318986662270042112 2020-10-22 02:45:00 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @NikkiHaley @standamericanow This is a lie. Trump is all about himself and is an immoral man who constantly whines. Just stop defending him.
1318980074012434433 2020-10-22 02:18:49 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @CheriJacobus Wtf!
1318971173703577600 2020-10-22 01:43:27 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MichaelVonIrvin @dbongino Lol! Just an average American tired of Trump always whining and playing the victim. Can’t stand people like that. It is so unbecoming of a president, however when you have been given everything your whole life and don’t know any other way then you can’t expect anything more.
1318967181258805248 2020-10-22 01:27:35 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MichaelVonIrvin @dbongino Doesn’t matter. He is a crook and  a cheat in every aspect of life. Trump is a sexual assaulter, draft dodger and all around skeeve. You do you though. Good luck and have a nice day!
1318966750898081792 2020-10-22 01:25:53 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @seanhannity You people act like Hunter is running for president. Mark my word, you will here nothing more about this after the election. Kind of like the wall, immigration, a health plan, etc.
1318966013057064960 2020-10-22 01:22:57 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MichaelVonIrvin @dbongino Listen he is in a position now and it is not appropriate. You know Trump is a cheat and a thief, however you don’t give a damn. Shame on you.
1318965654817443840 2020-10-22 01:21:31 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MichaelVonIrvin @dbongino You are funny. So Biden has paid millions, but you ask if he followed tax code. Trump pays nothing, but all good and he follows tax code. Just completely bizarre thinking. Have a nice day!
1318954690101481473 2020-10-22 00:37:57 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MichaelVonIrvin @dbongino He needs to stop his tax evasion and pay taxes in the United States. Trump is UnAmerican and such a whiner. Always playing the victim!!
1318954027397230593 2020-10-22 00:35:19 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @maxbrooksauthor @MelBrooks I bet he could walk down a ramp better than Trump!!
1318953698681180160 2020-10-22 00:34:01 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MichaelVonIrvin @dbongino Correct. He should not be doing personal business with China!!  Period!!

1318905263638802437 2020-10-21 21:21:33 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @PolitiFact The thing is, it doesn’t matter if you tell Trump supporters the truth, they won’t believe you.
1318904408248180736 2020-10-21 21:18:09 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DrJasonJohnson @Vaw511 Agree. Electoral college needs to be abolished.
1318903628917174272 2020-10-21 21:15:03 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @thehill Amy Coney Barrett and Angelina Jolie can adopt a few out of those 500. Add some Hispanic children to their bunches.
1318901847378120704 2020-10-21 21:07:59 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DavidCornDC @lula_reh @realDonaldTrump And the 60 minute video. And his plans and policies.
1318899835206918146 2020-10-21 20:59:59 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AudacityofGoats Out of our three, the youngest Mila (Dalmatian mix) sometimes wants to sometimes attack (or as you put it bicker) the oldest, Roxy (beagle/pit bull mix).  It is usually when Roxy is sniffing around the kitchen floor.

1318654438525997056 2020-10-21 04:44:52 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom I think it is a good idea that he wants different views.
1318645580780896258 2020-10-21 04:09:40 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @FoxNews He needs to mix his cabinet up. Different views which is a good thing!
1318617762176987136 2020-10-21 02:19:07 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RKCowgirl_Life Good for her! Smart lady!

1318611463129374720 2020-10-21 01:54:06 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @kurteichenwald I hope Biden does put some Republicans turned Independents in his cabinet.

1318605082888335361 2020-10-21 01:28:44 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @seanhannity Trump already f’ed NY AND CA up with taxes.
1318603124332924929 2020-10-21 01:20:57 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @LeeGainer @thefrayground @davenewworld_2 I had a combat tell me that all combat vets are for Trump. He was totally brainwashed. I couldn’t believe the stuff he was saying.
1318601979115970560 2020-10-21 01:16:24 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DemNevada Hunter Biden and China ad Emails.

1318597993923104768 2020-10-21 01:00:34 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @rodney_bee I agree. I think it is because of last election. If he does, he does. Just live your life and forget about politics.
1318595913581883392 2020-10-21 00:52:18 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @EricTrump So what!

1318571566276501504 2020-10-20 23:15:33 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @JohnCornyn Republicans just want to give the rich and corporations tax breaks and relief money anyway. I hope you get voted out.

1318543887267291136 2020-10-20 21:25:34 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom Oh but you should he his supporters defend him and then say they are Christians.
1318543665799729153 2020-10-20 21:24:41 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @robreiner Trump supporters do not think anything he has done is wrong. The way their brain thinks is so bizarre.

1318382680782721024 2020-10-20 10:45:00 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 Dude, Trump raped a 13 year old!! Get some help. Good night and again stay away from children.
1318382459747102721 2020-10-20 10:44:07 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 Dude, Trump raped a 13 year old!!
1318382338825277440 2020-10-20 10:43:38 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 You are too young to be this radicalized. You keep regurgitating all this propaganda and dismiss anything f that has to do with Trump or his family. You mind is too far gone. Also, why do you think I don’t exercise?
1318381708001988608 2020-10-20 10:41:08 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 Jr does cocaine and there is nothing wrong with that. Stop being so judgmental.
1318381204987498498 2020-10-20 10:39:08 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 @JoeBiden You first with the 20 something women who accused Trump.
1318380937630023680 2020-10-20 10:38:04 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 Many veterans have a different opinion than you have. You keep posting those GIF’s which mean nothing. Just regurgitating.
1318380470787215360 2020-10-20 10:36:13 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 Hunter is not running for president. Trump spawns stole from a charity and Jr was arrested in Louisiana for public intoxication. No mention of this from you.
1318380171938779141 2020-10-20 10:35:01 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 So why do you keep ignoring the 20 something accusers of Trump.? Ivana even said he raped her.
1318379185837010944 2020-10-20 10:31:06 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> This is a Trump supporter and why he supports Trump. I find it interesting. He claims to be Christian but has no problem with the way Trump acts and treats others he doesn’t know like crap.
1318378805531082752 2020-10-20 10:29:36 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 No dude no!
1318378650480246784 2020-10-20 10:28:59 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 Dude, I don’t watch cnn, Fox or msnbc. Again, you are making stuff up and believing it. There is the problem.
1318378435232690177 2020-10-20 10:28:07 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 Why do you think I don’t? Kind of curious??
1318376153757831169 2020-10-20 10:19:03 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 Again, tell me about the exercise thing.
1318375951420461057 2020-10-20 10:18:15 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 Dude, you are a victim of Trump’s system. Weak minded, but again you do you!!
1318375737045315584 2020-10-20 10:17:24 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 So everything you claim to be is everything Trump isn’t. Lol!
1318375463115399169 2020-10-20 10:16:19 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 When did I insult you?
1318374712158769154 2020-10-20 10:13:20 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 Not really funnier because they don’t make sense. Just proving you are not the Christian you claim to be. I have no problem with you trying g to sling insults. Just have them make sense and be relevant.
1318374398542278656 2020-10-20 10:12:05 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 Trump whines and plays the victim all the time. You claim to be a Christian, however you are not. It is evidenced by your responses.
1318371645480841216 2020-10-20 10:01:09 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @katieslush5 @Veracuda89 @AlphaWarrior21 @KESQ Or why do you think he has a problem staying married?
1318371243180003329 2020-10-20 09:59:33 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @katieslush5 @Veracuda89 @AlphaWarrior21 @KESQ Again, not about the remarrying. It’s about all the cheating!
1318370904745734144 2020-10-20 09:58:12 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 So you are a christian right?
1318370729763590145 2020-10-20 09:57:30 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 What does exercise have to do with anything?
1318370613971410944 2020-10-20 09:57:03 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 So Tara Reade is telling the truth and the 20 something women have all recanted?
1318369818303553536 2020-10-20 09:53:53 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 I’m sure that is what everyone is thinking.  Your desperate and it’s showing now. Come on try harder you pedophile. You don’t support victims of sexual assault and you support pedophillia. This is sad. I’ll pray for you.
1318368865710075904 2020-10-20 09:50:06 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 Screenshot this one too.
1318368616320966656 2020-10-20 09:49:06 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 So your just confirming to everyone that you are a pedo. You do you!!
1318367966203793408 2020-10-20 09:46:31 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 Lol!  You think telling someone to exercise is an insult?  You are ugly on the inside and out and nothing will help that. You are deranged and need some psychological help. Screenshot this!!
1318367346650574848 2020-10-20 09:44:04 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @CheriJacobus These Trump supporters are absolutely nuts!  I’m tired of being nice. They never are.
1318367135396065281 2020-10-20 09:43:13 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 No doesn’t make me nervous. I was trying to be nice. I still think your a pedo.
1318366069342392322 2020-10-20 09:38:59 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @CheriJacobus You know what Cheri. You have to treat these people like they treat you.
1318365519653740545 2020-10-20 09:36:48 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 Seriously, you are a total hypocrite supporting Trump. Also, stop hurting children. It’s not cool!

1318364137999642625 2020-10-20 09:31:19 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> Trump followers are wack!
1318363486313881600 2020-10-20 09:28:43 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 No they didn’t. Stay away from children dude!
1318361769019023361 2020-10-20 09:21:54 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 Trump sexually assaulted 20 something women and raped a 13 year old. This pedophile thing is something that you probably dream about because you’re projecting. Get some help dude and stop pretending to be a Christian.
1318360495124930560 2020-10-20 09:16:50 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @meenaharris @KamalaHarris At least she has rhythm.
1318359487288205314 2020-10-20 09:12:50 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AlphaWarrior21 dude, go ask Trump about his Christianity?  Maybe his cheating or abortions he has paid for. You hypocrite!!
1318359117849751552 2020-10-20 09:11:22 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Veracuda89 @katieslush5 @AlphaWarrior21 @KESQ This has been hilarious but you've crossed into the wasting my time category.  There’s no hope for you. Maybe those kids have a chance though. Get them some help before it is too late!! Maybe you should maybe your baby momma too.
1318356698759712769 2020-10-20 09:01:45 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @LauraDiBella15 Sad!
1318355173299814401 2020-10-20 08:55:41 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RepMattGaetz You’ve had four years and look where we are.

1318348975846559745 2020-10-20 08:31:04 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Veracuda89 @KESQ Back at you buddy! Thank you for being a prime example of why Biden has to and will win. And again, you support a serial sexual assaulter and adulterer. But, you do you!
1318347977430163456 2020-10-20 08:27:06 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @katieslush5 @AlphaWarrior21 @Veracuda89 @KESQ They are a cult and believe anything Trump says or any right wing crap that is put out there. They worship a man who has been married three times and has cheated on all his wives and have disdain for a man that has been married 47 years to the same woman. SMFH!!
1318346894934908929 2020-10-20 08:22:48 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Veracuda89 @KESQ It’s not personal. Just pointing out your idiocy. You have a lovely evening!
1318346245249794048 2020-10-20 08:20:13 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MichaelALeehan @FoxNews Immoral stances! Kind of like cheating on all three wives? Maybe raw dogging a porn star? Are these considered immoral stances?
1318344928477417472 2020-10-20 08:14:59 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Veracuda89 @KESQ And speaking of mimicking, I hope you don’t treat the woman in the photo like Trump has treated all three of his wives. Cheating on all of them, one of which is a porn star!!

1318319257449459712 2020-10-20 06:32:58 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Veracuda89 @KESQ Trump is a habitual lying, draft dodging, sexual assaulting POS who constantly whines and plays the victim.  I am going to be nice and give you the benefit of the doubt and say you are weak and have become a victim of his system and are not just dumb!

1317858539352698882 2020-10-19 00:02:15 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MichaelALeehan @FoxNews Somewhere that Trump doesn’t go unless it is a photo op!  Lol. You have a good day too. Oh and Regeneron that Trump used=stem cells.
1317857805383004160 2020-10-18 23:59:20 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MichaelALeehan @FoxNews So you think three marriages, cheating on all his wives (one with porn star) is ok though?  Biden has been a practicing Catholic his whole life but not good enough for you though. And you think Trump hasn’t paid for abortions?  Do you see how odd your thinking is?

Trump is a whiney ass bitch who is always playing the victim, assaults women, lies constantly, dodged the draft, thinks the military are suckers and losers, and sprays himself some shade of orange. He’s obnoxious!

1315725441710264320 2020-10-13 02:46:04 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom I agree. Term limits need to be set and they should not get full benefits afterwards.

1315321252991496193 2020-10-11 23:59:58 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden His supporters would say why is he an authoritarian and a threat?

The thinking is bizarre and unfortunate.

1315110574682824706 2020-10-11 10:02:49 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @seanhannity Good, people will understand how ridiculous you people are. #VoteBidenHarris2020
1315102703345831936 2020-10-11 09:31:32 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DonaldJTrumpJr You are one whiny ass bitch!
1315084144636948480 2020-10-11 08:17:47 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @kylegriffin1 Because he is. It takes 3 weeks or more to get a negative test.
1315083833499291649 2020-10-11 08:16:33 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @chuckwoolery Nobody said he will be a champion. He is just a decent person unlike Trump.
1315081596706328577 2020-10-11 08:07:40 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @redeyeshot @AndTheBandAides Yeah yeah he was!!
1315081095973486592 2020-10-11 08:05:40 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @JasonMillerinDC Where are Trump’s taxes and who does he owe money too?
1315068811393986560 2020-10-11 07:16:52 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DeLLBertoo @LunaApollo @ChonkyCat3 @Marythomason19 @chuckwoolery @knassios @realDonaldTrump He is a sociopathic narcissist. He doesn’t have it in him. It’s a disorder. 🤷‍♀️ Anyway, just poured myself a whiskey and Diet Coke and going to turn on Bruno Mars and dance. Then once the jacuzzi is warmed up going to sit and relax my muscles. Again, enjoy your night.
1315067673298919426 2020-10-11 07:12:20 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DeLLBertoo @LunaApollo @ChonkyCat3 @Marythomason19 @chuckwoolery @knassios @realDonaldTrump You’re right. Also, don’t want to admit they were wrong.
1315066312234659840 2020-10-11 07:06:56 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @IleosTony @ksorbs Trump has fare worse like sexually assaulting women and dodging the draft. You are all stupid MF’s.
1315066088598642689 2020-10-11 07:06:02 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @southerndawgs89 @127bama @ksorbs Or using Regeneron with stem cells from aborted babies.
1315065824571396097 2020-10-11 07:04:59 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @spirit9944 @ksorbs He lies multiple times everyday!! What the hell is wrong with you?
1315062550485037057 2020-10-11 06:51:59 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @LunaApollo @DeLLBertoo @ChonkyCat3 @Marythomason19 @chuckwoolery @knassios @realDonaldTrump It’s frustrating, I know. We can only try. I just want Trump out. Just a downright awful person. It is like listening to a whiny 12 year old bully always playing the victim.  Not sure why his supporters think this is manly. SMDH everyday.
1315061515062403073 2020-10-11 06:47:52 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @charliekirk11 Let him pack the court, although I doubt it. Trump packed the lowers courts so I see you have no problem with that.
1315061084730998785 2020-10-11 06:46:09 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DeLLBertoo @LunaApollo @ChonkyCat3 @Marythomason19 @chuckwoolery @knassios @realDonaldTrump No you didn’t make an ass out of them. Just think about saving our country with a vote for Biden. Have a good day!
1315053417761394688 2020-10-11 06:15:41 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DeLLBertoo @LunaApollo @ChonkyCat3 @Marythomason19 @chuckwoolery @knassios @realDonaldTrump I like Amy Klobuchar too. Now we have to stand behind Biden/Harris and get some normalcy back into this government.
1315053108750213120 2020-10-11 06:14:28 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DeLLBertoo @LunaApollo @ChonkyCat3 @Marythomason19 @chuckwoolery @knassios @realDonaldTrump I disagree. She is personable. She is tough when needed but also compassionate. Trump is like no one I have ever seen. He habitually lies, sexually assaults women, cheats, dodged draft and is a security risk.  Pence is like a robot. We need to come together to vote Biden.
1315043348885852161 2020-10-11 05:35:41 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DeLLBertoo @ChonkyCat3 @Marythomason19 @chuckwoolery @knassios @realDonaldTrump Interesting. That is too bad.

Nobody in their right mind would vote for him. He doesn’t even pay his damn taxes and owes money to someone. He is a threat to this country.
1314769282815856640 2020-10-10 11:26:38 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Shut up with your lies!  Sick of you and Trump. I will never vote for another Republican again.

1314237198670069761 2020-10-09 00:12:20 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @SenMikeLee Yeah right!
1314231733609324551 2020-10-08 23:50:37 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @kenolin1 @KamalaHarris @VP And still they are calling her names. Doesn’t matter. Comes with the territory.
1314221225841811456 2020-10-08 23:08:51 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Chayes1025 Nope. Ended up paying more.
1314220337857323009 2020-10-08 23:05:20 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @ChuckGrassley I actually thought Harris was more personable, however of course you would want to have dinner with a robotic white man who has pink eye, attracts flies, and wants to take a woman’s choice away.

1314202737639223298 2020-10-08 21:55:24 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @realDonaldTrump Just fly away!!
1314202626112720897 2020-10-08 21:54:57 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @realDonaldTrump You are all infected, delusional, POS’s who don’t give a crap about anyone. You make crap up in your head and believe it.
1314182963425239043 2020-10-08 20:36:49 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @LWCherokee @williamlegate Me too. No need for anymore debates. Republicans can’t follow rules. They are the elitists.
1314181089607380992 2020-10-08 20:29:22 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @marcorubio Pence is like a robot with no emotions and wants to take women’s right to choose away. Oh and Trump has the personality of a 12 year old bully. Both are just awful unrelatable men. My choice is #BidenHarris2020
1314179547248566273 2020-10-08 20:23:14 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Stacybrad71 @EricTrump Do Trump now.!! Then right after so Pence!
1314179075242508289 2020-10-08 20:21:22 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @amandacarpenter Trump and Pence are both abnormal in totally different ways. I am not sure how the average person can relate to either of them.
1314177519709351937 2020-10-08 20:15:11 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @TaraSetmayer @PeteButtigieg The think is he should have said who committed adultery.
1314176882519101440 2020-10-08 20:12:39 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Acosta Trump needs to keep his infected ass at home in Florida.
1314056019589251072 2020-10-08 12:12:23 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @donwinslow @JoeBiden Biden is behind. Go vote #BidenHarris2020

1314053998819700736 2020-10-08 12:04:21 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DLoesch Delusional thinking from all of you. I suppose you all feel if you say it enough it will be true.
1314047245575057409 2020-10-08 11:37:31 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RepMattGaetz @BarackObama @JoeBiden @HillaryClinton Go away and spend your free time with Nestor.

1314036886495621121 2020-10-08 10:56:22 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @kimguilfoyle You are full of shit!  If you were near Pence, the fly would have been attracted to you more than Pence.

1312922152211947520 2020-10-05 09:06:48 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump So ridiculous!  He is an awful selfish person.
1312919500291940352 2020-10-05 08:56:16 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Topobabe @Leaho99 @lldubs I do know taxes and Trump should have paid them like other millionaires and billionaires which he isn’t. He also has $450 million in debt which is owed soon. He is security risk.
1312919095805788160 2020-10-05 08:54:39 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @krunk84 Why do so many vets support Trump who dodged the draft and played down the virus?
1312918546813345794 2020-10-05 08:52:29 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @JasonMillerinDC Dude, this man is so weak and he is a draft dodging POS!

1312915146855968768 2020-10-05 08:38:58 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Topobabe @Leaho99 @lldubs Hey, we pay our taxes. He didn’t for 10 years and only $750 for two years. He is a habitually lying, sexual assaulter. Draft dodging skeeve who only thinks of himself.
1312911280630452225 2020-10-05 08:23:36 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Topobabe @Leaho99 @lldubs And it is selfish and irresponsible, however he is a narcissistic POS. What is sad is he pays $750 in taxes and using everyone else’s $ to pay for top notch medical care. SMFH!!

1312361723337216000 2020-10-03 19:59:52 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @SpeakerPelosi wait until November 4 to send out stimulus checks.

1312228474367606784 2020-10-03 11:10:22 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RodneyCaston I don’t think so.
1312211697717788672 2020-10-03 10:03:43 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @charliekirk11 You’re ridiculous. I have seen the opposite. What did he do to Hillary?
1312183082468876288 2020-10-03 08:10:00 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @thegoodgodabove @williamlegate Trump is a weak SOB!!
1312182063227756545 2020-10-03 08:05:57 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @IngrahamAngle Stop. If Biden was sick and in the hospital, Trump and the republicans would be even more rabid than they are now.

1312174569730400258 2020-10-03 07:36:11 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom What do Trump supporters think of this?  You know them best.

1312109340627628032 2020-10-03 03:16:59 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @choo_ek Not odd. Trump and his administration tell so many lies you really have to take it with a grain of salt.
1312066975875493888 2020-10-03 00:28:38 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @FoxNews Keep campaigning!!!

1312065558813130752 2020-10-03 00:23:00 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @JoeBiden This is how a president should act.
1312065266390499328 2020-10-03 00:21:51 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AJDelgado13 It does not make him look strong!! Such a ridiculous statement.

1311998304159322112 2020-10-02 19:55:46 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @benshapiro So let me get this right. You want people to be sympathetic towards Trump &amp; Melanie, however it doesn’t matter what Trump has said or done since Covid-19 has started?
1311915660520415232 2020-10-02 14:27:22 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MamaTriedHoney No
1311910121161650177 2020-10-02 14:05:21 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I think you are lying so you do t have to debate.

1311740689504321538 2020-10-02 02:52:05 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @EricTrump Dude, Biden pays his taxes and he donated money to different charities.
1311740291641032705 2020-10-02 02:50:31 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @davenewworld_2 Is this satire?
1311735891270930434 2020-10-02 02:33:02 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @realDonaldTrump You didn’t though.
1311673317015711745 2020-10-01 22:24:23 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom Then...Trump will not tweet for one day and then they’ll be like, I knew he could be more presidential!!
1311672916749107200 2020-10-01 22:22:47 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom They are so stupid.
1311648261380337665 2020-10-01 20:44:49 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @m10_castaneda Looks like Mick Jagger next to him.
1311644522909106179 2020-10-01 20:29:58 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @ProjectLincoln Polls are not reliable. Trump is ahead.
1311644132864004099 2020-10-01 20:28:25 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @JohnCornyn You never tell the whole story.
1311516446548140032 2020-10-01 12:01:02 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AJDelgado13 So everything awful that Trump has said for the past four years they never touch on, however they want to bring what Biden says during the debate which is true.
1311514352738955264 2020-10-01 11:52:43 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @harrisonjaime @LindseyGrahamSC @QuinnipiacPoll You should be way ahead.

1311492651129032704 2020-10-01 10:26:29 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @justinbaragona That was great!
1311484982452387840 2020-10-01 09:56:00 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @FoxNews Wow, I would think that you would be more worried about someone cheating on their taxes and stealing from Americans.
1311484251196465152 2020-10-01 09:53:06 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @therecount @mkraju So i#yes I will denounce it at this second in time. So stand back and stand by until further notice.
1311481191766192128 2020-10-01 09:40:56 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom I have not known a Trump follower who has changed their mind.
1311479795797032960 2020-10-01 09:35:24 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DonaldJTrumpJr Shut the fuck up now.

1311469683376177153 2020-10-01 08:55:13 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Lord_HelpUsNow No need. I think everyone has made their mind up.
1311462308283969536 2020-10-01 08:25:54 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @politvidchannel Nothing will bring down the Trump’s!
1311461821979664386 2020-10-01 08:23:58 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AudacityofGoats Auggie’s tail looks really long.
1311446959534661632 2020-10-01 07:24:55 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @SheriffReese @ChazzChaz Great job!
1311402371172327424 2020-10-01 04:27:44 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @GroverNorquist Lies!
1311382404125212672 2020-10-01 03:08:24 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @JohnJHarwood I can’t believe that Trump is ahead. There is something truly wrong with people.
1311381644561887232 2020-10-01 03:05:23 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @amandacarpenter We do not need anymore debates.
1311339470893924352 2020-10-01 00:17:48 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> This is so inspiring. Read the tweets from others.
1311337997372067840 2020-10-01 00:11:56 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @dcromp84 @MarteMartinez1 @criteria681 @JustinKollar @RobAnderson2018 @JoeBiden Wow again. Good for you. So far only three spoke out in this thread. Let me keep looking.
1311335762390966273 2020-10-01 00:03:03 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MarteMartinez1 @JustinKollar @RobAnderson2018 @JoeBiden Wow!  Good for you!  Rare.
1311335501467545600 2020-10-01 00:02:01 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @JustinKollar @JoeBiden Wow!  Good for you. You have a good head on your shoulders.
1311326922165506050 2020-09-30 23:27:56 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump You should both be in prison for tax evasion.
1311326573811752963 2020-09-30 23:26:33 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @NikkiHaley This is a complete lie!
1311312963102416899 2020-09-30 22:32:28 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @realDonaldTrump Shut up. Just shut up. You pay no taxes and literally don’t support or military or police.

1311283572804780033 2020-09-30 20:35:40 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @IngrahamAngle Trump is a combative bully and Biden is a grown up with compassion who sometimes gets fed up with Trump’s stupid ass behavior. Trump is an awful person.
1311163175803396097 2020-09-30 12:37:16 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AudacityofGoats Auggie is more obedient than a grown man.  Auggie is a good dog.

1311150774748024834 2020-09-30 11:47:59 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @kilmeade @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Hmm?
1311144402551668736 2020-09-30 11:22:40 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AudacityofGoats Pete is the cutest. He brings me happiness in this chaotic world.
1311143931980120064 2020-09-30 11:20:47 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @JoeBiden Trump is a disgusting person!!
1311143647883137026 2020-09-30 11:19:40 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AudacityofGoats I want Pete.
1311139260737568769 2020-09-30 11:02:14 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DevinNunes Good !
1311137623151267840 2020-09-30 10:55:43 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AndrewYang Of course you would feel like that because you support him.
1311124922152833024 2020-09-30 10:05:15 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @JoeBiden He is!!
1311079872102449154 2020-09-30 07:06:14 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RepMattGaetz How many times have you been arrested though??
1311070977267101697 2020-09-30 06:30:54 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @justbreathe1983 Im saying I don’t spend people’s taxes every weekend golfing. I do think a president needs some relaxation time, but not every weekend and not at his own hotels. There is a conflict of interest.
1311057478960836608 2020-09-30 05:37:15 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom Me too Joe! Me too!!!
1311054944355590144 2020-09-30 05:27:11 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @realDonaldTrump Every word that comes out of your mouth is a lie. So tired of this!!
1311050943987769344 2020-09-30 05:11:17 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Mike_Pence You’ve had almost 4 years to accomplish that and you failed. You walk around like a Stepford Wife and your king doesn’t pay any taxes and leaves the burden on working class families.
1311050386799648768 2020-09-30 05:09:05 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AudacityofGoats Pete gets two pillows. Lol!

1311044520415358977 2020-09-30 04:45:46 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @bamableu Yes

1311020054088048641 2020-09-30 03:08:33 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Jim_Jordan You allow boys to be molested. Trump sexually assaults women, dodged the draft, doesn’t pay taxes and is $400 million in debt that is owed to some unknown entity. As far as I see it, you are both UnAmerican and a risk to the security of this country.

Biden has accomplished more than Trump could ever imagine too. You have been conned, however would never admit it.
1311000276438888448 2020-09-30 01:49:57 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @charliekirk11 150 million for golf trips. Also, let’s see some proof he donates.
1310997905734471681 2020-09-30 01:40:32 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Vibr8_Hyer @Jackie_1ders @TheRISEofROD @MajorPatriot Trump has no plan. He’s had months if not years to answer and he hasn’t.
1310996869057638403 2020-09-30 01:36:25 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @mama_c2 The women who accused him of sexual assault. All of them. Stormy Daniels too.

1310934116917866496 2020-09-29 21:27:04 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @workinmamaw @WalshFreedom Trump lies everyday. If he wanted to prove everyone wrong he would have put out his taxes that day. Actually, he would have put them out four years ago.
1310933694824103936 2020-09-29 21:25:23 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom It’s just absolutely crazy shit happening right now.

1310708703239184388 2020-09-29 06:31:21 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AJDelgado13 I agree. Biden could sit and say nothing and I would vote for him over Trump, the crook!!

1310381422234935296 2020-09-28 08:50:51 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @gator_bates @KirstenPowers Awful!

1310379346977157120 2020-09-28 08:42:36 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom These are the tweets I get:  “I promise, when you FINALLY #WalkAwayFromDemocrats , I won't mock you for falling for their tricks, and that the vast majority of us on this side will welcome you with open arms. Have a good night. Just #WalkAway”

1310357328261128192 2020-09-28 07:15:06 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Bullbat13 @TrumpVet4 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump He’s been in NC, MI, OH. On place he hasn’t been is golfing almost every weekend for 4 years. He actually goes to church on Sundays too. Trump rarely steps foot in church except for photo op.
1310356306801221632 2020-09-28 07:11:03 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @noneya2168 @Bullbat13 @CraigMarker @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump I don’t do that. You do you though.
1310356137259139072 2020-09-28 07:10:23 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Bullbat13 @TrumpVet4 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Open your eyes and ears dumbass.

1310348498194161665 2020-09-28 06:40:01 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @TrumpVet4 @Bullbat13 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump No one has as many gaffes as Trump. Who are you kidding? You are deaf or just stupid. I am guessing the latter. You were conned and can’t admit you were wrong. Trump is a cheat and payed $750 in taxes at the most. Cheat, cheat, sexual assaulter, draft dodger!!!!
1310346679996919808 2020-09-28 06:32:48 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @TrumpVet4 @Bullbat13 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump said you were a loser.

1310342831261638657 2020-09-28 06:17:30 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Bullbat13 @TrumpVet4 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump You couldn’t shake up anyone. You think to highly of yourself.
1310342540713848832 2020-09-28 06:16:21 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Bullbat13 @whyaretheytake @TrumpVet4 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Then you are deaf because he says so much stupid shit it is unbelievable. Also, he’s a lying, cheating, sexual assaulting, POS who dodged the draft. All around UnAmerican!!
1310336309588709376 2020-09-28 05:51:35 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @ScottPresler @realDonaldTrump That was a joke and that is why he laughed afterwards.
1310336052465299456 2020-09-28 05:50:34 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @realDonaldTrump So your tweeting a joke?  He was laughing.
1310335649627529216 2020-09-28 05:48:58 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @marcus_w15 @RepsForBiden @realDonaldTrump We can see where Eric gets most of his looks from.
1310335432790401024 2020-09-28 05:48:06 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Bullbat13 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Listen Trump has twice as many gaffes as Biden, however you don’t say a thing about it!!
1310316424393449472 2020-09-28 04:32:34 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @marcorubio Why would you attack a religious man like Biden and support a skeeve like Trump?  You’re an asshole.
1310315525084381185 2020-09-28 04:29:00 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom He was castrated long ago.
1310315312483450880 2020-09-28 04:28:09 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MelDMann Depends on the spice I suppose.
1310315168048377857 2020-09-28 04:27:35 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @sushi_roll321 I guess you got your answer.
1310309976221523969 2020-09-28 04:06:57 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @glenlg2 @sharondigi @JoeBiden @mjhegar Glad you put an American flag. People think an American flag is for Trump followers only.
1310309708511674368 2020-09-28 04:05:53 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @sharondigi We have to see Trump flags all over the place so put out the Biden flags, signs, stickers. Put it all out!! Everyone has the right to put out whichever sign they want.
1310309154611818497 2020-09-28 04:03:41 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @sharondigi Wow!
1310304443481518080 2020-09-28 03:44:58 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AJDelgado13 B12 shots.
1310303886025007104 2020-09-28 03:42:45 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @YoRosesYo @AJDelgado13 The problem is the crap he says is so ludicrous. Should you engage?
1310302337416622081 2020-09-28 03:36:36 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Sc1F1R1ck @MajSchroeder @kurteichenwald Agree.
1310301869034545152 2020-09-28 03:34:44 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @casalesj @MajSchroeder @kurteichenwald Thanks George!  Love the positive words!!
1310267853090635787 2020-09-28 01:19:34 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @numbrcrunch @Leslieoo7 @NRSC The thing is everything about Trump is tacky. Always has been and always will be. He is a skeeve and you support all of it.
1310266842913464321 2020-09-28 01:15:33 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris We can’t vote for a Republican ever again.
1310266629167562753 2020-09-28 01:14:42 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Get out and vote for Biden/Harris!!
1310266392160030720 2020-09-28 01:13:46 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @harrisonjaime @LindseyGrahamSC I can’t believe it is only 2 points. Crazy!
1310264281997271040 2020-09-28 01:05:23 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @stevecraig56 so do you believe this Trump tweet or do you just like everyone of his tweets?
1310256120783540225 2020-09-28 00:32:57 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @TheRickWilson Sniffles McAdderall is what you called him one time I think. I think it is more appropriate.
1310255233633722368 2020-09-28 00:29:25 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @realDonaldTrump You’re sick in the head!
1310249177666912262 2020-09-28 00:05:21 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @mmpadellan @psepi Won’t happen!
1310248383072722944 2020-09-28 00:02:12 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @senafan1901 @CPofVirginia @amandacarpenter @jaketapper @CNNSotu California. However, if it weren’t for Los Angeles county, California would go red.
1310247254989529094 2020-09-27 23:57:43 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WinterwayEd Wow! Trump followers are skeeves just like him!! I hope Trump loses and loses badly so these followers can go back into the hole they came out of.
1310244293630590977 2020-09-27 23:45:57 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @kayleighmcenany @JoeBiden Wow! You are truly an awful POS human being.
1310237655397855232 2020-09-27 23:19:34 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @realDonaldTrump OMG! Does anyone think this childish crap is ok?  If you do, please explain.
1310236839194685445 2020-09-27 23:16:20 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @realDonaldTrump Your time is up.
1310236653068324869 2020-09-27 23:15:35 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @tedcruz Such a hypocrite and you don’t even give a damn about anyone, but your own party and in actuality not even them.
1310231126670102530 2020-09-27 22:53:38 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MatthewSchw @MajSchroeder @kurteichenwald Do you realize that you just made stuff up in that comment?  There is nowhere in my statement that said I couldn’t tolerate diff. views? I said it was strange, which it is. Anyway, what is it with people telling Americans to leave their own country?
1310215508533243904 2020-09-27 21:51:34 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @CPofVirginia @amandacarpenter @jaketapper @CNNSotu I know people who are voting for a third party candidate still. Can’t talk any sense into them.
1310215014926618631 2020-09-27 21:49:36 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AudacityofGoats Mine do that too. I feel like they are creepers sometimes. I will be in a room and I turn around and they are there staring. 😆
1310214016850034688 2020-09-27 21:45:38 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @ChonkyCat3 @proachaddix @kurteichenwald Totally agree. Term limits for Supreme Court also.
1310213693494366208 2020-09-27 21:44:21 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DadBodJP @maddentullis @Managlen @WalshFreedom Also, I can’t believe they would have plain clothed officers at a raid. They seem to have made many mistakes. Just awful.
1310192886541987851 2020-09-27 20:21:41 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @thehill I think she is correct.
1310189836498739200 2020-09-27 20:09:33 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DadBodJP @maddentullis @Managlen @WalshFreedom That they weren’t in uniform.
1310188703927525376 2020-09-27 20:05:03 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @proachaddix @kurteichenwald The thing is, Republicans say the same thing as you just said, but replace McConnell with Pelosi.
1310186710400004098 2020-09-27 19:57:08 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MajSchroeder @kurteichenwald Your positive thinking is wonderful, however there are too many conservatives in the US that only care about not spreading equality, taking women’s rights and guns. It is the strangest thing.
1310183740916654082 2020-09-27 19:45:20 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @maddentullis @DadBodJP @Managlen @WalshFreedom How do you know that?
1310049317688758274 2020-09-27 10:51:11 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @senatemajldr STFU!
1310049224034140161 2020-09-27 10:50:49 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @braintreebrat @politvidchannel @Deadpool650 I personally think that they will get Supreme Court justice and trump will win again. It is absolutely disgusting, however our system and half the people in this country are FU in the head.
1310047351197724672 2020-09-27 10:43:22 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom And he might win. This is so sad!
1310045402146643970 2020-09-27 10:35:37 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @SteveDaines @realDonaldTrump Nobody wants to take away your 2nd amendment right. If anyone thinks this, you are stupid.
1310044795708997634 2020-09-27 10:33:13 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AndreaJMata @bellengj @tedcruz Should have used some of that snark towards Trump when he called his wife ugly!  What do you think??
1310043462373236736 2020-09-27 10:27:55 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AndreaJMata @tedcruz He’s weak. It is too bad he at least couldn’t come back with some snark to protect his wife.
1310032469182222338 2020-09-27 09:44:14 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @LindseyGrahamSC @JudgeJeanine Don’t start whining/begging again.
1310013995529547777 2020-09-27 08:30:50 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MeghanMcCain Nothing wrong with adoption. Stop making everything about you.
1310010860262236161 2020-09-27 08:18:22 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @cptnrawrpnts It is grossing me out. Sorry.
1310005806906048512 2020-09-27 07:58:17 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DaxGigandet The truth!
1310004457258672128 2020-09-27 07:52:55 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @germa_shepherd Nope
1310004308516069379 2020-09-27 07:52:20 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @donwinslow Or early voting.
1310003055979458561 2020-09-27 07:47:21 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @meiselasb Where are they then?
1310002423486844928 2020-09-27 07:44:51 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I hope you lose badly. Donate to @harrisonjaime
1309996977380233216 2020-09-27 07:23:12 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @USPoliticsPoll People, Trump is a skeeve!!
1309989617874083840 2020-09-27 06:53:57 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @GavinNewsom Republicans don’t give a shit about anyone but themselves.
1309987087626588161 2020-09-27 06:43:54 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Deadpool650 @lauriebidaho @politvidchannel None of these Republicans are trustworthy. I will never vote for another again. Dems have to take back the senate, the presidency and keep the house.
1309984360116834304 2020-09-27 06:33:04 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @christineyhsd How do you know that?
1309983884856102912 2020-09-27 06:31:11 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Deadpool650 @politvidchannel All of this is so sad though. I hope there are more good people in the United States than Trump followers.
1309983482421022721 2020-09-27 06:29:35 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> So much turmoil in the United States right now. It is so depressing!
1309982921361518592 2020-09-27 06:27:21 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @politvidchannel @Deadpool650 Doesn’t matter. They have enough votes.
1309979373563305984 2020-09-27 06:13:15 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @marcorubio Why would you attack a religious man like Biden and support a skeeve like Trump?  You’re an asshole.
1309978397859168256 2020-09-27 06:09:22 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Cadillac Love the car, however need someone to help with a down payment.
1309977796244992000 2020-09-27 06:06:59 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @gtconway3d @DevinCow How about pre existing conditions and ACA?
1309974709644095488 2020-09-27 05:54:43 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @amandacarpenter The thing is everyone associated with Trump lies. Just my opinion.
1309974389941702663 2020-09-27 05:53:27 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @GavinNewsom Trump supporters go against their best interests.
1309958683913121792 2020-09-27 04:51:02 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @seanhannity That’s a good thing, isn’t it?
1309949185731391488 2020-09-27 04:13:18 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump He is going to nominate Merick Garland.
1309948978566324225 2020-09-27 04:12:28 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @jacksinboston No. Just excerpts.
1309939894739853312 2020-09-27 03:36:23 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DonaldJTrumpJr Deflecting again cokehead??
1309933988350369793 2020-09-27 03:12:54 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AudacityofGoats He is so fun!
1309928290107367425 2020-09-27 02:50:16 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MolonLabe51 @LylajoyRose @Geezy_ACG @WalshFreedom They would not be plain clothes going in for raid. They would be in full body armor and cams.
1309922623409676288 2020-09-27 02:27:45 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @robfwtx @Justin_scoobs @politvidchannel Me either. Ever again.
1309920603348983808 2020-09-27 02:19:43 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MysterySolvent Her hair is pretty. Just needs to be cut shorter as she is older. Of course just my opinion.
1309920032739131392 2020-09-27 02:17:27 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Chica_LeoLatina Absolutely yes!

1309919348316758016 2020-09-27 02:14:44 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @politvidchannel Thank god for that!  Pence walks around like a Stepford Wife or maybe a zombie. Just weird!!
1309845456185225218 2020-09-26 21:21:07 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom Not real sure about that, but it doesn’t matter. Biden could sit on a log and say nothing and he would be better than Trump.
1309844548961493001 2020-09-26 21:17:30 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MilesTaylorUSA People have already started voting.
1309844234791350274 2020-09-26 21:16:15 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @JoeNBC @OttDpo They are hypocrites. All of the Republicans.
1309843498258972672 2020-09-26 21:13:20 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @sweet_t46 @DadBodJP @LylajoyRose @Geezy_ACG @WalshFreedom Exactly! Until they are coming for them.
1309843364959760384 2020-09-26 21:12:48 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @LylajoyRose @Geezy_ACG @WalshFreedom The police made a mistake. No body cam footage does matter. Why was it not on?
1309835579299831808 2020-09-26 20:41:52 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @LylajoyRose @Geezy_ACG @WalshFreedom Why did the police not have body cams on?  Reason??
1309835430108434433 2020-09-26 20:41:16 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DadBodJP @PGH414 @WalshFreedom Also, why were their (police) body cams not on?
1309834965194960897 2020-09-26 20:39:25 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @kennysm91297483 @DadBodJP @kann_2121 @WalshFreedom Who knows? There is no body cam footage to review.
1309834299298865152 2020-09-26 20:36:47 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DadBodJP @Managlen @WalshFreedom It was all turned off wasn’t it?
1309834074559639552 2020-09-26 20:35:53 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom They sure did.

1309583651135393792 2020-09-26 04:00:47 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @politvidchannel Absolutely needs to be done for every justice.
1309582954696376320 2020-09-26 03:58:01 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @GrayTalksShop Please!!! Have you seen the Trump family??
1309582407536799744 2020-09-26 03:55:51 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @mmpadellan I think Trump will win!  Everyone be prepared.
1309581744413143040 2020-09-26 03:53:13 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @politvidchannel Good.
1309570992998555648 2020-09-26 03:10:30 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @onetrufan @caligrown310 @RubinReport You take the award for stupidest tweet of the day.  You don’t have to fly a flag to be patriotic. Also, many Democrats fly flags proudly. Trump is the most UnAmerican MF out there. Dodged the draft and thinks military are losers and suckers. Seems you are pretty ignorant. Sad!!
1309554308212375552 2020-09-26 02:04:12 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> This!

1309546812773031936 2020-09-26 01:34:25 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @EST2PST @onetrufan @caligrown310 @RubinReport Trump is a sexual assaulter too. Trump is UnAmerican and flying an American flag is the opposite of what he stands for.

1309523005484093440 2020-09-25 23:59:48 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @oompa4sc @RubinReport Yep the Biden/Harris signs get destroyed. Awful Trump supporters. They key cars too.
1309522819319869440 2020-09-25 23:59:04 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RubinReport What is sad is you equate an American flag with Trump supporter. In actuality, I fly an American flag and my neighbors do too, and we are Biden/Harris supporters. I am scared to put a Biden/Harris sign because Trump supporters will fuck my property up, like they did my mom’s car.

1309511290403004417 2020-09-25 23:13:15 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @USPoliticsPoll I’m proud to be an American although Trump is the most UnAmerican person I have ever seen. #draftdodger
1309510856313417728 2020-09-25 23:11:32 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump $200 isn’t going to do crap.
1309498112688308225 2020-09-25 22:20:54 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @essenviews What is appalling and disrespectful is the way Trump acts.
1309497826452275201 2020-09-25 22:19:45 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @thehill @IvankaTrump She sounds so fake. Oh because she is fake! They know nothing about the average American worker. I can’t believe Trump supporters think they would. SMFH!
1309497311140016131 2020-09-25 22:17:42 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @USPoliticsPoll Lol! I chose a BS answer for a BS poll.
1309496940753596416 2020-09-25 22:16:14 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @ProjectLincoln No way!  Texas is red. That will never change.
1309494247955939329 2020-09-25 22:05:32 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @JohnJHarwood @guyknoller1 Polls mean nothing. Fox News is an entertainment  channel. They are putting this out there to rile Trump’s voters up.
1309491353655541760 2020-09-25 21:54:02 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @kylegriffin1 Simple...Because he thought it would hurt him to tell the truth. It’s all about him.
1309489749275504641 2020-09-25 21:47:40 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom Actually, Trump will win. Although, I would like him to lose badly as I think it will be interesting to watch.
1309489185070313473 2020-09-25 21:45:25 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom Actually, Trump will win.
1309487989274243073 2020-09-25 21:40:40 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @ashleymoirDC Not true. Trump is ahead. Get out and VOTE FOR BIDEN/HARRIS!!
1309487502378627072 2020-09-25 21:38:44 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @jeffmason1 Probably because he has hearing problems. It happens when you get old.

1309473459081101312 2020-09-25 20:42:56 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @ProjectLincoln Not sure why his people put him out there with a mask that is too small.

1308268376909778945 2020-09-22 12:54:22 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @goldengateblond I thin we need to stay away from social media sites and the news.
1308266669920251905 2020-09-22 12:47:35 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @tedcruz @AOC @realDonaldTrump Impeach the motherfucker. Then impeach Barr too.

1308264969163563010 2020-09-22 12:40:49 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom And Trump will probably win because people are made to think their guns and rights will be taken away. SMFH!

1308132660875673600 2020-09-22 03:55:04 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RatchedNetflix Really like Sarah Paulson. The series was pretty good. Got better towards the end.
1308130465262395394 2020-09-22 03:46:21 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @mattklewis Unfollowing you. There is no whataboutism allowed here.

1307813224759214081 2020-09-21 06:45:45 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AstroInMotion @jedigoodman Trump teaches violence too. So start there. He is president. Listen to his rallies. You Trump supporters are something else.
1307812838417727489 2020-09-21 06:44:13 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AstroInMotion @jedigoodman Always trying to justify after the fact.
1307795660305915904 2020-09-21 05:35:57 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Davidopenheart @RedHairnBlkLthr @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump Trump has golfed way more than Obama ever did even after he said he wouldn’t because he would be to busy. And all during this pandemic where almost 200,000 have died. Why do you just dismiss what Trump does wrong and all his lies?
1307794929779793921 2020-09-21 05:33:03 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @sherylbeck @RealCandaceO Good choice because he is the only one who has he to church his whole life.

1307792553454968832 2020-09-21 05:23:37 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RealCandaceO And who seriously thinks Trump is a real Christian?  He doesn’t even step a foot in church without it being a publicity stunt.
1307791967451971584 2020-09-21 05:21:17 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RonJambo7 @DottieW08485010 @redwinecharms @RealCandaceO Seriously, this question should be asked of almost all Trump supporters who say they are Christians.

1307786600382754816 2020-09-21 04:59:57 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @jedigoodman So sports can be political when they support Trump?

You are a prime example of that., however Trump  is on a different level. I mean he is in the high thousands in 3 1/2 years. You are just blind and will never admit he is sick in the head. Good luck and take care.

You may want to point that finger at yourself.  Also, you support a man child who habitually lies, sexually assaults women and dodged the draft.

Plus he is just an indecent, vile man child who acts like a 12 year old bully. Sexually assaults women and is attracted to his daughter in ways he shouldn’t be. But you do you.

1306800452760080384 2020-09-18 11:41:21 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> I want to see a photo of everyone who doesn’t have a photo of themselves in their profile.
1306797001929928704 2020-09-18 11:27:39 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WindsorMann I’m so tired of Trump, his kids, his administration, and his followers/enablers. I will not vote for another Republican for a long time.
1306753573242322944 2020-09-18 08:35:04 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @JoeBiden Everyone should pay the same percentage. Exception the poor. Which someone will have to figure out what poor means. I am drinking whiskey right now.
1306608721192255493 2020-09-17 22:59:29 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RickFox @kanyewest @Twitter Are you for real here? Actually, you should be helping the man, not inciting his awful behavior.
1306601153950396417 2020-09-17 22:29:25 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom @EricHolder Good for you. Glad you are finally seeing the corruption of the GOP.
1306571510459412482 2020-09-17 20:31:37 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Lou02703 @Lovelistening1 @kylegriffin1 Are you 12? Typical don't like being called out for your obvious bias. Has nothing to do with policy, only that you think Biden bad.
1306495463722348544 2020-09-17 15:29:26 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AndrewUSA1776 @waltherppkfan90 @USPoliticsPoll Correct, 30% of the people in California are selfish, ignorant and we’re conned.
1306494260204584965 2020-09-17 15:24:39 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @transgendall @USPoliticsPoll No they didn’t misread.
1306492263837491201 2020-09-17 15:16:43 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Lou02703 @Lovelistening1 @kylegriffin1 Extreme TDS, you really should seek help! You are a joke, you obviously support a puppet with either dementia or early Alzheimer's all because he isn't Biden. That is a disgrace. Trump is so lost he can't even answer scripted questions with an earpiece and teleprompter, SMFH!
1306433930833264642 2020-09-17 11:24:56 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @JamesKosur @ceciliaannh @JoeBiden The thing is most Trump followers don’t give a damn about anyone else.
1306433234876555269 2020-09-17 11:22:10 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Lou02703 @Lovelistening1 @kylegriffin1 Trump is a habitual lying, sexually assaulting, draft dodging, POS that spray tans himself orange, man child who is attracted to his daughter. He can’t even speak in complete sentences. Good fucking lord, please stop trying to justify his awful decisions.

1306428123773153280 2020-09-17 11:01:51 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RickFox @kanyewest @Twitter Are you for real here?
1306427653117759488 2020-09-17 10:59:59 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RepDonBeyer I am seriously so saddened by this. I also don’t like seeing all the negative comments about California. Our fed tax $ are so important to many of those red states.

1306071207653945344 2020-09-16 11:23:36 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @archerrobb @AttorneyCrump @jodieegrace I agree somewhat, however the officer should have given the ticket and left. I would be worried for my son and he isn’t even black. So I’m sure she was terrified.

1306051177037967361 2020-09-16 10:04:00 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom They’re so fucking stupid. Did you know they were all this stupid before though?

1305924446276915201 2020-09-16 01:40:25 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom His supporters feel differently. Especially, the police. I think some military are coming around though.

1305899526679478272 2020-09-16 00:01:24 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @ProjectLincoln Electoral College and they cheat.

They care. It is Trump who is the habitually lying, sexual assaulter, draft dodging POS and you support this. I don’t get how your mind works.
1305876019992166401 2020-09-15 22:27:59 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @RudyGiuliani She hasn’t been silent. If you think this is true, I want to know.

1305266827010797568 2020-09-14 06:07:16 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AJDelgado13 @MikeBloomberg Florida leans too far right. Trump will win.

1305252637076459526 2020-09-14 05:10:53 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @ChidiNwatu @realDonaldTrump He should call Biden and ask him.

1305246711296569344 2020-09-14 04:47:20 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @OmgBeckyTree @The_Rockin_Prof @DeanBrowningPA Mine too. My husband is also a veteran and he was disgusted from the very beginning of his draft dodging, sexually assaulting self.
1305246272060702720 2020-09-14 04:45:36 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DeanBrowningPA @NWMouzer You really have to do this whataboutism crap. Make believe shit. OMG!

1305245249413902336 2020-09-14 04:41:32 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DeanBrowningPA Also, I wish the best for the officers and think it is wrong and I am voting for Biden. Biden doesn’t incite violence like Trump and he has condemned the violence.
1305244863718240257 2020-09-14 04:40:00 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @DeanBrowningPA That’s like saying the white supremacist that ran over people and killed them are all voting for Trump. Biden is a better person than Trump will ever be.

I think Trump supporters are nuts!  I don’t get the cultish behavior and never will. I think because if the electoral college we might be stuck with him for another four years though.

When he could of launched a prevention strategy. Can you see how sick in the head this man child is?  He literally has the mentality of a 12 year old bully. It is so bizarre.

Again, the first seven months of 2020, the Trump admin conducted more air strikes in Somalia than were carried out during any admin. He thinks the military are losers and suckers. He dodged the draft when my husband went. You blindly follow.

Does he listen to Trump? Does he care that he lies, sexually assaults women, was a draft dodger?  I don’t get it. I am an independent and have never thought he was a good person.
1304482324361273349 2020-09-12 02:09:56 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom It was a very interesting read.

1304480346063269888 2020-09-12 02:02:05 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @AmySpoonemore @HCTrudo @cam_joseph Wow!  I am not sure I could live like that. I suppose not taking about it would be hard.
1304478405677608960 2020-09-12 01:54:22 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @HCTrudo @gooner4evr Your article gives me hope, however unfortunately I still feel Trump will win again. I am so sad I feel this way.
1304477874909396993 2020-09-12 01:52:16 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @phanson1253 @kuchemJ @HCTrudo I’m in California and feel the same way, but there are a few Trump flags in my neighborhood and nobody does anything to them.

1304217580664569856 2020-09-11 08:37:57 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @EWErickson So there lies the problem. He is such a habitual liar that he can’t be trusted!
1304216654835052547 2020-09-11 08:34:16 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @realDonaldTrump Hey dumbass, you had the responsibility not him. YOU!!

1304200115792478211 2020-09-11 07:28:33 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @LouGarza86 It doesn’t seem possible because of the electoral college system.

WTF am I asking for? I know the answer. She already knew he was a lying draft dodger and still supported him!  SMFH!!
1303970792477085696 2020-09-10 16:17:18 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @realDonaldTrump Speak up followers. Do you deny Trump lies? Why do you still support him?  Please answer.
1303970335268585475 2020-09-10 16:15:29 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Kokomothegreat Play the recording on Fox News. Fox News watchers need to see them. How can they see them?
1303965409045962753 2020-09-10 15:55:54 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @CortRepairman @seanhannity Trump is a lying draft dodger who is responsible for making Covid-19 worse because of his lies.
1303893879326818304 2020-09-10 11:11:40 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump Shut up. You are all so full shit.

1303836020689911808 2020-09-10 07:21:46 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @TomCottonAR Really? Such a ridiculous tweet right now. It’s actually time for Trump to go. He lied to the American people about Covid-19 and killed people.
1303834598527303681 2020-09-10 07:16:07 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom He is a total idiot.

1303773074643251200 2020-09-10 03:11:38 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @kurteichenwald He was conning his supporters. That’s what he does.
1303757736409096193 2020-09-10 02:10:41 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom I am not sure I agree with this. His supporters will never betray their king.

1302577723794010113 2020-09-06 20:01:44 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @Norma22894111 @ellie_bufkin @JarrettStepman He left it up to his parents. Typical Republican never taking responsibility. Always playing the victim.
1302577078462799874 2020-09-06 19:59:10 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @JarrettStepman @ellie_bufkin Be responsible dude and do it yourself. Parents can’t do it for you.
1302576837105577987 2020-09-06 19:58:13 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @connormw @sassy_sarah01 @ellie_bufkin @JarrettStepman Thank you for saying this. Remember though, he is a Republican and they usually take no responsibility. They just want to play the victim.
1302576446611755009 2020-09-06 19:56:40 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @ellie_bufkin @JarrettStepman He needs to take some responsibility and call them to take care of this. He hasn’t done anything for 10 years?  Let’s his parents do it for him?
1302576021829423106 2020-09-06 19:54:58 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @JarrettStepman Take some responsibility and call them yourself. Have you been voting twice in the last 10 years? Why are you bring this up now?
1302575402812989440 2020-09-06 19:52:31 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @margiefeck @Tmbrdly1964Tom @Karoli @donmoyn @JarrettStepman He is a Republican. He takes no responsibility. Always playing the victim!!
1302575104220491779 2020-09-06 19:51:20 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @tamgin124 @twidark1 @JarrettStepman If they would have read it then maybe they would be clear about that. Or even better, maybe they should have done the ethical thing and called and said he didn’t live in California. So, has he been getting ballots for the last 10 years and only saying something now??
1302574331583578112 2020-09-06 19:48:15 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @JarrettStepman Why didn’t you let them know you moved?  Because you are a cheating Republican. You have a responsibility as an ethical citizen.
1302573739834368002 2020-09-06 19:45:54 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @GavinNewsom Make sure this man is off the voter rolls in California. We don’t need his cheating ass on them.

1302562160292196352 2020-09-06 18:59:54 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @charliekirk11 I think many Biden/Harris supporters don’t feel the need to put a sign up. They are the silent majority. Trump supporters are cultists.
1302558694207442952 2020-09-06 18:46:07 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @BarryFi58791936 My observation is the same.

Trump on the other hand lies, has sex in common with his daughter, cheats on wives and in business, is incompetent, a draft dodger and all around awful person.

1301729736339513344 2020-09-04 11:52:08 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @bdomenech @JeffreyGoldberg Trump is a lying POS!
1301727094380978176 2020-09-04 11:41:38 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @MeghanMcCain The thing is his supporters don’t care what he said about your dad. Also, you have defended Trump so many times in the last two years so just stop. You helped this monster.

1301347078510006273 2020-09-03 10:31:36 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @WalshFreedom Trump seriously has the mentality of a grade school bully. I don’t want to hear from him.

This is something I do t support. He also said he had sex in common with his daughter which is so bizarre. What kind of man would say that?

1301333211058905088 2020-09-03 09:36:29 +0800 <RoxyinLQ> @toddmargo @EchoSierrah @RexChapman I would give up my $40 a month for a decent President. I told him the riots are a symptom of Trump. People are tired of Trump and they are tired of racial injustice. He wasn’t hearing it. I have not met anyone who has changed their support of him except on Twitter.
