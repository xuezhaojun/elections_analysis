Not sure what relevance duplicating DNA has to do with anything? Once you've lost your private data including genetic profile its gone and available for digital use
1333425429374496768 2020-11-30 22:59:30 +0800 <CarlBrasky> @shamus1956 @BrexitBassist Until the lose your data to criminals, sell it to insurance and marketing companies who use it to profile/make money or discriminate against your genetic makeup

1330197622657789961 2020-11-22 01:13:21 +0800 <CarlBrasky> @Researchlight More likely that they will use a big databases or digital ID card that tracks people who haven't had the vaccine to restrict their movements and freedom until they have it
1326840219065323521 2020-11-12 18:52:14 +0800 <CarlBrasky> It's great that @sandwellcouncil  will be educating people as to why they should have a phobia of islam, although recent beheadings of non islamists will likely have influenced sane people already

This principle is also carried and forced into the workplace with unhelpful quotaâ€™s being demanded under the guise of diversity
1315411255709102080 2020-10-12 05:57:37 +0800 <CarlBrasky> @Saltydre23 When a woman says that she is going to leave, shes normally had a plan that she's been thinking of for some time rather than being impulsive. The test is if she is willing to try to work it out?  If yes then you got a shot, if no then likely that shes sadly moved on. Good luck.
1315345114085101571 2020-10-12 01:34:47 +0800 <CarlBrasky> @Essex_Fella_74 Agreed but I dont understand why the government is so supportive of this 3rd world belief, practises and turning a blind eye!  Brigitte Gabriel has some interesting experiences and good insight too, well work a look at some of her numerous youtube debates if you get a chance
1315275472423604225 2020-10-11 20:58:03 +0800 <CarlBrasky> @Robbryan8 I assume you intended to direct your message to the cleric and not myself for pointing the obvious correlation between these heinous offences occurring more often in the UK and their acceptance to commit them as part of their beliefs
