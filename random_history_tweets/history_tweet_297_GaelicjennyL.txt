1344053678592962562 2020-12-30 06:52:22 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DrLeanaWen This makes me feel physically ill. I've scarcely been able to see another human since last March. Last night, a despondent friend said she just wanted to expose herself to covid and "get it over with". I know dozens of people whose lives are simply on hold. The solution exists!
1344050362039332870 2020-12-30 06:39:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> And the Trump administration has failed once again. Their priority should be getting people vaccinated ASAP. Yet vaccine sits on shelves and local infrastructure isn't in place to get the job done.
1343975517284917248 2020-12-30 01:41:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @BillKristol Disband this mess.
1343975069689765888 2020-12-30 01:40:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JRubinBlogger It was a tactic. Nothing else. They were against the $600.
1343974669754494981 2020-12-30 01:38:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kylegriffin1 Support? Not hardly. McConnell is let them appear to be good guys in order to win the election in GA.  Meanwhile, the GOP in the Senate  shot the bill down. It is a tactic only.

1343538525405384722 2020-12-28 20:45:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @grandmagrit Counter protesters and the curious must stay away. They will fight among themselves. Let the beast consume its own tail.
1343536126796197890 2020-12-28 20:35:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @BrendanBuck Nonsense. Trump saw political advantage or other personal gain. Perhaps he thinks this makes him appear like a good guy to the masses while he fantasizes that he will declare Martial Law on Jan 6. Whatever his reasoning, you can bet it's twisted.
1343384829140885505 2020-12-28 10:34:36 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chipfranklin It is true that everyone, especially counter protesters, should stay away from DC on Jan. 6. It is the wisest course of action. They will only be able to fight among themselves. Stay.Away.
1342959051731300357 2020-12-27 06:22:43 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JuddLegum The problem is, that's what McConnell is going to do anyway.
1342954224045449216 2020-12-27 06:03:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SenJeffMerkley @darionavarro111 @JoeBiden Lots of luck, Senator. One word: McConnell. We have to find a way to go over, under or around him to get anything done. There's too much to be done to insure this mess can't happen again and he must be dealt with.
1342807342597996545 2020-12-26 20:19:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CBSNews We need to get vaccine into arms. Now. Trump's grandstand play on the stimulus bill is delaying money to the states to get people vaccinated.

1341870972949962752 2020-12-24 06:19:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @politico I just hope Trump doesn't try to steal everything that isn't nailed down. Is the White House curator counting the silver?
1341865714853031938 2020-12-24 05:58:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chatty_cath My sister went to a small family memorial service. Of the 8 people there, 6 were infected.
1341737318026240001 2020-12-23 21:27:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The government agreed to buy more Pfizer vaccine. The article says that means everyone can get vaccinated within 6 months. I personally will feel safer when the Biden administration is handling distribution.   https://t.co/THx9lkrFKs

1341732380181229571 2020-12-23 21:08:22 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CNNPolitics As much as I would like to see a far better stimulus bill, I'm already tired of hearing that Trump is "right" about the $2000. He deserves no credit. He is using it to score political points and could give a rat's ass about the people who need the money.
1341730494472450048 2020-12-23 21:00:52 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek Ridiculous. This is holding people hostage until Trump gets what he wants.

1341551623831760898 2020-12-23 09:10:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kaitlancollins Trump doesn't give a crap about the stimulus checks. Don't credit him with a "good idea". His is all for him and what he wants. Nothing else.
1341519249291042816 2020-12-23 07:01:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek They are welcome to protest but this is seditious.
1341518426020429824 2020-12-23 06:58:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek I'm tired of the Republican Party holding everyone hostage. Maybe THEY don't want a stimulus but what does the country need? I'm all for bipartisanship but not for a party full of little tin pot dictators.

1341425754891022336 2020-12-23 00:49:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is not trying to "overturn an election". Let's be clear. This is attempting to stage a coup. This is against the law and these people must be expelled and prosecuted.

Followers certainly behave like it's a cult and the people at the top only want to use them for personal gain. Whatever it is, it's had its day.

His idiots need to be kicked in the ass and the door slammed behind them. We can't afford to give election fraud  legitimacy of any kind. This drivel just causes confusion.

1339608446790983680 2020-12-18 00:28:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CNNnewsroom Trump's relationship with Russia is not something we should "move beyond". We need to understand what happened so it can never happen again.
1339599555042500611 2020-12-17 23:53:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @EricLiptonNYT @JustSchmeltzer What a perfect situation for Trump. He didn't have to do anything and he could call it a policy.
1339407329868083200 2020-12-17 11:09:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JesseRodriguez As far as I'm concerned, Biden/Harris getting the vaccine is a national security issue.
1339400779489263616 2020-12-17 10:43:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joshtpm Herd immunity was ideal for Trump. He didn't have to do anything and he could call it a policy.
1339379406675070977 2020-12-17 09:18:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> States aren't receiving as many doses of vaccine as they expected. Why does this not surprise me? So, how did this happen?  https://t.co/hJ7N3pij25
1339344634053603332 2020-12-17 07:00:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kylegriffin1 Nurses should know better. One thing that galls me is the Repub party has no platform. These nurses (and the rest of MAGAland) have no idea what they are fighting for. They are literally fight in for nothing. They risking their lives for nothing.
1339342031483756546 2020-12-17 06:49:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @BeschlossDC The WH curator is counting the silver (I hope).
1339280841592233984 2020-12-17 02:46:49 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kylegriffin1 Biden and Harris should be vaccinated ASAP. It is a national security issue. Can you imagine what stunts the GOP would try to pull if Biden became sick?
1339279984255496200 2020-12-17 02:43:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RepAdamSchiff Republicans in the House signed a document supporting a coup. We can't keep letting them slide because all they do is take advantage and go further. If we don't start drawing a line in the sand this behavior will continue.
1339274040951906306 2020-12-17 02:19:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> IMO Biden and Harris being vaccinated is a national security issue.
1339272041011286018 2020-12-17 02:11:51 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CNNPolitics Frankly, in the case of the President and Vice-president, being vaccinated is a national security issue.
1339269677822906369 2020-12-17 02:02:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RadioFreeTom Buttigieg is certainly smart enough and does have experience running a city. I'm sure if he doesn't rise to the occasion he won't be kept in the position. I think he will. He has eyes on the future and I'm sure he wants to prove himself in big time politics.
1339266836920209409 2020-12-17 01:51:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mkraju Hunter Biden is a private citizen.
1339266384480624641 2020-12-17 01:49:23 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mmpadellan It won't unite squat. It will just royally piss off most Democrats and Independents. Trump doesn't deserve credit when he has allowed 300,000 to die. He had no idea what to do, didn't really care and decided politicization of a deadly disease was more important than lives.
1339249950056714245 2020-12-17 00:44:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Bill_Maxwell_ @PuestoLoco @SpeakerPelosi Yes. We keep complaining about shady and illegal acts by members of the GOP but let it slide every time. The GOP just keeps going and the next time, escalates their bad behavior. We have to draw a firm line somewhere. They were advocating a coup. This must be addressed.

1339202113294000133 2020-12-16 21:33:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DamonLinker @ThePlumLineGS For one thing, Dems need to stop turning the other cheek. If we keep letting the GOP get by with their nonsense, they just become emboldened to go further. There needs to be a line drawn somewhere. Perhaps we should start with the House members involved in the TX lawsuit.
1339198380757618690 2020-12-16 21:19:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @washingtonpost Giving Trump credit for the vaccine would anger a lot of people. Trump has let the coronavirus rage unchecked across our country resulting in the deaths of 300,000 people. You can't put lipstick on a pig...
1339034237383684101 2020-12-16 10:26:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @thenation These people who are illegally disrupting our election process must be punished. We can't keep turning the other cheek because they will just keep wasting our time. There are bigger fish to fry like vaccinating millions of Americans.
1338974915790245895 2020-12-16 06:31:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chipfranklin Yes. Our out of control covid spread affects the rest of the world.
1338924885469523968 2020-12-16 03:12:23 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mmpadellan I am concerned that if there is no penalty the Repubs will just continue to try to run over us.
1338920923341197315 2020-12-16 02:56:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ddale8 Pandemic a hoax.
1338576995647692801 2020-12-15 04:09:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @VABVOX IKR!? Their choice of States to complain about couldn't have been more ridiculously obvious.
1338517180242128897 2020-12-15 00:12:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @gtconway3d Trump already called Mar-a-Lago the Winter White House. Nope, nope, NOPE!
1338515861125144576 2020-12-15 00:07:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kylegriffin1 Is there any provision for Biden and Harris getting the vaccine? There should be.
1338501803726475264 2020-12-14 23:11:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kylegriffin1 Yes please.
1338477709811445762 2020-12-14 21:35:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TVietor08 @JoeBiden The incoming President and those in key national security positions should get the vaccine.
1338476313162682369 2020-12-14 21:29:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JillWineBanks I agree that key people, definitely the President and Vice President, should receive the vaccine because of national security. I do hope there is a provision for Biden to receive it.
1338157889928765440 2020-12-14 00:24:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PuestoLoco A poster girl for this is Governor Covid Kim Reynolds of Iowa. She actually said that she couldn't prioritize lives over livelihood. How GOP of her....
1338151513781374980 2020-12-13 23:59:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> As an old DHL warhorse, I'm really proud of the involvement of FedEx and UPS in moving the vaccine. Way to go, guys!
1338046382838591488 2020-12-13 17:01:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JoyAnnReid Misogyny is one reason Hillary Clinton was harassed as badly as she was. That led directly to the mess we are in as a country right now. Joseph Epstein needs to take a deep, long look at himself.
1337810739185201160 2020-12-13 01:25:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KamalaHarris @StephenKing THIS is our main priority, not worrying about insane plots to overthrow the government.
1337810052279906304 2020-12-13 01:22:26 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joncoopertweets @DrDinD @SpeakerPelosi @GOP We can't keep just turning the other cheek. That's part of what has gotten us in this mess. Unless there is deterrence others will keep stirring up the hornets' nest. Are we strong enough to resist next time?
1337809052106100738 2020-12-13 01:18:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ClydeHaberman They don't get it because they are afraid of dark skin and they fear that more than anything else.
1337808005103038468 2020-12-13 01:14:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @grandmagrit Hell yes. I'm into my dotage and would like a little taste of my golden years. I'm tired of sitting on my haunches just getting older. I've tried to make the most of the situation but it wears on the nerves constantly having an axe swinging over my head.
1337806947794513920 2020-12-13 01:10:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @john_sipher Anyone advocating armed rebellion should be reported to the FBI.
1337803440123219972 2020-12-13 00:56:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @tribelaw The embarrassments are the suits to flip the election, Trump and all his minions. The rest of the world is breathing a sigh of relief that sanity will be restored under Biden/Harris.
1337802142615285760 2020-12-13 00:51:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RepWesterman This wasn't a "hotly contested" election. No matter how many times state officials of BOTH parties said there was no fraud people refused to believe it. This was all because of a lying, gaslighting ass of a president. Don't try to stamp this with any kind of normalcy.
1337792263716556801 2020-12-13 00:11:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DMRegister @IAGovernor Is anyone surprised by this? I'm not. Covid Kim has been playing Trumpian politics with people's lives ever since the beginning of the pandemic.
1337526368217731079 2020-12-12 06:35:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Covid should be our number one priority right now, not the election. The selfish, greedy, power hungry members of the GOP who are wasting our time and money need to pay a price for this. They are relentless and the Dems keep turning the other cheek. NO MORE.
1337524106011533314 2020-12-12 06:26:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Americans do not attempt to overthrow their own elections. Period. Those that try to do so must be penalized for the sake of the future of this country.
1337523236049997826 2020-12-12 06:22:44 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @jbarro The point is, though, there has to be deterrence for sedition. If not, this is going to keep dragging on and will come back to bite us. We have to draw lines as to what is acceptable and what is not.
1337520212464242688 2020-12-12 06:10:43 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump If our "Electoral Process" is not repected, it's because of the damage YOU have done to it.
1337515815235694593 2020-12-12 05:53:14 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ZoeTillman Enough is enough. It's way past time for these frivolous suits to stop. There has to be ways to deter this.
1337513250062262274 2020-12-12 05:43:03 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @bradheath We have got to stop letting the Republicans get by with anything they want. Refuse to seat the bastards and charge them with sedition.
1337509908988768256 2020-12-12 05:29:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> These Fascists have the gall to pull this undemocratic, un-American stunt because Democrats keep letting them get by with it. We need party leaders with the ability to look them in the eye and fight when necessary.
1337508232009568258 2020-12-12 05:23:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @McFaul And I hope we will remain a democracy.
1337507621616689156 2020-12-12 05:20:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JuddLegum These people must be refused seats in Congress and should be charged with sedition. There must be deterrence.
1337505675585474562 2020-12-12 05:12:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MollyJongFast Remember, the MAJORITY voted for Biden. These people want to go against the will of the majority of Americans. I wasn't crazy about Reagan, either of the Bushes or Trump and I just don't recall engaging in seditious acts to force them out of office.
1337504216684908544 2020-12-12 05:07:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ryanstruyk Dems constantly turning the other cheek has gotten us NOTHING but a sore cheek. We have got to learn how to fight back.
1337503344038965252 2020-12-12 05:03:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kylegriffin1 There needs to be deterrence.
1337457139095400455 2020-12-12 02:00:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ImSpeaking13 Hell yes.
1337455564452925445 2020-12-12 01:53:49 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This people should NOT be seated in Congress.
1337454538836619264 2020-12-12 01:49:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NotHoodlum Seeing Trump perp walked out of the WH is my favorite political fantasy. However, #2 is now the Supreme Court telling the 17 AG's and 106 Reps that they are committing sedition and sentencing them all to 20 years in prison. Impossible, of course, but it gets me through the day!
1337427987441061891 2020-12-12 00:04:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Republicans keep pulling stunts because Dems keep rolling over and showing them their belly. I don't think we can do it this time.
1337422696460775427 2020-12-11 23:43:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I don't think we can turn our cheeks and ignore acts of sedition or other crimes committed in an attempt to overthrow the government. A lack of deterrence will insure the chaos will continue and maybe next time we won't be strong enough to resist.
1337395795411283971 2020-12-11 21:56:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump Then quit helping the world to do it.
1337250621800452098 2020-12-11 12:19:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Congress should refuse to seat them.
1337223195712217089 2020-12-11 10:30:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is the same Gov Covid Kim Reynolds who has managed Iowa's covid response like a mini Trump. She said point blank she couldn't prioritize lives over livelihood.   https://t.co/HCEHd0FFEv
1337213245090902019 2020-12-11 09:50:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kylegriffin1 @Miller4IA Thank you!
1337211838749167617 2020-12-11 09:45:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chipfranklin Yes. There has to be deterrence or we'll be back in the same mess within 10 years. Will we have the strength to resist next time?
1337160706282692609 2020-12-11 06:22:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mmpadellan We have got to find ways to neutralize McConnell's stranglehold. If we win the Senate, we can legislate. If not, we've got to become far more clever than we have been.
1337154250296713217 2020-12-11 05:56:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @bradheath The doubt was manufactured. Biden is both the winner in number of votes and the Electoral College.  I didn't like Reagan or Bush presidencies but I didn't attempt to overthrow the government because of it.
1337090117085880321 2020-12-11 01:41:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @AssusReamus Of course! We must have deterrence. Republicans (or anyone else) need to know they can't pull these stunts ever again.
1337089312870068224 2020-12-11 01:38:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chipfranklin Ugh! The mental image! I need to wash my mind's eye.
1337074628624347136 2020-12-11 00:40:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CNNPolitics That definitely won't help their case. Cruz pisses everyone off the minute he steps into a room.
1337068086931886086 2020-12-11 00:14:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis Cheesecake is always a good idea. Rock on!
1336818727862538241 2020-12-10 07:43:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RepAdamSchiff Running their mouths and keeping Trumps base riled up is also complicity. We need to find a way to neutralize the lies.
1336774287894716420 2020-12-10 04:46:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @bradheath I am sick and tired of this bullshit. No fraud. They lost. Now tell me, just who is it that's trying to steal an election? Hint: it's not the Democrats. The Repubs are going to  constantly try to keep the Trump base riled up for the next 4 years.
1336705177194258432 2020-12-10 00:12:03 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NBCNews I am sick of Republican obstructionism.

1336703346552541185 2020-12-10 00:04:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RadioFreeTom Our national attention needs to be on covid immunization. We don't need an insane would-be authoritarian gumming up the works. Right, @FBI ?
1336698873130135554 2020-12-09 23:47:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chipfranklin  https://t.co/alipT49ml0
1336697817524559875 2020-12-09 23:42:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @glennkirschner2 @JoeBiden I'm concerned about Biden's pick actually making it through to assume the office. Repubs aren't going to vote for anyone who might go after Trump. We need accountability and deterrence or we'll wind up back in the same soup.
1336638458593501184 2020-12-09 19:46:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CNNPolitics Fine with me. We can find a reason to party later when it is safe.
1336637745637240833 2020-12-09 19:44:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CREWcrew Probably already too late.
1336634076552433665 2020-12-09 19:29:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This has got to stop. Promoting the delusion that there was massive election fraud does the country no good. This is simply going to keep it alive until 2024 when we will have another fight for the soul of the country. Do we have the energy to resist again? Are we strong enough?
1336323559698751489 2020-12-08 22:55:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Would someone PLEASE, PLEASE require anyone in hallways of apartment buildings to mask? Also, please require maintenance personnel to mask. Stepping outside my apartment door feels like bathing in toxic waste.
1336292290936115202 2020-12-08 20:51:23 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @polkcohealth Serious questions. When it is time for seniors that aren't in rest homes to be vaccinated, they can't all stand in long lines and many don't have transportation. Are there plans for this?
1336290418665852928 2020-12-08 20:43:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MollyNagle3 @seungminkim @GMA @JoeBiden Now that that the situation is SNAFU and we don't have enough vaccine, Trump regime Warp Speed will meet with Biden officials.

1335320313077358595 2020-12-06 04:29:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MollyJongFast The Republican Party isn't a party any more. Rememer, they didn't even have a platform. They are more like an overblown special interest group.
1335319364443250690 2020-12-06 04:25:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joncoopertweets I don't know unless they cross my palm with silver IN ADVANCE.

1335004478521692163 2020-12-05 07:34:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JoyAnnReid How can he be disempowered?
1334875034809196544 2020-12-04 22:59:43 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> So, here is some interesting psychological damage. Last night in my dream I kept running away from the sound of the song Happy Birthday.
1334851961871593474 2020-12-04 21:28:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Iowa has some big governmental housecleaning that needs to be done ASAP. C'mon, fellow Iowans, we can do much better.
1334528939117727746 2020-12-04 00:04:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> After the covid crisis lessens, I wonder how much PTSD we are going to see in front line medical personnel.
1334481578186170369 2020-12-03 20:56:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MSNBC Apparently it is now time four our lame duck government to thoroughly yuk it up and squeeze the last drop of money out of American taxpayers.
1334479125017464832 2020-12-03 20:46:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Looks like Governor Covid Kim of Iowa was demolished once again last night by Maddow for her ineptitude in the Tyson Waterloo covid outbreak. Believe me, Iowans still truly wish she would get it together. If she'd stop worrying first about her voters and donors it would help.
1334275912737705987 2020-12-03 07:19:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @nytimes Some people are getting sloppy because the vaccine is close. It still could be 6 months before the vaccine is widely available. Those that are careless endanger everyone else.
1334274168788054018 2020-12-03 07:12:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NatashaBertrand We still could have 6 months before the vaccine is widely available.
1334250317072969731 2020-12-03 05:37:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DavidCornDC How do we stop this? Powell and others like her are doing trendous damage.
1333814220757098497 2020-12-02 00:44:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DMRegister We could solve a lot of problems if Kim Reynolds would sack up and listen to the experts.
1333813583625523203 2020-12-02 00:41:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JRubinBlogger A question about Sally...could she potentially have a conflict that could cause her to recuse if the issue of Flynn comes back up?
1333812717421998082 2020-12-02 00:38:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @bradheath It is obvious that way too many people in this country don't understand what a dictatorship really means. We need a plan to popularly provide this information. Maybe it's time to resurrect Schoolhouse Rock...I know that sounds silly but people still remember the Bill.
1333361710548267010 2020-11-30 18:46:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TimEdwardsZero4 As long as there are consequences that will deter anyone from putting our democracy in jeopardy again I really don't care. That's the only relevance Trump has for me now.
1333360157842092032 2020-11-30 18:40:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ThatEricAlper "I Will Always Love You". Parton to Houston.
1333205532375724037 2020-11-30 08:25:43 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @donwinslow It's about deterrence. There have to be consequences or this will all happen again. Maybe next time we won't be strong enough to rescue ourselves.
1333129299365392395 2020-11-30 03:22:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I don't expect any Biden/McConnell relationship to mean much.   https://t.co/7glwih0MwD
1333105430709612551 2020-11-30 01:47:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NathanLerner We must make it clear we don't want to hear his bullsh"t. We don't watch him on TV, read his tweets, read articles about his antics. If we continue to sneak peeks as entertainment, it will keep the gravy train moving and Trump will have relevance. It's about revenue.
1333042701609136130 2020-11-29 21:38:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MuellerSheWrote And I would suggest that any venue, city or shuttle service demand payment in advance for Trump events. He still owes money for his 2020 rallies.
1332814914390536192 2020-11-29 06:33:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Note this, non maskers. Even with a vaccine, we may need to wear masks for another year, at least. The more people who refuse to wear masks, the longer it will take.
1332811108370014209 2020-11-29 06:18:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CBSNews The same may apply to the Inauguration on a smaller scale. It should be VIRTUAL.
1332810163619762177 2020-11-29 06:14:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CNNPolitics We should be putting our money where our mouths are. The Inauguration should be virtual.
1332779648556683270 2020-11-29 04:13:24 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @nycsouthpaw I assume @FBI has heard about this?
1332735392987164675 2020-11-29 01:17:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kcci This might be more newsworthy than your story about a family going to the movies on Thanksgiving.
1332733994207744001 2020-11-29 01:11:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CREWcrew No either/or. Both.

1332361140475744256 2020-11-28 00:30:24 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Who gets the coronavirus vaccine first? I agree that the first consideration should be people most likely to die from it.   https://t.co/H7IPNX59q7
1332352104619503616 2020-11-27 23:54:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @robreiner It would help if media would quit finding him entertaining. That got him the nomination in the first place. That's what will keep him relevant. He sure as hell isn't going to pay for print or air time. We have to keep telling the press that we really don't want to hear it.
1332348461178556417 2020-11-27 23:40:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NBCNews I doubt it is easy for anyone. Others have simply "adulted" through the situation and have not acted like emotionally stunted and intellectually incoherent douchebags.
1332314198911627265 2020-11-27 21:23:52 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Lee_in_Iowa I do hope the White House curator is still on the job and carefully counting the silver.
1332311159513477121 2020-11-27 21:11:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek This doesn't shock me at all. We've known from the very first that Trump has a reputation for stiffing workers. This is what I expected.
1332186109137342464 2020-11-27 12:54:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KCCINews And this is a good idea because.....? Why on earth would this be worthy of reporting? The CDC is BEGGING people to stay home for T'giving. I can't tell you how many times I've read articles by KCCI trying to put a happy little spin on poor covid management.
1332024264929800194 2020-11-27 02:11:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JustinWolfers Shoes? Explain the term....
1332016860871716867 2020-11-27 01:42:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TimHerrera Laugh it up folks. There is another strain of the virus out there that somehow bypasses immune defenses. This is the one. So far, if I understand correctly, it isn't creating a problem with the vaccines.
1332014731813597185 2020-11-27 01:33:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @nypost What's important here is the science and keeping people safe and alive. That was completely ignored.
1332014148197216256 2020-11-27 01:31:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DanDotLewis @jaketapper Thank goodness. We don't need another one.
1332012158037741568 2020-11-27 01:23:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MollyJongFast I'm an Iowan and this is humiliating.
1332011886825664524 2020-11-27 01:22:36 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I prefer turkey on T'giving, not hamstrings.
1332011301871226884 2020-11-27 01:20:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @sahilkapur @NYGovCuomo @gabegutierrez The important things here are the science and keeping people alive. I don't believe in "acceptable loss" among non-military citizens. This is the most harebrained and dangerous decision they could have made.
1332006956530348033 2020-11-27 01:03:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I had hoped that I'd be able to take just a little respite from political involvement. However, the Supreme Court decision easing covid restrictions on churches makes me realize we all must stay engaged. This mess is not over. Biden won't be able to solve it all.
1332000145832108032 2020-11-27 00:35:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The Supreme Court just handed down one of the most knuckleheaded, dangerous decisions they have ever made! What is WRONG with those fools?
1331951584176189441 2020-11-26 21:22:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ElieNYC This is outrageous. This ties the hands of people who are trying to keep the country safe and will result in many more deaths.
1331950083445821441 2020-11-26 21:17:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is one of the most brain dead decisions the Supreme Court has ever made. Why can't people get it through their thick skulls that protecting the country from a deadly disease is a GOOD thing and it can't be done by half measures.
1331805979122552833 2020-11-26 11:44:23 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @djrothkopf A reason we came within inches of losing our Democracy is because  there was no accountability. If we continue to just let people off the hook and establish no guardrails someone is going to take political advantage of us again. I'm betting it could be within a decade.
1331653881558949896 2020-11-26 01:40:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Also, many seniors live with other family. Can a caretaker be vaccinated at the same time if they bring the senior in for their vaccination? The caretaker is risking exposure.
1331653880636203008 2020-11-26 01:40:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @polkcohealth @IAGovernor In regard to future covid vaccinations: Seniors don't only live in group homes. There are plenty of us in homes and apartments and many of us alone and some without transportation. I hope this group is being considered in the vaccination plans. 1/2
1331651173837922305 2020-11-26 01:29:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Would someone please, please screw Gov Covid Kim's head on straight? Iowans simply can't take any more of her sneakiness, selfishness and stupidity.   https://t.co/2AkAQqNnFg
1331479164940128258 2020-11-25 14:05:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Scout_Finch This is just a ploy by the GOP to appeal to Trumpists who tend to be suspicious of people with educations. I'm sure we'll see plenty more attempts to keep that base consolidated and riled up. I hope the Biden Administration has people adept at counter messaging.
1331474096052310023 2020-11-25 13:45:36 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JennaEllisEsq What on earth are you talking about? One of the basic principles of America is religious freedom. That includes ALL religions which seems to be the sticking point for some people. Sorry to disappoint but the USA isn't in the business of making religious martyrs.
1331471008247713797 2020-11-25 13:33:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK If there aren't consequences for Trump's behavior and guardrails put in place, I fear we could be facing another authoritarian within a decade - and this one may actually read. I'm not sure we'd be strong enough to survive.
1331351295223943168 2020-11-25 05:37:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @nypost Give me a break. Looks like the New York Post wants to start spreading the bullsh*t to start trouble among Democrats.
1331290865512419330 2020-11-25 01:37:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kaitlancollins Aw. Baby needed some attention.

1331214526369439745 2020-11-24 20:34:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Iowa needs some investigating. The Governor's response to covid has been so bad she has the nickname of Covid Kim. She encouraged and participated in Trump's superspreader rallies. I don't think Iowa's government is above skullduggery.
1331211971543371782 2020-11-24 20:24:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This morning I woke up and read an article about the guest hosts for Jeopardy. It's lovely that my brain felt there was room to be curious about it.
1331208431756320769 2020-11-24 20:09:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek I certainly hope so.
1331031803847700485 2020-11-24 08:28:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chipfranklin With bells on! I had to have a repair person in my apartment today. We were both masked but, at 34 degrees out and snowing, I had windows wide open for two hours, stayed 12 feet away from the guy, he wasn't there more than 5 minutes and I'm STILL scared. I've had enough!

1330867698172125187 2020-11-23 21:36:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CNNPolitics Michigan law prohibits this. Therefore, I hope this person is prosecuted. Part of the reasons Republicans are trying this sh*t is because we haven't held them accountable. For the sake of our future, we must start.
1330866959429361664 2020-11-23 21:33:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @nypost We should practice what we preach. It should be virtual.
1330866421321052164 2020-11-23 21:30:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Trump administration is leaving vaccine distribution up to the states. This is beginning to sound like the distribution of PPE. Without strong federal guidance, it turned out to be a total cluster. Is this what Biden will inherit?
1330858206562807813 2020-11-23 20:58:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kaitlancollins @jmhansler Trying to drum up post election support for Trump?

We can't keep flinching every time someone in the GOP yells "BOO!" Offenders must be held accountable to provide deterrence in the future.

1330560824558182401 2020-11-23 01:16:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @washingtonpost We need to put our money where our mouths are when it comes to covid. The Inauguration should be virtual. We can party later when it is safe. And, stop calling protecting oneself from covid as "hiding". How has it become a virtue to expose yourself to a deadly disease?

Many have never admitted it and never will but the minute Obama was elected, the sound you heard was GOP knees jerking.

1330542652685758464 2020-11-23 00:04:23 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> If any member of the Michigan board attempts to block certification, I hope both the Michigan Governor and Attorney General move quickly to prosecute. A message must be sent that these false, anti-American tactics are unacceptable.

1330277522030944261 2020-11-22 06:30:51 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @danbbaer If the Trump presidency wasn't accepted it was because plenty of people already understood the man was a crook. No one felt that way out of blind obedience to the Democratic party.
1330275185933553666 2020-11-22 06:21:34 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KCCINews Many of these people don't know the truth. At this point, many also don't want to know the truth. As an Iowan myself, all it does is make us look like the ignorant hayseeds the rest of the country thinks we are.

1330192255928463361 2020-11-22 00:52:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Repubs grouse about Dems ruining Trump's time in office by harassing him about Russia. They think turn about is fair play. Big difference here. Trump really did encourage Russia but they are trying to blacken Biden's eye by PRETENDING he did something wrong in the Ukraine.

1329926458551242761 2020-11-21 07:15:51 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Thevoiceinmyhea @kaitlancollins I believe this would be sedition.
1329913646789570561 2020-11-21 06:24:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @nypost Who forked over the cash?
1329912718585950208 2020-11-21 06:21:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @BillKristol The Michigan legislators should have never gone to the WH in the first place.
1329903487354884096 2020-11-21 05:44:34 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kaitlancollins Michigan Atty Gen Nessel (D), heads up! If there is a hint of conspiracy, these individuals should be prosecuted for the sake of the state of Michigan and for the sake of our country so no one ever even thinks about this again.
1329866470894022661 2020-11-21 03:17:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @BillKristol Seems to me Michigan Attorney General, Dana Nessel (D), can make it clear that if MI laws are broken, there will be prosecutions. Republicans need to start seeing that their actions have consequences. Ditto for Josh Shapiro (D) in Pennsylvania.
1329864283828654081 2020-11-21 03:08:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JakeSherman @SpeakerPelosi I'd say the assessment is spot on.
1329842690540892165 2020-11-21 01:42:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Limeylizzie Exactly! And it is difficult not to take it personally.
1329840957404090368 2020-11-21 01:36:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mkraju Perhaps Dana Nessel (D) should make it clear she will prosecute if they attempt to break the law.

1329828263766749184 2020-11-21 00:45:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @abbydphillip There has to be consequences or I can see this mess returning within the decade under Trump or under another greedy Republican.
1329827108282126336 2020-11-21 00:41:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joshtpm We need the Senate.
1329823552279896064 2020-11-21 00:26:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @acnewsitics I hope the Inauguration is basically virtual. We need to practice what we preach.

1329609729677651971 2020-11-20 10:17:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @senatefloorfan That just gives the situation legs. Any of it.
1329579711748591617 2020-11-20 08:18:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @djrothkopf This HAS to be prosecuted or we are going to be in the same boat in 4 years. I know this won't make us friends on the Right but I don't know how we can let it go. To stop this seditious behavior there must be consequences.
1329578458461196288 2020-11-20 08:13:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @tribelaw And they are attempting this in a state with a Dem Governor and a Dem Attorney General? The impudence!
1329555414342651904 2020-11-20 06:41:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @senatefloorfan Then, why are GOP members from Michigan going to the White House?
1329503691360116739 2020-11-20 03:15:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Has Covid Kim of Iowa finally seen the light? If so, I'm glad. But, I will never forgive her for the lives lost unnecessary.
1329453396416466945 2020-11-19 23:56:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @waltshaub @GSAEmily Has anyone ascertained if she has been threatened in any way? I'm definitely not on her side. I just think it is a reasonable question.
1329144040516972544 2020-11-19 03:26:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CBSNews Seems to me she'd be less toxic to potential future employers if she'd do the right thing.
1329141838188580865 2020-11-19 03:18:03 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @jimsciutto @KristenhCNN It's just Donny trying to spitefully kill as many people as possible by delaying and confusing distribution of covid vaccine. THERE MUST BE CONSEQUENCES for Trump so this can never happen again!
1329115529861353474 2020-11-19 01:33:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Susan_Hennessey Emily Murphy might be better off in the long run being fired by Trump rather than pandering to him.
1329113508039057409 2020-11-19 01:25:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> We need to put our money where our mouths are. The Inauguration should be virtual.

1328735935694069760 2020-11-18 00:25:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @grandmagrit I can kind of see it from both sides. BUT we need future deterrence.
1328700047194808320 2020-11-17 22:02:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @nycsouthpaw The problem is that if we start giving Repubs an inch they will take advantage of it. I think penalties in this case need to be a deterrent or we are leaving ourselves open to trouble again, perhaps even within ten years.
1328698940364124160 2020-11-17 21:58:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CNNPolitics You can't threaten the lives and livelihood of clear thinking Americans without a reaction! Actually, the other side is reacting to some of the same things. It's just gotten twisted.

Wash, rinse, repeat. I'm sure there are members of this crowd that were harmed by that policy.

1327294401689825283 2020-11-14 00:56:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PoliticusSarah @toddgillman There is a pro-Trump March in DC on Sat Nov 14 called "Stop the Steal".

I've had to learn to be good to myself by taking breaks from the news and finding a couple of projects that give me a reason to get up in the morning.
1326762468505513986 2020-11-12 13:43:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PalmerReport The difference between Trump &amp; Palin is Trump's drive for attention. The media found him entertaining &amp; gave him all sorts of free publicity. That led directly to his nomination. He won't be able to stand not commanding the news cycle &amp; will do everything he can to correct that.
1326749379563229186 2020-11-12 12:51:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis The press found Trump entertaining and all the free publicity and air time they gave him led directly to his nomination. They simply can't turn every gesture he makes into news once he is out of the WH. He's going to be like a firehose spewing crap because he craves attention.
1326677108458991619 2020-11-12 08:04:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TuckerCarlson Biden won. Give it up. There is no purposeful voter fraud by Dem Party. Can't say the same for the Repubs. There was that little thing about the USPS.

1326643284991750153 2020-11-12 05:49:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The country is being eaten alive by a pandemic and Trump does nothing but sit in the White House and whine about the election. The fact that his supporters have been blinded to that reality infuriates me. They can't see how he's suckered them.

1326563971789426694 2020-11-12 00:34:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Trump is a petulant child who has never been told no before and doesn't understand consequences. The Republicam party is taking full advantage of it.

1326474576012988417 2020-11-11 18:39:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @adegrandpre @lrozen This is what is supposed to be happening Saturday. STAY AWAY. This would be a perfect time for Trump to send in troublemakers and start screaming Antifa. Trump also dreams of military in our streets. STAY AWAY and don't play into Trump's hands.  https://t.co/FQ2VPqRWKm
1326470778045542400 2020-11-11 18:24:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KCCINews Insanity while covid is surging.
1326368646680211456 2020-11-11 11:38:22 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @IAGovernor Please, please order some covid mitigation that will make a big difference. We need a better mask ordinance. No more half measures!
1326334238560579585 2020-11-11 09:21:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> We've got to quit flinching every time Republicans pound the table.

1326255905638412295 2020-11-11 04:10:23 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @cspan @SecPompeo Not funny, Pompeo. And, holding up Transition funds implies illegitimacy. You know very well that's the impression you are trying to convey and you also know equally as well that it is bullsh*t.
1326254871872466945 2020-11-11 04:06:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DMRegister Insufficient.
1326254297403846667 2020-11-11 04:03:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @carolyn_janet @MaryLTrump Nope. Not married.
1326248531674460161 2020-11-11 03:41:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @IAGovernor 25 people without masks can turn into a spreader event. My relatives had a memorial service in Illinois. 8 people attended. All but 2 are now positive. No idea who was exposed to them in turn.
1326228002338955265 2020-11-11 02:19:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @jaketapper Trump wants military on the streets. Wake up, Congress *knock*knock!
1326225932131196929 2020-11-11 02:11:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> And what is this roll? I hope he is referring to his roll as 2nd Gentleman. I do not want ANY nepotism in Biden administration.
1326224876089323523 2020-11-11 02:07:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KatiePhang We are stuck in a cold civil war.
1326222108867899393 2020-11-11 01:56:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This simply is odd and not enough. Gov Kim Reynolds continues to prove she has earned her nickname, Covid Kim.   https://t.co/KVTO1muWOn
1326221241137639425 2020-11-11 01:52:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The reason for the mitigation should be because people are getting sick and dying. As usual, Reynolds prioritizes the almighty dollar over the lives of Iowans.
1326218581567287299 2020-11-11 01:42:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Every time the damn Republicans pound the table, Dems flinch. We have to stop flinching!
1326215437370208256 2020-11-11 01:29:34 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CaroRCummings @KedronBardwell Too little too late! She needs to issue a legit mask ordinance.
1326210806359461891 2020-11-11 01:11:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KCCINews Is this going to be another waste of everyone's time?
1326204728464842753 2020-11-11 00:47:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @juliaioffe Exactly. Dems fought Trump because he was a corrupt demagogue. Repubs are fighting Biden simply because they want to stay in control.
1326204101059866625 2020-11-11 00:44:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joncoopertweets He will continue to act out in order to stay in the news and stay relevant. As long as the media continues to respond every time he farts it will be difficult to heal this nation.
1326195985249411072 2020-11-11 00:12:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Gov Covid Kim's neglect of Iowans is nothing short of criminal. Hospitals are saying that people "may have to find an alternative" if someone is in need of hospitalization from covid.
1326192552354181128 2020-11-10 23:58:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> These are the states that have joined a compact to issue their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner.  https://t.co/6Ggn9lraw0
1326184598447984646 2020-11-10 23:27:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MaryLTrump A big problem is how to overcome the gaslighting. My adult daughter has fallen prey &amp; she will barely speak to me because I won't agree that the Dems stole the election. She's always trusted me in the past but actually said, "Why are you doing this to me? What's wrong with you?"
1326177148420427777 2020-11-10 22:57:26 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek Not "enough" fraud? He still has to turn the screws. That's like telling someone they don't suck much.
1326163936207663105 2020-11-10 22:04:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @acnewsitics The head of Pfizer said very clearly that he didn't want to politicize the vaccine.
1326163205455040512 2020-11-10 22:02:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> In search of the Stat Stud - Fallon hunts for Kornacki. We can use the smile today.
1326159538245013504 2020-11-10 21:47:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @OMGno2trump The problem is that so many Republicans still won't believe there was no fraud. We have to figure out how to overcome the gaslighting.
1326133279527985153 2020-11-10 20:03:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @VABVOX And right now, McConnell seems to be saying that rejecting Biden is ok because Dems rejected Trump. False equivalency! Dems rejected Trump because they believed he was a corrupt demagogue. Repubs reject Biden because they want to be in control.
1326129802873626624 2020-11-10 19:49:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @democraticbear I think that may be part of the plan. If the Repubs can't be in the WH they will try to destabilize the Biden government. They don't care about the safety of the United States or the welfare of its citizens. They only want to be in control.
1326128449623388163 2020-11-10 19:43:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Steven_Strauss Repubs always want it both ways. And what burns me is they are trying to equate Dem rejection of Trump the same as their rejection of Biden. Dems rejected Trump because of his corruption. Repubs reject Biden to maintain control and to get even.
1326123983549444096 2020-11-10 19:26:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @bopinion @EliLake We need stability &amp; we need it now. After 4 years of a slash and burn government we are broke, less safe, our reputation has suffered globally, we are in a cold civil war, Trump is trying to steal the election &amp; all this is exacerbated by a pandemic Trump has chosen to ignore.
1326120275126198272 2020-11-10 19:11:26 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @bopinion @mikenizza Seniors in general need to be higher on the list, not just the ones in nursing homes.

1325994945086361605 2020-11-10 10:53:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I'm feeling resentful tonight. I got one good, clean breath for the first time in four years. As of this morning, I'm in knots again because of Trump's filthy tricks. I've had all of Trump I can stomach. How are you feeling tonight?
1325985417154400256 2020-11-10 10:15:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DrEricDing @realDonaldTrump Why would they be building viewing stands this early?
1325949031986638849 2020-11-10 07:50:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @HeerJeet Except he just fired Esper.

1325936326047313925 2020-11-10 07:00:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @anoncatanoncat Is this assh*le actually planning on starting a war? Is he planning to barricade himself inside so he can't be dragged out? This isn't his house. This is OUR house.
1325932966476918794 2020-11-10 06:47:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @LoveColumnist @Scout_Finch There was a curator. I don't know if she is still there. Her name is Lydia Tederick.
1325932559340068867 2020-11-10 06:45:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Scout_Finch And by keeping the Biden administration away by preventing the GSA from signing off on the Transition.
1325925123371790338 2020-11-10 06:15:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Recounts are fishing expeditions - a way to look for something to complain about.
1325923260505141249 2020-11-10 06:08:34 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> People stand in the halls and just chit chat away, again maskless. Delivery people and the mailman all mask. Why can't they when they are inside? Rant over.   2/2
1325923259511091201 2020-11-10 06:08:34 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> WHY isn't there some covid regulations for an apartment complex? The maintenance staff in my complex go in and out of buildings, through halls with no circulation, and even into apartments unmasked. I've had to request they mask if they come into my apartment.  1/2
1325905642884902913 2020-11-10 04:58:34 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Alyssa_Milano I think it is far worse than just a fear of failure. He is keeping his base agitated while trying to force a coup.
1325879455097745416 2020-11-10 03:14:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @James_Long_66 @peterdaou The media will NEVER be perfect but it is necessary for a Democracy.  What I'm referring to is the difference in sets of "facts". The skepticism on the Left is quite different from the paranoia on the Right.
1325875349251645440 2020-11-10 02:58:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Recounts are a way to retroactively find something for the Trump regime to complain about.
1325874545593610240 2020-11-10 02:54:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This election fraud nonsense will go on forever. We will be hearing about this 4 years from now.
1325873508661022721 2020-11-10 02:50:52 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chipfranklin Hypocrite.
1325863838395330571 2020-11-10 02:12:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @jimsciutto Because he can. What a jack*ss!
1325850469177176065 2020-11-10 01:19:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @peterdaou Misinformation has been very successful. The first thing an autocrat does is undermine the press and institutions. Trump supporters are so suspicious of anything outside their bubble.
1325839198142816257 2020-11-10 00:34:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Susan_Hennessey I'm happy that people felt like dancing in the streets after Biden's win &amp; happy that most everyone wore masks. But, there were a lot of people packed together. Please get tested if you were in one of those crowds. It's time for everyone to do their part and we make it through!
1325837610883936257 2020-11-10 00:28:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NormOrnstein A single dose vaccine will be important, too. I'm wondering how many people will think they can get by with one dose.
1325835377144451072 2020-11-10 00:19:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> It may not be over unless we have a competent government which is paying attention to covid. All Trump cares about is trying to steal the election.
1325818528004452354 2020-11-09 23:12:24 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Frankly, I don't give a damn what Trump wants to take credit for. I want the Transition funds released by the GSA.
1325817647783612416 2020-11-09 23:08:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> So, what can be done about the Transition funds?
1325814211893727232 2020-11-09 22:55:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I'm pissed at @GSAEmily. Does she think she's a heroine? She is a saboteur. Biden IS Presedent-elect.
1325812830663225345 2020-11-09 22:49:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kaitlancollins @drsanjaygupta Watch Trump try to shit on it because there is no $$ to be made.
1325792944549466116 2020-11-09 21:30:44 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Biden voters are seriously over Trump for all reasons, not just because of covid. We yearn for sanity and real governance instead of chaos and corruption. Anyone who thinks announcement of a vaccine would make any difference in the result of the election is missing the point.
1325791305285455875 2020-11-09 21:24:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joshchafetz @Steven_Strauss Would Trump have won if the vaccine news had broken sooner? The vaccine has nothing to do with him. It wasn't part of Warp Speed. Mostly, I think everyone who voted for Biden was thoroughly done with Trump for all reasons and it makes no difference.
1325790066778714119 2020-11-09 21:19:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> In short, wear a damn mask. You won't get vaccinated today, tomorrow or even next month.
1325784130848747521 2020-11-09 20:55:43 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Great news but not a done deal. If the vaccine is approved it will still take a while to be mass produced and distributed. Also, this is an announcement but results, including safety, haven't been published yet.  Wear a damn mask, PLEASE!
1325782897509478403 2020-11-09 20:50:49 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump You are still not going to be President after January 20.
1325781797834280961 2020-11-09 20:46:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> If approved, we still don't know how long the vaccine will take to mass produce and distribute. Wear a mask like the man says.
1325774836392718336 2020-11-09 20:18:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Note this: Pfizer not part of Warp Speed.   https://t.co/qoIFr9MatQ

1325766644430483458 2020-11-09 19:46:14 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @grandmagrit I have been politically active for a lot of years. I'm hoping now I can be just politically interested. Knowing myself, that may not happen. I am very concerned about women's rights.

1325559510732320768 2020-11-09 06:03:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis The country is split in two and we don't need more divisions. We don't always have to agree but we don't need to be giving fodder to the Right. We need to be brining them in, not turning them off. Everyone has an agenda and maybe we need to be picking our battles.
1325393913562193921 2020-11-08 19:05:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RealSaavedra Here in Iowa covid cases have dramatically increased from a hundred or two a day to over 4000 a day. I have no idea if that's a second wave or not. All I know is that covid is out of control and needs to be managed.
1325388518756118528 2020-11-08 18:43:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MSNBC @JoyAnnReid I have been shocked at how entitled and selfish Americans have become. Just try to explain to some people why they should wear a mask and it becomes obvious. If we want our world to return to "normal" we need to be pulling together!
1325387337426210817 2020-11-08 18:39:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @bradheath Does Trump think he can negotiate the transfer of power? It doesn't work like that.
1325386040891281409 2020-11-08 18:33:51 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JoeBiden In my state, it seems that every time a fiscal belt needs to be tightened, they hack away at Education. Then six months later they start complaining about the state of education and blame teachers.
1325375505940492295 2020-11-08 17:51:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ElieNYC @realDonaldTrump Lets just call it what it is. The man is a sore loser.

1325131842400395269 2020-11-08 01:43:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @grandmagrit The press needs to stop covering every time he passes gas. The fact that the press found him amusing back in 2015 got him a lot of free air time and the nomination. He's had enough attention.
1325029259753230336 2020-11-07 18:56:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Trump isn't paying attention to this, people...
1325026162196832256 2020-11-07 18:43:49 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is a good reason we need to have an adult leading our government right now. The infant currently in the White House is so wrapped up in self pity that he is paying attention to nothing else.
1324892477925576704 2020-11-07 09:52:36 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CapehartJ I'm sure that can be arranged.

1324751696489230336 2020-11-07 00:33:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @imillhiser We expected this. Let the table pounding begin - and don't believe for one hot second these Repubs give a damn.
1324741953154699268 2020-11-06 23:54:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @LauraRBelin @IAGovernor It's long past time for Iowans to wake up and establish some balance in the State Legislature. We just seem to sleep through local elections.
1324740586868453376 2020-11-06 23:49:03 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I sure AF hope the Biden administration isn't hounded for the next four years by the election results. Sounds like Benghazi.
1324739835526062080 2020-11-06 23:46:03 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NVGOP They know damn well this isn't going to make a difference because of PA. They are trying to set a prescedent for fraud.
1324734116521222144 2020-11-06 23:23:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is a big reason Iowans need Biden in the White House. Iowa has been thrown to the wolves by the Governor known as Covid Kim.   https://t.co/oBVyNXIUEf
1324681096450158595 2020-11-06 19:52:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @FrankFigliuzzi1 @FBI FBI needs to arrest this guy immediately.

1324447582584799235 2020-11-06 04:24:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Instead of bogus charges of election fraud, why isn't Trump addressing the increase of covid?
1324417237059538945 2020-11-06 02:24:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> 4500 new covid cases reported in one day in Iowa and Gov Covid Kim Reynolds puts it all on Iowans to be careful. There are no new mitigation orders. Weak tea, Covid Kim!  https://t.co/GzMBDvh97S
1324411291801427972 2020-11-06 02:00:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @LauraRBelin @IAGovernor Weak tea, Covid Kim. Weak tea.
1324398296593539074 2020-11-06 01:08:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PattyArquette You aren't alone. I feel like I'm barely hanging on to a raggedy edge. But, I think we'll be ok.
1324397285351084035 2020-11-06 01:04:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DMRegister Covid Kim bears responsibility for this. Experts have begged her to listen to them &amp; she refused. There is still doubt about the veracity of covid numbers and anger about how she spent federal covid money. I'm sure she feels emboldened now because Iowa went red in the election.
1324392637428805634 2020-11-06 00:46:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Let's just say it. Trump is a sore looser. (I would never say he's a whiny little bitch because that would be rude - true, but rude.)
1324280861622231043 2020-11-05 17:22:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NBCNews More info:  https://t.co/EcRXiVCMKg
1324278826617229313 2020-11-05 17:14:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @democraticbear And I really want to know where all the missing ballots are from in Florida.  https://t.co/F7dyPg9UYx
1324187271013302274 2020-11-05 11:10:22 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mrbenwexler @neeratanden He had been up in the 90's before that.
1324178069263994880 2020-11-05 10:33:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ArmandoNDK @LauraRBelin AZ is making my stomach hurt at the moment.
1324154409966804993 2020-11-05 08:59:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joncoopertweets It'll be fun for a while as we find out who's going to be part of the Biden Administration.
1324152586899959809 2020-11-05 08:52:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @waltshaub The White House Curator needs to do an inventory of everything.
1324065067197935616 2020-11-05 03:04:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DMRegister Oh I definitely can think of what Republicans can do with that mandate. I'm thinking of a gesture.
1324045694630592513 2020-11-05 01:47:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Acosta You know, I wonder if the post office debacle can be used to cool the Trump clan's jets somehow.
1324044617281642501 2020-11-05 01:43:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Why aren't they calling WI for Biden yet?
1324041148470624256 2020-11-05 01:29:43 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MeidasStaci @joncoopertweets @JoeBiden This might be the source:  https://t.co/R5gvocJfTR
1324025615155167233 2020-11-05 00:28:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is really freaking important!
1324011640753442816 2020-11-04 23:32:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @derekjGZ True. But it's also about the most egregiously malinformed electorate I've ever seen - and the first election I was actively interested in was Eisenhower/Stevenson in 1952.
1324009764100202496 2020-11-04 23:25:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I think what is sticking in my craw at the moment is the breadth of the egregiously malinformed electorate in this country.
1323950996092047360 2020-11-04 19:31:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Think about this...if Trump wins, the pandemic continues unchecked.
1323934616756068352 2020-11-04 18:26:24 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> My heart is broken. The fact that so many people are willing to follow a man with zero regard for their lives is just impossible for me to comprehend.
1323819800716595200 2020-11-04 10:50:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> People are beginning to say "regardless of how this turns out" and it's making me very uncomfortable. There can be no regardless. There will be no effort to control covid and lots of people will die needlessly - and that's just the tip of the iceberg.
1323816124040044545 2020-11-04 10:35:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @funder I will never, ever understand why Trump is getting ANY votes. I'm frustrated and worried.
1323792201441255425 2020-11-04 09:00:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ElieNYC You've been a bright light in all this mess. You are appreciated. That being said, I'm still reverberating from the election 4 years ago and this has me freaked.
1323720443665276928 2020-11-04 04:15:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kaitlancollins It's still not supposed to be on WH grounds.
1323675855671930881 2020-11-04 01:18:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DemWrite Covid, healthcare, civil rights.
1323659108839469057 2020-11-04 00:11:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @steve_vladeck @RMFifthCircuit I'm just SICK of these guys. Are they planning on trying to force this to the Supreme Court hoping that will side with them? If they do, that would open Republicans to bolder moves.
1323657196580851717 2020-11-04 00:04:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @tribelaw You-are-freaking-kidding-me! Does anyone wonder what Roe v Wade is all about any more? It isn't just about abortion, it's about control of women.
1323655455672016903 2020-11-03 23:57:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @grandmagrit It's awful. I'm distracted and spacey.
1323581511686381568 2020-11-03 19:03:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @samstein Trump still could cause chaos out of office. The press finding him amusing and giving him tons of free air time is how he won the nomination in the first place. He's had enough attention. The country will be safer if the press doesn't pursue his every brain fart as entertainment.
1323565593866473474 2020-11-03 18:00:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @briantylercohen I hope he has a place in the new administration.
1323564007878500352 2020-11-03 17:53:44 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis The fortification of the White House just breaks my heart. Frankly, I think we have more to fear from Trump's buddies, the gun toting white supremacist groups, than Trump has to fear from Democratic voting Americans.
1323561703414599680 2020-11-03 17:44:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @acnewsitics I still am traumatized from the last presidential election. This one's kicking my ass, too.
1323443201592692736 2020-11-03 09:53:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DataProgress @AJentleson I want it ALL! But, if I can't have that, I'd be thrilled to kick Ernst to the curb!!
1323368279587594242 2020-11-03 04:55:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MauriceMichael This is stomach churning. This is a symbol of what our county has become in just the last four years. Throw the bums OUT!
1323283282407182336 2020-11-02 23:18:14 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CREWcrew This is a slap in the face to Americans. One thing I would like to see if Biden wins is for the Hatch Act to be reinforced and enforced.
1323281183120252930 2020-11-02 23:09:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump Liar. Biden supporters aren't blocking highways, carrying rifles, pushing a campaign bus off the road, abandoning rally goers, trying to steal an election. Your ego is so damaged that think nearly everyone is beneath you. You are nothing but a festering boil on this country.
1323278460157108232 2020-11-02 22:59:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @WHO13news If I ever see one more Trump it will be too soon. His dangerous policies infect our Governor and have resulted in unnecessary loss of Iowans' lives. This is unforgivable.
1323277645413523471 2020-11-02 22:55:50 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NateSilver538 We don't need this reminder.
1323276573164843008 2020-11-02 22:51:34 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Seems to me people would learn after Trump screwed them like this 3 times. But, I guess that's too much to hope. Trump has been screwing them for the last 4 years and they haven't figured that out yet.
1323274432366915585 2020-11-02 22:43:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> We can't let the Trump bullies deter us on Election Day. If Trump stays in office these people are going to become bolder. We can't let them get a foothold.
1323248401715265536 2020-11-02 20:59:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MauriceMichael @PalmerReport I'm concerned that Trump may be planing to use rabblerousers to start trouble. It won't take much to trigger the far right.
1323247680315887616 2020-11-02 20:56:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @nycjim Someone explain to me how any of this juvenile gamesmanship can be considered patriotic. Patriotism is for your country, not an individual.
1323246731891453954 2020-11-02 20:53:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is insane. What's going to happen when the first "plague ship" needs to return to port?
1323245924903194625 2020-11-02 20:49:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> My concern about this juvenile act is that it can also delay emergency vehicles. If someone is hurt because of this stupidity, they should be prosecuted.
1323087626950365185 2020-11-02 10:20:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MollyJongFast This doesn't seem to be having the dampening effect they probably expect. It's pissing people off - and not in Trump's favor.
1323086660498792448 2020-11-02 10:16:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis It's juvenile.
1323055281635500032 2020-11-02 08:12:14 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chipfranklin IA
1323036090895421441 2020-11-02 06:55:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DMRegister This is trash.
1323019716630335493 2020-11-02 05:50:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Let's turn these predictions into reality. VOTE. The American way of life is on the line. In fact, life itself is on the line. We must have a national plan to fight covid.
1323018945138434049 2020-11-02 05:47:51 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kaitlancollins Even if that were true, that isn't their job. Such utter bullsh*t. Why are we playing these adolescent games?
1323016733582626823 2020-11-02 05:39:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @matthewjdowd They aren't going to believe a Biden win. Scary thought. They will believe the election was rigged. How do we ever get through to these people?
1323013705886535681 2020-11-02 05:27:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DavidCornDC What about emergency vehicles?
1323013559756988416 2020-11-02 05:26:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Amy_Siskind They are also blocking emergency vehicles. If someone is hurt because of that these people should be held accountable.
1322967052047458305 2020-11-02 02:21:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Lee_in_Iowa @4everNeverTrump That's true but it shouldn't be. Iowans keep voting against their own best interests year after year. This stubborn, in-bred Conservatism  has never done the state any favors.  Typical Iowa "shoot yourself in the foot politics".
1322964753845805057 2020-11-02 02:12:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JenniferJJacobs Warning Americans about a deadly world-wide pandemic is not political. The virus doesn't care about who you vote for. All it wants to do is use your body to survive. Trump has made covid political and it is destroying lives. It doesn't have to be this way!
1322963751017058306 2020-11-02 02:08:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DiscreetLatino @yashar Actually, right now, I'd say the greatest indignity is being told by my government that as a senior I am expendable.
1322961584558383106 2020-11-02 01:59:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Zac_Petkanas I'm still traumatized from the last presidential election.
1322929095999655937 2020-11-01 23:50:49 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @USAirForce92 It depends. People of color felt the dread. White people, no. The difference now is that we ALL have everything to lose. IMO, this is a 1776 level emergency.
1322926605589716993 2020-11-01 23:40:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @djrothkopf Roe v Wade isn't just about abortion. It is about control. When women are denied reproductive freedom, they fall behind in education, in job experience and don't progress to the highest level in their careers. This is suppression and discrimination.
1322881255399186435 2020-11-01 20:40:43 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CNNPolitics It may be a little tough convincing even our friends that this won't happen again soon. We've got a lot of damage control ahead.
1322880216407121922 2020-11-01 20:36:36 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek Besides being unqualified, WTF is this man doing interviewing with Russian state media? This just makes us even look more ridiculous and weak because Russia has a mask mandate!
1322877919195258882 2020-11-01 20:27:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is just one thing that Trump's lies have caused. Trump supporters simply aren't living in reality. If Biden becomes president, how do we reclaim them? This simply can't continue. Please vote!
1322829348827766784 2020-11-01 17:14:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @AngelaBelcamino Yup. Too much at stake. I'm still in shock from 2016.
1322806773930172416 2020-11-01 15:44:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JoyceWhiteVance What on earth do white men see in Donald Trump? I'm not talking about the gun toting extremists. I'm talking about the average white guy. I don't understand the appeal and it worries me.
1322800962898219011 2020-11-01 15:21:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @davidfrum @nadabakos @natfrum @beatrice_frum This is inexcusable. I'm so sorry your people were caught in this. I hope everyone is ok.
1322797836967333890 2020-11-01 15:09:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Why does this election seem personal to you? For me, it is because I am a senior and I was told that I'm expendable.
1322797163278159872 2020-11-01 15:06:34 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DrEricDing @donwinslow This is personal for me because I an "expendable" senior.
1322749081253486592 2020-11-01 11:55:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Andee_Panda_ @brianneDMR @DMRegister Except that's EXACTLY what has happened to her and she DOES have covid. She also has covid lung and her kidneys and other internal organs are painfully swollen. She was very, very sick and not out of the woods one month later. Minimize it if you will but this is real.
1322728690845929472 2020-11-01 10:34:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @B52Malmet Not to mention the 30,000 people his rallies have made sick with covid.
1322727959443156994 2020-11-01 10:31:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Democrats, do not let this discourage you. It is not over. Get to the polls and VOTE!
1322702939820072961 2020-11-01 08:52:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Andee_Panda_ @brianneDMR @DMRegister A dear friend has covid. Tell me I'm overreacting at the blisters covering her body and the scabs all down inside her esophagus - and that's just for starters.
1322702445873635329 2020-11-01 08:50:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SMack30147213 @brianneDMR @DMRegister The point is we need a legit national plan to control covid. The economy won't recover and people will needlessly die if things continue the way they are. Trump is tired of dealing with the virus because he has no clue what to do. So, he seizes on the fantasy of herd immunity.
1322701284152061957 2020-11-01 08:45:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @matthewjdowd We can't let this discourage Iowans. It isn't over yet. Please, please VOTE.
1322689667427434496 2020-11-01 07:59:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The damage this can do to our country is heartbreaking. Mitch McConnell will stymie recovery. Bills passed by the House will continue to pile up on his desk. We have to quit fooling around and VOTE. Every Dem must get to the polls!
1322688316823752706 2020-11-01 07:54:03 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @brianneDMR @DMRegister I'm thoroughly disgusted. Democrats....get to the polls. Don't just give up!
1322687541728956416 2020-11-01 07:50:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @yashar This is beyond frustrating. This is based on lies and corruption. I don't understand what blinds my fellow Iowans to the truth!
1322686829661986816 2020-11-01 07:48:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @brianneDMR @DMRegister Covid Kim as a Governor. Phony Joni in the Senate. I have barely seen another human being since March because of covid. Biden must win nationally or Iowans will continue to die needlessly. NO MORE!
1322685677025329152 2020-11-01 07:43:34 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DMRegister This is beyond frustrating to me. I just don't understand why Iowans repeatedly vote against their own best interests. This is shoot yourself in the foot politics.
1322684817121644544 2020-11-01 07:40:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Amy_Siskind Also, it really bothers me that white men don't see through the Trump bullsh*t.
1322681910829764612 2020-11-01 07:28:36 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @IowaBonnie @DMRegister Ignorant bullsh*t.
1322671253929558017 2020-11-01 06:46:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Olivianuzzi @NYMag What a ridiculous, petty man Trump is! People are dying from covid, children are in cages, the economy is struggling and Trump talks about Biden's wrinkles. I can't take another minute of Trump!
1322669138326835200 2020-11-01 06:37:51 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KellyO This is a crime scene as far as I'm concerned.
1322668682905034755 2020-11-01 06:36:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kirstiealley It still remains that we need a national plan to fight covid. Obviously, that isn't going to happen under Trump. I've barely seen another human since last March because of my medical risk. It doesn't have to be the way it is! Other countries have proven it.
1322663526595514372 2020-11-01 06:15:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> We desperately need a national plan to get covid under control. Vote Biden/Harris.
1322661896814759936 2020-11-01 06:09:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> We have to stop this by voting in numbers so large that they can't be manipulated. Stop Trump!
1322659767597309952 2020-11-01 06:00:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Make these predictions a reality. VOTE in numbers so large that the cheating bastards can't catch up!
1322658424958701570 2020-11-01 05:55:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TeaPainUSA We need help from the press. Not every fart and whisper he makes is newsworthy. They also need to be careful of his comments that incite violence.
1322595229149679616 2020-11-01 01:44:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @AnnieLinskey There are quite a few eagles living in trees above the 2 rivers in Des Moines.
1322273432256524289 2020-10-31 04:25:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is the Director-General of the WHO.
1322146886707482624 2020-10-30 20:02:36 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JillWineBanks Covid, voting rights and voter suppression. We need to look at broken norms that got us into trouble and legislate them. The emoluments clause needs to be expanded upon and financial expectations for the president better defined. Strengthen rules on nepotism, reexamine Hatch Act.
1322023239019802626 2020-10-30 11:51:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @B52Malmet My election anxiety is like a roller-coaster. The covid stress is constant, always clinging to the back of my brain. Throw in a handful of resentment because I'm a "expendable" senior and you have one strung out old broad....For me, it's both.
1322009348109979648 2020-10-30 10:56:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I just despise what Covid Kim has done to Iowa. Iowans aren't "learning to live" with covid. They are dying from it. She's delusional.   https://t.co/WXgQ0euvwz
1321536894543532033 2020-10-29 03:38:43 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I just made the mistake of watching a few minutes of a Trump rally in Arizona. The duplicity is just stunning. The lies and disinformation in just a few minutes was astonishing: they spied on my campaign, we're turning the corner on covid, a vaccine will come momentarily...
1321527074348171264 2020-10-29 02:59:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @nielslesniewski @Smartypants60 When Trump says stuff like this, he's talking directly to the court and telling them what he wants.
1321455039186149376 2020-10-28 22:13:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PuestoLoco Problem is, it is totally believable.
1321346639521599488 2020-10-28 15:02:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @politicalelle Biden is controlling attendance to his events due to covid. Also, Dems, who don't pretend covid doesn't exist, know to stay in out of the rain. Comparing Biden events to Trump events is a false equivalency.
1321335596875395072 2020-10-28 14:18:50 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ElieNYC We keep warning Trumpers that they are only being used. All they do is get angry and accuse us of some evil agenda. I guess exposing them to covid at the rally wasn't enough. I just hope all survive the Omaha rally healthy, safe and warm.
1321333598193156096 2020-10-28 14:10:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> These are the people in Omaha that Trump first exposed to covid then  abandoned to hypothermia.
1321332285455667200 2020-10-28 14:05:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DrEricDing I'm just livid that exposing these poor people to covid wasn't enough for Trump. He also abandoned them to hypothermia in freezing temperatures due to a nearly 4 mile walk to get back to their cars.
1321227204236333061 2020-10-28 07:08:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Please...if you can vote early, do so. Today (Tuesday) is probably the last day you can mail in your ballot. Just be sure to VOTE.

1321117031014563842 2020-10-27 23:50:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump That would have been a little difficult. Biden wasn't on any stages yesterday.
1321073824708894721 2020-10-27 20:58:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> There has been essentially no government for the last four years. VOTE!
1321067850992394240 2020-10-27 20:34:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @jimsciutto #1: Saving our Republic. Unless we wrest control from fascists currently in office, we don't have a prayer of controlling covid or preventing our country from devolving into two classes. It will completely change life as we know it. It is almost unrecognizable already.
1321058003567652867 2020-10-27 19:55:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @glennkirschner2 I wish I shared your confidence.
1321057601640108032 2020-10-27 19:54:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The little soiree for Barrett last night is a slap in the face for the majority of Americans.

1320918124900790274 2020-10-27 10:39:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Amy_Siskind I'm so livid I can barely think.
1320859697365225472 2020-10-27 06:47:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ElizLanders @SenatorRomney Romney knows better than this. I guess his Republican "principles" outweigh ethics.
1320713380601171970 2020-10-26 21:06:22 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> My political anxiety is really painful this week. I'm so tired of feeling like I have whiplash. As an "expendable" senior, it is difficult not to take this whole mess very personally.
1320701652073091073 2020-10-26 20:19:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @GeorgeTakei Poor argument. Covid is too prevalent - anyone can come down with it. If Biden should become infected would he be unworthy of being president?
1320669329944383489 2020-10-26 18:11:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kylegriffin1 Someone is trying to avoid sanctions.
1320231043635490817 2020-10-25 13:09:44 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @sfpelosi @VP This is a risky argument. Anyone can get sick from covid. It's just too prevalent. If Biden were to become infected, would he suddenly be a bad candidate?
1319984612051984385 2020-10-24 20:50:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DavidVeevers1 I remember Eisenhower winning the presidency over Stephenson (1952). It was the beginning of my interest in politics. We had a mock election at school.
1319977999308120064 2020-10-24 20:24:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @StevenBeschloss Roe v Wade is at least part of the issue. Pro-Lifers love the fetus but have little concern for the person. They are willing to make a pact with the devil and have decided that people suffering and dying is an acceptable price.
1319799507840913409 2020-10-24 08:34:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KCCINews Repub Joni Ernst knowingly accepted illegal contributions during her 1st run for the Senate. Is this suit garbage to smear Dems right before election day? I wouldn't put it past them.
1319781823124328449 2020-10-24 07:24:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @J_Motoki I'm in Iowa. We are expecting snow Sunday morning. We had snow last weekend, only about half an inch in the middle of town. Just north of the city they had 9 inches of snow. It's unusually early for that.
1319780342740508674 2020-10-24 07:18:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek This "payroll tax" Trump keeps talking about cutting is the FICA tax for Social Security. No contributions and it goes under, taking the money we have contributed with it.
1319779418051612674 2020-10-24 07:15:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I hope he starts with Governor Covid Kim of Iowa. She's stubborn as a mule and far more concerned with her donors and voters than she is about lives. She has fought against mask mandates in Iowa.
1319756266022051841 2020-10-24 05:43:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This angers me beyond belief. Women are not secondhand citizens. They have brains and are better able to determine what is right for their families than an outsider. They do not require an overlord.
1319696375731335168 2020-10-24 01:45:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Iowa's covid deaths rate highest in the US and Governor Covid Kim Reynolds is still pandering to her donors and right wing voters.
1319418836211404808 2020-10-23 07:22:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @IsaacDovere Oh who cares.
1319363044015747072 2020-10-23 03:40:36 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Des Moines, IA will soon only have ONE covid test site. Governor Covid Kim strikes again.
1319353029045456898 2020-10-23 03:00:49 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kylegriffin1 Pure spite.
1319346418302263296 2020-10-23 02:34:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis What a baby! I'm so SICK him!
1319328111083794439 2020-10-23 01:21:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Good news but Covid Kim misses the point once again. If the pandemic was managed we wouldn't have to worry about the beds.  https://t.co/HZ0uugR2nE
1319281837944926211 2020-10-22 22:17:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The Russians say that election interference from them is groundless? I want Biden to be inaugurated then sanction the sh*t out of them so thoroughly that they never try this crap again!
1318933047820025856 2020-10-21 23:11:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Iowa reports 31 deaths from covid since yesterday! Gov Covid Kim Reynolds is responsible. She still refuses to issue a mask mandate because she is afraid of upsetting her donors and voters. She should be impeached but fat chance with the Repub legislature - and she knows that.
1318923900751892480 2020-10-21 22:35:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JenniferJJacobs @MarkMeadows @LesleyRStahl So?
1318922158991691781 2020-10-21 22:28:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @B52Malmet Yep. It's kind of like the 3AM "night terrors" except it goes on all day.
1318774220801953803 2020-10-21 12:40:50 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kshivs20 He doesn't look well. Is he sick?
1318621283014348802 2020-10-21 02:33:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ElieNYC This not only includes the Border but his lies about coronavirus. He KNEW the truth but tried to spin the situation for selfish purposes. He must be held accountable so it never happens again.
1318619472354332672 2020-10-21 02:25:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Susan_Hennessey I get so tired of ALL the phony GOP table pounding. The next in line will be the deficit which they haven't given a sh*t about for the last 4 years.
1318611129829031937 2020-10-21 01:52:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Giant_Cyclone @senatemajldr Nope. It proved she is an ideologue and I do not want her anywhere near the Supreme Court.
1318537843241877504 2020-10-20 21:01:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Trump has KNOWINGLY left millions of people exposed to a deadly disease because of his own self interest. This is a crime against humanity and Trump needs to answer for it.
1318536269308317697 2020-10-20 20:55:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ddale8 What enemy? Russia, Iran, North Korea? Fellow Americans are opponents and not the enemy.
1318524036801024001 2020-10-20 20:06:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The closer we get to the election, the worse my stomach acts. I can't believe how stressed I am about a presidential election. This is 1776 level stuff and I hope after Nov 3 I still have a country. Please vote!
1318321328965980169 2020-10-20 06:41:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KCCINews Virus is surging and Iowa sends their kids to school. Covid Kim Reynolds is out of her mind.
1318314441730117634 2020-10-20 06:13:50 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chatty_cath We're hanging in there. Healthy so far.
1318297523740692482 2020-10-20 05:06:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MauriceMichael I'm curious as to how they are accounting for this today.
1318297172035670017 2020-10-20 05:05:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Dan_F_Jacobson My signature looks quite different from one time to the next. People with physical conditions and seniors often have this problem. Using signatures for this purpose is bogus.
1318220591661547522 2020-10-20 00:00:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PhilipRucker I believe that a president should never try to prosecute their political opponents. However, this is criminal. The Woodward recording left no doubt that Trump knows the truth. Hitler gassed people. Trump exposes them to a deadly virus. Trump should be held accountable!
1318211584519475201 2020-10-19 23:25:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @pilukiki I've been home since March. My groceries are delivered - left outside my door. It's going to get worse here because of the stupidity of Trump. We have a national election on Nov 3. Keep your fingers crossed that the Trump is kicked out. Lives depend on it.
1318210204111114242 2020-10-19 23:19:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The population of my city is 216,853. Number of covid deaths is 219,537. Statistically, every man, woman and child in my city is gone.
1318206049019637766 2020-10-19 23:03:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @pilukiki Still staying healthy? Covid is completely out of control here. My doctor said I have to assume everyone has it and act accordingly. It is snowing here right now which is much earlier than normal. I've been trying to do my part to get rid of Trump.
1318203433137147907 2020-10-19 22:52:44 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chatty_cath The whole OL microcosm has been shattered in more pieces than our country. Peace is practically guaranteed never to break out.    Thinking of you this AM. Still healthy? Are you working from home?
1318198667178856449 2020-10-19 22:33:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DMRegister @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @heytana This is complete crap. The Republicans have wanted to torpedo Social Security and Medicare for a long time. To anyone who doesn't realize it, this tax that Trump wants to put on hiatus is the FICA - the Social Security tax. No funds = no Soc Sec.
1318197459005394944 2020-10-19 22:28:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JRVJ71 @ClydeHaberman I agree to a point. It can be amplified if the press isn't careful. A lot of folks live in his fairytale land and it's going to take time to bring them back to reality. If he fundraises and does rallies it's going to be tough. But, this can go so many different ways.
1318183531848388608 2020-10-19 21:33:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JRVJ71 @ClydeHaberman I suspect he'll try to continue to make noise. As long as the press doesn't fall for his attention seeking I think you have a good point. There are so many ways this can go. One of the biggest problems is the lalaland Trumpers live in.
1318176536902668292 2020-10-19 21:05:51 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ClydeHaberman That's how Trump got the nomination in 2015. After he leaves office, if the press continues to chase all his shiny objects, it will be very difficult to heal. He will pander to QAnon, white supremacists. That's not hyperventilating. We all need a little peace.
1318174935995584512 2020-10-19 20:59:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @lisastark351 Hopefully, what color a dress really is. But, I fear Trump isn't going to keep his mouth shut. The press has to stop chasing every shiny object so we get a little peace.
1318173943220604929 2020-10-19 20:55:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RWPUSA It would be the best thing for the country, actually. This country can't heal with him still spewing out all his bullsh*t. The country needs some peace!
1318172796799848448 2020-10-19 20:50:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ClydeHaberman I the press reports every little piece of bullsh*t it would be a problem. That's how Trump got the nomination in 2015. He was entertainment. He can't be legitimized this way. Hasn't he had enough attention by now?
1318169995151659008 2020-10-19 20:39:51 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KCCINews This makes me extremely nervous when virus is surging. We've had up to 1600 cases reported in a 24 hour period! I honestly can't see how this won't be a waste of time, money and lives. Thank our Governor, Covid Kim Reynolds.
1318168352091668480 2020-10-19 20:33:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joncoopertweets I'd head to the ACLU on this one.
1317976699359854593 2020-10-19 07:51:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump How on earth are these people ever going to be brought back into the real world?
1317960017736327168 2020-10-19 06:45:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CBSNews In other words, he voted for Trump.
1317956293462839297 2020-10-19 06:30:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @donwinslow What is the status of this? Anyone know?
1317953254098149383 2020-10-19 06:18:36 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joshscampbell These same geniuses say on Twitter and FB that Trump is going to win because of the size of the crowds showing up for Trump and few showing up for Biden. *face palm*
1317920795616636929 2020-10-19 04:09:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @briantylercohen How about Chief of Staff?

1317884339183620097 2020-10-19 01:44:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek The press will need to stop reporting every little antic by Trump. That's what got him the nomination in 2015. Trump was entertainment. He's had enough attention now.
1317882517375078400 2020-10-19 01:37:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Remember when the big issue on Twitter was the color of a dress? Seems like a million years ago.
1317879287035420680 2020-10-19 01:24:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kumailn Polls can be turned into reality if we vote!
1317872260062072833 2020-10-19 00:56:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Turn the polls into reality. VOTE!
1317869537409236999 2020-10-19 00:45:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis My daughter lives two floors above me in the same building and we can't see each other. Plus, I'm an "expendable" senior. It's hard not to take this stuff personally. I resent Trump to the bone for throwing me out like chum. I voted for Biden.
1317867622193614848 2020-10-19 00:38:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @markknoller He heard that Biden attends regularly.
1317866691402096640 2020-10-19 00:34:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SimonWDC Then he's stupid.
1317866249674776587 2020-10-19 00:32:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SenKamalaHarris It really isn't just about abortion. This is about control. Remove women's reproductive rights and you destroy options. Then, women fall behind in preparation and experience if they want a career.
1317844683901554696 2020-10-18 23:07:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JillWineBanks I was in the park. A lot of people were there because they believed in the cause but there were a lot there on a lark. I don't think many responded to what leaders said or did but to what the crowd was doing. One small raindrop became a storm.The movie accurately portrayed that.
1317830365633982464 2020-10-18 22:10:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @McQzan @JeremyCom I was a manager for an air courier company.
1317817459890659336 2020-10-18 21:19:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kirstiealley @realDonaldTrump He's definitely not a politician. I'll give you that. He definitely is a f**k up.
1317806692051177472 2020-10-18 20:36:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JeremyCom I used to make people take stuff from other people. Then we'd put the stuff on an airplane. Then someone else would give the stuff to other people.
1317614294402478080 2020-10-18 07:51:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @GreenfieldIowa Go get it, girl. What a relief that will be!
1317489022197956610 2020-10-17 23:33:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Seeing is believing. Wouldn't be the first time he's the only one who knows about it.
1317487821373034496 2020-10-17 23:29:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @djrothkopf If I felt like I had to flee, I don't have the means. A lot of people would be trapped here for the same reason.
1317487329167159296 2020-10-17 23:27:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KrauseForIowa @JoeBiden @DEADLINE He's toast when we vote him out. We still need to turn that into a reality. Everyone, vote!
1317143873743917056 2020-10-17 00:42:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Turn this into reality. Vote!
1317132504839630848 2020-10-16 23:57:14 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RawStory @darionavarro111 When did this country become so intellectually stunted? We used to be admired for our educational system. In my state, cuts to the educational budget year after year has had its effect.

1317124683674931200 2020-10-16 23:26:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Aw f**k! My state, Iowa, is on the news again as what not to do in regard to coronavirus. Blame is layed where it belongs, on the Governor Covid Kim and on an everyone for themselves attitude.  That is so opposite of what Iowa always has been that it breaks my heart.
1317122245618241536 2020-10-16 23:16:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NWPinPDX It's a long list - all of them. But, primarily Barr followed by Trump family members.

1317114047385436160 2020-10-16 22:43:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RadioFreeTom According to the Outage Map, Europe was having quite an issue at the same time.

My dad died in his 90's and had every single marble to the very last. And remember - some day this may be you.
1317109267607003137 2020-10-16 22:24:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MrDanZak In short, he voted for Trump. Why is that a concept that is so difficult to understand?
1317108198827020288 2020-10-16 22:20:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Lee_in_Iowa Hip pain is just miserable. Glad you're seeing some light.
1317107684043333639 2020-10-16 22:18:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Good news but don't think it is a done deal. Vote!
1317025685882417153 2020-10-16 16:52:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Polls only reflect potential votes. It isn't over yet. Get out and turn that potential into reality. VOTE!
1317019964272934912 2020-10-16 16:30:03 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CNNPolitics I wish someone would give me that kind of pity cash.
1316939412920520706 2020-10-16 11:09:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @emrazz @Lee_in_Iowa I remember all too well what it was like before Roe. Young women, you don't want to go there. There are all the physical and emotional ramifications AND it limited women's options. Women fell behind in their career preparation and experience. Thats what the boys' club wants.
1316924849328132097 2020-10-16 10:12:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @billscher Popsicle Joe.
1316907993414406146 2020-10-16 09:05:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mmpadellan Coherence! What a concept!
1316837828584710147 2020-10-16 04:26:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I guarantee they aren't going to like it once their rights and protections are stripped away. We can't go back.(2/2)
1316837827691327493 2020-10-16 04:26:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> If I could tell Trumpers one thing it would be that I remember what it was like before the Civil Rights Act, Medicare, Roe v Wade, strong environmental laws and much more. If Trump stays in office, (1/2)
1316830500972097536 2020-10-16 03:57:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Trump has never had a coherent message. He has shtick. He was just lucky.
1316818337205190657 2020-10-16 03:08:51 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Gma2Iowa @DMRegister The fact that you'd call political opponents "haters" speaks volumes.
1316817703714402309 2020-10-16 03:06:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Iowans, new Wall Street Journal poll has Biden +1. Keep pushing and get to the polls. Make sure others get there, too. We need someone to tell Covid Kim to get her shit together.
1316816716601712641 2020-10-16 03:02:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @feliciasonmez @SykesCharlie Exactly. And if you remember, in 2015 this kind of sh* t gave him the nomination.
1316815806211260416 2020-10-16 02:58:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CheriJacobus Absolutely this isn't about abortion. It is about control. Women know the options they have in life, like choosing a career, is irrevocably tied to birth control. Take away options and you control the woman.
1316813249019613184 2020-10-16 02:48:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @waltshaub @jentaub This is just going to alienate him even more. He's thrashing. We have got to get EVERYONE to the polls.
1316787864533970944 2020-10-16 01:07:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Giant_Cyclone @sarahcpr I dunno. Stroking the ego of a sociopathic narcissist in any way doesn't sound like a plan to me.
1316782068156821504 2020-10-16 00:44:44 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DMRegister This tarnishes Gable's reputation.
1316781800736382981 2020-10-16 00:43:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @sarahcpr @Giant_Cyclone Trump has had enough attention.
1316781365233356800 2020-10-16 00:41:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Watching Biden tonight will be like a palate cleanser. I've had enough brain pollution this week via Barrett and Trump.
1316780448765415424 2020-10-16 00:38:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Check this out, Iowans. Phoney Joni has a little something to worry about.
1316779605169184769 2020-10-16 00:34:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MarcACaputo How about an hour earlier or later? Not buying the excuses.
1316779285521272833 2020-10-16 00:33:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @glennkirschner2 Boohoo.
1316773357413707776 2020-10-16 00:10:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Nothing is certain. Vote.
1316770048804036610 2020-10-15 23:56:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> David Frost's interview with 45 year old Joe Biden is here ( and more). Wonderful interview.   https://t.co/Syn7wG0vKY
1316764916880113665 2020-10-15 23:36:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Trump may like the herd immunity idea simply because that gives him a policy but he doesn't have to DO anything. He is horrifically lazy.
1316754823887433728 2020-10-15 22:56:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @juanferquinterp @JRubinBlogger @Acosta Not just control of the body parts, control of women in general. Reproductive rights are vital to women who want options, like whether or not to have a career. Limiting a woman's options control the woman.
1316752944403034113 2020-10-15 22:49:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @grandmagrit Slithery.
1316752263684206592 2020-10-15 22:46:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Please, don't watch Trump's Town hall out of curiosity or because you are entertained by his antics.
1316751758010593281 2020-10-15 22:44:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @shannonrwatts I simply can't understand a woman who can't see all the ramifications of Roe. Her attitudes relegate women to second class citizenship. I guess she has her place in the sun and other women's lives don't matter. I just don't understand her.
1316749530143035392 2020-10-15 22:35:26 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MyBookPublisher @ktumulty @JohnJHarwood Better solution. Don't watch Trump's Townhall. All it will be is lies and antics.
1316747592756277249 2020-10-15 22:27:44 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> As an exhausted Iowan, this makes my heart sing. Now all we have to do is turn the statistics into reality by voting.
1316727310989524992 2020-10-15 21:07:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SaltyProfessor @Lee_in_Iowa I certainly hope so. We can't get overconfident on that.
1316725937963233286 2020-10-15 21:01:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> 19 days to go. Hang in there and VOTE as soon as you possibly can. This is a 1776 level emergency - and that isn't the tiniest exaggeration.
1316724875172679680 2020-10-15 20:57:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Get out and vote. Do not leave it to chance. The alternative is unthinkable.
1316718498299641864 2020-10-15 20:32:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TeaPainUSA Yes please!
1316718019092058113 2020-10-15 20:30:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KimReynoldsIA Once again, I'm totally furious with and ashamed of Covid Kim, Governor of Iowa. Last night, she spent her time, maskless, at a Trump superspreader event in Des Moines where Trump referred to her as "honey". That's a clue, Governor.
1316580194069753856 2020-10-15 11:22:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is depressing. Margin between Biden and Trump may be much closer than polls indicate.. Get to the polls as soon as you possibly can. This is an emergency. Our lives literally depend on it.   https://t.co/JBL9ybnc5A
1316576283275427841 2020-10-15 11:07:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Don't get complacent and pretent polls don't exist. Get to the poll as soon as you can! Vote a straight Dem ticket so we flip the Senate, too. There is a lot of work to be done and we need the Senate.
1316574444685582336 2020-10-15 10:59:43 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @StevenBeschloss Didn't he say the same thing in North Carolina? I'm hoping he means it.
1316497762939277312 2020-10-15 05:55:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I do not want Barrett on the Supreme Court. I was suspicious of her in the beginning and now I outright don't trust her.
1316496992630190086 2020-10-15 05:51:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chick_in_kiev @jentaub His loss.
1316493450188029953 2020-10-15 05:37:52 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Throwing this out there for (much) later: how are seniors without transportation going to get vaccinated without exposing themselves to covid? Lots of seniors live by themselves.
1316483930774700040 2020-10-15 05:00:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Barrett really doesn't seem to like Kamala.
1316481257606389760 2020-10-15 04:49:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ElieNYC Anyone that Trump wants on the Court as badly as he seems to want Barrett needs to be looked at with suspicion. I'm tired of the implication that we are just being paranoid. She's a zealot.
1316472760848220161 2020-10-15 04:15:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mkraju Barrett is a zealot. There's that.
1316454850025197572 2020-10-15 03:04:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Get those ballots returned!!
1316454244195733508 2020-10-15 03:02:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @WhiteHouse Well, Trump's cure is definitely turning out to be worse than the cure. 216,000 lives lost because too many are too stubborn, too ignorant, too selfish or too entitled to wear a damn mask. I'd definitely call death worse than wearing a mask!!
1316452689191088130 2020-10-15 02:55:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Wow. Blumenthal is right. Barrett's lack of transparency scares the sh*t out of me.
1316448846969548800 2020-10-15 02:40:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kshering @rabiasquared That's just devastating.  I'm so very sorry to hear that.
1316446942545747968 2020-10-15 02:33:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ThePlumLineGS @BradMossEsq Get ready for all the fake Repub outrage, table pounding about the deficit, attacks on voter rights, in short, all the bag of tricks will come out and harass Biden from day one. There is so much for Biden to prioritize so we're going to have to be patient on some things.
1316442770916159498 2020-10-15 02:16:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ElieNYC @BenSasse Bottom line IMO is that Barrett is a zealot.
1316441807929171977 2020-10-15 02:12:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @AmerIndependent Her "Originalism" is simply an excuse for her zealotry.
1316441186144522241 2020-10-15 02:10:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @WHO13news Barf. This will tarnish Gable's reputation. Trump cheapened this medal with his award to Rush Limbaugh.  This feels like pandering.
1316436669650939906 2020-10-15 01:52:14 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @WhiteHouse If I hear "China virus" come out of Trump's oral sphincter one more time, I will vomit. A lot. Everywhere.
1316436026513129472 2020-10-15 01:49:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ElieNYC Never forget this is all about control.
1316434361097613314 2020-10-15 01:43:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KCCINews This will tarnish Gable's reputation. Trump has cheapened the medal. Rush Limbaugh was a Trump recipient, remember?
1316433184599552001 2020-10-15 01:38:24 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RadioFreeTom Toxic masculinity.
1316431170729541633 2020-10-15 01:30:23 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joelockhart @NBCNews We'll find out if that happens. Don't be drawn into watching Trump because of this or because his antics are entertaining.
1316416277930553344 2020-10-15 00:31:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @HillaryClinton Then perhaps Barrett should stop acting like Barr in a dress. I'm always extra offended when another woman abuses all the hard work of women before her that gave her this opportunity.
1316414149220593664 2020-10-15 00:22:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @3921Bob @KCCINews Uh huh, Ivan.

1316410843983216640 2020-10-15 00:09:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JenniferJJacobs @DMRegister You are sh*tting me! I hope Iowans aren't that dumb....
1316410286346244096 2020-10-15 00:07:24 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @3921Bob @KCCINews Ya better look at some of the fact checking on this. I guess some people never learn when they are being "had".
1316409249497583616 2020-10-15 00:03:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NBCNews Seriously underwhelmed.
1316408455402590211 2020-10-15 00:00:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chatty_cath Excellent! I'm trying to get all my Christmas shopping done on line before all h*ll breaks loose for the season. You helped!!
1316403749766729730 2020-10-14 23:41:26 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chatty_cath Sounds like fun! Click! In Amazon cart. In fact, click! again. My daughter would enjoy this for Christmas.
1316385331919433728 2020-10-14 22:28:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MollyMcKew The pros are encouraged to reveal truths but everyone else should avoid turning it into the trending topic o' the day.
1316384568069500928 2020-10-14 22:25:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ThePlumLineGS Please, please don't let this take up all the air today. Call bullshit then STOP.
1316383224399097857 2020-10-14 22:19:52 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JakeSherman @JoeBiden @nypost STOP giving this air!!!! We all see the holes in it and know what it is. S.T.O.P.
1316382283440492545 2020-10-14 22:16:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @B52Malmet I'll be watching Biden. After Barrett this week, I need to hear someone who isn't certifiably nuts.
1316381444386717699 2020-10-14 22:12:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @maggieNYT Not worth discussing past this. Someone is trying to start a new controversy.
1316313127059886080 2020-10-14 17:41:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @nypost Looks like Murdock is trying to stir up a new controversy practically on the eve of election day. Hard pass.
1316312196679438336 2020-10-14 17:37:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NBCNews Seize that moral high ground! Trouble is, being a member of the GOP means Romney gives tacit approval to their racism, voter suppression, kidnapping of children etc. Romney was also in favor of filling the Supreme Court seat. All shiny on the outside but nothing within?
1316129702898171905 2020-10-14 05:32:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Dammit!   https://t.co/KTdHmtrRUq
1316065195014393859 2020-10-14 01:16:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I just can't stomach Cruz. I can't watch this.
1316063395049811968 2020-10-14 01:08:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JRehling I'm not into conspiracy theories but it's difficult not to question this.
1316060765972033536 2020-10-14 00:58:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @pittengineer75 @kasie I disagree for now. We need the Senate to make sure this doesn't happen again. Splitting a ticket in this divisive (and fascist) atmosphere gets NOTHING but the sound of spinning wheels. But I do agree it shouldn't go on forever. Term limits might help. .
1316058608178733056 2020-10-14 00:49:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @pittengineer75 @kasie There is a lot of work to be done to ensure our government is not threatened by another Trump. I'm not sure that this is the moment to have to worry about every shred of legislation being buried. Repubs need to reestablish trust. Vote solid blue ticket this time.
1316057048652615681 2020-10-14 00:43:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @pilukiki Ah! Makes a big difference! 😁
1316056582753525761 2020-10-14 00:41:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RonWaxman @ElieNYC Without the right to choose, women are second class citizens who apparently don't have the brain power to make a better decision for themselves and their families than some stranger. It is saying women require an overlord for guidance.

1316052723482218497 2020-10-14 00:26:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kasie Amen.
1316034234428121091 2020-10-13 23:13:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> What is Durbin up to? So far he's making her case.
1316033481055629313 2020-10-13 23:10:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SenKamalaHarris Not to mention relegating women to 2nd class citizenship. Women do NOT need overlords to school them on what is best for themselves and their families. If Roe goes, that's what happens.
1316030536607989760 2020-10-13 22:58:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KrauseForIowa In the last few days, more than one person I know has wondered if Covid Kim can be impeached. Fat chance with our Legislature. We've got to find ways to hold her accountable.
1316027791624740864 2020-10-13 22:47:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ElieNYC Barrett is nothing but a poison pill.
1316002648924000258 2020-10-13 21:07:36 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JenniferJJacobs @PressSec She apparently doesn't know how lucky she was.
1315843969075609601 2020-10-13 10:37:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @AynRandPaulRyan @MSNBC I'd like to see him back in the Senate but this wouldn't be bad.
1315840758679842817 2020-10-13 10:24:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joncoopertweets Some of the Senate races are uncomfortably close. We need the Senate in order to get real work done. Vote straight Democratic ticket!
1315839176294707200 2020-10-13 10:18:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Where is Barr?
1315834131717255169 2020-10-13 09:57:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Please, if you are voting for Biden vote for a straight Dem ticket. If you don't, we aren't going to be able to get important things accomplished.
1315833375555571713 2020-10-13 09:54:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @uche_blackstock @MSNBC @CNN Horrific! Please, report that to the FBI. I'm so sorry you have to go through this.
1315831725591855104 2020-10-13 09:48:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @grandmagrit Nothing much different as long as covid is a problem BUT I will be hopeful.
1315800896492707840 2020-10-13 07:45:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Hope012015 We don't even know what's going to happen - if it would be possible. There are bigger fish to fry right now.
1315792726454042624 2020-10-13 07:13:26 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RealJamesWoods Don't worry. Dems understand what he means. We don't give a crap about this pseudo-scandal. The Repubs have done plenty of court packing and pretty much no one is going to play this game Repubs are trying to push. I'm all for Court restructuring.
1315749339013230594 2020-10-13 04:21:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @grandmagrit Nope.
1315729738422521858 2020-10-13 03:03:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @B52Malmet @JoeBiden I'm tired of waking up in the morning and before I'm fully conscious feeling that nudge in the back of my brain that something is wrong.
1315727930132180992 2020-10-13 02:55:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @nikikole @ElieNYC It happened nonetheless. This was during a planned traffic stop.  We found out later that others were given warnings for the same thing. ALL were white.
1315726169472368640 2020-10-13 02:48:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Barrett's faith isn't the issue. The issue is that she is perceived as an ideologue - perhaps even Barr in a dress.
1315718128731648003 2020-10-13 02:17:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @hippiemama2002 @ElieNYC Please don't tell me she was "shrill".
1315717062736719873 2020-10-13 02:12:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is the bottom line:
1315716275717496835 2020-10-13 02:09:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I wish the people in the hearing room would just keep their masks on.
1315714376184336386 2020-10-13 02:02:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ElieNYC I worry about my daughters. One of them couldn't find her insurance card immediately during a traffic stop. She asked permission to pull it up on her phone. The cop impounded her car and I had to pick her up and found her sobbing on the street corner.
1315711847597854725 2020-10-13 01:52:03 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Graham isn't wearing a mask.
1315709899180044288 2020-10-13 01:44:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @leahmcelrath I can't eat a lot of things because of a special diet I have to be on. BUT, I've learned to make a very credible lower fat Mac and cheese - the real stuff from the oven. I use zero fat cheese, skimmed milk. I can't have it often but every now and then, it's ambrosia.
1315707410431070208 2020-10-13 01:34:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Repubs don't care that millions of Americans, the majority, feel like they are living through actual hell right now. We are broke, have covid to worry about and have a government in disarray. So what do Repubs do? The make THE issue the Supreme Court. Get out and VOTE.
1315705536382369792 2020-10-13 01:26:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> U don't think the Constitution was meant to be frozen in amber.
1315704663958790145 2020-10-13 01:23:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> It is the job of the PEOPLE to decide social and economic policy and the job of the individuals representing us to convey that information.
1315703943935275013 2020-10-13 01:20:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Call your Senators today and tell them NO confirmation until after the election. 202 224 3121. And please, please vote as soon as you are able.
1315703443454070785 2020-10-13 01:18:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> These Court hearings are setting me on edge. When the Repubs speak I feel like I'm whistling in a graveyard and I want to throw bricks at the TV. Then a Dem speaks and the roller-coaster ride starts all over again. I'm so angry. Our lives as we know them are at stake.
1315694155566395392 2020-10-13 00:41:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I want to watch all of the Barrett hearings but I'm having difficulty being able to stomach Repub opening statements. They are divisive and manipulative.
1315689005699215362 2020-10-13 00:21:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JamesPurefoy That is partially what this election is about. Americans are sick of being manipulated. This is supposed to be a government by the People but Republicans want a government by a ruling class. They are willing to cheat, lie and just do anything to ensure that happens.
1315681555755532288 2020-10-12 23:51:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump Your inattention to covid made the economy crash. It is YOUR FAULT.
1315681227039559680 2020-10-12 23:50:23 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump You bet I'll vote. In fact, I already have voted - for Biden.
1315681047498100741 2020-10-12 23:49:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump Vote Biden!
1315680884524298241 2020-10-12 23:49:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump Which has nothing to do with you.
1315680746623897600 2020-10-12 23:48:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump Will you please, please STOP.
1315679301895938052 2020-10-12 23:42:44 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Let's turn these statistics into reality. Young voters, please, please get to the polls as soon as you can.
1315678054392434691 2020-10-12 23:37:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Gov Reynolds of Iowa is not counting covid cases in schools.   https://t.co/9zjmsAXtVR
1315676807866261504 2020-10-12 23:32:49 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I don't believe it. What does Barrett do when a break is called in the Supreme Court hearings? She takes off her mask.
1315676264884305922 2020-10-12 23:30:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mckaycoppins Definitely. They look like monkey paws and I buy lotion and hydrocortisone in 55 gallon drums but it is necessary.
1315674755429732353 2020-10-12 23:24:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JasonMillerinDC Economists don't think so.
1315673826655600642 2020-10-12 23:20:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Barrett's religion has nothing to do with anything. The problem is she's an ideologue.
1315673467677745153 2020-10-12 23:19:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RBReich I've been participating in politics since Eisenhower ran against Stephenson. I've watched the long slide of the Republican party and this wash-rinse-repeat is completely accurate. Repubs, like everyone else, KNOW that trickle down does not work except for the rich.
1315671790941802499 2020-10-12 23:12:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Amy_Siskind Just made my call to Ernst office. I'm mad as hell.
1315668119839535105 2020-10-12 22:58:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @paulwaldman1 Of course it has to do with Barrett. It indicts the system that wants to put her in place and talks about what we can lose if she gets to the bench.
1315665999404957697 2020-10-12 22:49:52 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MollyMcKew Any Republican.
1315665655144869896 2020-10-12 22:48:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Get on the phone, people. Amy is right.
1315662214313971712 2020-10-12 22:34:50 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @people4kam Adam Schiff?
1315661218061975553 2020-10-12 22:30:52 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I have to turn this shit off for a bit. I can't stomach Cruz.
1315642297518874625 2020-10-12 21:15:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kath_rothschild Morte d' Arthur. I was fascinated by the Arthurian legend and was so motivated at 10 I began to learn Middle English. I wish I'd been THAT motivated in High School!
1315633589858557952 2020-10-12 20:41:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Delavegalaw Traditionally, while the inaugural festivities are going on, the old family is moved out and the new one in. There is or was a White House curator, Lydia Tederick, appointed in 2017 and that is likely where to start if people are concerned.
1315466242845798406 2020-10-12 09:36:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> What kind of country have we become? I do not recognize it.   https://t.co/dM0MfDykim
1315402147937292292 2020-10-12 05:21:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I live in Iowa and frankly would prefer Trump stay away. We have a huge problem with the virus and don't need a big gathering of any kind.  https://t.co/fOXsN4NZOf
1315357459113029636 2020-10-12 02:23:51 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The Right is talented at ignoring the will of the People. We've come to expect it and often just shrug when it happens. This isn't about how the people who represent us feel but how we feel. There needs to be an attitude adjustment. We need to elect people who understand this.
1315355848940679168 2020-10-12 02:17:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PeteButtigieg @Lee_in_Iowa Roe and LGBTQ+ go hand in hand. With both, the Right is attempting to relegate them to 2nd class citizenship. It's as discriminatory as it comes.
1315350627472605184 2020-10-12 01:56:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CapehartJ I'd love to see him gain some experience in Washington. I hope Biden finds a place for him.
1315304669015609347 2020-10-11 22:54:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ArmandoNDK And I believe the majority will support court reforms. A relatively balanced Court makes it less about ideologies and more about the Law.
1315304157163724800 2020-10-11 22:52:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JamesArkin Better than the presidential race in Iowa which is running neck and neck.
1315303800421392387 2020-10-11 22:50:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @sahilkapur Iowans! What the holy hell is wrong with you? You are better than this. I am embarrassed for my state.
1315303279518253056 2020-10-11 22:48:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JonLemire I agree. The Trump administration is entirely too litigious. Nor is the court a place for ideologies. It is about the Law.
1315299727810928640 2020-10-11 22:34:26 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ArmandoNDK A reasonably balanced Supreme Court is preferable to me because it should be about the Law, not ideologies.
1315296708809707521 2020-10-11 22:22:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ericawerner @scottwongDC Trump hasn't got a clue. He's been grasping at straws.
1315294364554465281 2020-10-11 22:13:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kaitlancollins Maybe if these people listened to him they'd hear the answer. The problem is they don't like the answer.
1315292952961449995 2020-10-11 22:07:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @azureeblue @JoshNBCNews No.
1315274682065727491 2020-10-11 20:54:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @GovHowardDean When Trump was first in office, a lot of folks were angry and confused. People were begging to hear from Democratic members of Congress. Nothing but crickets. One of the first people to speak up and offer support was Gov Howard Dean and he's been a reliable voice ever since.
1315269442339651586 2020-10-11 20:34:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Turn these numbers into reality. Vote!
1315269222994411521 2020-10-11 20:33:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PaigeBMacdonald Just shut up.
1315268920824258560 2020-10-11 20:32:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RadioFreeTom I think it is part of it. For example, Southerners who feel their culture is being dismantled. Or, Trumpers who resent being generalized as dumb. Or, Midwestern blue collars who feel they've lost the power and voice the unions once gave them.
1315225020616957954 2020-10-11 17:37:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kendallybrown Jeez. God complex.....
1315222338296840192 2020-10-11 17:26:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @notsolittleold1 @JoshNBCNews 515 281 5211
1315207959035752449 2020-10-11 16:29:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JeffFallick @MollyJongFast Osteopaths receive the same training as MD's.
1315207459963838466 2020-10-11 16:27:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MollyJongFast Trump likes these official looking statements. Remember the controversy in 2016 about Trump's health? Trump appeared on Dr Oz offering two sheets of paper written by Harold Bornstein. Here's an article about it from 2016:  https://t.co/jxALUFRmZM
1315088285035827201 2020-10-11 08:34:14 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ParkerMolloy I'm all for restructuring that includes ending this political cudgel - possibly term limits with each president nominating the same number of judges.
1315074285476642818 2020-10-11 07:38:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KCCINews Definitely not an endorsement I'd want.
1315071253489823745 2020-10-11 07:26:34 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @atrupar Still, masking is a start.
1315070656866856967 2020-10-11 07:24:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Iowans, let's upset his plans. VOTE as soon as possible.
1315070207728156672 2020-10-11 07:22:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PressSec And there's this.
1315069428183248897 2020-10-11 07:19:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PressSec If you want to talk about endorsements there is the following. I'm pretty sure nearly 100% object to a SCOTUS pick rammed through by the Trump regime. I hope Trump is proud of his Taliban endorsement.   https://t.co/D7Q7Fd4xbz
1315067892258365440 2020-10-11 07:13:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PressSec Well, for starters:  https://t.co/kDAwee2ueN
1315065821119549441 2020-10-11 07:04:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PressSec @WhiteHouse Nothing compared to the majority. And you know it.
1315064170719649797 2020-10-11 06:58:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis In my state, covid has invaded 55 senior communities. This infuriates me and breaks my heart at the same time.
1315063508279668736 2020-10-11 06:55:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Amy_Siskind These people are putting their families, friends and neighbors all at risk. Stupid and tragic.
1315033054537187334 2020-10-11 04:54:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @WHO13news Absolutely no! We have enough covid circulating around.

1315025388599468033 2020-10-11 04:24:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I wish Trumpers would understand that the 2nd Amendment isn't the issue - only measures to ensure responsibility.
1315021162074779648 2020-10-11 04:07:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Iowans, every time Covid Kim refuses to take covid seriously, we get angry but then sit back and let her get by with it. We have to apply pressure. Start by calling her office on Monday and telling her we don't want the damn Trump rally in Des Moines. 515 281-5211.
1315019895936094209 2020-10-11 04:02:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JoshNBCNews Covid Kim, the Governor of Iowa should stop any rally in Des Moines, Iowa where the virus is surging. But she won't. Iowans, we have to let her know we don't want this rally. Call her office on Monday. We can't keep letting her ignore us!
1315017515710504962 2020-10-11 03:53:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @smbwalker64 @JoeBiden And why would that matter?
1315016752787578882 2020-10-11 03:50:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Biden_Army @JoeBiden Once Trump has been defeated, the press has to stop giving whatever craziness he spouts any oxygen. He's had enough attention.
1314998822557319168 2020-10-11 02:38:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @brianneDMR She's 5 down in the polls. She isn't being nice.
1314998398379057154 2020-10-11 02:37:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @W_MarkFelt @realDonaldTrump That he did.
1314989494467166209 2020-10-11 02:01:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CharlesMBlow Seeing those people piling in just hurts. Badly.
1314984652436910080 2020-10-11 01:42:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JakeSherman No more Trumpy drama. Please!!
1314984061488816129 2020-10-11 01:40:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Anyone hear any more about the resignation rumor?

1314974292975779840 2020-10-11 01:01:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ARBryant4 Toast. Cereal. Tuna sandwich.
1314973992692875265 2020-10-11 01:00:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joncoopertweets More like Borderline?
1314967404208951297 2020-10-11 00:33:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @nytimes @JuddApatow I'm tired of women who dislike toxic masculinity being called "man haters". Some misogynistic jerk carrying a rifle and wearing a MAGA hat is not going to "get the chicks".
1314965602331656195 2020-10-11 00:26:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @duty2warn Just something that wandered through my mind: if Trump were to seriously consider starting a TV station (if someone fronts him the money) under what circumstances could he be denied a license? There are more important things to do right now and I'm filing this away for later...
1314964405629710337 2020-10-11 00:21:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DMRegister There is absolutely no excuse to let this continue unchecked. Once the election is over,, I think Iowans need to have a serious discussion about removing Covid Kim from office.
1314963604001771521 2020-10-11 00:18:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @stucam7771 @darionavarro111 "Socialism" became a bad word because of Communism &amp; McCarthy. We've never gotten over it. If you ask most people what Socialism is, they don't know. In their minds, Socialism = Communism. They don't understand that forms of Socialism have existed in the US from the beginning.
1314961813776330753 2020-10-11 00:11:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @therealzanetta @nicolejames Kamala is class all the way.
1314961395293794307 2020-10-11 00:10:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @YouGiveMeFever7 @glennkirschner2 I guess little will surprise me but I also wonder if that huge ego will let go of control.
1314960966271066120 2020-10-11 00:08:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> IMO Conservatism has become a political theory that is contrary to the realities most people live with. When theory overrides needs of the People it's unworkable. It's lots of fun to argue the differences but no fun living it.
1314946399222591489 2020-10-10 23:10:26 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Do not forget this. Someone's Messiah Complex is showing.  https://t.co/tcW4I5gqZR

1314920223338835969 2020-10-10 21:26:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Ya think?  https://t.co/C25dRoi68V
1314853261619474432 2020-10-10 17:00:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CNNPolitics Ignore. They're just trying to distract and we've got far more important things to do. So, Let's stop talking about it.
1314844540201832448 2020-10-10 16:25:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Acyn That's the whole point. Conservative politics is one thing but Donald Trump is something else entirely. Trumpism is a mental disorder.
1314833796244688896 2020-10-10 15:43:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @djrothkopf @SenFeinstein @SenatorLeahy Aren't the hearings in person or remote optional? Anyone in person should be required to be tested!
1314726622323408897 2020-10-10 08:37:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PolitcalCapitaI And doing it on Conservative radio and TV.
1314726279468535814 2020-10-10 08:35:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joncoopertweets This is just flat out cruel and evil. I wish Trump fans could understand he doesn't care who he kills be they Trump fans or Biden supporters. If you are in his way he doesn't hesitate.
1314725267663982592 2020-10-10 08:31:44 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mschlapp It isn't "hate". It's anger and frustration. The cheating and lying is exhausting.
1314724381906685954 2020-10-10 08:28:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis @AdamParkhomenko Thanks.
1314724080365506576 2020-10-10 08:27:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I hope everyone at the Judiciary hearing for Barrett is properly tested, not just run past a thermometer.
1314723547785433098 2020-10-10 08:24:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NBCNews @CNBC And SCOTUS nominee should be after inauguration in January.

1314706943978676224 2020-10-10 07:18:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SimonWDC Barrett.
1314706186428702722 2020-10-10 07:15:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @latimes I think Trump will try to schedule an event on the same night as Biden has one so he can brag about beating Biden in the ratings.
1314702302343761920 2020-10-10 07:00:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @democraticbear They don't want to screw up getting Barrett on the bench.
1314682857428844545 2020-10-10 05:43:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @zietray This is the kind of thinking that got us Trump. That is a mistaken impression. In fact, that is exactly the kind of nonsense enemies of our country might spread to skew votes to Trump. What you actually did was vote for Trump.
1314680798675689474 2020-10-10 05:35:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @maggieNYT Frankly, I wouldn't go near the place.
1314677372197711872 2020-10-10 05:21:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Now that Trump has had covid I would think that at least a FEW Trumpers would wake up. I'm not seeing it and I'm not surprised. The bullsh*t is strong with them.
1314674783087456256 2020-10-10 05:11:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MelissaJPeltier Bon voyage. Enjoy.

1314669910874886146 2020-10-10 04:51:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kylegriffin1 A rally at the White House? Disgusting! He has no right to use OUR White House as a backdrop for his maskless superspread event.

1314617398453039105 2020-10-10 01:23:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @markknoller Like he gives a sh*t about others. What does he expect in return. I assume right now it's votes.
1314617052146077697 2020-10-10 01:21:44 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @brianstelter He won't be able to stand not having constant media attention so I expect TV or radio. Someone else will foot the bill to get it going. He's too broke. I hope that is something the FBI will keep an eye on.
1314596454015684608 2020-10-09 23:59:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @arawnsley There is an area of my town that's been that kind of bellwether for me. 2015: 99.9% Trump. This year, the complete opposite. Interestingly, it is a very wealthy area.
1314595023174995969 2020-10-09 23:54:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Lee_in_Iowa That's been a problem among the Trump Regime's judicial picks. They pick ideologues over the qualified.
1314589539613237249 2020-10-09 23:32:24 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @thedailybeast Utterly ridiculous!
1314587158536245248 2020-10-09 23:22:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CTerp23 @nytimes I'm quite aware. It just hurts.
1314577855511224321 2020-10-09 22:45:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Did Pence go back to DC because he thought the 25th was going to be invoked, is he sick? We need to know if there is danger to Kamala.
1314573326791118849 2020-10-09 22:27:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @wahlstedt007 I've barely slept in 4 years.

1314534888045973505 2020-10-09 19:55:14 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JaxAlemany McConnell already inserted a little wiggle room between himself and Trump by criticizing the way Trump handled covid at the White House.
1314531139068088325 2020-10-09 19:40:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KeithOlbermann The media gave him all kinds of free air time in 2015 because he was amusing. Look how that turned out. The media will need to quit making his antics news. As far as I'm concerned, after he's out of the WH he's irrelevant. He's had enough attention.
1314529901907791872 2020-10-09 19:35:26 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kathrynw5 Barrett isn't even sitting on the court yet so the discussion is moot. Why take up oxygen when the number one priority is the election?
1314390470336929797 2020-10-09 10:21:22 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TeaPainUSA Well, ladies. Who doesn't want a piece of THIS?
1314389096060588033 2020-10-09 10:15:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis And he short sheeted the money he promised to send to Puerto Rico.
1314387596588601349 2020-10-09 10:09:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @markknoller @seanhannity He needs to produce proof but of course, he won't.
1314387225916866562 2020-10-09 10:08:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ElieNYC @mattkatz00 Were's Barr?
1314386992063565824 2020-10-09 10:07:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chipfranklin Yes, please! It would be a big relief.
1314324998983741440 2020-10-09 06:01:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @abbydphillip Because of Pelosi's statement about a discussion on the 25th Amendment tomorrow?
1314301695376138263 2020-10-09 04:28:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> We aren't hearing anything about Barr or Christie.
1314299268304379914 2020-10-09 04:18:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @jonkarl Sure it does. Especially since Barrett isn't even on the bench yet.

1314285022451564556 2020-10-09 03:22:22 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kaitlancollins Cover up.
1314284762450681857 2020-10-09 03:21:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kevincorke I believe that's because he knows it's bullsh*t, Spanky...
1314283269928747010 2020-10-09 03:15:24 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PuestoLoco @glennkirschner2 @greensnow I'll holler about it all. No matter what way you come at it, this is about control.
1314257920708706307 2020-10-09 01:34:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @jordainc Hmm. What's next? Will McConnell further socially distance and deny knowing anyone by the name of Trump? With McConnell, loyalty to Trump was nonexistent. Trump was a convenient coattail. Is this the first crack? Seriously, KY. Get rid of McConnell.
1314255983229784064 2020-10-09 01:26:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Make this a reality. Vote as soon as you possibly can!!!
1314253255204012035 2020-10-09 01:16:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TopherSpiro @Lee_in_Iowa And Iowa. 1500 new cases reported since yesterday. Iowa is in a Red Zone.
1314252387155087360 2020-10-09 01:12:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Harlan Any more questions on why the Right wants to destroy Roe? It's about control. They want women to go back to being 2nd class citizens who are regarded as not smart enough to make decisions for themselves and their families. The poor little dears require supervision...

I want them packed into impenetrable bubbles to protect them. (I wish!) Trump will do ANYTHING to win and I honestly feel they can't be trusted not to do harm.
1314241890963910656 2020-10-09 00:30:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ProjectLincoln Turn poll numbers into reality. VOTE!

1314224060553998341 2020-10-08 23:20:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> A huge issue that needs to be addressed is establishing without a doubt a president is not above the law and creating new ways to hold a president accountable. You can drive a truck through the holes in the impeachment process. I just don't want anyone to forget about this.
1314222158265102336 2020-10-08 23:12:34 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This issue of NDA's in government needs to be discussed and parameters established for the future. There's too much room for abuse.   https://t.co/dcX0yYzU3T
1314220803605528578 2020-10-08 23:07:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is Iowa, folks. 1500 new cases of covid reported since yesterday. The Governor, popularly known as Covid Kim, still refuses to issue a mask ordinance. She, obviously, is a Trumper and it shows. She does little other than step over the bodies.  https://t.co/TVAMS0yfIV
1314219126592864257 2020-10-08 23:00:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @marcorubio Trump lied. Then he kept lying. Then he caught the disease and lied some more. Talk about malpractice! I've barely seen another human since last April because of it and because I'm a senior have been told I'm expendable. This is personal to every single person in this country!
1314098510577438720 2020-10-08 15:01:14 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek As VP, she supports Biden's plans, not necessary all of her own.
1314048998270005248 2020-10-08 11:44:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I wonder who gets first interview with the fly?
1314047086225174530 2020-10-08 11:36:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ChuckGrassley I disagree and his wife wouldn't let him.
1314044287668150273 2020-10-08 11:25:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SethAbramson And she did it backward and in heels.
1314038921886564353 2020-10-08 11:04:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Pence's wife isn't wearing a damn mask!!!!!
1314036666672259073 2020-10-08 10:55:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @glennkirschner2 Slimy, smug and stiff
1314033421551886343 2020-10-08 10:42:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I value the Supreme Court and I don't want the Trump regime anywhere near it.
1314032443469504513 2020-10-08 10:38:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JRubinBlogger It is awful that we feel can't trust members of the Trump regime not to spread covid.
1314031211304583169 2020-10-08 10:33:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Let's see if Pence answers the abortion question.
1314028150498750464 2020-10-08 10:21:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ACLU It's a whole lot more than that. Without Roe, women become 2nd class citizens who apparently don't have enough brains to make decisions about themselves and their families without an overlord to tell them how to live. It is about control and as discriminatory as it gets.
1314026559322427392 2020-10-08 10:15:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @C0rporateMerica @0rf What does that mean?
1314026408587464706 2020-10-08 10:14:43 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @C0rporateMerica @0rf Your damn right they've been targeted. That kind of division is encouraged. It's naive to think otherwise.
1314024759064178690 2020-10-08 10:08:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @C0rporateMerica @0rf What I meant is that it wasn't policies that stopped Bernie. There were several big reasons. Honestly, I'm not panning Bernie. I'm concerned how some of his followers have reacted and then bad people encouraged it.
1314021991536525313 2020-10-08 09:57:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @C0rporateMerica @0rf From Socialist to Democrat to Socialist to Democrat. That turned some folks off. I like Bernie but I hate the message that the answer is to vote third party or not at all. Bernie supporters are targeted by bad actors for that very reason and I think that hurt his message.
1313999779316346880 2020-10-08 08:28:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> True! So let's turn them into reality. Vote!
1313996885779193857 2020-10-08 08:17:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @LauraRBelin @IAGovernor I've had it with her playing with people's lives.
1313993203855560705 2020-10-08 08:02:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @C0rporateMerica @0rf It wasn't about policies. Bernie burned his bridges by switching affiliations, switching back and switching again. At least that was part of it. Fewer trusted him. And to my knowledge, he didn't poll as well as Biden against Trump.
1313987699305590784 2020-10-08 07:40:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @C0rporateMerica @0rf Sorry. No. All they were trying to do is build a coalition that would attract crossover voters. There's no plot here about Progressives.
1313987175915061249 2020-10-08 07:38:50 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @0rf This is insanely stupid. Do you want to get some of what you want or nothing? Because voting third party is a vote for Trump. Are you so young you didn't see what happened in 2016 or are you a Russian stooge? Idiotic!!!!
1313983507224551424 2020-10-08 07:24:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @waltshaub Pence makes me feel like I've been sprayed with smarm.
1313982819425804288 2020-10-08 07:21:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KrauseForIowa He misses a fine point. People who successfully shoot from the hip are prepared.
1313966446188396545 2020-10-08 06:16:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis I've been wondering about Barr. A FOX report says he will be back to work soon but *shrug*... We know less about him than Christie. Have I missed something?
1313965297179791363 2020-10-08 06:11:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Emobunneh2 @NewsFallon @tedlieu Aw! Thank you.
1313964687600558080 2020-10-08 06:09:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @HenryJGomez @mommydog67 Is he putting everything into fighting the election? Lawyers are expensive.
1313918233125236736 2020-10-08 03:04:52 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @markknoller @BMorgenstern45 I'd rather he'd stay in the residence. It's too risky for others in the WH.
1313916556703924224 2020-10-08 02:58:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Make this a reality. Vote!
1313878397639176194 2020-10-08 00:26:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NewsFallon @tedlieu I don't live in any kind of retirement facility. However, I am a senior and couldn't get a test when I had symptoms. I then felt like hell for about a month but have gotten much better.
1313876581853597698 2020-10-08 00:19:22 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Green_Footballs @Lee_in_Iowa There's only one thing to do if we want to turn those figures into reality. Vote.
1313873235570823169 2020-10-08 00:06:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @imillhiser Leaving the court with Right leaning ideologues without imposing a check is like leaving a foot in the door for extremist R operatives to sneak back in. That's a danger to the Republic, as we have learned the hard way in the last 4 years.
1313871201434034179 2020-10-07 23:57:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Women do not require an overlord to tell them how to live. Without Roe, women become 2nd class citizens. This is more about control than anything else. (3/3)
1313871200347709446 2020-10-07 23:57:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> decorating window shades is a whole lot different than having a place at the table that determines the direction of the church. Roe is about a lot more than reproductive rights. Women are adults with a brain, capable of making decisions for themselves and their families. (2/3)
1313871199382974464 2020-10-07 23:57:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Another trope is "women are equal but different" from men. My church uses this concept to this day and that's why I left. Running a women's organization that has guest speakers talking about (1/3)
1313867674401812480 2020-10-07 23:43:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @jrovner So. Seniors are expendable again. Hard for me not to take that personally being that I'm a senior.
1313866921843077120 2020-10-07 23:40:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joncoopertweets Turn these numbers into reality. VOTE.
1313866257343672325 2020-10-07 23:38:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PoliticusSarah @politicususa Fascism is an aberration of far Right politics, not Left.
1313865333078396928 2020-10-07 23:34:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The polls look good. But, we now must make them a reality by voting. Vote a straight Democratic ticket in order to save the Senate. We can't stand 4 more years of McConnell, either. #savethesenate
1313860632781950983 2020-10-07 23:15:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TheRickyDavila Duh!
1313860499222728707 2020-10-07 23:15:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mkraju Trump is manic. He shouldn't be in charge.
1313859091425525763 2020-10-07 23:09:52 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SenFeinstein The thing that upsets me the most is that Trump and the Republican party completely ignore the will of the People.
1313857991351861248 2020-10-07 23:05:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @_redsiren_ @BarnettforAZ @realDonaldTrump Simply, no arrests. No plot. You are a victim of Russian based disinformation.
1313856796461854721 2020-10-07 23:00:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Ok. I just got my question answered about Barr in this FOX piece about the ISIS Beatles. Barr is expected back to work soon. Of course, being that this is FOX that info is in the "remains to be seen" file.  https://t.co/9DIOWsSSN9
1313854639796899841 2020-10-07 22:52:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @BuzzPatterson Not happening. I have to wonder that if this is the issue Wray is going to talk about today.
1313853880883720192 2020-10-07 22:49:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> There is no Obamagate.

1313851781370253317 2020-10-07 22:40:49 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @_redsiren_ @BarnettforAZ @realDonaldTrump It simply isn't going to happen - not because it will somehow be foiled by the "evil left" but because it is straight up nonsense. You've been conned.
1313845334058074114 2020-10-07 22:15:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Bill Barr is silent. Anyone know his condition? It's a big deal. This isn't rhetorical. I want to know. As of 2 or 3 days ago he was isolating but that's the last I heard.
1313839628911288320 2020-10-07 21:52:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Where is Barr and what condition is he in?
1313838609800269824 2020-10-07 21:48:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PeterAlexander The superjerk needs to keep his ass put in the residence. I don't give a sh*t what he "wants".

1313813257220653056 2020-10-07 20:07:44 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @waltshaub @darionavarro111 A Supreme Court loaded with ideologues just defeats any kind of real political repair. It is a foot in the door for a return of right wing shenanigans.
1313812222746005506 2020-10-07 20:03:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CarlosLozadaWP @ktumulty The period of time necessary to repair America is going to be interesting. There will have to be some innovative legislation. I don't think it can be done with a Supreme Court loaded with ideologues. It just keeps a foot in the door for more Repub shenanigans.
1313804343825567749 2020-10-07 19:32:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek Trump shouldn't be trusted under any circumstances on anything and especially this. Do a remote debate.
1313802601201389569 2020-10-07 19:25:24 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Before you get too concerned, consider that this news comes via the Tucker Carlson show on FOX.
1313799810315628548 2020-10-07 19:14:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kasie @MSNBC @WayTooEarly You saw yesterday, right?
1313669833024843776 2020-10-07 10:37:49 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump And you will be hated for it.
1313669566820757504 2020-10-07 10:36:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump Like he cares...
1313669461078147072 2020-10-07 10:36:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump @SteveFDA Vaccines aren't political because covid should not be political and used to divide the American People.
1313669101689212930 2020-10-07 10:34:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump Your own intelligence services say you are wrong. Your behavior over the last 4 years prove you are compromised and should not be in the White House.
1313668407544426502 2020-10-07 10:32:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TMcErskine @kylegriffin1 @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump He knows better. He's just become Trump's lackey so he's going to lie.
1313667903800082434 2020-10-07 10:30:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @johncardillo @realDonaldTrump Obama was a good and great man. You are trying to steal an election and may be high on steroids.
1313667636341944320 2020-10-07 10:29:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @FDRLST @realDonaldTrump @CBedfordDC @johnddavidson The Federalist? Seriously?
1313667199987572741 2020-10-07 10:27:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump Bullsh*t. Clerical errors, printing errors, etc. aren't  corruption. However, trying to say so to steal an election is.
1313665292954931200 2020-10-07 10:19:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @grandmagrit It jumped species.
1313665001459249152 2020-10-07 10:18:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @grandmagrit Brilliant.
1313664207825571842 2020-10-07 10:15:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @samstein It's difficult to make sense of it, though he has already begun his reversal on the stimulus. The man is flying. He should turn things over to Pence while on the 'roids but I doubt his ego will let him.
1313642216485683205 2020-10-07 08:48:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JoelMartinRubin I agree but damn...

1313638603621314560 2020-10-07 08:33:43 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Where's Barr? Last I knew he was self-quarantining as of 2 days ago. If he is sick I'm betting they'd try to keep it secret. Anyone know what's up with him?
1313638139894824962 2020-10-07 08:31:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @HunterJCullen @ShawnM220 Barr was self-quarantining as of 2 days ago.
1313567530217242624 2020-10-07 03:51:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Enough. Pence must take over the reigns of government.
1313566615854878726 2020-10-07 03:47:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @sahilkapur It is insane.

1313564731828035586 2020-10-07 03:40:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is even more reason to stop this son-of-a-b*tch. Are you getting NOW, trumpers? He doesn't give a sh*t about you, either. This is just plain DUMB.   https://t.co/ylEbTLQjn3
1313550757451517953 2020-10-07 02:44:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @tribelaw Pence just flipped and rejected plexiglass.
1313550523996532742 2020-10-07 02:43:44 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DrEricDing I don't care if Kamala debates Pence. I want her safe. I do NOT trust Pence.
1313546450857533442 2020-10-07 02:27:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> There is absolutely NO reason for Trump's hand picked electors. This is only an attempt by Trump to steal the election. VOTE so the results speak for themselves.
1313541957038288896 2020-10-07 02:09:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> 🚨🚨🚨🚨

1313538595785932800 2020-10-07 01:56:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is disappointing. They are holding the movie an entire year! I was hoping for a PPV or streaming release around Christmas.  https://t.co/AZr9V7Bsif

1313534076637392910 2020-10-07 01:38:22 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @tracy_walder @nadabakos I've had it with Barrett. I didn't bust my ass in the 70's for THIS. Truth which this woman hasn't figured out yet: this isn't about embryos or fetuses to people at the top. This is about control.
1313531773830262785 2020-10-07 01:29:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @OlgaNYC1211 Do Trump and Putin have a standing date we are unaware of?

1313529526727606272 2020-10-07 01:20:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @jimsciutto @CNNValencia Trump is hiding something. I think it is probably that he doesn't want anyone to know he was infected at the debate.

1313498550052040707 2020-10-06 23:17:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Turn these numbers into reality by voting.
1313494994859307009 2020-10-06 23:03:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The Governor of Iowa, popularly known as Covid Kim, is a Trump clone and this is a result.  https://t.co/AlIB2HNtpr
1313462797838188544 2020-10-06 20:55:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This isn't real until we vote and make it real. Still, wowza!
1313461996394864640 2020-10-06 20:51:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SimonWDC Sociopathic narcissist. I know that's more of a definition...

1313312287176843264 2020-10-06 10:57:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ananavarro He's wearing makeup, too. I doubt he did that himself.
1313304726298071040 2020-10-06 10:27:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Lying doesn't make it so. NBC/WSJ has Trump down by 14.
1313275921135267841 2020-10-06 08:32:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @bariweiss @HotlineJosh Incredible selfishness. What about the people nearby that aren't immune?
1313274567419404289 2020-10-06 08:27:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ElizLanders @POTUS His immunity isn't the problem. He's contagious and spreading coronavirus around.
1313260505251942403 2020-10-06 07:31:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SpiroAgnewGhost @lauferlaw He looks like an assh*le.

1313259417853403137 2020-10-06 07:26:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CNN Definition of "batshit crazy".
1313256337166528512 2020-10-06 07:14:44 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Acosta He's wearing make-up.
1313253958744408065 2020-10-06 07:05:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @AdamParkhomenko He is still contagious. He should be arrested for purposely endangering others. I expected it.
1313250965680783360 2020-10-06 06:53:23 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @AFarr01 @CIAspygirl @ericgarland It isn't just our bodies. Removing Roe says we don't have the brains to think for ourselves and require men to provide guidance as to how to live our lives.
1313250100152594433 2020-10-06 06:49:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @rmayemsinger Anyone with active covid should be held responsible for breaking quarantine.
1313244134086455297 2020-10-06 06:26:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KrauseForIowa @CDCgov Trump doesn't want anyone to know when he got sick.
1313217508304990209 2020-10-06 04:40:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mkraju Not good enough. Is he still positive for virus?
1313217119824293889 2020-10-06 04:38:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TeaPainUSA The issue is will he abide by the rules when he gets there? He won't.
1313203611736911872 2020-10-06 03:45:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Again, Trump has escaped consequences.
1313201629282394112 2020-10-06 03:37:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> As usual, the medical update for Trump stunk to high heaven.
1313200797539332098 2020-10-06 03:34:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> For the safety of the people who work at the White House and their families, shut the place down until he is clear of the virus.
1313199259601317888 2020-10-06 03:27:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The doctor doesn't know Trump's viral load???
1313198992063332353 2020-10-06 03:26:52 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The doctors are ALLOWING Trump to work in the Oval and we don't know if he is still contagious.
1313198671211704321 2020-10-06 03:25:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> From what I understand, the steroid prolongs contagion.
1313197820648849413 2020-10-06 03:22:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The press needs to ask about his viral load.
1313197365176737792 2020-10-06 03:20:24 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NatashaBertrand Right. Sure. He won't abide by rules. Look for him to hold a rally while he is still contagious.
1313197073571942400 2020-10-06 03:19:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Don't believe on word that comes out of Trump's oral sphincter. Wear a MASK. Protect your family and others around you.
1313196228780462080 2020-10-06 03:15:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> If one more of Trump's medical team talk about what an honor it is to be on the team I will puke. A lot. So Stepford!
1313195386308362241 2020-10-06 03:12:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kimmurphy100 @Lee_in_Iowa @ACLU And call the damn police. This is illegal.
1313194674421665792 2020-10-06 03:09:43 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ACLU This goes hand in hand with Roe. This is another attempt to relegate a group of people to second class citizenship. Apparently the power hungry straight white males feel women and gay people require the guidance of an overlord to be told how to live..
1313193262333730823 2020-10-06 03:04:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TheDailyEdge I don't think so. Look at all the people testing + at the White House.
1313192651257188352 2020-10-06 03:01:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Yamiche @darionavarro111 Wow. That isn't tone def. That's psychologically dead.
1313190779993706498 2020-10-06 02:54:14 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump He learned NOTHING from having covid. He doesn't even understand he is still in jeopardy.
1313189844861018116 2020-10-06 02:50:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump DO NOT fall for this. It is illegal. You could be held responsible.
1313189445320011776 2020-10-06 02:48:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump At least 14 in the WH have tested positive for covid. This is the DUMBEST decision I've ever heard. You had best stick to the residence until you are given the all clear from being contagious - perhaps another 13 days or so. No trips into the Oval. No superspreader rallies!
1313188280792473602 2020-10-06 02:44:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @lindsaywise @esaagar @JohnCornyn The man denied the entire pandemic and politicized it in order with win an election to save his ass from prosecution. That's not over one's skis. That's malevolence.
1313187237874544642 2020-10-06 02:40:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Susan_Hennessey If Biden becomes president, I think all these reckless assh*les need to be held accountable if they purposefully expose others.
1313186742044950530 2020-10-06 02:38:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TheRickWilson And he could because of the recklessness of Donald Trump.

1313183694157381634 2020-10-06 02:26:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TheoKeith Is there nothing we can do to prevent these assh*les from purposefully spreading the virus? They are even killing themselves to keep Trump in office. That is insane!
1313182586529865729 2020-10-06 02:21:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @GeorgeTakei It's all about straight white male power. This goes hand in hand with Roe. Women and gay people are being relegated to second class citizenship once again. We apparently need overlords to tell us how to live. I'm livid. We didn't fight our asses off in the 70's for THIS.
1313181292343820291 2020-10-06 02:16:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SadieSiamese @atrupar @ErinMPerrine Poor argument. What if Biden gets sick? The issues are negligence and lying.
1313181058335154176 2020-10-06 02:15:36 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @atrupar @ErinMPerrine Idiotic. Biden understands what is at risk far better than Trump.
1313180624681828352 2020-10-06 02:13:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> If Trump comes out of isolation while he is still contagious he should be put on psychiatric hold.
1313178108330115073 2020-10-06 02:03:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> 🚨🚨🚨🚨
1313177484142276610 2020-10-06 02:01:24 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Olivianuzzi @ErinMPerrine The only way I'd even faintly believe this is if Trump has a major epiphany, presents a plan to fight covid and issues a mask mandate with penalties. That's obviously not going to happen.
1313175996485468166 2020-10-06 01:55:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @rossgarber At this point we need to "overreact" to save the economy. The economy will sputter along as long as the virus is not under control.
1313175494683242496 2020-10-06 01:53:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @biannagolodryga They claim they will wheel the sick in to vote. Is there no consequence for someone shedding virus purposefully spreading it?
1313174805592633348 2020-10-06 01:50:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KCCINews Covid Kim strikes again.
1313173946137800704 2020-10-06 01:47:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Good news but means nothing unless it corresponds to votes!!
1313173194191314944 2020-10-06 01:44:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MarkHertling LOVE it.
1313172794876846081 2020-10-06 01:42:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mmpadellan I would prefer a plexiglass divider be added.
1313172627620605955 2020-10-06 01:42:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek Thank God. Seems to me he understands the situation far better than Trump.
1313172291409326080 2020-10-06 01:40:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @democraticbear He won't have any regard for people in the WH. Then he will go further and try to hold a rally while still contagious.
1313171821546606597 2020-10-06 01:38:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @matthewjdowd Infinitely. I'm furious.
1313159102172991496 2020-10-06 00:48:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CharlesMBlow Awful. My heart goes out to you and your family.
1313158557194432512 2020-10-06 00:46:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Delavegalaw Not such a great argument. What if Biden gets sick? The issues are negligence and lies.
1313158233691951106 2020-10-06 00:44:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mjs_DC This is all about power. If you aren't white, make and straight you are a threat and have no place at the table. Reversing Roe means women require supervision. This goes hand in hand with Roe.
1313147903741919232 2020-10-06 00:03:52 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @glennkirschner2 He isn't going to isolate. He'll leave the residence in the WH and expose people there to the virus. Then, he'll try to hold rallies while still capable of spreading the virus.
1313145970146840577 2020-10-05 23:56:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TrueFactsStated Nope. I miss it, too. I will, however, pay a bit more than usual for a TV release or PPV of something I really want to see - but not ridiculously so.
1313144342379474945 2020-10-05 23:49:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Just saw a clip in which a masked Biden fist bumped someone. Someone please remind him to cut that shit out and stay further back from people. He genuinely likes people so I'm sure it is difficult for him but he can't take chances. He is too important.
1313138910009139206 2020-10-05 23:28:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @BCDreyer @brianklaas I'm a senior and couldn't get tested when I had symptoms.
1313137443277811713 2020-10-05 23:22:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @funder And he's campaigning on an account meant for emergencies. I'm seeing his tweets and I don't follow him.
1313137097826619392 2020-10-05 23:20:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I don't care who Trump thinks he is but if he starts trying to hold rallies while he is infectious he should be contained in a padded cell. Same applies if he tries to leave the residence in the WH.
1313131334878060544 2020-10-05 22:58:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chrislhayes Can't anyone get the bastard off my timeline? He's campaigning on the account meant for important messages.
1313113128985661441 2020-10-05 21:45:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Trump's mental state obviously isn't being monitored properly. He's manic again. Is this being caused by the medications?
1313111992220094464 2020-10-05 21:41:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @maggieNYT It's not safe for this fool to be let loose on the WH. He obviously will do whatever he wants with no regard for others. The people who work in the WH won't be safe as long as he's contagious.
1313061397950066689 2020-10-05 18:20:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CNN Obviously he can't follow doctor's orders. It is unsafe to return him to the White House where he will expose others to the virus.
1312967240631955457 2020-10-05 12:05:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JamieFord @macley I don't think he should be allowed to go back to the WH until virus free. Obviously he has no scruples about infecting others or following doctors orders. He would endanger others working in the building.
1312956618024333312 2020-10-05 11:23:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JesseLehrich @nytimes Cagey? That's nonsense. Biden has been releasing his test results. That headline is journalistic malpractice. This is the sort of thing that gives the press a bad name.
1312955253717958656 2020-10-05 11:18:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kaitlancollins And Trump and the GOP are trying to kill protection for preexisting conditions and the ACA.
1312954428035674114 2020-10-05 11:15:03 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KrauseForIowa I don't think he should be allowed to go back to the WH. Obviously he can't be trusted not to endanger himself or others. He won't pay attention to his doctor's orders and it wouldn't be safe for others who work there.
1312953215302991877 2020-10-05 11:10:14 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Yamiche That expression doesn't exactly give me the warm fuzzies. I think he's trying to look strong. He just looks like an assh*le.
1312917251029446656 2020-10-05 08:47:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mccarthyryanj I'm so sorry about your mom. Thank you for telling us about this.
1312913965261914114 2020-10-05 08:34:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Trump shouldn't go back to the WH until he is virus free. He can't be trusted to do the right things to keep others in the building safe.
1312909424734896128 2020-10-05 08:16:14 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @bessbell @Scout_Finch DO's are as legit as MD's. My hospital has both and there is no discrimination between them.
1312908847825268742 2020-10-05 08:13:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Yamiche This was ridiculous and irresponsible.
1312906038547447809 2020-10-05 08:02:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Trump should not go back to the White House. He won't do as he's told and is a danger to everyone there.
1312890531031244806 2020-10-05 07:01:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis Poor argument. If Biden gets sick, he couldn't protect himself either - even if it was Trump who made him sick. The issues are negligence and lying.
1312888706605481985 2020-10-05 06:53:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chrislhayes I couldn't even get a test and I'm a senior.
1312877525916438531 2020-10-05 06:09:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis Someone from his medical team better start start talking. How could this joy ride have happened?
1312871008802660354 2020-10-05 05:43:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis Inexcusable! This is extremely bad judgment. Could his covid drugs be having an effect on him?
1312821593593217031 2020-10-05 02:27:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MSNBC @Yamiche Terrible argument. If Biden gets sick - even if it was Trump who made him sick - he couldn't protect himself, either. The issues here are negligence and lies on Trump's part.
1312819270888361990 2020-10-05 02:17:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Any word on a Biden retest?
1312817125812248577 2020-10-05 02:09:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @K_JeanPierre Please, please, please!!
1312816485870514179 2020-10-05 02:06:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Trump isn't tweeting. If he was bored, I would expect he would be.
1312815685182074881 2020-10-05 02:03:44 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @tribelaw What would happen if Trump signed over to Ivanka?
1312813058100727815 2020-10-05 01:53:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Amy_Siskind And Biden! I'm really stressed about Biden's tests.
1312811679026237441 2020-10-05 01:47:49 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JenniferJJacobs @SpeakerPelosi @margbrennan Inexcusable! If he dies, is there a plot to keep it secret? I wouldn't put anything past the GOP.
1312811247306448897 2020-10-05 01:46:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @tribelaw So far, he hasn't tweeted in about 15 hours. If he was feeling that terrific, I bet boredom would have him clicking away on his phone.
1312810413181095936 2020-10-05 01:42:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Lovely to have good news BUT this means less than nothing if we don't vote. Please, please vote as soon as you can!
1312809537771122689 2020-10-05 01:39:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @robreiner Please. His doctor is a DO. They are well trained and completely legit. The issue is that this particular doctor is another Trump lackey.
1312808802627063808 2020-10-05 01:36:24 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mmpadellan @Yamiche And he hasn't gotten a positive bump so far.
1312785596461592576 2020-10-05 00:04:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mmpadellan That's about when concern starts about the cytokine storm so I don't understand this at all.
1312783781137461251 2020-10-04 23:56:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis Trump could be bullying them.
1312783444267728897 2020-10-04 23:55:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Acosta Trump has learned NOTHING from being sick with covid. I didn't expect that he would.

1312773963618095110 2020-10-04 23:17:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MSNBC @Yamiche Terrible argument. If Biden gets sick, he could not protect himself, either - even if the infection came from Trump. The issues are Trump's negligence and lies.
1312773376340037634 2020-10-04 23:15:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @GeorgeTakei Biden wears a mask to protect himself and others as well as to set an example. Amazing how Repubs always find the most belittling word in the Thesaurus. I'm tired of spin. I'm tired of chaos. I'm sick of Trump, his minions and his "fans". Please VOTE as soon as you can!
1312771643782164480 2020-10-04 23:08:44 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MauriceMichael I had symptoms and couldn't get tested. I'm a senior. Of course, I'm in Iowa and the covid situation here is exceptionally screwed up thanks to Covid Kim, our Repub governor.

1312768604711071744 2020-10-04 22:56:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MauriceMichael Do people realize the chaos there'd be if Social Security was no longer available? What are we supposed to do with seniors or disabled with no place to go? Do we build workhouses? That's a Dickensonian nightmare.

1312766067589210118 2020-10-04 22:46:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek Someone really wants to be sure this article is seen. This has been reposted.
1312765377013788673 2020-10-04 22:43:50 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @burgessev This is just insane. Of course people want to get back to whatever normal is to them. But pretending there is no pandemic doesn't do that. It doesn't restore the economy. It gets us where we are today. The virus is surging, roughly 210,000 are dead. We need a damn plan!
1312733539876646913 2020-10-04 20:37:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @brianstelter @Kevinliptakcnn Trump is learning nothing from being sick with covid. I didn't expect that he would.

Someone might get arrested if they purposely cough on me. Some assh*le standing next to me who has chosen to blow off wearing a mask feels no different to me.
1312461341148418048 2020-10-04 02:35:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SenatorLoeffler It didn't have to be this bad here. The lying and negligence by Trump and the complicit GOP must stop.
1312460395093786624 2020-10-04 02:31:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @speechboy71 @RTMannJr Gov Reynolds of Iowa is called "Covid Kim" by many of her constituents.
1312459396606091264 2020-10-04 02:27:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis Is that secret code for "Netflix"?
1312459181761335298 2020-10-04 02:27:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ShimonPro That shouldn't be a choice.
1312457136010485760 2020-10-04 02:19:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @marcorubio @WhiteHouse The White House and the GOP have done excellent jobs of shattering their own credibility. But, I agree we need transparent updates on Trump.
1312456123845206017 2020-10-04 02:14:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @sahilkapur Oh. The official stationery makes it true. Right? Give me a break!
1312455472058777602 2020-10-04 02:12:23 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MrDanZak @mateagold Then why weren't they removed? I'm tired of people being intimidated by them.
1312453724728557569 2020-10-04 02:05:26 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump Who taught him to spell "plague"?
1312452728166072320 2020-10-04 02:01:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @gtconway3d @isa97 I thought a reporter heard something and reported it? I'm sorry. I don't remember her name.
1312451113786896385 2020-10-04 01:55:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DrBiden Every part of me that will cross is crossed in hope you will both stay well. Not pretty but very sincere!
1312449500166852608 2020-10-04 01:48:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @BillKristol @darionavarro111 Or he's panicked. I definitely believe Trump would demand the spin.
1312448894542868481 2020-10-04 01:46:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @michaelgwaltz @CNN @kaitlancollins Bullsh*t. Conley was evasive and Americans deserve the whole picture. I've had it with the lies and cheating.
1312448005384007680 2020-10-04 01:42:43 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Don't let this latest mess cause you to procrastinate on voting. If there's only one truth left, it's that Trump and Republicans must all be removed from office.
1312446866685009920 2020-10-04 01:38:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KaivanShroff @darionavarro111 If I get sick, I wouldn't get the medical attention Trump has. They'd let me die. I'm the same age as Trump. I resent it deeply and take it personally. Our entire healthcare system needs to be revamped.
1312443974766845952 2020-10-04 01:26:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kaitlancollins Kind of depends on who it was.
1312443178843168769 2020-10-04 01:23:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JReinerMD @Lee_in_Iowa And if anyone dies, that's murder.
1312441424449687552 2020-10-04 01:16:34 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JohnCassidy And it is possible it could have affected Biden. Our country is dangling by a frayed string.
1312438822911631361 2020-10-04 01:06:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis  https://t.co/0zjETykeCp
1312437718392008705 2020-10-04 01:01:50 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @froomkin It doesn't matter if he is a DO. They are as legit as MD's.
1312434853401559043 2020-10-04 00:50:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @brianefallon And Biden needs to stay home.
1312432959752998912 2020-10-04 00:42:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ElieNYC I want Biden to stay home and monitor. He will have to do virtual events. If he gets sick, I expect him to get the same level of care Trump is getting.
1312431418178494464 2020-10-04 00:36:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kurteichenwald I want Biden to go home and be monitored. He can do virtual events.
1312430619281043456 2020-10-04 00:33:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @dandrezner A shitcluster? Now as that image forms in my brain, I need to poke out my mental eye. Ewww!
1312428679147016194 2020-10-04 00:25:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I want Biden to go home and monitor his condition. He can do virtual appearances. We can't afford him being infected. If he is, I expect him to get the same level of care Trump has received.
1312423896768016384 2020-10-04 00:06:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @pixy711eleven The doctor to the R behind Conley? Is that the one you think possibly reacted?
1312423039527784448 2020-10-04 00:03:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @maddow The timeline is "off".
1312422727475748866 2020-10-04 00:02:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MollyJongFast Was he on oxygen at any time during the day he went to Bedminster?
1312421931803607040 2020-10-03 23:59:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joshrogin I thought I saw one of the doctors react to the question about other comorbidities. It could be my imagination.
1312420711907110912 2020-10-03 23:54:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I'm not satisfied with the medical press conference. It was evasive.
1312420360193814531 2020-10-03 23:52:52 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Did I just see one of the doctors on the Trump medical team react to a question about other comorbidities? It could be my imagination.
1312405823403028482 2020-10-03 22:55:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chatty_cath Belittling words like "afraid" or "hiding" drive me straight up the wall. What worries me is how aggressive they are about it. What perplexes me is their lack of concern for anyone but themselves. I've compared them to zombies - there's just nothing going on inside.
1312402054674083841 2020-10-03 22:40:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @brianklaas Kim Reynolds, the Repub Gov of Iowa, is known throughout the state as Covid Kim for her callous indifference to the Iowans who have died. She refuses to issue a mask mandate despite the pleading from top medical professionals. She's lied about covid counts in packing plants.
1312400566522445830 2020-10-03 22:34:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Don't go on hold because Trump is sick. The election is about a month away. Help people register and VOTE.
1312398890574938117 2020-10-03 22:27:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MauriceMichael It drives me crazy. Someone can be arrested for purposely coughing on me. Someone standing next to me who refuses to wear a mask doesn't feel one bit different.
1312398045108211716 2020-10-03 22:24:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TeaPainUSA We've been trying for about 5 years but about a third of the country won't listen.
1312396968900079616 2020-10-03 22:19:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KrauseForIowa Pence needs to get his act together and do a press conference.  But it sounds like the WH is scared and in disarray. Trump may have ordered everyone to shut up, too. He hates looking "weak".
1312393762786742274 2020-10-03 22:07:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chatty_cath Rights are not absolute. They are contingent on people behaving responsibly in society. Unfortunately, that isn't being enforced when it comes to covid. Someone might be arrested for purposely coughing on me but that's it. To me, a maskless person is purposefully endangering me.
1312359447591890945 2020-10-03 19:50:49 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @brhodes Poor argument. Biden isn't out of the woods yet. If he gets sick, he couldn't protect himself, either. The issues here are lies and negligence.
1312357276217475074 2020-10-03 19:42:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @robreiner @darionavarro111 I think Trump is likely trying to. If it hadn't been for one reporter I'm not sure we would have known squat.
1312356662703988737 2020-10-03 19:39:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @juliaioffe I'm not so sure that's even true. If it hadn't been for one reporter we might not have known squat. Trump doesn't like looking "weak".
1312355852439957504 2020-10-03 19:36:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @abbydphillip I don't think it matters one bit. It all depends on what is done with the information. They got caught by a reporter when Hicks got sick. Otherwise, I'm not certain we'd know anything at all right now.
1312353705539272705 2020-10-03 19:28:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @briantylercohen Poor argument. If Biden gets sick, he couldn't protect himself, either. The issues are negligence and outright lying by Trump.
1312176266909343745 2020-10-03 07:42:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @brad_dickson Bullsh*t. That leads to fights about election delays. Trump's people aren't going to be napping and we can't be the saps.
1312165579634032642 2020-10-03 07:00:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis Biden is trying to be decent and the opponents will do nothing but try to take advantage of it. They will walk all over us and then give us a hard kick for good measure.
1312164628823068674 2020-10-03 06:56:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chrislongview @Lee_in_Iowa They were willing to make changes because of the monkey throwing sh*t. You would think it would be a no brainer to make adjustments to ensure the health of the participants.
1312163953141710848 2020-10-03 06:53:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @meridithmcgraw I wish he'd go home and go through a few more tests to be sure he is clear. We can't lose him.
1312162999457648641 2020-10-03 06:50:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Where is our press conference on Trump's condition?
1312162400116699138 2020-10-03 06:47:49 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @IsaacDovere @neeratanden We will make extra efforts to be fair and the opposition will walk all over us. I'm not saying we have to fight dirty but I am saying we can't be chumps.
1312160758503936000 2020-10-03 06:41:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @WHO13news This proves that Reynolds is dumb as a brick and unteachable. What a FOOL.
1312160350284906498 2020-10-03 06:39:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @jaketapper @PaulBegala THIS is why we can't just be nice guys. They will still fight as dirty as they can.
1312159654827364352 2020-10-03 06:36:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RadioFreeTom I appreciate Biden trying to be positive but I hope that doesn't include ignoring the stonewalling. There are things we need to know!
1312127051780943872 2020-10-03 04:27:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @grandmagrit Definitely!
1312119996634419200 2020-10-03 03:59:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Billysthought That's one reason Biden needs to go home until he tests negative a few more times. If he tests positive and affects others, he's going to be accused of hypocrisy.
1312117990154932225 2020-10-03 03:51:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @democraticbear I hope so. I would feel a bit more comfortable if Biden would go home until he tests clear a few more times. If he causes spread, he's going to be crucified. We don't need him being called a hypocrite.
1312116177326358528 2020-10-03 03:44:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @IndyUSA NO!! Don't these assh*les ever learn?
1312115305150210048 2020-10-03 03:40:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @HeidiNBC @NickRiccardi I want Biden to go home and wait until he tests a few more times. If he comes down with it and causes a spread, Biden will be crucified.
1312114777963950080 2020-10-03 03:38:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I would feel more comfortable if Biden would go home until he tests clear a few more times.
1312100457385398278 2020-10-03 02:41:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> We haven't heard from Trump in at least 13 hours.
1312089295138836480 2020-10-03 01:57:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @BrianKarem @kurteichenwald @PressSec @realDonaldTrump The question wasn't just if NJ was safe for him! Was Trump safe for NJ? Looks like he was not.
1312085233777377282 2020-10-03 01:41:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Olivianuzzi Active or manic?
1312084347990814722 2020-10-03 01:37:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KCCINews NO!! What does it take to make us learn? This is a money decision NOT one for the fans. I guess I should expect this stupidity in Reynold's Iowa.
1312077893657387008 2020-10-03 01:12:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @glennkirschner2 It's kind of like the slogan on a bulkhead of a Destroyer in the movie "Battleship": In God we trust. All others we track.
1312076968268099587 2020-10-03 01:08:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @poniewozik @RadioFreeTom About damn time.
1312075106953371648 2020-10-03 01:00:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @primadonna001 @kylegriffin1 I don't think it takes that long to actually process. This article says 6 hours which is possible since last night. This sample would be expedited.   https://t.co/JTWkA64G3t
1312070070873489408 2020-10-03 00:40:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kylegriffin1 @MSNBC VOTE! Do not wait.
1312068130114621444 2020-10-03 00:33:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @primadonna001 @kylegriffin1 Biden took the PCR.
1312066415445397504 2020-10-03 00:26:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @sahilkapur That helps. I'll feel like I'm squatting on a cactus until retests remain negative.
1312064957740089344 2020-10-03 00:20:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @natashakorecki @JoeBiden Biden needs one of the more accurate tests. Too much is hanging on his good health.
1312061530943434752 2020-10-03 00:07:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @AdamParkhomenko McConnell's statement says it all.  https://t.co/KayvCR2YsE
1312060573132222480 2020-10-03 00:03:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chatty_cath I'll get mine by mail very soon. I'll fill it out immediately and then look for the car keys. I can be a procrastinator and don't want to give myself a chance of doing that.
1312059797336981505 2020-10-03 00:00:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kaitlancollins @saletan Typical. All are expendable. The GOP doesn't give a sh*t about Trump, either, if they can win without him.
1312058600068730881 2020-10-02 23:55:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ChrisDJackson @Lee_in_Iowa @JoeBiden @DrBiden He still should quarantine. It may take a few days of tests to determine if he is covid free.
1312057843361755137 2020-10-02 23:52:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KLoeffler @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Trump gave Trump coronavirus via denial and carelessness. It didn't have to be this bad. Trump could have done a lot to prevent this from the very beginning.
1312056170035785732 2020-10-02 23:45:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I feel like I'm squatting on cactus while waiting for Biden's test results.
1312050323729666051 2020-10-02 23:22:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chatty_cath We do have vote by mail. However, I plan on taking my ballot to the county election headquarters. It's close and convenient.
1312049465730256896 2020-10-02 23:19:03 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek Oh swell. Just what we need - another batshit crazy conspiracy theory.
1312049151677431809 2020-10-02 23:17:49 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @senatemajldr @sahilkapur @POTUS I'm livid. You are a cheat.
1312043479896403969 2020-10-02 22:55:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chatty_cath I couldn't agree more! Hope you've been staying healthy. I've been in my apartment for the most part since March so I'm a bit stir crazy. I enjoy your book recommendations. Just what I've needed! You are supplying a public service! 😃
1312031991504793604 2020-10-02 22:09:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TheAtlantic @GrahamDavidA An it placed Biden in peril.
1312010705026142210 2020-10-02 20:45:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @bopinion Bad argument. We don't know Biden's results yet. He could have been exposed by Trump. The issue is Trump's carelessness and denial.
1312006691370741760 2020-10-02 20:29:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @AtomicAnalyst @TimInHonolulu @VP @Mike_Pence @WhiteHouse @hogangidley45 @robertcobrien And covid is soaring in Iowa. Hospitalizations are up.
1312003446216761345 2020-10-02 20:16:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mkraju So much for the fiction that Trump didn't prepare for the debate.
1311933057109196801 2020-10-02 15:36:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @AmyAThatcher @DrDinD Juggle chipmunks.
1311930499191930880 2020-10-02 15:26:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NBCNews Don't let this info get lost in the shuffle. We don't know how this is all going to shake out.
1311929233841827840 2020-10-02 15:21:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @spettypi There is always someone to blame. I don't think military hug and kiss.
1311928658425188352 2020-10-02 15:19:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> So, how is Biden? That's what I want to know.
1311927766124826624 2020-10-02 15:15:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kylegriffin1 Another fine mess he has gotten the country into.
1311927464193601536 2020-10-02 15:14:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @gtconway3d Poor argument. Biden could have been exposed by Trump. He may not have been able to protect himself, either. As of right now, we don't know. The issue here is Trump's denial and carelessness.
1311926348601077760 2020-10-02 15:09:50 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @StevenBeschloss The hypocrisy galls me but if people wake up about covid I'll consider it a good thing.
1311924870348001280 2020-10-02 15:03:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Evan_Rosenfeld @Yamiche @AliVelshi That's a poor argument. Biden may have been exposed by Trump. As of this moment we don't know. The issue is Trump's carelessness and denial.
1311924143076581376 2020-10-02 15:01:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @brianefallon I'm betting they got permission from McConnell to save their political behinds. This was not out of the goodness of their hearts.
1311923645586038784 2020-10-02 14:59:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> First, let me say that I hope all goes well for Trump and his wife. But, I'm (once again) angry. Carelessness and denial on Trump's part have, yet again, created another fine mess for Americans.
1311862343899508738 2020-10-02 10:55:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ZekeJMiller Could he have exposed Biden?
1311859450865692674 2020-10-02 10:44:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @grandmagrit Empty.
1311797674832809995 2020-10-02 06:38:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mattmfm But there are some swing states where Dem voter registration is lagging behind. That has to be addressed immediately.
1311793617611223041 2020-10-02 06:22:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MaxMMarin After Trump conspiring with his Party in PA about electors, any place having to do with the election should be buttoned up tight.
1311792447077470208 2020-10-02 06:17:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> In the US a vial of insulin retails for about $300 and requires a prescription. In Canada it is $50 and over the counter. There is NO EXCUSE.
1311790467495923713 2020-10-02 06:09:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump What gall.
1311788890097963017 2020-10-02 06:03:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mkraju It makes me sad when I see another woman disparage Roe. Without Roe, women are once again 2nd class creatures unable to make intelligent decisions and who require an overlord to tell them how to behave. It is the ultimate in discrimination.
1311785237387644928 2020-10-02 05:49:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Lee_in_Iowa @chrislhayes There is this. We need to make sure people know that this wasn't out if the goodness of her heart. Likely that she got permission from McConnell. In short, this vote is as phoney as Joni.   https://t.co/hJgOQ5jR2u
1311778161655504898 2020-10-02 05:21:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SenFeinstein Without Roe, women once again are considered incapable of thinking for themselves and in need of an overlord to give them guidance. That is the ultimate in discrimination.
1311775070625427456 2020-10-02 05:08:43 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SenTedCruz There is a moderate coalition for a very good reason. This is a blatant lie.
1311774316254593026 2020-10-02 05:05:43 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CNNPolitics Trump forgets how many people saw his worthless self acting like a monkey throwing sh*t.
1311772295829032960 2020-10-02 04:57:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MilesTaylorUSA We were confident last time, too.
1311771427272626176 2020-10-02 04:54:14 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Susan_Hennessey And we need people to get out and register in those states. In some of them, Dem registration is running behind Repub registration.
1311771048958930947 2020-10-02 04:52:44 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JohnJHarwood Fine with me.
1311770890628141061 2020-10-02 04:52:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MSNBC Uh...because he didn't "win".
1311748642584367104 2020-10-02 03:23:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This isn't good. Do not procrastinate. There is too much at stake. Register. Vote!  https://t.co/A2Wq8Rnk0U
1311723595165511686 2020-10-02 01:44:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek Not according to the majority of Americans...
1311722945216163840 2020-10-02 01:41:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @12SpUnKy Just imagine the chaos this would create! No wonder they are trying to kill us off with covid. So, where would all the penniless seniors go? Many have no family left. Are we going to open workhouses like some sort of Dickinsonian dystopia?
1311721412500115458 2020-10-02 01:35:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mayawiley If we don't call them out, people forget very quickly.

1311708527157706758 2020-10-02 00:44:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RadioFreeTom Oddly, this kind of reminds me (in a way) of how women were feeling in the late 60's. We wanted to be heroes of our own lives.
1311704983218401280 2020-10-02 00:30:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JuliaDavisNews @Twitter @Teri_Kanefield @jack There were some Twitter issues earlier. Elie Mystal also commented on it.
1311703677804085251 2020-10-02 00:25:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Yamiche @PressSec This is a perfect example of how Trump and his minions should be questioned.
1311703048478240770 2020-10-02 00:22:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RadioFreeTom In the deep South part of the attraction for Trump is because of a resentment of people in the North who tell them that the culture they've clung to since before 1861 is wrong. They don't like seeing their cultural icons destroyed and don't understand who they are without them.
1311700721008607233 2020-10-02 00:13:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MyPeakChallenge @SamHeughan I did the same. I'm now bopping around with no walker or cane. If I'm tired, I do develop a bit of a list but it is entirely manageable. The only secret I discovered along the way was to just keep going.
1311699557647036417 2020-10-02 00:08:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @VoLinxx That underestimates just how nasty they are. Their initiation includes doing a criminal act. They are misogynistic as well. They aren't just "playing" and need to be destroyed.
1311696741993975818 2020-10-01 23:57:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump Typical Trump. Claim victory when none exists.
1311695888272814080 2020-10-01 23:54:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ElieNYC @jbouie Ain't that the truth!!
1311695646748037121 2020-10-01 23:53:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Don't think this settles things, Floridians. This is good news but you must keep it going. Vote!!
1311686490171338761 2020-10-01 23:16:43 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis Trump simply doesn't deserve another huge forum in which to spread his poison. I really don't want another debate. It's just too dangerous. In the last one he spewed his bullsh*t about a "rigged" election and mobilized the Proud Boys. What will happen next time?
1311683838133907457 2020-10-01 23:06:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Zac_Petkanas Women didn't bust their asses in the 70's for THIS. Losing Roe makes women 2nd class citizens. It means someone thinks that we don't have the brains to think for ourselves and require some overlord for guidance. This is the ultimate in discrimination.
1311682050307620864 2020-10-01 22:59:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @amandacarpenter There are seniors in that photo! Life is sure cheap to those women.
1311680800535064579 2020-10-01 22:54:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joncoopertweets These jerks will stab their own people square in the back. Problem is how deep seeded Traditional Republicanism is in TX. Texans get stabbed over and over by the GOP and the constituents just beg them to stab them again. Please sir, can I have some more?
1311674550183170053 2020-10-01 22:29:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DNCWarRoom He sure cares about you, MN Trump fans. He's saying screw you if he doesn't get what he wants. Trump cares only about himself.
1311673085129564160 2020-10-01 22:23:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This information cannot get buried in all the noise. This is an indication of her mindset concerning Roe.
1311643598316863489 2020-10-01 20:26:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Just a reminder. Another day and more people are still dying from covid. This can't be lost in the confusion the first debate created.
1311641702596325376 2020-10-01 20:18:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump Bullsh*t. You are losing fair and square. It is simply AMAZING were some of these ballot "issues" are showing up. Pennsylvania, a swing state, New York with it's heavily Democratic vote.... And you sure know about them in a split second. Not buying it, Donny.
1311638780399554560 2020-10-01 20:07:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JillWineBanks I think we learned all we can take in the first one.
1311638039907758081 2020-10-01 20:04:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek A printing error, like a clerical error, is not fraud and indicates no evil intent. Someone put a muzzle on Trump because he's siezing on every opportunity to promote a false narrative.
1311635636428976129 2020-10-01 19:54:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JillWineBanks Frankly, what comes out of Trump's mouth is dangerous to the well-being to the country. I don't think there should be another debate. It's just a huge forum for the spread of his poison.
1311634703200538624 2020-10-01 19:50:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KCCINews @caseysgenstore It's just not different enough to be impressed. Meh.
1311634402665955328 2020-10-01 19:49:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek Gee. Who could possibly put him up to that? I'm so sick of every sneeze being litigated in Trumpland.
1311631279142694913 2020-10-01 19:37:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Trump officials were told to make comments sympathetic to Kyle Rittenhouse.  https://t.co/fNnHv1xzUG
1311521475153793026 2020-10-01 12:21:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek The CDC always has delivered vaccines. They are the experts. Why bother the military which has other things to do.
1311389183781621761 2020-10-01 03:35:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kylegriffin1 You tell an army to "stand down". You tell a bunch of thugs they are going to jail. Very telling.
1311377156161843200 2020-10-01 02:47:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @amandacarpenter I'd go further. He mobilized them.
1311376529520287745 2020-10-01 02:45:03 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JoshNBCNews @NickRiccardi You tell an army to "stand down". You tell a bunch of thugs they are going to jail. Hmmmmm....

1311372183952936960 2020-10-01 02:27:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @sahilkapur @MeetThePress Uh huh. You know, it really doesn't matter. The damage is done. So that makes Trump an evil SOB if he meant it and dumb as a rock if he didn't. Choose. Either way he is completely unfit.
1311371485148311554 2020-10-01 02:25:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KrauseForIowa I'm so tired of all of this. She's a threat to the well-being of every single Iowan - some of them are just too indoctrinated into the White Taliban to realize it.
1311370602847051778 2020-10-01 02:21:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @gregpinelo I agree. Plus, he doesn't need another huge forum for spreading his bullsh*t. It's just too dangerous to the well-being of this country.
1311368447302029320 2020-10-01 02:12:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DMRegister Schoolyard slap fight? That denigrates the importance of this election. It was a lousy debate but it definitely underscored just how dangerous Trump is. The story is Trump's harping on an imaginary "rigged" election followed by his mobilization of the Proud Boys.
1311341838712926210 2020-10-01 00:27:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @binarybits @Susan_Hennessey Why is the military being called upon to do this? The CDC which usually takes care of this has the expertise. This is disturbing.
1311340786009755652 2020-10-01 00:23:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SykesCharlie I am so incredibly SICK of this lack of responsibility. How utterly unrealistic and damaging that is to everyone around them. It is all Trump's fault.
1311339934821818371 2020-10-01 00:19:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @AshaRangappa_ @davidfrum And it is also a huge forum for his "rigged" election message and last night he mobilized the Proud Boys. This is incredibly dangerous.
1311337293517647872 2020-10-01 00:09:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @tribelaw Yeah...I was looking forward to less stress.
1311337034863325185 2020-10-01 00:08:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Delavegalaw I'm doing exactly that. But I need to purge my thoughts a bit before I turn on Netflix and give myself a break.
1311336617446191104 2020-10-01 00:06:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SenatorRomney @JenniferJJacobs @senjudiciary Nope. The People are already voting.
1311336418782912518 2020-10-01 00:05:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Amy_Siskind I'm really curious as to whether Trump hasn't suppressed his own votes. He keeps telling his voters they are winning and people who believe the election is rigged may not bother.
1311333617684172801 2020-09-30 23:54:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @jbarro @Yair_Rosenberg True. But they covered him because he was amusing in 2015 and that helped him to get the nomination. If we get rid of him they have to cut that sh*t out.
1311329568498819072 2020-09-30 23:38:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kenolin1 @CheriJacobus @realDonaldTrump Even that won't do it. The media will need to ignore him. They covered him because he was amusing  in 2015 and that helped get him the nomination. He's got to be removed as an influencer who divides the nation.
1311328339047731200 2020-09-30 23:33:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I just think that giving him an additional huge forum to spread his lies about the "rigged" election after he's mobilized the Proud Boys is dangerous. He also called for people to go to polling places and watch. What are they watching for?
1311321941987516416 2020-09-30 23:08:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mkraju @jaketapper I think this misses an important point. It isn't just that he refused to condemn the Proud Boys. He actually mobilized them.
1311317654666387459 2020-09-30 22:51:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JRubinBlogger @mkraju @alizaslav Even if he misspoke (which I don't believe) the genie is out of the bottle. That makes Trump stupid and irresponsible. So I guess "misspoke" isn't an good excuse.
1311315257659469826 2020-09-30 22:41:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SteveSchmidtSES Again with forest management. About 57% of the forest in CA is owned or managed by the United States - 33 million acres. So, here's a rake, Donny. Have at it.
1311313732740485120 2020-09-30 22:35:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump He probably would have if Trump had given him the chance.
1311308367328088064 2020-09-30 22:14:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Exactly! It's like the symbol for infinity. It is self perpetuating.
1311307444551929856 2020-09-30 22:10:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JoyceWhiteVance @shin_inouye Exactly!
1311306308474359812 2020-09-30 22:06:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ElieNYC I partially agree. The story is his message about a "rigged" election. His mobilization of the Proud Boys was to facilitate that.
1311305624068804610 2020-09-30 22:03:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @jeneps Yeah. Keep him away from the pharmaceuticals.
1311303636874559489 2020-09-30 21:55:24 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MerriamWebster @maddow Trump suffered from far more than that during the debate. More like Adderallrrhea. The man was manic.
1311302765151424512 2020-09-30 21:51:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NBCNews So?
1311302024412254208 2020-09-30 21:49:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TIMEPolitics @VeraMBergen @LissandraVilla I'd go a little further. I'd say he mobilized them.
1311299004811141122 2020-09-30 21:37:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JoyAnnReid Was Trump flying on Adderall or something else? He was manic.
1311298461694922760 2020-09-30 21:34:50 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @brianklaas About 57% of the forest in CA is owned or managed by the US Forest Service - that's 33 million acres. So here's a rake, Donnie. You go clean that forest. Let us know when you are done.
1311296773969805314 2020-09-30 21:28:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> While we are all outraged by Trump's bullsh*t last night (and we should be) people are still dying of covid. I don't that want to be lost in the chaos.
1311295627586830336 2020-09-30 21:23:34 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DMRegister Nonsense. If you think you are trying to be fair by adding to the confusion this morning you are wrong. After Trump's comments about a rigged election and his mobilization of the Proud Boys I think you need to back off.
1311279509233074178 2020-09-30 20:19:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @EamonJavers @CNBC This is outrageous. Donald Trump will do everything possible to make the world a much harder place for black people - as if it isn't hard enough already. I don't want my daughters and granddaughters having to endure their lives rather than just having a chance to live them.
1311273109996154880 2020-09-30 19:54:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ashleyn1cole He didn't just refuse to denounce. He mobilized them.
1311271612793094144 2020-09-30 19:48:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chrislhayes @NicolleDWallace Drunk uncle doesn't describe it. That performance was manic.
1311270539466616832 2020-09-30 19:43:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @robreiner Not really. People need to be voting. Implying any kind of win makes people think it is over so they don't need to vote. We still need to flip the Senate and we need a blow out on election night. We haven't won zip.
1311269559756820482 2020-09-30 19:39:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Scout_Finch He was manic and out of control. This is who he is.
1311269349093769217 2020-09-30 19:39:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JoeBiden He didn't just not disavow. They think he mobilized them.
1311268222952501248 2020-09-30 19:34:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @tribelaw After his call out to the Proud Boys, I'm not sure a second debate is a good idea. That was incredibly dangerous.
1311267439259287554 2020-09-30 19:31:34 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @BillKristol Trump wasn't forceful, he wasn't emotional. He was manic. Let's call it what it was.
1311266537022656512 2020-09-30 19:27:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DavidKlion We do not need that right now. People are already pissed off about the debate and you are just adding to the cacophony.
1311265843884560384 2020-09-30 19:25:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @jpaceDC @gtconway3d They weren't "tones". That was manic.
1311265234871615495 2020-09-30 19:22:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @morgfair Spot on, Morgan.
1311264972366897158 2020-09-30 19:21:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MichaelSteele Trump wasn't emotional. That was manic. He did everything but set himself on fire - and I'm not so sure that he didn't.  I feel like I was beaten up last night.
1311264200744894464 2020-09-30 19:18:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JaxAlemany Trump wasn't forceful. He was manic. He did everything short of setting himself on fire - and I'm not so sure he didn't.
1311262775377825803 2020-09-30 19:13:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JeffreyGoldberg He didn't just not condemn, he mobilized them.
1311262467704619008 2020-09-30 19:11:49 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is an important point.
1311259699724120066 2020-09-30 19:00:49 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MichaelSteele With the comment he made to the Proud Boys I think it is too dangerous to have another debate.
1311258586081824768 2020-09-30 18:56:23 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @billscher It isn't just his obnoxiousness. His comment to the Proud Boys just made November a lot more dangerous for Americans. We don't need more of that.
1311257290511704064 2020-09-30 18:51:14 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @brianklaas I don't think there should be another debate. After the Proud Boy's reaction to "stand back and stand by" it just is too dangerous.
1311255413187325953 2020-09-30 18:43:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Anyone thinking what Trump did in the debate was strong is wrong. That was the desperate flailing of a man knowing he's in trouble.
1311254252245876736 2020-09-30 18:39:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PoliticusSarah I felt like I'd been mugged after the debate.
1311252044775383042 2020-09-30 18:30:24 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @brianklaas This makes November scary. So Trump stalls the election and unleashes the white supremacists. We shouldn't have another debate. It is too dangerous.
1311249553363005441 2020-09-30 18:20:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JillWineBanks @NicolleDWallace We don't need more debates. We know who Trump is.

1311116721722449921 2020-09-30 09:32:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Trump is a disgusting pig. What a horrible, horrible person.
1311106124586905602 2020-09-30 08:50:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SonyaBaker2 @AndrewDesiderio They hounded her for years because they were scared of her.
1311103100703445000 2020-09-30 08:38:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @AdrienneWrites Stories like this are powerful. Thank you for sharing her with us for a brief moment.
1311096264080191489 2020-09-30 08:11:23 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kylegriffin1 They played the same tune with Hillary Clinton.
1310986979987910657 2020-09-30 00:57:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @AdamParkhomenko This just infuriates me. Is this the beginning of new messaging that women aren't fit to participate in politics (or upper level business or *fill in the blank*)? We didn't bust our asses in the 70's to become 2nd class citizens again.
1310975366564122624 2020-09-30 00:10:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Amy_Siskind Trump hasn't prepped. He'll be the same bully as he was in 2016. He'll attack and play the victim.
1310922340772065281 2020-09-29 20:40:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump @CNN He protests too much. There are too many hoaxes. He paints himself as victim too often. He has cried wolf and fewer and fewer people believe him.
1310921146938855424 2020-09-29 20:35:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @brhodes Seems to me someone has something on Ronny Jackson.
1310918645565001728 2020-09-29 20:25:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RightWingWatch Just what we need - another conspiracy theory. So she seems to know all about this when no one else does. So, tell us where these barns are.....
1310917615246860288 2020-09-29 20:21:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @democraticbear @SRuhle @LaurieFitch3 The press was entertained by his silly antics and that helped Trump win the nomination. They should have never given Trump all that free air time.
1310914858121146368 2020-09-29 20:10:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mattyglesias @Susan_Hennessey I've been wondering that too. Basically, is all the red ink simply because he's writing it in red ink. His businesses need to be audited for starters.
1310913521463459841 2020-09-29 20:05:13 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @HeathenOnEarth_ It's easy enough to protect small houses of worship but tax churches that become money machines.
1310911478430683138 2020-09-29 19:57:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @tomkarkar @MikeFromUSA1 @Super_chief69 @maggsnaidu @Newsweek @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden World peace? The United States is in its most weakened state since at least WWII. That's when aggressors act. Thats why so many have been concerned about all these Russian connections that keep popping up and all the calls to Putin the learn about from Russian media.
1310910318093242368 2020-09-29 19:52:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @LJMURPHY1910 @democraticbear Which is? If it applies to Trump, I hope it's awful...
1310709642075529216 2020-09-29 06:35:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PoCoAustinPa @PinkBling2017  https://t.co/6LysddKCxN

1310702362965704705 2020-09-29 06:06:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TeaPainUSA What matters is no one can assume this is locked up and over. We still need to flip the Senate and make sure Trump is kicked out of office. And now we are hearing that the State of PA may try to help him cheat. So, vote and vote early if you can. We need this to be a blowout.
1310700401612775424 2020-09-29 05:58:22 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @politvidchannel Nope. Statements are bullsh*t. We need official tax returns.
1310633963061473281 2020-09-29 01:34:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KCCINews They seem to be territorial. I rarely saw a red squirrel where I lived in Illinois. The squirrels were black and grey. Here, I rarely see anything but red squirrels.
1310631723345084423 2020-09-29 01:25:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Wow. I wonder what it would be for Trump to live on Soc Sec and the good graces of their families like so many seniors are forced to do. Oh wait. He's trying to destroy Soc Sec. I don't think he is in Mary Trump's good graces.
1310630276461195266 2020-09-29 01:19:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @nypost Delaying tactic. Trump doesn't want to debate.
1310629817595895810 2020-09-29 01:17:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Channel4News Is there any independent confirmation on this yet?
1310628614828941312 2020-09-29 01:13:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Now on top of the tax revelations, we have a report on black voter suppression in the 2016 campaign.
1310625790036520961 2020-09-29 01:01:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> What makes me angriest about Trump is his willingness to sacrifice everyone (other than himself) to get what he wants. That was obvious from the very beginning. People who can't see it have been a big source of frustration to me.
1310608247603118081 2020-09-28 23:52:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @B52Malmet Remember all those canceled ads? I think that's one source. I'm betting that that American taxpayers are footing at least some of the bill. Also, Trump has never hesitated to stiff anyone he wants to.
1310607115380240384 2020-09-28 23:47:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @brianklaas If Americans are sick, broke and gaslit we become easy pickings for agressors. I think it is possible that Trump has received or solicited advice on what to do about the virus from Putin. He has had too many "mysterious" calls with Putin and it must be considered.
1310605025245356034 2020-09-28 23:39:22 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JamesSurowiecki There are things Trump simply doesn't want to become public knowledge. What if there is irrefutable proof of a pee tape or any other sexual crime, for example. The man is even paranoid about his grades being released. Combine that with the trappings of power and an empty pocket..
1310600267075850240 2020-09-28 23:20:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Will the curators of the National Treasures in the White House do a complete inventory, please? They also might count the silverware....
1310599518396743680 2020-09-28 23:17:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @darionavarro111 This may change nothing as far as some Repubs or Trumpers. We still need to get Trump's dead weight out of office and flip the Senate. We still need to vote early and in a landslide.
1310598971015016449 2020-09-28 23:15:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @grandmagrit This may not move the needle at all with Republicans or Trumpers. I hope no one thinks we are off the hook. We still need to flip the Senate and we still have to get Trump's useless ass out of the White House. So, vote.
1310597596046594051 2020-09-28 23:09:51 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump Release the returns. That's all you have to do to prove it. An audit doesn't prevent that. This is hardly a hoax.
1310593714901975040 2020-09-28 22:54:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Today I am wondering weather or not Trump was just over his head with covid or whether he received advice to just let it rip in order to weaken the country and keep us from the polls. Talk about a national security risk! Americans are sick, broke and gaslit.
1310568568816316419 2020-09-28 21:14:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joncoopertweets So, this would be why Trump ignored covid, screwed up the USPS, wants to put Barr in a dress in the Supreme Court and so on. I've wondered for years what kind of financial deal Trump has with Putin. We all have. Yesterday the picture became a little clearer.
1310566557534367748 2020-09-28 21:06:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump So, all you have to do is release your taxes and easily prove it is false. Audit does not prevent that. If you don't release your taxes, you are toast.
1310550808732327937 2020-09-28 20:03:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JillWineBanks This tells me everything I need to know about her. She will let bias and political chicanery affect her opinions on the court.
1310548821076783105 2020-09-28 19:56:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KrauseForIowa Or used it to make schools safer or used it to do about anything directly covid related.
1310440810652016641 2020-09-28 12:46:50 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @whstancil @Yr_Obt_Svt I bet he winds up with more alimony, too.
1310440292361924608 2020-09-28 12:44:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @renato_mariotti This needs to be required.
1310437714840428544 2020-09-28 12:34:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump Vote! Trump is going to be a caged animal. We need to be sure we defeat him.
1310423930298134528 2020-09-28 11:39:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Please, don't anyone start to think this latest tax news has stopped Trump. He is a caged animal and could strike out. We still have to get to the polls and vote like never before. Remember what happened in 2016!!!
1310416664442306560 2020-09-28 11:10:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MysterySolvent @Delavegalaw A dumpster which should spontaneously ignite any second?
1310274944912293891 2020-09-28 01:47:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joncoopertweets @LindseyGrahamSC @harrisonjaime Nothing I can think of.
1310211131290660864 2020-09-27 21:34:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PatSton58668260 @Rizabellepow Yup. Women have to let their daughters know what they have to lose. If you look back at some of the movies of the day, men either were hitting on women or treating them like children. Sorry, Hubby. I don't need your guidance but I do appreciate your opinion....
1310202471898320896 2020-09-27 20:59:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JulieGunnigle So, Barr in a dress...
1310196071537274881 2020-09-27 20:34:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CNNPolitics In other words, Barr in a dress.
1310195782151213056 2020-09-27 20:33:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chipfranklin Barr in a dress.
1310188520972210177 2020-09-27 20:04:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @maryr0414 @Rizabellepow If Roe is defeated, women become less than fully functioning adults with the brain power to make decisions for themselves and their families. We become second class citizens who require being told what to do.
1310185990154223623 2020-09-27 19:54:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @wadesmom @Rizabellepow @kurteichenwald I'm right with you there, Carolyn. As a woman, it was so hard to even be recognized as a fully functioning adult. There is so much to lose. Remember what it was like before? The younger generations won't know what hit them should we return to "old fashioned values".
1310183750651858944 2020-09-27 19:45:22 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Rizabellepow I've lived long enough now to have seen everything from Eisenhower to Donald Trump. The rights we have achieved were hard won. So many today take them for granted. My heart hurts when I see us poised to obliterate those gains. Life as you know it depends on defeating Trump.
1310179092264873984 2020-09-27 19:26:52 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @samstein The very fact she would be a willing participant in jamming her nomination down the throats of the majority of Americans tells me all I need to know. I'm so sick of ideologues and yearn for a return to government by the People.
1310177915276079104 2020-09-27 19:22:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @democraticbear Wow this is offensive. Elections by the people are at the very core of who we are.
1310175387108995073 2020-09-27 19:12:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MollyJongFast Practice.
1310174477255409665 2020-09-27 19:08:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis This is a slap in the face to every woman in this country.
1310173536523350016 2020-09-27 19:04:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NRSC This offends me to the core.
1310172344170819584 2020-09-27 19:00:03 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kurteichenwald I've seen a few different administrations come and go. I began to see the Republicans change in the 70's. They were becoming more theorist than activist in an activist age - if that makes sense. Then in about '76 they became pro-life. They became against a lot and for little.
1310170054751911936 2020-09-27 18:50:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KCCINews Dishonest and hypocritical. Ernst places her Party above the best interests of Iowans.
1309979727285936130 2020-09-27 06:14:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @grandmagrit Barr in a dress.
1309966215339749377 2020-09-27 05:20:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @gtconway3d Probably stand. I doubt she will be helping that happen.
1309950189197840387 2020-09-27 04:17:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek Vomit.
1309895784356347905 2020-09-27 00:41:06 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PoliticusSarah @Yahoo There was at least one place I read about that reinstalled their machines.
1309895074986291200 2020-09-27 00:38:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @GOP If the Party is willing to lie like this, perhaps the GOP should be disbanded. They are consciously trying to spread disinformation. We need to look closer at Russian collusion, this time without constraints. Let's start with the individuals who were in Russia July 4, 2018.
1309892951666036738 2020-09-27 00:29:50 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JoyceWhiteVance It still wouldn't surprise me if the Trump regime sprinkles some dollars around to make a case for fraud.
1309825662597894144 2020-09-26 20:02:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @McFaul Putin may be realizing he awoke the sleeping giant and sanctions are on the way.
1309825012002631681 2020-09-26 19:59:52 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @carolfromindy I'm wondering when or how  Trump and his people knew about it so quickly. I've suspected that they will throw some money around to create some incidents.
1309824557059117058 2020-09-26 19:58:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @GabbieKDrice @KrauseForIowa I had a similar experience with a few friends. Now they are pretending they voted for Clinton in 2016.
1309823123819241472 2020-09-26 19:52:22 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @thoughtShopper @KamalaHarris Not just ouch. Where are the seniors supposed to go and how are they supposed to live? Life can take away every penny you have in a flash and there are many seniors in this boat. You would be shocked at how many have no family to turn to. This would create a serious crisis!
1309821588758507520 2020-09-26 19:46:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chrislhayes Same old Republican tricks, Chris. The "morally outraged" table pounding is about to start all over again. They'll suddenly discover the deficit the minute Trump is defeated.
1309820785931026432 2020-09-26 19:43:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CNNPolitics Platinum Plan? Sounds like a weekend Las Vegas package.
1309820324599468037 2020-09-26 19:41:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @B52Malmet Woman are not free as long as anyone tries to legislate their bodies - and that is EXACTLY what they want. This isn't about abortion. This is about control.
1309819546082193414 2020-09-26 19:38:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JoyAnnReid Most people can't afford that and with the pandemic there are a lot of places that won't take us. So, we can't blow this election.
1309741217270374401 2020-09-26 14:26:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Hope012015 "Platinum Plan" sounds like a weekend Vegas package. The plan itself is garbage. Is this what Trump thinks black Americans want? What ignorance!
1309567857064316928 2020-09-26 02:58:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> As long as anyone attempts to legislate women's bodies, women will be second class citizens. That is EXACTLY what they want.
1309534602881572874 2020-09-26 00:45:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> With the current controversy &amp; Trump making it clear that he expects "his" court to give him the election, the entire Supreme Court should recuse. The Appellate Court has judges perfectly capable of handling the situation if it comes to that. I know it will never happen....
1309477451345661954 2020-09-25 20:58:47 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RepsForBiden Cheaters.
1309287530035122176 2020-09-25 08:24:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DMRegister I will never understand why places keep reopening when covid is still ravaging Iowa.
1309272775820029952 2020-09-25 07:25:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JoeBiden I have two daughters and a granddaughter. It just terrifies me when I think of the possibility of them having to live 4 more years in a country "led" by Donald Trump.
1309271124228923392 2020-09-25 07:18:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MauriceMichael @politicususa I'm hoping so. I sure will never vote for her.
1309270409028698113 2020-09-25 07:16:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @markknoller @JoeBiden Smoke and mirrors. Meanwhile, he is out to erase preexisting condition protections, stomp on Obamacare, obliterate Social Security and Medicare.
1309269502996230157 2020-09-25 07:12:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MollyJongFast @PressSec @realDonaldTrump I am not tempted by this bribe to vote for Trump. In fact, he is using taxpayer money to do it and that really makes me angry. Besides, this is cheap as hell and doesn't erase all your threats to my Social Security. "Payroll tax cut" my ass.
1309266959905808389 2020-09-25 07:02:22 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Hope012015 This is ridiculous. He's using taxpayer money to try and buy votes. Well, it doesn't change my mind one tiny little bit. It sure as hell doesn't erase his threats to my Social Security.
1309244801406074883 2020-09-25 05:34:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Has anyone noticed that we haven't heard jack from the AARP in regard to Trump or the election? They've been absent for quite a while, acrually.
1309166713242615809 2020-09-25 00:24:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Just an FYI. Some seniors and people with various medical conditions can have trouble writing and their signatures can vary by quite a bit. Ballot acceptance should NOT depend on a signature comparison.

1309143264503771139 2020-09-24 22:50:51 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @thisage @TeaPainUSA Look at who she's fought for all her life. I don't think she would mind one tiny little bit.
1309137087317323776 2020-09-24 22:26:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> NYT Poll: Iowa. Biden 45. Trump 42.
1309135361940115456 2020-09-24 22:19:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Because Trump may use what might be a legal method to steal the election doesn't make it any less seditious.
1309134184661889024 2020-09-24 22:14:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mikememoli @kasie @realDonaldTrump And I don't thinks she'd mind one bit!
1309133467301679110 2020-09-24 22:11:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @marcorubio Is Rubio really this naive?
1309133114862710786 2020-09-24 22:10:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> What Trump is doing isn't politics. He's playing with people's lives for personal gain. Even the Repulican enablers are just pawns to him. They just don't care because they think it gets them what they want. ENOUGH! We the People don't want any of them!
1309123614566952961 2020-09-24 21:32:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Trump's plan to cheat and refusal to agree to a peaceful transition of power are the big enchiladas. This is tyranny - 1776 level.
1309106258193113088 2020-09-24 20:23:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @deadcoco @ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump I agree. What I'm saying is they don't realize they will be hurting like everyone else.
1309104439077240836 2020-09-24 20:16:34 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> I agree. This is why Trump is pulling ads. All of his efforts are going into cheating.
1309103899886878720 2020-09-24 20:14:26 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is a very important point. Trumpers please note. Trump is willing to crash the economy - take money out of your pocket - so he doesn't go to jail. Trump doesn't care about you or anyone else. He is using you.
1309101770958831623 2020-09-24 20:05:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Trump has let 200,000+ people die so many vote by mail, so he can complain about those ballots, so he can steal an election, so he doesn't go to jail. He sees us all as pawns. That includes his own followers.
1309099122071343107 2020-09-24 19:55:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kasie @WayTooEarly @MSNBC I'm awake because my cat Harry is sitting on my chest demanding breakfast.
1309098637272797187 2020-09-24 19:53:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MauriceMichael If he really gives a sh*t he wouldn't have made the snarky comment about the Supreme Court. Romney is having visions of Ayn Rand dancing in his head just like every other Republican.
1309097119433871362 2020-09-24 19:47:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek Correction. Trump accomplices sue Republican governor.
1309092802207330304 2020-09-24 19:30:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JessicaAW32 Go get 'em! Thank you!
1309092461202092032 2020-09-24 19:28:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joncoopertweets Nice. But what are we going to do with it right now? I would rather she put all her energy into defeating Trump first. Then we can talk legislation.
1309091116084604933 2020-09-24 19:23:38 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Amy_Siskind I know how you feel. A friend said to me, "You're just being silly. Congress will control him."
1309089868023296001 2020-09-24 19:18:40 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RadioFreeTom @DanielBShapiro I feel like I've been constantly mugged by Trump and his toadies for the last four years.  The difference is that today left bruises.
1308945991815573507 2020-09-24 09:46:58 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is important. Don't be discouraged. Vote. It is the only way.
1308945654232817670 2020-09-24 09:45:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RepAdamSchiff We also need the Dems in the House and Senate to fight. Keep it legal but you may have to break some eggs.
1308902334223781888 2020-09-24 06:53:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump The joke is that he thinks most everyone is a nobody. He doesn't like his own base any more than the Dems. He'll take healthcare and preexisting conditions, Social Security &amp; so much more away from them, too. As indoctrinated as his base is, they won't understand what hit them.
1308900113499250690 2020-09-24 06:44:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kaitlancollins @maggieNYT Bury the bastard in ballots.
1308899820451565568 2020-09-24 06:43:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CharlesMBlow Right now, I'm so worried for my daughters and granddaughter. Seeing them live one more second in a country with Trump as its "leader" just crushes my heart.
1308896019577556993 2020-09-24 06:28:23 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joncoopertweets Someone PLEASE tell the House to stop passing legislation that won't go anywhere right now. It's time to break some norms if necessary. They need to get tough and stop Trump.
1308895264661557248 2020-09-24 06:25:23 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TeaPainUSA He'll just say he couldn't lose by that much therefore, there must be fraud. We need objective observers present during counts in every single state.
1308894616540917765 2020-09-24 06:22:49 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RepAdamSchiff Excellent. However, what are you going to do with it right now? Please apply ALL your energy to defeating Trump.
1308893012433539072 2020-09-24 06:16:26 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek Blah blah blah blah blah....
1308892814017789953 2020-09-24 06:15:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis This is not a world I care to live in. Vote!!
1308892535859879938 2020-09-24 06:14:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Hope012015 So, Trump has determined that there is election fraud before any exists. Sounds like the Senate. They did a whip count on votes for the new Supreme Court Justice before there was a nominee.
1308841252822056963 2020-09-24 02:50:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @robertjdenault Halle-frikkin-lujah!
1308840982830624768 2020-09-24 02:49:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> is a hint of fraud. This isn't a contingency plan because it is a plan to cut out voters and go directly to electors. We would be deprived of our Constitutional right to vote. Is this not a conspiracy? We need to find out if any steps have been taken toward that end right now.
1308840981815537666 2020-09-24 02:49:41 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> A plan to declare the election fraudulent has already been floated. Trump is doing the same thing the Senate is. The Senate was whipping a count before there was a candidate for the Supreme Court. Now there are possible plans to declare the election fraudulent before there (1/2)
1308838076031131650 2020-09-24 02:38:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Perhaps we need impartial observers for this election.
1308828002533466112 2020-09-24 01:58:07 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump Oh look! A superspreader event.
1308827707854200836 2020-09-24 01:56:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump Bullsh*t. This is Russo-Trumpian propaganda.
1308824315949993984 2020-09-24 01:43:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @robertjdenault This is a coup. Nothing less. He must be stopped. Dems in the House and Senate better go up in the attic and retrieve those balls they packed away in 2016. They are going to need them.
1308822889303625729 2020-09-24 01:37:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The charge is only wanton endangerment and he is out on $15,000 bond.
1308811327784222721 2020-09-24 00:51:51 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kylegriffin1 Trump wouldn't recognize integrity, compassion or even just plain common sense if he tried until doomsday.
1308810797078982656 2020-09-24 00:49:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CNNPolitics They could give a sh*t. This is table pounding. They'll suddenly notice the deficit if Biden wins, too. Then they'll trot out their self-righteous anger. I call bullsh*t on all of it.
1308810065533689856 2020-09-24 00:46:50 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TeaPainUSA People enter the danger zone when they allow a political leader to convince then, for any reason, that allowing over 200,000 people to die is a good idea. It is a horror - the stuff of nightmares. That is radicalization.
1308808320954888195 2020-09-24 00:39:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kylegriffin1 I guarantee we aren't going to take this sh*t again.
1308757098789040131 2020-09-23 21:16:22 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> You have entered the danger zone when you allow a political leader to convince you for any reason that allowing over 200,000 people to die is a good idea. It is a horror - the stuff of nightmares. That is radicalization.
1308746871616286720 2020-09-23 20:35:44 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PamelaApostolo1 Political ideologues have been fighting "socialized medicine" since the 1950's. "Socialism" became a dirty word because of the "Red Scare" after WWII. Today, Ayn Rand variety politicians fight national healthcare tooth and nail. It is NOT what the American people want.
1308724178317606913 2020-09-23 19:05:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PostOpinions @MaxBoot He wants to indoctrinate and radicalize our children - like the Hitler Youth.
1308716557623795712 2020-09-23 18:35:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MSNBC We have video - not that it matters to the Trumpian zombies.
1308714033642700805 2020-09-23 18:25:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @AdrienneLaF The first was the Weekly Reader in school (more of a pamphlet, really) and then Mad Magazine.
1308713330157158403 2020-09-23 18:22:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @B52Malmet @darionavarro111 My daughter has been radicalized into Trumpism. Recently, she sent me texts spouting Russo-Trumpian propaganda. Her sister and I were alarmed that it didn't sound like her at all. We actually thought maybe a stranger had her phone and was texting. We had to confirm it was her.
1308643740622491655 2020-09-23 13:45:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis My favorite pre-Obamacare trick was when the uninsured arrived at a hospital sick or injured they were refused treatment.
1308638989641973760 2020-09-23 13:27:03 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TeaPainUSA This is upsetting. Trump doesn't care if people get sick and die. These are his own supporters and they are too blinded to see what he is doing to them.
1308585659620352001 2020-09-23 09:55:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ddale8 @aravosis It is so frustrating when people refuse to believe how much they will lose if Trump has another 4 years.
1308583370255990784 2020-09-23 09:46:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Hope012015 Bullsh*t.
1308582595228246017 2020-09-23 09:42:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @wesson6151 @Shareaholic This is a lie. The warning has nothing to do with liberals. It has to do with foreign entities spreading this information. Anyone want to take any bets on which American mouths this disinformation winds up coming out of?
1308550684749565952 2020-09-23 07:36:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Acyn The biggest hoax of all is Trump.
1308544545047678976 2020-09-23 07:11:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CNNnewsroom @brianstelter @brikeilarcnn Trump is the one who accused Biden of using drugs to enhance cognitive ability. To me, that's confirmation that it is Trump who does that. Duh.
1308478483291672583 2020-09-23 02:49:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @markknoller You completely lost me at "it bothers the President". I have to consider anything you just said as being a lie.
1308477791743213575 2020-09-23 02:46:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ThePlumLineGS So, at least 200,000 Americsns since March are nothing. That's spitting in the eye of all the grieving families and an insult to those still around. Somehow I take being regarded expendable personally.
1308476675953483776 2020-09-23 02:42:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ElieNYC Yep. And we might not have the time to squabble over it.
1308476304417841152 2020-09-23 02:40:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ChrisMurphyCT Squee!!! Pocket book opening....After hearing from Ms Atilla the Hun today, sharing a little green to save the country and my state feels like a privilege.
1308475148228603905 2020-09-23 02:36:00 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> All women owe a lot to RBG whether they are Republican or Democrat. Unfortunately, those who did not live through those times often take a lot for granted.
1308473611464970247 2020-09-23 02:29:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mgreek_gypsy @kylegriffin1 @maddow Don't let it stop you from voting. Please!
1308472973414854658 2020-09-23 02:27:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @EllenBarkin Exactly. Despite his feigned innocence, he knows what the issues are and he knows Repubs are cheating. He also claims not to be racist, but he supports a party that clearly is. The hypocrisy runs deep.
1308471897210982403 2020-09-23 02:23:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is the main issue in a nutshell.
1308470937533194240 2020-09-23 02:19:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> and how much he wanted to kill Social Security yet he had taken advantage of Social Security to go to college. (3/3)
1308470936547532800 2020-09-23 02:19:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> reject the truth if it isn't convenient. She'll pay lip service if pressed.  Ideologues damage Court and the country. The Court is meant to be objective, not answer to an overlord or some political bias. Her hypocrisy reminded me a little of Paul Ryan (2/3)
1308470935595503618 2020-09-23 02:19:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JoyAnnReid It would have been much more difficult for the possible Court nominee - Ms Atilla the Hun - to achieve success if it hadn't been for liberal RBG - that is, if she'd been able to achieve it at all. So many women take so much for granted or perhaps (1/3)
1308465434191106051 2020-09-23 01:57:24 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @elagwil @KevinMKruse Another fun fact. I'm certain that the possible Court nominee would have had a much harder time achieving the success she has - if she was able to achieve it at all - if it wasn't for liberal RBG. Some women really take it for granted.
1308452255872540674 2020-09-23 01:05:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @clairesandberg @shaunking @SenSchumer Is it entirely Schumer he's doubting or is he confident they can steal the election?
1308451810479403008 2020-09-23 01:03:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @brianklaas He's jealous of Pol Pot's 1.5 to 2 million dead. Pol Pot killed by starvation, disease and murder. So far, Trump's method is only covid. However, I really see no difference between the two men. It is still genocide.
1308450500971560962 2020-09-23 00:58:03 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @EricHolder This is the whole issue in a nutshell. We've spent the last 4 years catering to the greedy, the wealthy and privileged. The government must be returned to the service of the People.
1308449895620149248 2020-09-23 00:55:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @TimAlberta Under normal circumstances, I never would be in favor of adding justices to the court. The court is supposed to be objective, not political. This time, it may be our only choice to achieve parity.
1308448584824741893 2020-09-23 00:50:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @funder The majority of Americans do not want an ultra conservative judge on the Court &amp; I think a lot of Trumpers are going to figure that out, too. When Soc Sec, healthcare, women's reproductive freedom and so much more starts to disappear they will feel it just like the rest of us.
1308447070198665218 2020-09-23 00:44:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ChrisMurphyCT @darionavarro111 Typo! *prejudicial.
1308437402621485057 2020-09-23 00:06:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ChrisMurphyCT @darionavarro111 I started my adult life in the 60's. Brown vs the Brd of Education settled only in 1954. The Natl Organization for Women was still in the future in 1966. Old fashioned "values" that Repubs tout are nothing more than prejuducial societal restrictions. I lived it. Don't be fooled.
1308434273914023942 2020-09-22 23:53:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JenniferJJacobs @LauraLitvan This statement is snarky. Romney is not our friend. He knows damn well Repubs are cheating and he's willing to support it.
1308431319203012609 2020-09-22 23:41:50 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JenniferJJacobs @LauraLitvan This comment infuriated me. The majority of Americans want to wait until after the election. It is in the stars, Mitt. You just don't like my stars and will let them cheat us out of it. And besides, a court is supposed to be objective, not political.
1308429860390555648 2020-09-22 23:36:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @CheriJacobus Read the comments here. THIS is what panic gets us. People are talking about going to war. Others sound defeated enough that they may not bother to vote. Right now we have no choice but to work as hard as we can and stay the course. We have no chance at all if we do not vote!!
1308426207193706497 2020-09-22 23:21:31 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JenniferJJacobs A court is a place of justice. It is supposed to be objective. It is not supposed to be political. Placing ideologues on the court hurt the Court and the country. They SERVE the People of the United States not an overlord.
1308424677216473089 2020-09-22 23:15:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KCCINews Duh.
1308422709655883779 2020-09-22 23:07:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kdoright @joshrogin That goes without saying. What I'm saying is that people who plan to vote for Biden see through this bullsh*t like glass.
1308421766902153220 2020-09-22 23:03:53 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Romney just said that liberals have become used to a liberal court. "That's not in the stars." Never, ever doubt all the Republicans in the Senate are scum bags.
1308351914447429633 2020-09-22 18:26:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Salon @MalcolmNance This extreme politicization of the Supreme Court is wrong. Justice is supposed to be impartial and objective and not political. Placing ideologues on the Court damages the Court and our country.
1308348049962471425 2020-09-22 18:10:57 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @joshrogin Well, it's not working. People aren't stupid and can see who Donald Trump really is.
1308347401862893568 2020-09-22 18:08:23 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @GenMhayden @MalcolmNance He's talking about indoctrination - like the Hitler Youth.
1308344105219559426 2020-09-22 17:55:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MeretriciousPro @LindseyBoylan All you have to do is look at the record. You are spreading propaganda and I think you know it. I've seen your timeline.
1308342701335760897 2020-09-22 17:49:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kasie @MSNBC I'm worried about the election. That's kept me up on more than one night. I was a young woman just starting out in the 60's. Many of the "values" that the Repub party wants us to return to are nothing more than prejudicial societal restrictions. I witnessed it. Don't be fooled.
1308339540923494400 2020-09-22 17:37:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @bevredhm @KrauseForIowa Isn't that the truth! I always refer to Iowa politics as "shoot yourself in the foot politics". We consistently vote against our own best interests because of deep seeded traditional conservatism and fear of liberals. It's bred in and as a result, some people just don't think.
1308337217270673409 2020-09-22 17:27:54 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @lauraapollo @peterjukes If it was anything other than the disjointed rambling of a deteriorating mind could he mean withdrawal from NATO?
1308334934705217536 2020-09-22 17:18:50 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MeretriciousPro @LindseyBoylan Actually, this meme is true - and he said it in 1974 - 46 years ago. Since then, Biden's views have evolved and he has been consistently pro-choice. Therefore, this meme is a bogus attempt at trying to confuse people about Biden's real position on the issue.
1308331739127918598 2020-09-22 17:06:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Remember pre-ACA what happened when you got sick or injured and didn't have insurance? You could be rejected by the closest hospital and be sent, untreated, to a hospital that accepted the "indigent". Is this one of the "values" the GOP wants us to return to?
1308318540978626560 2020-09-22 16:13:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis I'm sick of this assh*le telling me I am nobody - that I don't count. I'm tired of his minions who refuse to believe how much they are going to lose if Trump gets 4 more years. If they think times are tough for them now, they ain't seen nothin' yet!
1308188973286797312 2020-09-22 07:38:50 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @nickconfessore @AnnHornaday She helped change my life for the better and the lives of every single woman I know.
1308152795628007424 2020-09-22 05:15:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @WalshFreedom Well...there's Trump....
1308136017430564869 2020-09-22 04:08:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @LindseyBoylan The "values" these people want us to return to weren't values at all. They were prejudicial societal restictions. I know. I was a young woman just starting out before the changes started happening. Take none of your rights as a woman for granted.
1308134762113044487 2020-09-22 04:03:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @jadedcreative You are right on point.
1308133710433341441 2020-09-22 03:59:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kylegriffin1 And then lack of attention span took over. He now seems bored by it.
1308097586826555393 2020-09-22 01:35:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DrLeanaWen @MaxBoot @CDCgov This is intentional genocide.
1308084765350862848 2020-09-22 00:44:45 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @mmpadellan He is going after Pol Pot's body count (1.5 to 2 million). Pol Pot killed his own people via starvation, disease and murder. Trump's instrument is covid via lies. I see no difference between the two men. Genocide is genocide.
1308083228289490944 2020-09-22 00:38:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kasie @MittRomney Limp as a dishrag. He knows very well what McConnell is up to. Just shows me that at heart, he's willing to support essentially an overthrow of legitimate American governance.
1308078927584296962 2020-09-22 00:21:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Laurie_Garrett Looks like Trump is going for Pol Pot status. Pol Pot killed 1.5 to 2 million via starvation, disease and murder. Trump is at least at 200,000 via covid. Imagine how many more will die if he isn't checked. I really don't see any diff between the two. Both are genocide.
1308077362978979840 2020-09-22 00:15:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MrMiah9 @CNNPolitics But it may be the only way to achieve parity. Dems were cheated out of Garland and now the Repubs want to cheat again.
1308075621264875520 2020-09-22 00:08:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @PoliticusSarah @politicususa Welp. There go more voters away from Trump.
1308072808514301952 2020-09-21 23:57:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @dr0lst0n He's likely jealous.
1308072260574605312 2020-09-21 23:55:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DavidWright_7 Yeah. I said that, too. Dude! You're in my spot!  https://t.co/iL4vUg9qIc
1308070998814724096 2020-09-21 23:50:03 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @djrothkopf Diplomacy has been all but forgotten. The United States is increasingly becoming isolated. That's a national security issue. Add in a population sick from covid and a bad economy and we start to become easy pickin's for an aggressor.
1308070114659635200 2020-09-21 23:46:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NewYorker Money is at the very heart of MAGA - and that doesn't mean money for the citizens. The fact that Trump supporters just don't see how much they could lose in a very short time breaks my heart. They mistake greed for strength.
1308068506504695809 2020-09-21 23:40:09 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JohnWDean It just floors me when I hear another woman say these things. What brings a woman to the conclusion that these things are good for our country (or for her fellow women). The people in government are supposed to serve, not control.
1308066770876616704 2020-09-21 23:33:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Eiggam5955 Many things torpedoed a woman in those days - and these are the traditional values people think we should return to. I couldn't sign for a mortgage or get a credit card yet I'd be held accountable for my husband's debts if something happened. My city had ZERO day care centers.
1308063997120389121 2020-09-21 23:22:14 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Eiggam5955 I just tweeted about that yesterday. I was a young woman starting out in the 60's - and I had an excellent college degree in hand. What I experienced over and over, if an employer would even hire a woman, was they would ask my typing speed and offer me minimum wage.
1308058863644667905 2020-09-21 23:01:50 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Interesting. The stock market is plunging this morning. Hey, Republicans! All your bullsh*t about SCOTUS and supporting a monster who does nothing to deal with covid is hitting you right in the pocket.
1308051931777167362 2020-09-21 22:34:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Do NOT let this cause doubt and confusion. Stay the course or our country js gone.
1308035696918224896 2020-09-21 21:29:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Trump's lies and lack of policy on covid have him on track to become the next Pol Pot. Pol Pot killed 1.5 to 2 million of his own people via starvation, disease, murder. Trump is on track to kill something like 6 million via covid. This is a crime against humanity - genocide.
1308032889901252608 2020-09-21 21:18:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @JYSexton I agree completely. Pol Pot killed 1.5 to 2 million people. Trump's lies and lack of any reasonable policy could put something like 6 million people under the axe if he's allowed to continue. This is genocide. Many of these deaths did not have to happen.
1308030142887976961 2020-09-21 21:07:42 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @artist4ever Happy birthday to you! Happy to see you will enjoy your day nonetheless. I have a daughter in the same boat.
1308028992021319686 2020-09-21 21:03:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This is horrendous. This is pure authoritarianism. These people must be stopped cold. There is no alternative.
1308014411320381442 2020-09-21 20:05:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NBCNews It's called indoctrination - just like the Hitler Youth.
1307851607053402114 2020-09-21 09:18:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KCCINews Yeah. Punish the kids. Reynolds is a grade A jerk.
1307763075571945476 2020-09-21 03:26:28 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Hope012015 Translation: I want to indoctrinate your children like the Nazi Youth.
1307517793169027072 2020-09-20 11:11:49 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @maxasteele It would be helpful that once Trump is out of office (please, please, please) that the press doesn't report every crazy utterance the man makes. That's what got him in office in the first place. We don't need him continuing to divide the country.
1307449466543378432 2020-09-20 06:40:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek He's trying to purchase defecting Republican women.
1307342242399629314 2020-09-19 23:34:14 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek I'm so sick and tired of these assh*les manipulating the law to suit their purposes.
1307341192183545857 2020-09-19 23:30:04 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Here are phone numbers for Mitch McConnell. Please let me know if there are errors.  502 582-6304  859 224-8286 202 224-2499   270 781-1673 606 864-2026
1307331429441953797 2020-09-19 22:51:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump @GOP Power and importance? That's not who you were elected to be - you made that up yourself. That's clearly fascist.
1307307086511067140 2020-09-19 21:14:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Many young women don't realize how much they owe RBG. They take for granted rights they have as women they wouldn't have had if it wasn't for her. I was a young woman just starting out in the 60's. It was a very different world back then and I do not want to go back.
1307198826462302208 2020-09-19 14:04:21 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump Biden just announced a plan to help Puerto Rico. Trump is playing games. Is the check really in the mail or will it suddenly go missing after the election? Even if PR gets the money, the way Trump insulted then ignored PR likely isn't forgotten.
1307195870375481344 2020-09-19 13:52:36 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @djrothkopf Absolutely. McConnell seems impervious to shame. The only way to defeat McConnell is to strip away his power.
1306939406360760322 2020-09-18 20:53:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Bill Barr and everyone else in the Trump regime will continue to ignore this.   https://t.co/2UwRURktbj
1306532056990724097 2020-09-17 17:54:51 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KCCINews Reynolds is trying to defend the morally indefensible. Nothing new to see here. Reynolds' wishy-washy policies and lies have resulted in 1248 covid deaths in Iowa (as of Sep 16) - that we know about.
1306526795622240257 2020-09-17 17:33:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The bubonic plague killed 75,000,000 to 200,000,000 between 1346 and 1353. Though rare, it is still around to this day. There was a death from it in New Mexico this year and there was a case in California. This is the truth of herd immunity.
1306517340364984321 2020-09-17 16:56:22 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KrauseForIowa We need to legislate some of the norms. Unfortunately, we can't trust ourselves if we don't.
1306024543916568577 2020-09-16 08:18:10 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @peterdaou I would not trust a rushed vaccine particularly one pushed by the Trump regime.

1304865273812578307 2020-09-13 03:31:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @aravosis I call for international monitors. And, someone tell that huge, sucking black hole laughingly called a president that we will exercise our Constitutional right to protest if we wish.
1304839210638217219 2020-09-13 01:48:05 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @map_59 @pbartosz7 @repjacoby Sound bites! Do my research! LOL!!!  If you only knew how ridiculous that is! Let me put it this way, I've done my homework on historical matters for about 55 years or so. "Socialism" is used in the United States as a trigger word.
1304837128606670848 2020-09-13 01:39:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @RudyGiuliani You got caught and now want to whine. Stay off the TV shows if you can't deal with it.
1304795734005477377 2020-09-12 22:55:19 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @pbartosz7 @repjacoby The systems of those countries remain socialist. It's not pure socialism any more than we are pure capitalists. The fear is communism, not socialism but somehow Americans have managed to demonize socislism. It has become a political buzzword for clutch the pearls.
1304756464221933569 2020-09-12 20:19:16 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @pbartosz7 @repjacoby Do you even know why socialism is supposedly so scary? I'm a capitalist but get tired of this demonization without facts to back it up. You do know Great Britain is socialist, right? They haven't sprouted horns and a tail as far as I know.
1304752514072535041 2020-09-12 20:03:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> This could have happened in the United States, too.
1304751622959116288 2020-09-12 20:00:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> him politically instead of protecting themselves and their neighbors against the disease. They have been blinded to the fact that Trump is a huge, sucking black hole of a creature who is only using them to get what he wants. (2/2)
1304751622157983746 2020-09-12 20:00:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The very fact that any conversation about coronavirus quickly devolves into a fight between those who think Trump craps rainbows and those who don't should be the first clue. Politicization of a disease is ridiculous and deadly. Trump has manipulated people into protecting (1/2)

1304624850858840064 2020-09-12 11:36:17 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @LeaKThompson I absolutely agree. Though, the ones who may be the most damaged are his gaslighted, radicalized "fans". They don't even know they've been abused and follow him slavishly. It's scary.
1304618743138484224 2020-09-12 11:12:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @democraticbear Very happy for Canadians! At the same time, it makes me furious because this could have been us in America if it wasn't for Tump and his zombie "fans" and enablers. My state is cursed with a flaccid, Trump loving fool of a Governor who even makes it worse.
1304615319340756993 2020-09-12 10:58:25 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Sarah_Boden Gov Kim Reynolds is a mini Trump and the state is suffering because of it. I'm so TIRED of basically having no life at all in order to protect myself from covid. All these selfish, maskless assholes and Gov Reynolds make any real improvement completely impossible.
1304500888913031170 2020-09-12 03:23:43 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @maddow More than 33% of a school near me in Des Moines area is sick with covid or in quarantine. It is long past time for Gov Kim Reynolds to get her shit together. Her flaccid covid management is killing people and it doesn't have to be this bad. Iowans are begging for HELP.

1304085557140692992 2020-09-10 23:53:20 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @NBCNews Whatever Woodward did or didn't do, this is still on Trump. Trump is guilty. Trump is trying to claim he's inocent because Woodward didn't stop him? Oh please! That's ridiculous.
1304078862733762560 2020-09-10 23:26:44 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @BenSpielberg @shaunking And, we get to worry about this if we can get Trump out of the White House. There will definitely be no medical care or measures to protect the planet if we can't do that first.

1304076539227787266 2020-09-10 23:17:30 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @nickconfessore Well, the point is whatever Woodward did or didn't do, Trump is still guilty. Is Trump seriously trying to blame Woodward for not stopping him?
1304074300484452353 2020-09-10 23:08:36 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> If Governors Reynolds of Iowa and Noem of South Dakota would stop competing to be the Republican Party pinup, perhaps the Upper Midwest would be a lot safer from covid.

Iowa is one of the states in the top three per capita for cases of covid. The Governor, Kim Reynolds has politicized coronavirus from the start and insists
1303352295510495238 2020-09-08 23:19:37 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump Millions heard you bash McCain and the military, genius. I think you might have to accept that there are a lot of folks that see right through you.

He is saying there were 19 people who heard this conversation? Millions have heard him bash McCain and the military and know this whole mess is likely true, given Trump's "character".

1302577934692225025 2020-09-06 20:02:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> A huge point here is that other countries that have managed coronavirus better than the United States has been able to do so because they have comprehensive health care systems.

1302574250679828480 2020-09-06 19:47:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @StevenBeschloss All this trouble for a money hungry sociopath who just doesn't want to go to jail. He won't do any work in a second term, either. Are his most powerful supporters compromised in some way, too? McConnell has Russian ties, there was the mysterious July 4 Russian trip.
1302570064437276673 2020-09-06 19:31:18 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @KrauseForIowa Epstein wasn't poisoned as far as we know but I'm still wondering what happened to him. And we hear nothing at all about Maxwell, either.

1301919598938386435 2020-09-05 00:26:35 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @GlennKesslerWP Unacceptable! On top of the news via the Atlantic, this is too much.
1301905103998377984 2020-09-04 23:28:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @toddzwillich @JeffreyGoldberg It's mentioned in John Bolton's book published before the Atlantic article came out.
1301862690873323520 2020-09-04 20:40:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Trump has nothing to do with this. If anything, by keeping Americans sick with coronavirus, he's stalled the economy. Imagine where it could be now if this was all done properly.   https://t.co/ZnInQGesuZ

1301536479898992640 2020-09-03 23:04:12 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @chrislhayes I've talked to seniors about this. Several seem to think that they will be grandfathered in and their benefits will continue. I vaguely remember hearing something like this from Trump long ago but am not finding it. Anyway, it is a misconception that needs to be addressed.
1301532888085737472 2020-09-03 22:49:56 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @tjcalvin12 @TommieClarkKCCI @KCCINews @KimReynoldsIA I agree the big corporations are benefitting while the little guy is getting hurt. Perhaps if Mitch McConnell would stop blocking legislation &amp; grabbing money for his donors there could be relief for the little guy. Meanwhile, bar patrons are causing a problem.
1301529136008245248 2020-09-03 22:35:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @6022jsm @PalmerReport This is exactly what I was going to say. It's about control. The ones that perplex me are the women who go along with it.
1301528217359187972 2020-09-03 22:31:22 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @SykesCharlie The term "The Radical Left" is nothing more than code for "brown skinned people".

1301522851598565376 2020-09-03 22:10:03 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @thesarahkelly My daughter has had the same problem. Student loans become a lifetime sentence.

1301520633562570753 2020-09-03 22:01:14 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @markknoller @PressSec @FoxNews It just amazes me how open Trump needs someone to interpret what he says. He does the damage and then has someone put a bandaid on the gaping wound.

1301516303874883585 2020-09-03 21:44:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Biden is open to new ideas and opinions. He wants a VP that challenges him. Facts matter. He cares about the People.    Trump only wants people who agree with him and are loyal to him alone. Facts? What's a fact? People are pawns to be used.
1301380618572500992 2020-09-03 12:44:52 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @ClydeHaberman @mkraju If Biden is elected (please, please, please) we are going to see all kinds of Republican table pounding over the Debt. It's bullsh*t now and it will be bullsh*t then.
1301345732859961344 2020-09-03 10:26:15 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @tribelaw As much as I want my life back I don't trust anything coming from the Trump regime. They've told the States to prepare to distribute a vaccine Nov 1 but don't even know which vaccine.

1301133034054389761 2020-09-02 20:21:03 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @kylegriffin1 We all know why. It's just all so insane and frustrating.
1301109707864780801 2020-09-02 18:48:22 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump No. You don't. Violence is wrong on the Left or the Right. I'm not seeing you gloat over arrests of Proud Boys or members of other Right wing groups.
1301106708685754368 2020-09-02 18:36:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Newsweek You have also been accused of the same so maybe you should stop pointing your finger at him.
1301105834622169088 2020-09-02 18:32:59 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump You do realize that Law and Order includes responding to subpoenas. No one is above the law. So, I find it difficult to buy that you are a law and order president.
1301104879830740993 2020-09-02 18:29:11 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump @CNN CNN said nothing about strokes. Read your own tweet.
1301104466255544322 2020-09-02 18:27:32 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump Nope. The normal process of ballots being counted particularly because people want to vote by mail safely because of the pandemic.

1301100194373738499 2020-09-02 18:10:34 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump America was great. Now, not so much. Biden isn't president. You are. What happened?
1301008986838368257 2020-09-02 12:08:08 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @politico What he's talking about is indoctrination of our children in schools.
1301000628156669965 2020-09-02 11:34:55 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @Hope012015 Sure. If it's mutual. Call his bluff.
1300942462324744198 2020-09-02 07:43:48 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> The top news today is the same it has been since March. Donald Trump has failed to control coronavirus. As a result, over 180,000 Americans are dead and our economy is in shambles. There are Americans who can't pay the rent and aren't sure where their next meal will come from.

1300876588477808641 2020-09-02 03:22:02 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @DNosknih @duty2warn I thought he looked just fine - and he isn't carrying around all the extra weight Trump is.

1300873314345398281 2020-09-02 03:09:01 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @realDonaldTrump You've lied so often that few trust what you say. Americans have a right to know about the health of the president - and it wasn't for a physical. So?
1300802000683139077 2020-09-01 22:25:39 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> Getting lost in the Trump noise: People are still dying from coronavirus. People are are afraid because they've lost their jobs and can't wait for Trump to be ousted before help arrives. Flip the script, VP Biden. Take control of the news cycle.
1300788361364471809 2020-09-01 21:31:27 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @juliaioffe Yup. 2020 is a bitch.
1300787433395703809 2020-09-01 21:27:46 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @jlock This is getting lost in the news cycle. People feel abandoned and are afraid. They can't wait until Biden is elected but need help now.
1300783355156467713 2020-09-01 21:11:33 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MilesTaylorUSA Basically, if he can't get his way he'll burn it all down. Frankly, even if he does get his way, he'll still burn it all down. Trump never has understood consequences.
1300782331251298305 2020-09-01 21:07:29 +0800 <GaelicjennyL> @MT4tk @tribelaw I sincerely thank you for the thought. That means a lot.
