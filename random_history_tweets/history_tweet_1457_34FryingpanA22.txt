1320957691313983488 2020-10-27 13:17:10 +0800 <34FryingpanA22> @KamalaHarris The term affordable is an oxymoron considering The ACA actually raised up the price of deductibles and monthly insurance premiums most people couldn‚Äôt afford it so they didn‚Äôt lose anything if the ACA goes awry. Talking about things being shoved down peoples throats.

1320904583166607360 2020-10-27 09:46:08 +0800 <34FryingpanA22> @SenSchumer what we need is a stimulus package and the truth about COVID-19 I have family members that work directly in hospitals with patients and guess what it's all a hoax and you're part of it. N1H1 was a lot worse. why don't you go out there and tell the truth #impeachChuckietheClown

The largest hospital chains in the US are controlled by the socialist CEO's. employees are threatened with dismissal if they don't report inaccurate Covid cases which are really flu.

1320869307455131650 2020-10-27 07:25:58 +0800 <34FryingpanA22> every major hospital chain is controlled by a socialist. they are all in on the COVID-19 BS  which is not as bad as the H1N1 virus. The reports of increased cases are false. I still have two family members that are involved in healthcare in hospitals. are the ones I get my info
