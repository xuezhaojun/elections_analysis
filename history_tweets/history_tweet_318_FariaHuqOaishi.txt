1338918374185701376 2020-12-16 02:46:30 +0800 <FariaHuqOaishi> This looks amazing!
1337871219182297088 2020-12-13 05:25:29 +0800 <FariaHuqOaishi> This is very interesting. Imagine how many people will have access to AI who do not own a costly GPU. Unlike GPU, smartphones are cheap and easily accessible for everyone.
