1343633300158439424 2020-12-29 03:01:56 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Looks like Canada to me:
1343627879641276416 2020-12-29 02:40:24 +0800 <RealCoachClay> This is the promoted ad paid for by tax payer money by the Alberta government:  You're disgusting @jkenney
1342932410216763392 2020-12-27 04:36:51 +0800 <RealCoachClay> This 👇 is exactly how to deal with a situation in regards to our rights and freedoms:
1342532069738483712 2020-12-26 02:06:03 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @BoooogReeeeeee Except Justin Trudeau and Chrystia Freeland  They can go rot with George Soros.
1342523602411814912 2020-12-26 01:32:24 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Merry Christmas everyone!    I love you all!

1338857797908189184 2020-12-15 22:45:48 +0800 <RealCoachClay> JT Trudeau still owns a soft wood lumber company.    And the Trudeau's have big stocks in Irving oil.  That's why he continues to bring in Saudi oil to the east through Irving.
1338648416327323649 2020-12-15 08:53:47 +0800 <RealCoachClay> This shows how corrupt our government is:
1338549479243276288 2020-12-15 02:20:39 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @Prem_S That's past next years mayors election...  Wake up people

1338542499304931329 2020-12-15 01:52:55 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Today is the day Dec 14 for Calgary city council to review the 'temporary face covering' by law in council meetings.  2 months ago Mayor Nenshi used as reasoning a poll of 500 Calgarians on global news as validation.   What will he use this time to extend it?
1338540486965878785 2020-12-15 01:44:55 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Medical Maleficence   Medical Fraud
1338539565645119489 2020-12-15 01:41:15 +0800 <RealCoachClay> RICO:  Money Laundering.    $485 million more to places unknown.  Treason.
1337471077354639364 2020-12-12 02:55:28 +0800 <RealCoachClay> The Carbon tax announcement is a distraction.   Just saying.
1337074289380487168 2020-12-11 00:38:46 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @dbongino @IETruthSeeker @CodeMonkeyZ To imply that you don't know who Ron @CodeMonkeyZ is... is to imply you are stupid.  Don't play coy.
1336497354891960320 2020-12-09 10:26:14 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @CanAditude Patriots' Soapbox the only 24/7 internet news channel run by volunteer Patriots!   Join me, we need more Canadian voices!!
1336387053001474049 2020-12-09 03:07:56 +0800 <RealCoachClay> The Mayors want to implement more control measures before the Justice Center's @JCCFCanada lawsuit hits the courts...
1335986801010298880 2020-12-08 00:37:29 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @Blood_And_Fire_ I agree, she spoke it in her best nlp voice as she could.  She's well trained at subversion.

1335351324309786624 2020-12-06 06:32:20 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @randyhillier @michaeltaube Wasn't it Harper who tried to make it where they could confiscate peoples bank accounts to bail out the banks?  Same theory.
1335295956506460161 2020-12-06 02:52:19 +0800 <RealCoachClay> PM Trudeau and Chrystia Freeland  - This is evidence of their treason:   You can not transfer that amount of wealth without corruption.   Prove me wrong.
1335294006008287232 2020-12-06 02:44:34 +0800 <RealCoachClay> This could be big:  Justice Centre takes Alberta to court
1335258329883394048 2020-12-06 00:22:48 +0800 <RealCoachClay> 'Conspiracy theory'  - One of the only words left [they] have to keep people brainwashed.
1334903756845019136 2020-12-05 00:53:51 +0800 <RealCoachClay> A True reenactment of Trudeau putting his make up on:
1334532933093261312 2020-12-04 00:20:20 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @craig_jasman Calgary city planners really fucked up the downtown core when they installed the 'plus 15' walkways.    It eliminated 90% of foot traffic on sidewalks outside that had store fronts, retail, food, bars - they all disappeared.  Back in the day downtown had all the good places to go
1334324156456816644 2020-12-03 10:30:44 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @CashMooo Not Patriots.... the sheeple.  Too many sheeple.  People like yourself need to keep standing up for freedom.  I stand with you, not against you.
1334322200870940672 2020-12-03 10:22:57 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @cazzjenkins You didn't think they have been ballooning Chrystia Freeland to her great heights because of her merit did you?  🤣
1334321284994383877 2020-12-03 10:19:19 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @greg_scott84 Canadians are the most brainwashed cowards in the world.
1334320715483414529 2020-12-03 10:17:03 +0800 <RealCoachClay> I fully agree with this message:
1334251362834554880 2020-12-03 05:41:28 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Since when is it against the 'face covering' by law for not wearing a mask outside, whether it be an event or not?
1334247522546507779 2020-12-03 05:26:13 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @TeddyBearA11 Any sauce or links on tanks going through Toronto?  ...you sure they're not just on the way to a bbq place?

1333123411787227139 2020-11-30 02:59:24 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @LeighStewy @6ixbuzztv Any time I make a video to post now I put my name on a watermark on it.....prevents this from happening unless they want to give you the credit.    I see larger accounts do this all the time, regurgitate someone else's work as their own for clicks and followers...
1333079239537561600 2020-11-30 00:03:52 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Laundering Money.  No other reason.   $12.8 million to create jobs in Kenya, layoffs immediately follow
1332818444350148608 2020-11-29 06:47:34 +0800 <RealCoachClay> They can't stop Freedom once the masses have awoken.
1332759503977271296 2020-11-29 02:53:21 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Why is Doug Ford's head put on a green screen here making him look like he's in a suit?
1332445760164511744 2020-11-28 06:06:39 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Fake News Headline: ' 88 per cent of Canadians'  Sample size: 1001 Canadians  Population of Canada: 37,868,047 million  This is why you are the Enemy of the People:
1332423962106552321 2020-11-28 04:40:02 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Are you scared to be an Individual, or happy to be a submissive Slave?
1332409206276648960 2020-11-28 03:41:24 +0800 <RealCoachClay> I challenge any one like this to have a discussion about masks outside...let's go chat.    Sick of Cowards.    Eat my toxic masculinity.
1332366188270129152 2020-11-28 00:50:28 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Anybody see the figure of how much they 'fundraised' ??  It was a 'grassroots' style -   Not sure if that means George Soros can donate or not...
1332348309285916672 2020-11-27 23:39:25 +0800 <RealCoachClay> This:
1332037574353956866 2020-11-27 03:04:40 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Meanwhile cops carry the luggage of illegal immigrants walking through Roxham Road....   Just a disgrace.
1332035556507746305 2020-11-27 02:56:39 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Independent Member of Parliament arrested for attending lockdown protest:   Can we get any more Communist today Canada?
1332033461461209088 2020-11-27 02:48:19 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Alcohol is essential but exercise isn’t.   Yeah, because Ford is fat and likes to drink.
1332021386387152901 2020-11-27 02:00:20 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Patriots sing the National anthem while cops block a small business with horses and men like Commies
1332016169969094656 2020-11-27 01:39:37 +0800 <RealCoachClay> They started to serve food inside and the cops arrested the owner Adam just now.     Communists.
1332015864334356480 2020-11-27 01:38:24 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Police bringing in the horses to push back  Patriots.    All this about opening a small business to serve food.  This is fucking Canada in 2020
1332015367539965952 2020-11-27 01:36:25 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Police still Obstructing Patriots
1332006136422100992 2020-11-27 00:59:45 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Police take an Oath to NOT obey UNLAWFUL orders.    Remember that.
1332005413433212928 2020-11-27 00:56:52 +0800 <RealCoachClay> What kind of show is this by the police in Ontario?  Do they actually believe that Patriots will stop?
1331978919147257856 2020-11-26 23:11:35 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Police in Ontario pulling Nazi behavior:
1331704877467111424 2020-11-26 05:02:39 +0800 <RealCoachClay> There are no group rights - only Individual rights.
1331661341937995777 2020-11-26 02:09:39 +0800 <RealCoachClay> I might not have very many followers, but unlike many, I have a platform.    I have a show on one of the most censored channels on the internet - Patriots' Soapbox.    Help me use my platform to get the word out.  Come on my show to speak out against our government tyranny  https://t.co/PXKXaWsaa5
1331658764932448258 2020-11-26 01:59:25 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Fucking Imbeciles.
1331657664988807169 2020-11-26 01:55:02 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Do you see [their] play here?   Gave him a Summons for operating without a business license today.  Still no fine under the public health orders.    The first Unconstitutional case on covid blows their whole game down.   They don't know what to do...  PANIC.
1331656097422209024 2020-11-26 01:48:49 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Why would we need a 'local' state of emergency if we have a 'Provincial' one...  This is Mayor Nenshi's continual backroom play from his 'Federal Municipalities' UN usurping.
1331367232815788033 2020-11-25 06:40:58 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @TheWedgeLive @PierrePoilievre That's not alex soros, it's one of Trudeau liberal MPs...you know..the one with the ties to muslim brotherhood...
1331340941215502336 2020-11-25 04:56:30 +0800 <RealCoachClay> From a Patriot that has seen it all:
1331340269531271168 2020-11-25 04:53:50 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Hidden in plain sight.    Key word 'adopted'.... the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.    Adopted means shit.  It's all globalist foolery
1331087176684109824 2020-11-24 12:08:07 +0800 <RealCoachClay> h/t @TrumpCanuck for the audio clip of the kids!
1331087129670152192 2020-11-24 12:07:56 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Trump Broke the Media.   Would be a shame if this went viral  https://t.co/SUImc2aslF
1331050648280866816 2020-11-24 09:42:58 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Thanks for the correction!
1330947325712166915 2020-11-24 02:52:24 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @FordDar @AnnetteA66 That's not Alex Soros.  It's one of Trudeau's liberal MP's who is connected to the Muslim brotherhood.
1330945665707360256 2020-11-24 02:45:49 +0800 <RealCoachClay> There is a reason why politicians are putting the ONUS on  UNELECTED public health officials.    Guilty of Medical Malfeasance lies on them, not the politician for unconstitutional and false restrictions
1330931252191395844 2020-11-24 01:48:32 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Exposing the fraud of city elections:
1330929858306658305 2020-11-24 01:43:00 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Liberal Mayor of Edmonton who is guilty of crimes against the people will NOT be seeking re-election:    Leaving before the human rights law suits arrive?  Or is it because DOMINION systems was used in your election?   City of Calgary - Same boat.
1330928972490625024 2020-11-24 01:39:29 +0800 <RealCoachClay> What do you think happens after these *new* lockdown restrictions DON'T work?    Do [they] just end the lockdowns?    NO - [THEY] WILL MAKE MORE RESTRICTIONS OF RIGHTS.  Why is it so hard for some people to realize this only goes in one direction.
1330901912305057793 2020-11-23 23:51:57 +0800 <RealCoachClay> One good law suit challenging the unconstitutional dracone measures   Any Lawyers up to the task????
1330895683214213120 2020-11-23 23:27:12 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Lesson here - Don't be a snitch!!
1330891424062029824 2020-11-23 23:10:16 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @Connie_Alberta Just a rumor, not true.
1330645070488301568 2020-11-23 06:51:21 +0800 <RealCoachClay> "Special grassroots fundraiser"  by the PM and Deputy PM Freeland -    What the fuck kind of hogwash is this even?    A fundraiser for who?  Your puppet master George  Soros?
1330249831605006336 2020-11-22 04:40:49 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Does this do ANYthing but increase control and limit sales/business ?    What really is [their] argument here?...less covid will be spread by these items not being sold?    Give me a fucking break.    It's literally against the Nuremberg code:  https://t.co/VkT7D5XkiS
1330245907602870277 2020-11-22 04:25:13 +0800 <RealCoachClay> What cycle is being used in Alberta?  @jkenney
1330222880400011264 2020-11-22 02:53:43 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @mikef656 @jkenney Meaning they don't know what covid is.  They have not isolated the virus from other similar viruses like the common cold or flu.   They can not distinguish it.
1330215777664962561 2020-11-22 02:25:30 +0800 <RealCoachClay> It is medical malfesence to propagate that covid-19 is deadly serious or ANYthing at all.  AHS has not ISOLATED the virus -   @jkenney care to respond and tell the people your thoughts on a Non-isolated virus?
1330214744851099650 2020-11-22 02:21:24 +0800 <RealCoachClay> G20 Summit Nov 21-22 includes not just the G20 countries...  But the UN, IMF, WHO, and every other globalist unelected body:   The whole G20 is illegitimate.
1330212401191522308 2020-11-22 02:12:05 +0800 <RealCoachClay> It is this simple.  Business owners and the people have rights.
1330171978460880905 2020-11-21 23:31:27 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Even the WHO says NO to contact tracing and quarantines:
1329956538400743425 2020-11-21 09:15:22 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Round up the Turkeys!!
1329909517258166272 2020-11-21 06:08:32 +0800 <RealCoachClay> "...in a few months, a few years..."
1329894721305464832 2020-11-21 05:09:44 +0800 <RealCoachClay> A De facto government is not responsible for anything, remember that.
1329277483045117952 2020-11-19 12:17:03 +0800 <RealCoachClay> The Prime Minister again showing he sides with the Chinese dictatorship CCP:
1329184728667226114 2020-11-19 06:08:29 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @RudeTrue yes, but it's just a motion...
1329179333521330176 2020-11-19 05:47:02 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Opposition Motion to change foreign policy on China passes:
1328800054644068352 2020-11-18 04:39:55 +0800 <RealCoachClay> How about adding when he paid Hillary Clintons stooge Warren Kinsella to slander/defame/cancel Maxime Bernier during the last election?    I think there's a few more as well if others want to add...
1328789963735846912 2020-11-18 03:59:49 +0800 <RealCoachClay>  https://t.co/PzZp2ieEAL
1328789563163086848 2020-11-18 03:58:14 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Sorry Brett.    Acknowledging my responsibilities IS insisting on my rights.
1328773433908346880 2020-11-18 02:54:08 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Don't forget MP Monsef committed immigration fraud to get to where she is right now:
1328769616559017984 2020-11-18 02:38:58 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Great video by Mayday check it out:
1328767557331947520 2020-11-18 02:30:47 +0800 <RealCoachClay> People who are naysayers of Bernier don't get it....  It doesn't matter who the leader of the PPC is, it's the values, principles and platform of the PPC that people are voting for.    Max could step down and no one would falter.
1328766211136471040 2020-11-18 02:25:26 +0800 <RealCoachClay> More Unconstitutional recklessness from Canadian politicians:  Putting the enforcement of unconstitutional restrictions on a 3rd party is also [their] attempt at distancing themselves from law suits.
1328760084499894272 2020-11-18 02:01:05 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Are ANY of these 'thugs' actual police forces, or are they all UN NATO forces?
1328753517515816961 2020-11-18 01:35:00 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Here's the deleted video from the World Economic Forum where [they] tell you how they will own you and you will like it:

1328362965397999616 2020-11-16 23:43:05 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Mayor's in cities in Canada (like mayor Nenshi) have agreed to this behind closed doors, in private.    No Mandate by the People on this subject has ever happened.    No Public discussion.  Just politicians pushing an agenda that [they] are benefiting off financially with payoffs

1327903662417485826 2020-11-15 17:17:59 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Trudeau is the laughingstock of the global elite.    This display of offensive smugness again proves his ego is bigger than his IQ.
1327403521751224320 2020-11-14 08:10:36 +0800 <RealCoachClay> "Canada has purchased ten doses for each of its citizens, the most for any country or alliance on a per person basis...”  Why the fuck would we each need 10 doses of a vaccine?   @vankayak
1327356755454554113 2020-11-14 05:04:46 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Considering there is only 106 people in Ontario population over 14million and only 67 on ventilators, there is no logic that warrants ANY shutdown:  https://t.co/mGdKkLCX2R
1327324255730561024 2020-11-14 02:55:37 +0800 <RealCoachClay> 'Liable' for Slander/Defamation type crimes can not be proven if what is said is actually true.    That's why no one gets sued by Trudeau/Freeland etc  [They] know how easy it would be to prove acts of 'Treason'.
1327322106598547456 2020-11-14 02:47:05 +0800 <RealCoachClay> When a country is led by a 'De Facto' government,  nothing is 'illegal'.  Make sense now?

1326626188924657664 2020-11-12 04:41:45 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Mayor Nenshi's involvement with the UN Smart City bike lane initiative is one of the biggest disasters of his term in office.  Millions of tax payer dollars wasted.  Collectivism vs. Individualism  Cloward-Piven  And get this folks -THE BIKES ALREADY USED THE ROADS  So Stupid.
1326342170920378368 2020-11-11 09:53:10 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @AlbertaLeonidas Premier Kenny hasn't implemented any new lockdowns, so Trudeau had to call Mayor Nenshi directly today to see what they can muster on their own...  48hr watch to see what Nenshi does next
1326339760848216065 2020-11-11 09:43:35 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Can we please hear the audio transcripts of your call PM Trudeau with Mayor Nenshi?
1326320934584635392 2020-11-11 08:28:47 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Fake News Canada headline says 67 % of Canadians would back a curfew:  A poll of 1500 Canadians out of 37 million.   See why they are the Enemy of the People?

1325164563277389824 2020-11-08 03:53:46 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Jason Kenney is a globalist puppet.   The media does not decide who is elected, the usa constitution does.

1304131261422661632 2020-09-11 02:54:56 +0800 <RealCoachClay> If I knew a lawyer that would support my case I would sue the @cityofcalgary today.    Pretty easy cases to win, in my opinion.    Any Lawyers here in Calgary that will support Freedom?    Anyone have any suggestions?

What about the people who 'identify' as Black - do they count as 'Black entrepreneurship?  What is 'Black'?

1303368220116619265 2020-09-09 00:22:53 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Mayor @nenshi, do you have any response regarding the safety of these masks you 'require' for people who live in Calgary under your 'Temporary face covering'  bylaw?   Does the Mayor believe he is not liable for what happens to the health of people?  Or does he not care?
1303362924988084224 2020-09-09 00:01:51 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Mayor @nenshi,   the people of the city of Calgary request to see what medical science, testing, and factors you used to decide on the 'Temporary face covering' bylaw.    What say you Mayor:
1303357421251772421 2020-09-08 23:39:59 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Take the mask off.  Stop follow orders from tyrants.  You can lead others to FREEDOM.    Every voice counts.  #WWG1WGA
1303357019059924995 2020-09-08 23:38:23 +0800 <RealCoachClay> I just love men with long thumb nails:  https://t.co/XVf2yThT8D
1303340543884230656 2020-09-08 22:32:55 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Well doesn't this just say it all:
1303114809026650112 2020-09-08 07:35:55 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Government Tyranny:
1303113423899615232 2020-09-08 07:30:25 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Calgary has highest unemployment rate in Canada and also has youngest on avg population...  The perfect mix for bringing in an Universal Basic Income and keep young people out of the workforce:
1302684723399987201 2020-09-07 03:06:55 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Just plain Truth:
1302663514545291264 2020-09-07 01:42:38 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @JaePark10899177 @DavidMilley22 @JustinTrudeau It's actually not slander if it can be proving true.    That's how our law states it, and in this case of Trudeau, the courts would not even attempt to defend him, the evidence is beyond statistical probability.
1302662681069977600 2020-09-07 01:39:20 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @MapleSu83765869 @presscoreca These are the great lawyers that testified in the hearings last year.  Thank you for share, they are doing great work.  @LWDoyleUSA Please continue to help Canadians to expose the corruption ties between CF &amp; Trudeau foundation and any other RICO type crimes!!
1301996975978622989 2020-09-05 05:34:03 +0800 <RealCoachClay> I would vote for Brett Wilson @WBrettWilson for Mayor.   As a successful entrepreneur, I have no doubts that he would run the city of Calgary like a business &amp; turn the city around.    And I don't have to agree with everything he says to still know he'd be a good leader.
1301630888657133568 2020-09-04 05:19:21 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @SeirX @greg_scott84 @PierrePoilievre Thank you, I forgot.  I did it now.
1301630771396923392 2020-09-04 05:18:53 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @greg_scott84 @PierrePoilievre  Please respond sir!
1301628517600227328 2020-09-04 05:09:56 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @greg_scott84 Looks like it was going directly to help fund Chrystia Freeland's connections in Ukraine:    Part of a $5 billion dollar bail out  https://t.co/GDMDRo1gKr
1301628263307984896 2020-09-04 05:08:55 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @greg_scott84 Here's the sauce on Morneau's transfer:  https://t.co/VZA5FTb493
1301625626005127169 2020-09-04 04:58:26 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @greg_scott84 How about Pierre Poilievre or Michelle Rempel or their new leader O'toole point out that Morneau, just before he left, on orders from Freeland &amp; Trudeau, transferred over $3 billion to the IMF?    Why are they silent on matters as such? #PartoftheProblem

1301202644606816257 2020-09-03 00:57:40 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @MaryMenopausal Trudeau sold the last reserve stocks of gold we had in 2016.  And has not bought any since.    Canada literally has 0 gold reserves.    How's that for an easy target for Usurpation
1301202107333324811 2020-09-03 00:55:32 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @WCCanadian That's what my show usually is...casual talk between Patriots!    Keep up the great work!    And so glad to hear you got yourself and your puppy home, that was a travesty.
1301200982613737472 2020-09-03 00:51:04 +0800 <RealCoachClay> @WCCanadian I would extend an offer to any female who would like to come on my show on the Patriots Soapbox News Network including yourself Jordan!    More Canadian voices need to be heard!!   Patriots Soapbox - Where Free Speech is welcome.
1301196708806668289 2020-09-03 00:34:05 +0800 <RealCoachClay> A person may also be found guilty of inciting an offence even if committing the offence incited is impossible – see s11.4(3)Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).  Get that last part?    GUILTY EVEN IF COMMITTING THE OFFENCE INCITED IS IMPOSSIBLE  #Unfuckingbelieveable
1301196334095937538 2020-09-03 00:32:35 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Further, the incitement need not be acted upon for the offence to be committed – the offence is complete upon the incitement reaching the audience. The mens rea for the offence is that the offender intends that the audience or person incited will carry out the offence incited [3]
1301196181091971073 2020-09-03 00:31:59 +0800 <RealCoachClay> Aussie Law states: "The offence of inciting another to commit a crime is established even if the communication/incitement is directed at the world at large hence, there need not be a specific or intended audience eg. banners or posts in newspapers or websites [2]  Continued...
