The Williams Institute estimates that 0.6% of the population identifies as transgender.  0.6% * 18,830 = 113  If the actual number is only 37, shouldn’t we actually try to figure out the transgender secret to avoiding murder?

1328788311142404097 2020-11-18 03:53:15 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @SimonTimony 2. It is much more efficient (much less jobs destroyed) and fair to impose the cost of subsidizing low wage workers on the broad economy through taxation using whatever logic you use to distribute tax burden, and then give cash to workers.
1328786827881287681 2020-11-18 03:47:22 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @SimonTimony 1. A minimum wage imposes the cost of subsidizing low wage workers on some combination of other low wage workers (who become unemployed) and employers of low wage workers (who pay more).  Employers of low wage workers are not necessarily the most profitable businesses.
1328786560687325185 2020-11-18 03:46:18 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @SimonTimony Below is a good explanation of the standard economist argument against the minimum wage from AEI.

1328746301094182918 2020-11-18 01:06:19 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @Jobaria1 If going to college and paying the cost of going to college made people *worse off* than if they had mot gone to college, then that would be a big problem.  Mostly people are made better off on net, and converting their student debt into national debt is unfair and a bad idea.
1328744788917514241 2020-11-18 01:00:19 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @Jobaria1 But the idea that “families are being crushed” by student debt is not exactly consistent with the data.

1327423029370966016 2020-11-14 09:28:07 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @PlateauUkok You have to be patient and/or a lawyer (I am both) to read through pages of text to the part that says “Prohibition of Discrimination and Preferential Treatment”.

It buries legalization of racial discrimination in state employment and education beneath a whirlwind of other policy issues like free covid vaccines, and the Dem AG proposes giving it ballot language that makes no mention of racial preferences.
1327400677711048709 2020-11-14 07:59:18 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> Washington’s legislature pushed to make discrimination legal again in 2019, and voters rejected it. Now Washington Democrats are coming back to try again in 2021.  California Democrats will do the same. We must get state senators to commit to vote NO, or we must vote NO on them.

The University of California does minority outreach now. It does not involve discrimination between students based on race and so does not violate our constitution.

1325617231485566977 2020-11-09 09:52:31 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> These numbers are based on final October PPIC and Berkeley polls, after allocating the undecided voters in each subgroup in proportion to the decided voters in that subgroup - which is reasonable because this allocation of all undecideds yields results very close to actual vote.
1325611035844206593 2020-11-09 09:27:54 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> Based on final polls, the Californians who voted for legal equality and against Prop 16 were a broad coalition.  28% of them were Democrats, 34% were Independents, 39% were Republicans.

1324125567726219264 2020-11-05 07:05:11 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @BusinessTrash @robnormal @UofCalifornia @UCPrezDrake Here is UC Berkeley’s hierarchy of racial preferences from 1993, before California voters amended our constitution to outlaw this practice.  For example, in category “B” being black is equivalent to being both latino and disabled.   https://t.co/5i0CfkeuxV  https://t.co/0TR7DfrEjq

1324070263000985600 2020-11-05 03:25:25 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> Prop 16 from 30,000 Feet:  Our political establishment lives in a bubble where “equality” is a bad idea that must be replaced.  A super majority of the state legislature, blinded by this, walked out on a political limb that a double digit majority of voters cut off behind them.
1324054820391563264 2020-11-05 02:24:03 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> Some people are angry this morning.  I’m singing.  “The colors of the rainbow So pretty in the sky Are also on the faces of people passing by.  I see babies crying I’ll watch them grow They’ll learn much more Than I’ll ever know.  And I think to myself, WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD!”  https://t.co/iSAblSz7v4

1323904223654768642 2020-11-04 16:25:38 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @ricshar333 Total votes counted in current returns are 11 million.  Total ballots cast statewide as of 3pm today were 13 million.  https://t.co/c6w6Wkeq0x
1323903117331623937 2020-11-04 16:21:14 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @ricshar333 You’re right, that’s only partial returns in 73.3% of precincts. But really it’s more than 73.3% of votes counted given counts of early and mail votes.
1323900422076026880 2020-11-04 16:10:32 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> With 73.3% of votes counted, Proposition 16 is currently:  55.6% No 44.4% Yes  Equality wins. Prop 16 loses.  The margin of victory for Equality will be even greater in 2020 than it was for Proposition 209 in 1996.  Which is as it should be.  https://t.co/BNkMVV3ck1
1323871759238524928 2020-11-04 14:16:38 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> In my personal opinion, Prop 16 has been defeated.  With 60% of votes counted, #NoProp16 is leading by 10% and is doing better than polls in every county.  #YesOn16 needs to win remaining votes by more than 20% to win, an impossibility given trends.  https://t.co/I8H08VT6Wk
1323856717520646146 2020-11-04 13:16:52 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> Returns are also looking good for #NoProp16 in the Bay Area! We are also gaining No votes there over our Berkeley IGS poll numbers.  Bay Area (Contra Costa, Santa Clara, Alameda, San Mateo, San Francisco)  Poll 40% No Results 43% No  Victory for Equality Under Law is near!  https://t.co/jSwU4Sbcj8
1323849564659445760 2020-11-04 12:48:26 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> Returns are looking very good for #NoProp16!  The Berkeley IGS poll showed No Prop 16 winning 49% statewide. So if we gain anything we win.  Orange County: Poll 59% No Results 62% No  San Diego: Poll 52% No Results 58% No  Los Angeles: Poll 42% No Results 45% No
1323762682818822144 2020-11-04 07:03:12 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @aidanaras I like my chances in Orange County, where our activists are the most energized and the Berkeley poll showed Prop 16 behind by almost 2-to-1.  https://t.co/ra9MAtITWx

1323693313258479616 2020-11-04 02:27:33 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @steamyporkbuns @BUCAblog I can absorb all of your animosity toward me based on my race and gender without returning any.  Because your resort to ad hominem attacks validates rather than disputes my point.

1323485734234324992 2020-11-03 12:42:42 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> 59% of the world population lives in Asia, and less than 59% of UC Berkeley students are classified as “Asian” by UC.  But UC Berkeley still wants the power to racially discriminate against them in the name of reflecting “the diversity of the world”.  I suspect other motives.

1323128276798169088 2020-11-02 13:02:18 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> I sat down with Spectrum News last week to explain why I oppose Prop 16.  I told them I oppose it on principle, and because non-discriminatory affirmative action is still legal. But the reason that made it into the program was discrimination against Asian Americans.  #NoProp16  https://t.co/kZ9vc8cOsB

1322048429061595136 2020-10-30 13:31:22 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @RobBonta Yale racially discriminates against Asian Americans so heavily that while 62% of Yale’s top applicants by GPA and SAT are Asian, only 27% of students admitted by Yale are Asian.  Prop 16 would bring this racism to California.  Everyone should get #MyShot without regard to race.

The moderator starts out describing Prop 209 as “imposed on California by voters”.  If there was an actual quote substantiating their accusation about white nationalists, it would be the most newsworthy part of this article.
1321525139897339905 2020-10-29 02:52:00 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @mzinshteyn Nothing in the text of the article substantiates the claim he said that about white nationalists. I’m listening to the podcast now.  I would assume a journalist would want substantiation before (re)publishing such a claim.

1321461967257620480 2020-10-28 22:40:59 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> This 1993 report from the Committee on Admissions at UC Berkeley provides a window into what #Prop16 would return us to:  White students on average had to have these scores to be admitted: 3.85 GPA 1261 SAT  Asian students: 3.95 GPA (max 4.0) 1282 SAT   https://t.co/5i0CfkeuxV
1321442782687318020 2020-10-28 21:24:45 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @kothaikannan That is odd. #Prop16 would ALLOW government to discriminate based on national origin, and #S386 would STOP government from discriminating based on national origin.  Do you have examples?

1321138473047191552 2020-10-28 01:15:32 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @El63813694 I was quoting *you*.  And the only thing the proposition says is that the state shall now be allowed to discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to individuals and groups on the basis of race.  aka state sponsored racial discrimination.
1321122459177734144 2020-10-28 00:11:54 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @latimes I know all journalists see the world through the lens of their own worldview, and this can affect reporting.  But the @latimes goes way beyond that on Prop 16. You  stand out among news outlets in your overt distortions on behalf of your preferred outcome.  Readers beware.

1321119315681181702 2020-10-27 23:59:24 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @latimes Your reporters and editors seem to have no shame, no limits on the distortions and misrepresentation you will publish to push this proposition to allow state government to racially discriminate.   https://t.co/o5hTnqpVGs
1321117326696087554 2020-10-27 23:51:30 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> Today’s article in the LA Times is yet more disgusting political hackery. It sets up a despicable distortion of Cruz’s advice in the opening paragraphs.  I was an LA Times subscriber a month ago, but I have developed a scathing disregard and even hatred of the @latimes now.

It goes hand in hand with earlier policies of denying entrance to all refugees and proposing to cut legal immigration in half.  I look forward to President Biden.
1320517226588368896 2020-10-26 08:06:55 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @El63813694 This thread os about how it is easy for whites to advocate for race-based admissions when they impose all of the burden on non-whites, and indeed whites often benefit.  I have addressed other aspects of this proposition a thousand other places.
1320516777550344192 2020-10-26 08:05:08 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @El63813694 The preamble to Proposition 16 refers directly to the federal court decision upholding Harvard’s race-based admissions system that suppressed the acceptance of Asian American students.  So it is highly relevant to how Prop 16 authors would use the power to racially discriminate.
1320515991873359873 2020-10-26 08:02:01 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @El63813694 umm ... maybe read all of the evidence presented in the rest of my thread right below that tweet.

1319982301573308417 2020-10-24 20:41:19 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @latimes Hey @latimes! We know you are an arm of the #YesOn16 campaign.   You are not real journalists seeking to inform readers of things that are true or objective or impartial.  Let me count the ways the LA Times is full of !@#! on Prop 16 with nine tweets from them:
1319981019634622468 2020-10-24 20:36:13 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @latimes A summary:  1. Here’s an Asian female saying Prop 16 would allow more students who look like her at UC. No rebuttal.  2. Here’s an Asian female saying Prop would discriminate, and an expert explaining why she’s wrong and Prop 16 is about allowing things that are already legal.
1319856370229727232 2020-10-24 12:20:55 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @SophiaL81330160 @latimes The entire video is designed to convince people to vote in favor of Prop 16 by setting up and then tearing down the argument against Prop 16. If the YesOn16 campaign were to produce this video they wouldn’t change a thing.  Because they did produce it.
1319854899593506816 2020-10-24 12:15:04 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @SophiaL81330160 @latimes This @LATimes video is manipulative lies.

It is the California state legislature voting by a two-thirds super majority to amend our constitution and legalize racial discrimination. It is the San Francisco school board saying merit is racist.
1319050908789948416 2020-10-22 07:00:18 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @PlateauUkok The faculty don’t even have power.

1319041578728476672 2020-10-22 06:23:13 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> What happens when you face racial discrimination in admissions in all but 9 states, and the best universities where you are treated equally are the University of California campuses?  The UC becomes a popular option.
1319040590118490112 2020-10-22 06:19:17 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @mzinshteyn You know what I will say....  ... it’s because they don’t get as many competing offers outside California, where they are racially discriminated against.
1319035608409387008 2020-10-22 05:59:30 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> Yes, race-based policies would likely discriminate against Californians classified as white when applying for state jobs or competing for state contracts.  But most rich white guys aren’t looking for a state government job or contract, while their kids are applying to college.
1319005357398585344 2020-10-22 03:59:17 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> Or as I put it more succinctly a month ago ...
1319003149240160257 2020-10-22 03:50:31 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> But they know if #Prop16 passes that it will not be THEIR kids who will be racially discriminated against when they apply to college.  It will be the only racial group that the UC calls “over-represented” — Asian Americans.  Their piety hides their racism.  https://t.co/yit0AU8hkQ
1319001856765358085 2020-10-22 03:45:23 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> When the California state legislature passed the constitutional amendment now on the ballot as Prop 16, over and over lawmakers in favor of legalizing racial discrimination said this was appropriate because “race matters!”  They said “we all know in our hearts that race matters”  https://t.co/2Y1RZkQD9K
1318993976955842560 2020-10-22 03:14:04 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> When interviewers point out that race-based admissions to increase “under-represented” racial categories at the University of California would mean “more white students, but the number of Asian American students would be reduced by over 50%”, #YesOn16 lawmakers just shrug.  https://t.co/TkPydcK5QI
1318989244648415232 2020-10-22 02:55:16 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> At Yale, we just discovered from data revealed by the Department of Justice that   the top 10% of Yale applicants by GPA and SAT were:  62% Asian 33% White  while the 7.1% of Yale applicants actually admitted were  27% Asian 38% White  https://t.co/pV2CfMEZLx
1318988249537208325 2020-10-22 02:51:18 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> The data made public in litigation revealed that Harvard’s admissions system had no net negative affect on white applicants relative to a strictly GPA and SAT system, and that it was specifically Asian American applicants that Harvard systematically gave low “personality” scores.
1318986295587209216 2020-10-22 02:43:33 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> Separately, Espenshade and Chung studied 124,374 applicants under current “race conscious” admissions compared to a “race neutral system” and found white enrollment would be unchanged but Asian American enrollment would be MUCH higher in a race-neutral system.  https://t.co/A81h9C86An
1318984749927460864 2020-10-22 02:37:24 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> Espenshade found an Asian American had to score MUCH higher than a white student on the ACT to have equal chance of admission.  But, as an advocate of race-based admissions, he denied this proved a racial bias against Asians because Asians might be inferior on “soft variables”.  https://t.co/nZLH2K19dq
1318983476041764864 2020-10-22 02:32:20 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> Thomas Espenshade and Alexandria Radford favor race-based admissions. But their study showed that at competitive public universities, the racial bias AGAINST Asian applicants relative to whites was as strong as the bias in favor of black students.   https://t.co/i1F3YxTXlg
1318982474857291776 2020-10-22 02:28:22 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> Race-based college admissions discriminate against Asian American children and have either no effect or actually benefit white students.  That is why rich white guys like this can support it to signal their virtue, while pushing down others not like themselves based on race.

1318227555825143814 2020-10-20 00:28:35 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> The story of what happened at the California League of Cities was shared with me by @wu_wenyuan of @CA4equalrights. Wenyuan was present at both the committee meeting and the full board meeting, helping to press members to vote no.
1318218614944591873 2020-10-19 23:53:03 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> It may very well be that Proposition 16 is headed for defeat in no small part because a significant number of Democrats still believe this ...  [crowd spontaneously shouting “race doesn’t matter!”]  https://t.co/wSZNvVG5NK
1318216481650266112 2020-10-19 23:44:35 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> But the Race Matters brigade came up exactly 1 vote short of getting the California League of Cities to endorse Prop 16. Only 30 public YES votes with 31 votes required.  It was supposed to go differently! Democrats were supposed to control the League.  Now comes Nov 3.
1318215492440522753 2020-10-19 23:40:39 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> “There’s a mistake!” they shouted. “We demand a revote, an open and public roll call vote!” they insisted.  The bylaws said that they weren’t entitled to call for a public roll call vote. But they got it anyway.  One by one the board members voted publicly. More YES this time...
1318214449254158336 2020-10-19 23:36:30 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> When the motion to endorse Prop 16 went before the full board of the California League of Cities, board members voted by secret ballot as they usually do. 31 votes were required for the League to endorse.  The result: only 24 Yes votes.  The Race Matters brigade was furious! ...
1318210951938678784 2020-10-19 23:22:36 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> This fear by some Democrats of speaking out against the Prop 16 Race Matters brigade reminds me of the recent vote by the California League of Cities refusing to endorse Prop 16.  The policy committee, whose members vote publicly, recommended Yes on Prop 16.  But then...
1318205981747154944 2020-10-19 23:02:51 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> I keep getting messages from Democrats who tell me they oppose Prop 16 but are afraid to speak out.  They are professors, party operatives or candidates afraid of retribution.  They feed me data, point me to outrages, ask me to make their points, or just offer encouragement.

1317960053253533696 2020-10-19 06:45:37 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @ThouArtThat Prop 16 will give CA state government more leeway to discriminate between Californians on the basis of race and sex because federal courts interpret the 14th Amendment and Civil Rights Act as allowing some of it, but interpret Sec 31 of CA constitution as prohibiting all of it.

I agree with UCLA law professor Sander, who I quoted, that as legal matter “affirmative action” includes much more than the racial discrimination/preferences the general public thinks about when you use the term “affirmative action” and that UC did in fact do as he says.

1316759848206262274 2020-10-15 23:16:26 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @ECalifornians Racial discrimination by state government, apparently.
1316628431325417472 2020-10-15 14:34:14 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @lukemacdonald The arguments in favor suggest that state government needs to racially discriminate between applicants to ensure that a diverse mix are hired or accepted.  But state employees and universities are already diverse while also treating all applicants equally regardless of race.
1316627003747913729 2020-10-15 14:28:34 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @lukemacdonald Prop 16 is a measure to allow CA state government to discriminate between applicants to state jobs and universities based on their race, sex, ethnicity or national origin.  It is expected to result in a bias against Asian applicants to the UCs because so many apply.  I’m opposed.
1316572264586862592 2020-10-15 10:51:03 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> What does this even mean?  Whenever I see the term “model minority myth” it is usually a guilt-trip to prevent Asian Americans from objecting to discrimination against them.  But I’m not sure if that’s what is going on with this word salad.
1316554010971660288 2020-10-15 09:38:31 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @JurgenSaysRelax I am pretty sure they initiated Prop 16 to influence the Supreme Court by eliminating our current example of colorblind admissions leading to diversity. That’s why the preamble to Prop 16 cites the pro-Harvard decisions in that case.  Now it could backfire with opposite effect.
1316553241153339392 2020-10-15 09:35:27 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @JurgenSaysRelax Decide that all race-based admissions violate the 14th Amendment — essentially eliminating the current difference between the 14th Amendment and Prop 209.

But politically they will know that all of the winds are blowing in their favor this year. So if they lose, I think it will be a very long time before they try again. And if they lose, it could also embolden the Supreme Court to act.

1315173195612184589 2020-10-11 14:11:39 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @ThisIsIWT As for lining up with rhetoric, #Yeson16 is the one focused on treating students as representatives of a race. The #NoProp16 wants students treated equally as individuals regardless of race, which means admissions will look like the  applicants rather than the population.
1315171854395432961 2020-10-11 14:06:19 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @ThisIsIWT So I get these “proportions of representation” for 2019 CA resident UC students / CA population:  Latino 31.5% / 36.6% = 80% White 20.6% / 36.6% W = 56% Asian 40.3% / 15.1% = 267% Black 4.5% / 5.8% = 78%
1315169117008089088 2020-10-11 13:55:26 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @ThisIsIWT Look at CA resident UC students if comparing to CA population, and use a consistent number of significant digits.

1314614793970483201 2020-10-10 01:12:45 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @a_centrism That’s already the narrative: whites and Asians vs Blacks and Hispanics.  What I am pointing out is more corrosive to the other side’s “Fight White Supremacy!” narrative ...  That their race-based admissions system HELPS whites relative to admissions strictly on SAT and GPA.

1314542657398472707 2020-10-09 20:26:07 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> In contrast, Yale’s race conscious admissions system admitted White students at HIGHER rates than White students appeared in the top 10% of applicants by SAT and GPA.  The top 10% of applicants by SAT and GPA were 33% White.  The 7.1% of applicants admitted were 38% White.
1314540854174863360 2020-10-09 20:18:57 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> The top 10% of applicants by SAT and GPA = 2836 Asian, 4576 Total.  The 7.1% of applicants admitted = 918 Asian, 3289 Total.  https://t.co/6J7tvTPUBS

The top 10% of Yale applicants by SAT and GPA were 62.0% Asian.  The 7.1% of Yale applicants actually admitted were 27.9% Asian.
1314520656659185668 2020-10-09 18:58:41 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> Yale preferred Whites over Asians.  Yale admission rates for students whose SAT and GPA put them in the top 10% of all non-athlete applicants:  White 20.18% Asian 14.32% Black 60.00% Hispanic 34.84%  https://t.co/FMWVd6kiQj

Race-based admissions do not grow the pie, they do not increase the budget or increase the number of seats in the freshman class. They cannot lift anyone up without pushing exactly the same number of people down. On the basis of race.

Asians are the only “over-represented” group.  The preamble to Prop16 quotes directly from the cases upholding Harvard’s policy suppressing Asian enrollment.
1314260116439408646 2020-10-09 01:43:24 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> The progressive college town of Evanston IL adopts a policy preventing certain races from entering school.

1314256656688050181 2020-10-09 01:29:39 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> So a black superintendent is literally standing in the school door only allowing certain races to enter and prohibiting any little white or Asian kids from coming to school.

1314246409823023105 2020-10-09 00:48:56 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @realSamWeber @scottzabielski Right now students are accepted in very similar to the racial proportions that they apply.   Latinos are the largest ethnic group, Asians the second largest. White students are 21% of the student body.  But #YesOnProp16 says this is not “diversity”.
1314244915035922432 2020-10-09 00:42:59 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @realSamWeber @scottzabielski At the Univ of California, Californians who apply are: 38% Latino 31% Asian 21% White 6% Black  But overall California population is: 39% Latino 14% Asian 37% White 5% Black  So #Prop16 would mean a racial bias against Asian students because “too many” apply compared to pop.
1314244032277540864 2020-10-09 00:39:29 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @realSamWeber @scottzabielski It all depends on how you define “equality”  #YesOnProp16 wants to use racial discrimination by state government to get outcomes that are equal to and “represent” the racial proportions of the population.  #NoProp16 wants equality for all individual applicants regardless of race.

The only difference now is that the well bottom is a horizontal line, not a pinpoint, and so the volume of water pumped to fracture rock is much greater.

1313211422638129152 2020-10-06 04:16:16 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @KQEDForum @1KatieOrr Proposition 16 would allow California state government to racially discriminate against anyone who applies for a state job or university if “too many” people like them apply compared to the overall population - such as Asian American students applying to UC.  No #Prop16  https://t.co/blpRhLLMIT
1313210127483170817 2020-10-06 04:11:07 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @brittniisright @KQEDForum @1KatieOrr Proposition 16 only applies to state government. It does not apply to “biz”  Numbers don’t lie, but California’s numbers are not “atrocious”. Our universities are the most diverse and best in the nation at lifting up poor and first generation students, without regard to race.

1313186934542409728 2020-10-06 02:38:57 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @David_desJ @1ruthlessmom Also, if he is lodging accusations of divisiveness then he has apparently not seen the #YesOnProp16 ads portraying opponents as tiki torch wielding “white supremecists”   Or maybe he has.
1313185115149758466 2020-10-06 02:31:43 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @David_desJ @1ruthlessmom I presented evidence to him that the UC intends to push student admissions in a way that means a bias against Asian students, and that this bias is heavy enough to reject 1 out of 4 who’d otherwise be admitted in the universities they would imitate.  He is in denial.  https://t.co/DvDCNwlYXZ
1313184876699348993 2020-10-06 02:30:47 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @David_desJ @1ruthlessmom He responded and immediately blocked. Clever trick to have the last word for all other readers of the thread.
1313182161181175808 2020-10-06 02:19:59 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @David_desJ @1ruthlessmom It’s the same context - admissions policy of the University of California.
1313181736839176192 2020-10-06 02:18:18 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @David_desJ @1ruthlessmom The measure of discrimination would not be whether Asian enrollment was held constant. That is what Harvard and other racist universities have done since the 1990s.  The measure would be whether admissions numbers decline relative to application numbers.
1313179160110538753 2020-10-06 02:08:04 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @David_desJ @1ruthlessmom And I am not the one interpreting “represent” to mean “proportional to the population”.  That is the University of California’s own use of the word. They label groups “under-represented” and “over-represented” by a comparison to the proportions of the state population.
1313178608366571521 2020-10-06 02:05:52 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @David_desJ @1ruthlessmom As you likely know, quotas that force the student body to “exactly” match the racial proportions of the population has been prohibited by federal courts, but using a racial bias against some races and in favor of others as “one factor” to push in that direction has been upheld.
1313149489591382018 2020-10-06 00:10:10 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @David_desJ @1ruthlessmom The UC Regents would have all the authority they need if Proposition 16  passes. There would not need to be any legislative process around how to conduct UC admissions.
1313149020873715717 2020-10-06 00:08:18 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @David_desJ @1ruthlessmom Again I disagree.  The preamble to Proposition 16 directly quotes from the federal court decision upholding Harvard’s race-based admissions policy that suppressed Asian American enrollment.  You are ignoring evidence from all sides and the clear statements of the UC Regents.
1313143670451781633 2020-10-05 23:47:02 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @David_desJ @1ruthlessmom The UC President, talking this year about why the Regents want Prop16 to allow consideration of race, said that race is “pretty central to the student’s identity!”  The UC press release said that the racial composition of the student body “must represent” the state population.
1313142372306362370 2020-10-05 23:41:53 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @David_desJ @1ruthlessmom We don’t have to compare to a hypothetical UC policy. We can look at UC policy before 1996 and we can look at current policy at other universities that have race-based admissions.  Or we can look at current UC statements of intent...

1312082524747649024 2020-10-03 01:30:25 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @mzinshteyn So Stanford had 10% Black and 23% Asian, while UCB had 4% Black and 40% Asian?  And the reality of the state outside them was 5% Black and 14% Asian?
1312078867511746560 2020-10-03 01:15:53 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @mzinshteyn So he chose a university where he was more comfortable because it had more people like him and fewer Asians, who were excluded through a system of racial discrimination.

1310264669999828992 2020-09-28 01:06:55 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @MSCollegeOpp @yesprop16 @yeson16 would give them more power — the power to racially discriminate.  The same UC Regents who used their power to corrupt admissions with family connections unrelated to a student’s aptitude want to corrupt admissions with race - which is unrelated to a student’s aptitude.
1309946958094594048 2020-09-27 04:04:27 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @JenYao2012 Thanks to everyone who came out to our Orange County #NoProp16 sign meetup this morning!  We distributed a few hundred signs to people to put in front of their homes and assembled several hundred more.  Here’s the early bird assembly crew who showed up before the pictures above:  https://t.co/FCl7KyI7X6
1309623811323514880 2020-09-26 06:40:22 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @mzinshteyn No, you are the one who first brought up SAT scores. I did defend them, but not ad the only or best measure of academic aptitude.  The study I cited about a race-neutral system did not use only SAT scores.   https://t.co/TI93XyYmj3
1309621744559206401 2020-09-26 06:32:10 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @mzinshteyn You argued race-based admissions are “narrowly tailored” because that’s what courts say.  I offered more than one reputable large sample study showing a massive impact detrimental to Asian American students.  I have not seen any response from you that defends “narrowly tailored”.
1309613547421229056 2020-09-26 05:59:35 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @mzinshteyn Currently UC is less racially biased than other competitive universities.   But if subjective criteria in the UC admissions process “compensate” for differences in objective measures among racial groups, that’s just an admission that the subjective criteria have a racial bias.
1309612017473351680 2020-09-26 05:53:31 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @mzinshteyn This does not dispute the findings of the studies I pointed to that 1 in 4 Asian Americans who would be admitted in a race-neutral system nationwide are rejected by the current system, and Asian American students must score 140 points higher than white students.
1309600108338540545 2020-09-26 05:06:11 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @mzinshteyn Not surprisingly, I agree with this assessment.   https://t.co/LTExPIibMo

1309599214352048128 2020-09-26 05:02:38 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @mzinshteyn Yes, if you tear down the idea of merit then it is easy to say equal outcomes by race is better than the ruins of what you have torn down.  But the UC faculty disagreed with your assessment of SATs and merit. They do predict college performance.  https://t.co/Uj0lBXIySh
1309598196465692672 2020-09-26 04:58:35 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @mzinshteyn @1ruthlessmom @RealAhmadAli Thanks!
1309598024365039616 2020-09-26 04:57:54 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @mzinshteyn But what is the point supported by your data point? What are you trying to say by pointing out that Asian American students are “over-represented”?  Is your objective that students be treated equally regardless of race, or is it something else?   https://t.co/Lr83crBRvf
1309591375839723520 2020-09-26 04:31:29 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @mzinshteyn It is important to remember that at top universities nationwide, Asian American students must score 140 points higher on the SAT than White students to be accepted.  Claims of “narrowly tailored” racism do not match reality.   https://t.co/Vl4AozTrOT

1309546744921767936 2020-09-26 01:34:08 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @aborunda @townerman1 @junecutter Nope. Prop 16 will open the floodgates for the UC to racially discriminate against “over-represented” Asian Americans.   https://t.co/rr8DvsG1IC Regents want to push students to
1309544736336703489 2020-09-26 01:26:09 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @aborunda @townerman1 @junecutter Wrong.  Race-based admissions are no longer limited to remedy past discrimination. Courts now justify them everywhere on a theory that certain racial proportions affect learning.  1 in 4 Asians who would be admitted in a race-neutral system are rejected by race-based admissions.  https://t.co/aIc5cTXGpa

1309532057215746050 2020-09-26 00:35:47 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @aborunda @townerman1 @junecutter He is saying that this corruption affected less than 100 students, and race-based admissions will affect thousands of students.  He did not say, as you alleged, that admissions “based on money is cool”. He said it was “corruption”
1309527811615416320 2020-09-26 00:18:54 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @aborunda @townerman1 @junecutter He is literally saying the opposite, and you know that perfectly well. He called preferences based on money “corruption”.
1309316784504225794 2020-09-25 10:20:22 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @S386Advocate I agree.   https://t.co/mL4VpfYLcS
1309310264035037184 2020-09-25 09:54:27 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @mzinshteyn @1ruthlessmom @RealAhmadAli I don’t hate on your reporting, it is excellent. I disagree with your assessment that race-based admissions have a minor effect. I enjoy sharing some quantitative studies with you.
1309298346750697472 2020-09-25 09:07:06 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @1ruthlessmom @mzinshteyn @RealAhmadAli I think what Mikhail is saying is that he invites us to send him materials about the extent that federal courts have allowed racial bias in college admissions against Asian Americans despite the 14th Amendment.  For his reading pleasure.
1309296611156062208 2020-09-25 09:00:12 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> This is a distillation of their statements and not an exact quote of course. They would never be so explicit.  What they do say is they want to use race-based admissions to “represent” the state by reducing over-represented groups.  Asians are the only over-represented group.
1309293210670301184 2020-09-25 08:46:41 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> Californians want equality under the law regardless of national origin.  Prop 16 would amend our constitution to allow state government to discriminate between applicants to state jobs and universities based on national origin.  Defend equality.

I assume the audit does not answer @1ruthlessmom’s question about who was hurt by UCB, UCLA and UCD giving the name, native language and place of birth of applicants to readers.
1309252943497969665 2020-09-25 06:06:41 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @townerman1 @edifiquest @RealAhmadAli Just one bulk printing with a single design for our shoe string budget.  But that’s a good idea. Maybe a second run with “equality” in all 8 languages most spoken in California.  https://t.co/Pxf8azTq0B
1309236907633553409 2020-09-25 05:02:57 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> The problem with #NoProp16 signs is that as soon as you put one up your neighbors want one too.  Good thing I have extra!  https://t.co/SJoZWpQzi5
1309234068316278785 2020-09-25 04:51:40 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @1ruthlessmom @RealAhmadAli That’s big.   So most UC campuses did not show readers information that suggests the race or ethnicity of the applicant — the applicant’s family name, native language, and where they were born — but three of the most competitive campuses did show readers that information.
1309223699824869376 2020-09-25 04:10:28 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @RealAhmadAli They were “wrongly admitted” because they were admitted on the basis of something unrelated to their capabilities as a student.  Race is also unrelated to your capabilities as a student.  Say NO to race-based admissions. Say NO to #Prop16.  https://t.co/XwLGNGIL3n

Well, the UC student body is also more diverse than ever. And the majority-white UC Regents still want to discriminate between applicants based on race.

I am pointing out that Asians apply to the UC at higher rates, and I am saying that all applicants should be treated equally regardless of race, as they are now, rather than instituting a racial bias against Asians because “too many” apply.
1309017319302213633 2020-09-24 14:30:23 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @Kusandra @Aerosmith888 @alexandrashlee Wrong again. UCs successfully conduct outreach under current law, without racially discriminating.   https://t.co/JNLNgu40o0

Many universities already discriminate against Asians (see above).  That’s why whites, blacks and latinos all accept UC offers at the same rate but Asians at higher rates. Fewer other offers.

The UC wants Proposition 16 ao they can use race to push the student body to represent the population rather than reflect the applicant pool - to reduce “over-represented” groups and increase “under-represented” groups.  Asians are the only over-represented group.
1308992826991091720 2020-09-24 12:53:04 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @Kusandra @Aerosmith888 @alexandrashlee Asian Americans I talk to are asking for equality under the law and equal opportunity regardless of race.  That should be good enough for anyone to oppose Proposition 16. But for me it’s personal since the state government will place my children in the Asian category.

1308811614854852609 2020-09-24 00:53:00 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> The California Democratic Party was too extreme to endorse their own sitting Senator in 2018, and instead ran a left-wing opponent against her. She won anyway with support from independent and Republican voters.  Now this. 😎

This would mean a heavy bias against Asians, the only “over-represented” group.   https://t.co/xwCM1aVwXp

1306996119243616256 2020-09-19 00:38:52 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @latimes So Prop16 isn’t quotas, it’s just that there are too many Asians?  “the inability to consider race in admissions hobbled efforts to fully represent the state’s broad diversity”  “Asian Americans are over-represented, making up 19.9% of the eligible pool and 33.5% of UC students”  https://t.co/gRV0Umg0Yv
1306950522822254595 2020-09-18 21:37:41 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @tobeequal This is so true (and funny).  The quotas are baked into their very words. They define individuals as “over-represented” or “under-represented” with the clear goal of getting a result to “represent” the overall population rather than reflect the individuals in the applicant pool.
1306787868094930946 2020-09-18 10:51:21 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @Momatwork3 Nicely phrased 😎
1306748536986284032 2020-09-18 08:15:04 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @michelleqchang The fact that most of the country already has Prop 16 is why they already racially discriminates against Asian American students, such that studies find Asians need 140 points higher on the SAT than Whites, and Asian admissions would be 25% higher in a race neutral system.
1306747875737567232 2020-09-18 08:12:26 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @michelleqchang I don’t think that is correct. Most of the country already has Prop 16 - because they never had Prop 209.  Most of the country only has the less specific guarantee of equality under the 14th Amendment, and federal courts have interpreted that as allowing race-based admissions.
1306706043330654208 2020-09-18 05:26:12 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> It was a powerful moment when the California legislature voted to amend our constitution to remove these words:  “The state shall not discriminate...”  It will be an even more powerful moment when voters reject their amendment and preserve equality under the law.  #NoProp16

1305056270848684033 2020-09-13 16:10:36 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @pcg92107 @tobeequal The UC Regents decision was that SAT was optional by campus for 2021 and 2022 admissions, and then no SAT for California applicants starting in 2023, then no SAT for out of state applicants starting 2025.  Different UC campuses were going to do different things in 2021/22.

If your son does well on the SAT, it’s a good indicator he’ll do well in college - as the UC faculty tried to tell the Regents.  https://t.co/k1o7I0gkQB

1305038924146814976 2020-09-13 15:01:40 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> @pcg92107 @tobeequal The court decision was an injunction against use of SAT that has immediate effect and lasts for as long as the case is pending.  But the UC Regents had already voted to remove SAT for most purposes in future years. So when the injunction is gone UC still won’t be using SAT.

They show them as inherently inferior.  Because their solution is permanently ending equality, rather than removing discrimination.
1303348862417948672 2020-09-08 23:05:58 +0800 <SteveMillerOC> We see this attitude over and over from #Prop16 advocates - especially from those who do not fall in the racial category that they belittle.

So diversity is not the real reason nor a sufficient excuse for race-based policies.  So what is your reason? Do UCs not have the right mix of diversity? Do you think Asians are over-represented?
