1328399721229148162 2020-11-17 02:09:08 +0800 <HmsBarona> @CliffordAgius @pete_codes @Microsoft @MSIoTDevs Definitely. Coding I would suggest you have a look at how you can use the SDKs available to build your IoT devices, IoT service clients, and the IoT Edge devices. There is a pattern on how you use the SDK in different languages, so it is easier to understand it.
1328389502889553920 2020-11-17 01:28:32 +0800 <HmsBarona> @MSIoTDevs @Microsoft Thank you @MSIoTDevs. We have a few sessions coming up soon on the @CloudLunchLearn related to #IoT. I will try to share the knowledge I got while studying to this exam.
1328388910163111939 2020-11-17 01:26:11 +0800 <HmsBarona> @CliffordAgius @pete_codes @Microsoft @MSIoTDevs You are welcome Clifford and good luck with the exam.
1328367116328824833 2020-11-16 23:59:35 +0800 <HmsBarona> @MrTerzic By the way, is the volunteer program of the same organization?
1328366623594569730 2020-11-16 23:57:37 +0800 <HmsBarona> @MrTerzic Amazing man. That sounds like a dream. Hope you guys enjoy it and keep sharing some photos and your experience doing the volunteering.

1328313059383906305 2020-11-16 20:24:46 +0800 <HmsBarona> @MrTerzic Looks great Vukasin. Is it your first time in Malta? I heard great things about Malta, but unfortunately never had a chance to go there.

1328259504262295553 2020-11-16 16:51:58 +0800 <HmsBarona> @TechTrainerTim Thank you Tim. 👍💪

And when you master it, then you can master a lot of other things. I was lucky to have two soft weeks in community and work, so I could dedicate myself to this certification
1328088007866454016 2020-11-16 05:30:30 +0800 <HmsBarona> @jonnychipz @Microsoft @MSIoTDevs You will not regret John. And more and more IoT will be present in our profession, so it will be definitely useful for everyone doing it.
1328082718580740102 2020-11-16 05:09:29 +0800 <HmsBarona> @GeertBaeke @Microsoft @MSIoTDevs Definitely Geert. Btw, were you able to do all the IoT Edge modules on the Microsoft Learn paths? I tried to do the modules related to deploy IoT modules to IoT Edge devices, but the sandbox subscriptions were not allowing me to deploy the Linux VMs to run the IoT Edge runtime.
1328070018370850816 2020-11-16 04:19:01 +0800 <HmsBarona> @DwayneNcloud @Microsoft @MSIoTDevs Thank you, Dwayne.

In order to get hands-on training with #PowerPlatform administration, you need to be admin of a tenant and be able to access the Power Platform admin center. If you do not have a tenant to practice, maybe you can try to create a trial one?  https://t.co/zUpP3PlgUS
