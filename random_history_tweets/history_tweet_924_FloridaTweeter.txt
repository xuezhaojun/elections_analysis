It's possible that it is a verbal agreement for no extradition, in exchange for immunity, &amp; no transactional emails or other written documents exist. We saw a Trump quid pro quo with UA

1337773955524988933 2020-12-12 22:59:00 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @BrennanRandel After the game one year, my college roommate and our dates went to a mixed Middie/Cadet dance. She came home with a Cadet uniform; I still have no idea what happened to her original date, or what the owner of the uniform wore  getting back to West Point the next morning.

He said when the vaccine arrives, even those who've had COVID10 should get the vaccine, because they have no idea at this point how long the immunity lasts in the long term for the disease or the vaccine.

I would lover another cat, but my big boy, 11 healthy years old, 105 long and tall but not fat pounds, king of his house, is not likely to approve of a new addition.

1336005091451674626 2020-12-08 01:50:10 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @realPaulMay A new spur for Trump-once President Biden is sworn, Trump's exit plane won't have the (Military) Air Force One/Executive One designation. The number will revert to the plane's tail number. His private plane, while he's been in office was SS designated Tyson 1, maybe for chicken.

This, along with Flynn, and other nutter Generals who appear on Fox platforms give me pause to Trust that the Military will honor their Oaths of loyalty to the Constitution.

1335997017772994566 2020-12-08 01:18:05 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @mitchellreports I get it. It's free publicity for Trump, whose followers continue to send him money, and don't realize or care that much is going to line his pockets...as they stand in food lines and have or are losing their jobs. Trump said he loved the uneducated.

1324193000256397312 2020-11-05 11:33:08 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> When Arizona goes for Biden, it will be John McCain's getting the last laugh on Trump.

1324191775423107072 2020-11-05 11:28:16 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @Mediaite I wonder if Sean's trying to buy Rush's EIB license; I hear he won't be needing it too far in the future. I'm hoping a minority buys it; not too many minorities own those licenses. Can you imagine.
1324188628319428611 2020-11-05 11:15:45 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @donnabrazile Agree, but here's some very good news. The FAA has made the area over @JoeBiden's home restricted airspace, a very good sign.  https://t.co/4eE1SZkgHw
1324188055486500866 2020-11-05 11:13:29 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @HelaoSouse Here's a very good sign that you'll like. The FAA has made the area over @JoeBiden's house restricted airspace!  https://t.co/4eE1SZkgHw
1324183564338999296 2020-11-05 10:55:38 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> Absolutely, the Democratic Party should recognize her efforts, and reward her with a working position. She's got vision and is more than capable. Looking at a future for her.
1324182359265169410 2020-11-05 10:50:51 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> Do you realize what this means. Air Space over @JoeBiden's home is now restricted. OH BABY!
1324181608690311168 2020-11-05 10:47:52 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> This is really important.  A very important recognition of @JoeBiden's electoral position as the potential next President of the United States. Thank God.

1324170944286511104 2020-11-05 10:05:29 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @ActiveHomeRenew @NotGIJoe It pisses me off greatly. On January 20, 2021, at 12:30 p.m., I hope I never have to see or hear him again, except when they perp walk him, Barr, and the rest of the "enterprise" into a federal court building. Somewhere where the weather is deadly cold all year round.
1324165174736179204 2020-11-05 09:42:34 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> I'm with @JoeBiden , @KamalaHarris , &amp; @AmbKennedy_ret , we will be back, and not just on this, but, in my opinion, also other important work that Trump kicked to the ditch.

1324163286481383426 2020-11-05 09:35:03 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @wiczipedia They need to use that site just one time to organize a crime, any crime, and it's game on to become a federal prosecution. After January 20, 2021, Barr won't be able to help them.

1319410645905924097 2020-10-23 06:49:46 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @HeartsAboundUSA My post comes from the perspective of being a wife who saw what happened to her husband as a result of his taking blood thinners since 2000. I saw thinning skin &amp; bruising on his entire body, &amp; dressed the tears in his skin from a bump or scrape. Please go argue with someone else

1319270612213272579 2020-10-22 21:33:19 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> Voter intimidation. Dangerous in Florida to threaten someone, who also may have a concealed carry, and feel threatened; deadly some might say.

Instead, the word that comes to me for this result of the president's policies and rhetoric is "dangerous".

1319068933027147776 2020-10-22 08:11:55 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @DearAuntCrabby Blood thinner, more than likely, which causes that bruising &amp; a thinning of the skin. Clearly his meds need adjusting; my husband's were checked weekly &amp; he still bruised. Mitch definitely has good health ins. that would pay for tests &amp; new meds. Medicare first, then the 2nd ins.
1319067654548803584 2020-10-22 08:06:50 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> This is what comes from Trump's very fine people. I am hopeful that those who sent these can be identified, prosecuted, and convicted.

1319000901055664129 2020-10-22 03:41:35 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @kristenisbored @pbump Likely answer is prescription blood thinners; taken usually by people w/heart problems, valve replacement, maybe a stint, a prior tia or stroke. They also make the skin very thin, so a cut will bleed forever, &amp; cause bruising just like that. Google blood thinner bruising for pics

Usually if people have had a bipass, stint, or a stroke would be a few reasons why someone would be prescribed them. Hope you're doing well, Jodi!

1318767144461602816 2020-10-21 12:12:43 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @JillWineBanks Why indeed? Possibly because Trump issued the order to Parnas, a non-government employee, "to take her out", not to the Secretary of State to recall her as prescribed by law, which would place Trump again in the position, of having to be identified as an Unindicted /3
1318766500329803778 2020-10-21 12:10:09 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @JillWineBanks It has been reported that Parnas, et al claim it was a joke.

1318745725438668800 2020-10-21 10:47:36 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @donnabrazile Exactly. We can't have "Disappeared" children or adults in this country. We can't. If those lawyers can't find the parents, give it to others to give it another look. This is unacceptable, and Trump should be in cuffs at The International Court at The Hague.

1311483305859178498 2020-10-01 09:49:20 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @melindaharing I have an open mind, including a statement allegedly made by Hyde to Parnas, reported in an NPR article on 15JAN2020. I hope the investigation will be thorough, follow the evidence, and I would speculate that our FBI will assist UA investigators. Pray for the woman &amp; her family.

1311478978717405184 2020-10-01 09:32:09 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> I am interested in the investigation of this recent hours old murder of a U.S. Embassy employee. Understandably, there is presently very little information. I am sorry she was murdered, &amp; sincerely hope this did not involve international political players.
1311473642149117954 2020-10-01 09:10:56 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @RTMannJr It's somewhere in the "mine". When you call OPM,call the mine directly, and ask for someone who works with your specific area of employment. The lady that helped me was a wizard, and has long since retired, or I'd give you her name and number. I have a friend who waited 6 months.

1307795918008332294 2020-09-21 05:36:59 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> The old standard was one for each Appellate Circuit; that would increase the Court to 13 Justices. Sufficient.

1304413001953554432 2020-09-11 21:34:29 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @BearroristJodi Stick with it sweetie, and stay with us on Twitter for talk. You've got friends. And, don't take a drink or anything else like it from your room mate or anyone else. I'm glad to see you posting.
1304409876542771201 2020-09-11 21:22:03 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @mallen2010 @JohnJHarwood Facts; you just don't like them &amp; would rather see the stats hidden from Americans for Don's re-election campaign. It's the Trump Virus, not the China Virus. Trump's inaction, lying, &amp; not providing info to us is now exemplified by 2 football stadia's seats filled with corpses.

1304181142388707330 2020-09-11 06:13:09 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @BearroristJodi Bless you, young woman. I was looking for an update form you, and here it is. Keep us posted; let us know how you're doing. Don't leave early, &amp; stay the course. Be very good to yourself, and ask for help, even here on the net.
1304171746816413698 2020-09-11 05:35:49 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @NurseNinaPA I get it 100%, &amp; asking them just after you smack them good, what they are thinking. Back in the day, we were forbidden by written policy from discussing politics or religion while on duty. Some might think that unreasonable, but it was a smart move since we all carried guns.
1304161760715431936 2020-09-11 04:56:08 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @HelaoSouse I'm good with the earthquake if Trump is standing on the fault when it happens. You don't know how much God the Father, the one who believes in smites, not the forgiving Son, will put up with. So, my advice, don't stand anywhere near Trump.

1303708585092960256 2020-09-09 22:55:23 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> Why to Trump and GOP supporters need any additional evidence that they are cruel, selfish human beings, who care not a whit for the common citizen. I am clueless about that, but here's one more blatant log to add to the woodpile.

1303028525608431616 2020-09-08 01:53:04 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> Name calling is all Trump has left, like the schoolyard bully that everyone eventually ignores, and leaves standing alone in the schoolyard.  I wonder if people just started laughing at Trump, what that would elicit.

1303026943890272258 2020-09-08 01:46:47 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @RepublicanSwine Maybe start interviewing those who are writing what the "presenters" are saying, getting the writers faces on the media as the person responsible, and requesting their source or proof, if the source can't be identified, i.e. electronic media, photos, etc.
1302979951659044866 2020-09-07 22:40:03 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @DonaldJTrumpJr Certainly no one in your family respects or supports the military.
1302979590219075591 2020-09-07 22:38:37 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> @DaxGigandet News sources that are able to be fact checked. Anonymous isn't necessarily unknown to the news source, nor is it necessarily untrue. The ability to fact check, or fact check forward is important. That eliminates most platforms, and anything with a .ru or related extension.

1301511812849045507 2020-09-03 21:26:11 +0800 <FloridaTweeter> NC should prosecute all, regardless of party, &amp; Trump. To induce another to do it, or to do it is a violation of NC law. Ethics Enforcement Act § 163A-1389 [(4), (6), (7)]. Certain acts declared felonies. This is a Class 1 Felony.  https://t.co/xYgjEiYGI8
