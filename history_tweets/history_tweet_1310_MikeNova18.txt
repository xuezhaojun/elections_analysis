1330696071853445122 2020-11-23 10:14:01 +0800 <MikeNova18> @GovSisolak If you’re so big on percentiles why don’t you tell us what the death rate is? NV has 64 deaths per 100k according to the CDC. 7th grade math tells us that 64/100k= 0.00064 0.00064x100= 0.064%  That’s the death rate. 0.064%

1330676899698208769 2020-11-23 08:57:50 +0800 <MikeNova18> @8NewsNow @GovSisolak What is with the obsession with cases? 64 deaths/100k in NV is a mathematical equation. 64 divided by 100,000 is 0.00064. Multiplied by 100  equals a death rate of 0.064%. 10 times worse would be still be just over half a percent. This is public info from CDC and 8th grade math  https://t.co/hkz36tjI9d

These fatherless boys are clearly angry. Why aren’t you?

When the average person of any background votes he’s not doing so for lofty social justice ideals. He’s doing it with the knowledge that #Democrats have &amp; plan to continue bankrupting him.

Think about it... do you really believe that uneducated, working class white men are really that different from their black counterparts?   Clearly the Democrats traded class for race and the black working class realizes they’ve been abandoned too

A lot of being a for profit artist is networking not just for clients/buyers but for other artists to collaborate and share opportunities with.

Markets are hierarchies of value that exist independent of our ability to perceive them... communism, on the other hand, is a “social construct” that aims to dominate &amp; or destroy anything &amp; everything. It’s anti human.

It’s one of many REAL problems that come from poverty. The problem with you communists ideologues is you’re bad at identifying enemies. Maybe that’s why your ideas have killed more that 100 million 🤔

Overheard them comparing notes. Apparently they’ve only “got one” Biden voter in my blue collar, diverse, young neighborhood. #MAGA2020LandslideVictory 👌

1319067318563926017 2020-10-22 08:05:30 +0800 <MikeNova18> @_sconsolato @Bradshaw2020 @SarahKSilverman Yeah, that’s implicit in my point. I speak from experience. Poverty necessitates making poor financial decisions a lot of the time and it can become an ingrained negative pattern of behavior... even in times when you can afford to make wiser financial decisions.

1313715260327518209 2020-10-07 13:38:20 +0800 <MikeNova18> @RealJamesWoods Hey, @BernieSanders, why do we need a $15 minimum wage when the Scandinavian countries you hold up as examples have no minimum wage at all? Are you misrepresenting the Scandinavian model for your own ends... maybe? 🤔

1312088502566227968 2020-10-03 01:54:11 +0800 <MikeNova18> @ProPeaceCath For the record I mostly think the second train of thought is crazy and homophobic in and of itself. Gays don’t have to hide in bushes &amp; hook up with strangers anymore. If they do so now it’s a choice that can have many negative consequences.
1312087423644434432 2020-10-03 01:49:53 +0800 <MikeNova18> @ProPeaceCath Many believe that because gay activities where forced under ground for so long, “high-risk behaviors” became baked in to gay culture. Some think those activities should stop but others think that is an attach on gay culture &amp; therefore homophobic.

1307566340459225088 2020-09-20 14:24:43 +0800 <MikeNova18> @LeftRightIDGAF UBI is redistribution of wealth.  Taking taxes from an indevidual and then returning the same amount to them is different than taking 10,000 from them and giving back 1,000.  UBI aims to take money from some and give it to others.

Since then I’ve realized that V.I.Lenin called his Bolshevics “Democratic Socialists” before they took power
