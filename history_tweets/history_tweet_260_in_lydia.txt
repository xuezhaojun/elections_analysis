1343654653091831808 2020-12-29 04:26:47 +0800 <in_lydia> @AdamMeakins Happy Birthday! 🎉

1343108673296617472 2020-12-27 16:17:16 +0800 <in_lydia> For the first time in 2 years (5 if you count with unborn ones) there are no kids in the house! And I'm having a very very lovely morning 😊 coffee and Christmas presents 👌 I expect 2021 will be the year I become wise. #woolensocksforthewin  https://t.co/zozGfEBRmK

1341461899859419138 2020-12-23 03:13:34 +0800 <in_lydia> @MyCuppaJo What a beauty 😍 enjoy your break, and wish you a restful few weeks! Thanks for the insights you have kept on bringing this year. Here's to a brighter 2021! 🥂

1338803352034025473 2020-12-15 19:09:27 +0800 <in_lydia> I've been looking so forward to this I nearly forgot to buy a ticket 😁 luckily in time! Very much looking forward to a much needed whisky and a laugh 😎
1338203232062074884 2020-12-14 03:24:47 +0800 <in_lydia> @jptlowy @Retlouping I see.. A backdrop I didn't realize. The notion of health care being a privilege blows my mind 🤯  going off Twitter now.. Thanks for engaging w/ me without questioning my integrity, and for clarifying differences 👍🙂
1338194576847343616 2020-12-14 02:50:24 +0800 <in_lydia> @jptlowy @Retlouping I'm sorry people do that to you. And yes, we then obv have different experiences &amp; live in different cultures. I have loved ones who won't take the vaccine. They aren't trolls on SoMe, they rn't ignorant and they take care of their health. Seeing them repeatedly ridiculed hurts.
1337150566728863748 2020-12-11 05:41:52 +0800 <in_lydia> @OnlinePhysios @adamdobson123 😅 Def quite hardcore! Is it a nature-themed one? Ours have gone fishing.. (caught and sliced them too) and hatched chickens. They're regularly out in the woods, light a fire and get to try whittling(?). But that's as bad as it gets in the public one I think 😉

1334079979383115777 2020-12-02 18:20:27 +0800 <in_lydia> What 2020 needs? A great good Xmas quiz!😄Come join! How choose a fav moment.. Maybe @Farmer_MindBody starting her presentation with playing music, depicting the layers of the song - as an analogy of the layers of pain 🎼🎶 and then "Emotion without sensation is just a thought"
1333787042564644864 2020-12-01 22:56:26 +0800 <in_lydia> Oh, twitter and nuance.. Please share beautiful pictures! but you know, not in the way that subtly tells everyone how perfect your life is and how they should strive to do like you because that's what God parents do. X I'm done now
1333783903262294017 2020-12-01 22:43:57 +0800 <in_lydia> If you have beautiful Christmas moments, stay present and share them with those who are there. They're the ones who really matter.  And here's a picture of our humongous stack of laundry, just for balance 😘😬 (#goals because it's not spread out over the floor)  https://t.co/dDldoLaSbJ

1332816678519009282 2020-11-29 06:40:33 +0800 <in_lydia> @OnlinePhysios @runchatlive @Physiobil I mean, I am currently dealing with some deep shame, as we have not been giving the kids tran for most of this year 😱😱 only the occasional kids tranfish with fruitflavor 😅 We need to get our Vitamin D! + probably connect in a weird way with the remnants of viking DNA  https://t.co/zZiyncRHFS
1332454599140249600 2020-11-28 06:41:46 +0800 <in_lydia> @Retlouping Ooo and losing my religion with REM  https://t.co/ihUfnxXdIU

1331971497498472454 2020-11-26 22:42:06 +0800 <in_lydia> And just to be very clear: I do not in any sense or form believe that I am more fulfilled or better as a woman or mother than any others. It's the way my life has turned out, and the choices that worked for us. You do you 😊
1331586606030065672 2020-11-25 21:12:41 +0800 <in_lydia> From an environmental pov.. Should we really be advocating for free menstrual hygiene products? Why not rather work towards encouraging the use of reusable, sustainable products? Cheaper and often more practical too. 👍 Why not a free menstrual cup to all who wish to try? 🙂
1331580750144090119 2020-11-25 20:49:25 +0800 <in_lydia> @Retlouping @ThomasRoth91 @OnlinePhysios @nakedphysio @JghPhysio @MyCuppaJo @sprakradet also been thinking in these terms. Just call it "pain that's been around for a while"..? Or spend time and effort with pt/client to explore which words they would use to describe their pain situation? Bc there can be real relief in putting the exp and situation into words..
1331543767510372352 2020-11-25 18:22:27 +0800 <in_lydia> @OnlinePhysios @ThomasRoth91 @nakedphysio @JghPhysio @MyCuppaJo @Retlouping (that caption 🤣) Langvarende would be pretty accurate 😀 🤔 we should send a petition to @sprakradet 😁 make it the new word of 2021😁
1331489735102124033 2020-11-25 14:47:45 +0800 <in_lydia> @OnlinePhysios @nakedphysio @JghPhysio @MyCuppaJo @Retlouping @ThomasRoth91 Har brukt "vedvarende" eller enkelt og greit "langvarig". Pros &amp; cons med begge 🙂
1331321782696030213 2020-11-25 03:40:22 +0800 <in_lydia> @LirbesOlerybes 😅😁 You're very well in the game, my dear 😍
1331199784473022466 2020-11-24 19:35:35 +0800 <in_lydia> @JghPhysio Remember that to give care to others, you need to take care of your self too.  Take the time and the help you need to get through and over this. It's not egoistic. All the best! Also attaching a hug to those virtual flowers 🤗
1331198810580803584 2020-11-24 19:31:43 +0800 <in_lydia> @JghPhysio I'm very glad you were terrible at your attempts ❤️  you are probably of the greatest value for them, even if it's not your scope. True empathy goes a loooong way. And you represent hope that they too can get through. And hope is powerful.
1331190953584029697 2020-11-24 19:00:30 +0800 <in_lydia> @JghPhysio Wow, that's powerful. You're doing an incredible job! many (most?) are not willing to go there. Hope you have the opportunity to take the breathing space you need after. Sending you all the virtual flowers and support 😊💐🙏
1330834930566373378 2020-11-23 19:25:47 +0800 <in_lydia> Use open-ended questions! - It let's the patient guide the therapist to what's important for them. - Closed questions make you fit into *my* setting
1330834928855093249 2020-11-23 19:25:47 +0800 <in_lydia> Underlying view of MI method: Respect - the person (eg by not saying "I think you should ... ") Empathy! Collaboration - Both pt and therapist are experts, so combine the expertise! Autonomy over self and life choices.
1330834927458414592 2020-11-23 19:25:47 +0800 <in_lydia> "Adherence" and "compliance" insinuates you have to follow orders. People generally don't like to follow orders about their own life, but want to decide them selves.  Also implicates a skewed power balance in the pt-therapist relationship.
1330834926065823744 2020-11-23 19:25:46 +0800 <in_lydia> Been sorting some old stuff lately, and came over notes from a lecture on motivational interviewing with Tom Barth back in 2012. Some gold in there! Useful for clinical settings also outside of MI.. Felt like sharing some of it 😊
1330545594075648000 2020-11-23 00:16:04 +0800 <in_lydia> @LirbesOlerybes The angels up high 👼😍

1330186069351014401 2020-11-22 00:27:27 +0800 <in_lydia> @laurarathbone I didn't know this was a thing!? But we often do jigsaws between christmas and new years. Love the calm it brings! (except when the toddlers are helping, then its not calm.. ) Enjoy! 😊
1330129497031643141 2020-11-21 20:42:39 +0800 <in_lydia> Who else is excitd for this one? My exp of illness during pt school had a massive impact on my view of the clin. setting, how communication is essential and what NOT to do.  But my pain was short term &amp; limited. So much still to learn! Who best to learn it from than the experts?
1330110380782333952 2020-11-21 19:26:41 +0800 <in_lydia> @Retlouping I love Christmas, but hate the commercialized consumerism. Love the lights, lots of quality family time, music, and thought through gifts that are given with love. Hate the "have to buy some shit to everybody" so have stopped doing that and told people we don't want it 😊
1329849892425109506 2020-11-21 02:11:36 +0800 <in_lydia> @JohannesK97 Nei, sant det.. Altså, noe lærer man vel av å se motsatt av det en selv vil være ja 🙃 men litt tungvint..
1329836579540627458 2020-11-21 01:18:42 +0800 <in_lydia> @JohannesK97 Uff, høres ikke greit ut.. Du får gi tilbakemelding til skolen om veilederen din. Vet ikke hvor lenge det er igjen, men det skal være mulig å bytte og.. Lykke til uansett
1327927032861384704 2020-11-15 18:50:50 +0800 <in_lydia> @LirbesOlerybes 😔 Hope it's only uphill from here! Sending love and hugs 💕💜

1320831746619985922 2020-10-27 04:56:42 +0800 <in_lydia> @laurarathbone I've spent maternal leave and time out of clinic to deep dive into what I want to do differently, and sought resources to help me find a way to change my practice and empower me in this choice. I've sought community online, and lately started to seek to build local community 😊

That our motivation lies there, and not in the art? And then again, I think an empathetic artist, who dedicates time to help could do well! (e.g music therapy 🤔😊)

1318228707748741120 2020-10-20 00:33:10 +0800 <in_lydia> @OnlinePhysios I pondered the whole day last time, and now also.. Very conflicted thoughts and feelings about it, too much to put into Twitter.. first time in my life I've wanted to write a blog post! 😅
1318074069464604675 2020-10-19 14:18:41 +0800 <in_lydia> @LirbesOlerybes 🤪
1318073840107507713 2020-10-19 14:17:46 +0800 <in_lydia> @OnlinePhysios 🤣🤣🤣   Kind of a solace though, that the algorithms actually are quite stupid still.. 🤷‍♀️
1317939788603949057 2020-10-19 05:25:06 +0800 <in_lydia> So apparently BigTech thinks it's time I have another baby 😂 been receiving ads for ovulation and pregnancy tests for quite a while, but as I elegantly overlook them, I'm now seeing lots of ads for fertility clinics 😂 🤦‍♀️
1317756908497940480 2020-10-18 17:18:24 +0800 <in_lydia> @laurarathbone Happy birthday! 😊 🎉🎈

1317030349340364800 2020-10-16 17:11:19 +0800 <in_lydia> Usually, October in Bergen means rain, wind, dark clouds, 2°c, dark pavement, wind and some more rain. This year, it's been just beautiful 😍  https://t.co/b5n7ZXg8wv

1315343874257289216 2020-10-12 01:29:52 +0800 <in_lydia> @OnlinePhysios @ranilillanjum @ThomasRoth91 Nydelig! 🤩😊
1315315957678604289 2020-10-11 23:38:56 +0800 <in_lydia> @GregLehman We help our kids balance the fun and the risk of cycling, skating, rollerblading, skiing, tree climbing and on and on. Shouldn't be different with a trampoline. When used somewhat sensibly, the fun and benefits far outweigh the risks imo 🙂
1315033226344386561 2020-10-11 04:55:27 +0800 <in_lydia> @laurarathbone My dad used to rant about how toddlers and kids are generally underestimated. I went yadayada until I suddenly had one myself and got totally blown away by the capacity to learn, that they hold 😁
1315029555086798849 2020-10-11 04:40:52 +0800 <in_lydia> @fnorses Ja, enig i at det kan gi positive utslag den veien! Men samtidig tenker jeg at det var /er vi på vei mot som profesjon uansett.. Er det mange unge som kun gir passive tiltak v/artrose?
1314954953736232960 2020-10-10 23:44:26 +0800 <in_lydia> @OnlinePhysios @MRWPhysio What I meant was, opening the journal to the patient automatically makes them a part of it, a recipient, and thereby changes the way hcp writes about or characterizes the patient and their interactions. Our at least, it should...
1314949123351683072 2020-10-10 23:21:16 +0800 <in_lydia> @OnlinePhysios @MRWPhysio Yes! I think, for that reason, easy access to one's medical journey is an important step in making health care patient centered.
1314943528540270592 2020-10-10 22:59:02 +0800 <in_lydia> @MRWPhysio @OnlinePhysios  https://t.co/ltH4reZ6vk
1314888144005758977 2020-10-10 19:18:57 +0800 <in_lydia> @OnlinePhysios Yup.. And God forbid one can reach out to the patient to discuss the test results, if it's so worrying 😛
1314880496460075008 2020-10-10 18:48:34 +0800 <in_lydia> @OnlinePhysios I remember discussions about this when I was "turnus" and online access was being rolled out to patients in specialized hc. There was worry that pts would read test results and not understand, and therefore catastrophize (eg. MRIs)
1314518913045102592 2020-10-09 18:51:46 +0800 <in_lydia> @Martin_Nekkolai Ja, jeg hørte den og! Syns han hadde mange gode poeng. Han har senere lansert  https://t.co/LUc5DYZxvi som et slags motsvar, tror jeg 👍 Sertifiseringen er vel litt av hovedproblemet, ja
1314509103948075008 2020-10-09 18:12:47 +0800 <in_lydia> Glad for om noen vil gå i diskusjon med meg! 🙂 Jeg er ikke bare ute etter å få bekreftelse fra folk som er enige med meg 😉  #fysioterapi #fysioterapeuten #AktivA #GLADryg
1314509102417149954 2020-10-09 18:12:47 +0800 <in_lydia> - Hvor blir det personsentrerte av i disse programmene? Hva med å finne bevegelsesglede i andre aktiviteter enn øvelser?  - Jeg har hverken tid eller råd til å reise på sertifiseringskurs. Vil pasienter da anta at jeg ikke er skikkelig kvalifisert, eller like god til å hjelpe?
1314509100844290048 2020-10-09 18:12:46 +0800 <in_lydia> - Er resultatet egentlig så godt, når 1 av 10 *starter * med smertestillende i etterkant? Det kan ikke være positivt for dem at de enda en gang går "tapende" ut av noe som ellers roses og beskrives som fremtiden for ryggsmerter og det beste alternativet?
1314509098923315200 2020-10-09 18:12:46 +0800 <in_lydia> Jeg kjenner frustrasjonen bobler - så jeg forsøker meg på en tråd. - Hvorfor må ferdig utdannede fysioterapeuter ta ekstra sertifisering i noe som burde være standard fysioterapi? Prinsippene bak både AktivA og Glad:Ryg burde være, og er i stor grad del av grunnutdannelsen.

1312000372093997058 2020-10-02 20:03:59 +0800 <in_lydia> @OnlinePhysios @tristanharris A year ago I would have rolled my eyes at myself for this.. But too many pieces are falling into place by now.
1311992318447226881 2020-10-02 19:31:59 +0800 <in_lydia> Well worth your time! I would even say, it should be mandatory to spend time getting one's head around this! It's not too late yet! #forthesakeofpeaceanddemocracy

1306922479491915777 2020-09-18 19:46:15 +0800 <in_lydia> What do you do when you pick up nine 8yo boys at school for a birthday party, and they walk down the road singing "we will, we will f*ck you! F*ck you!" at the top of their voices? 😬🤣😳 I ended up threatening to remove one candy from the bags for each time - worked wonders😂 😝

1302284690586505216 2020-09-06 00:37:20 +0800 <in_lydia> @LirbesOlerybes Just saw the ad from d+ about "now streaming".. not fair 😣

1301847608823033856 2020-09-04 19:40:31 +0800 <in_lydia> @OnlinePhysios Yes, absolutely see that! Kind of turns back to listening and not assuming..? We should maybe have these posters in the clinicians' lunch room 😉😄
1301843519112458240 2020-09-04 19:24:16 +0800 <in_lydia> @OnlinePhysios But maybe we have seen different patient groups? Very few patients of mine have attributed their pain/unhealth solely to ps/so factors? 😊
1301841798566903808 2020-09-04 19:17:26 +0800 <in_lydia> @OnlinePhysios Hmm🤔 Interested in how you would present that to a patient and make sure it doesn't come across as a fancy way of saying "suck it up"? How does this play into validation of pain experience?
1301632435105525767 2020-09-04 05:25:30 +0800 <in_lydia> Beer and coffee empty - mind and notepapers full Thank you for an enlightening evening @LePubScientifiq @MelanieNoel! 🙏 Both as a parent and clinician 😊  https://t.co/SBIbJ515In
