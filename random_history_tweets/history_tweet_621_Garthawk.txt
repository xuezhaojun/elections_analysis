1302330342536359936 2020-09-06 03:38:44 +0800 <Garthawk> Who are the Brainless Bastards who criticize Trump for taking out Qasem Soleimani? One is Colin Powell. Get Colin Powell together w/ loser Biden &amp; you have a losing team that doesn’t give a shit about how many US sons we lose as long as their sons are never in battle @Jim_Jordan
1302326538814320640 2020-09-06 03:23:37 +0800 <Garthawk> Seriously, Trump rightly cannot Stand Politically correct wars &amp; General who don’t know how to win &amp; get out. If Generals had Trumps genius &amp; didn’t play political games, 1000s of US sons would still be alive. Trump can beat the generals at their own game. Jennifer knows NADA @VP
1302324490089754625 2020-09-06 03:15:29 +0800 <Garthawk> Trump has always preferred approaching war like he did Qasem Soleimani. If MadDog Mattis &amp; ColinPowell hadTrump’s approach, Afghanistan Would Not Have Lasted 30 fricken Years w/ death of 1000s of US sons=Trumps meaning of wasted lives. @POTUS @VP @AlanDersh @dbongino @Jim_Jordan
1302320072208384006 2020-09-06 02:57:55 +0800 <Garthawk> Jennifer Griffin obviously doesn’t know the Vietnamese were beaten and on the edge of giving up. General Curtis Lemay wanted to bomb Hanoi which would have immediately ended the war &amp; defeated the Communists who had infiltrated &amp; indoctrinated the Vietnamese Nationalists.
1302275166085566470 2020-09-05 23:59:29 +0800 <Garthawk> Trump has always stood for saving American lives and fighting wars smartly to lose as few Young Men as possible. Trump would never fight by Obama’s Politically correct Rules of Engagement like “Don’t fire until fired upon” which caused 1000s more US soldiers to die needlessly @VP
1302273536388726784 2020-09-05 23:53:00 +0800 <Garthawk> I’m a Vietnam Vet &amp; understand his remarks about Vietnam Vets &amp; the Vietnam War. Jennifer Griffin needs to understand what I know. Jennifer Griffin is disgusting. I worked Intel Recon &amp; offered Job at NSA after the war. Jennifer Misses Trumps Vigilant &amp; insightful stance on war.
