1311720788882407425 2020-10-02 01:33:01 +0800 <AlanMiLLRrr> @JillWineBanks You almost need to go full Zoom call. Have the candidates in separate physical spaces so Trump is muted and can‚Äôt possibly distract with sound or visuals either Biden or the audience.  All this is moot if Live fact checking isn‚Äôt happening. Trump‚Äôs lies need to be addressed.
1311720417350959104 2020-10-02 01:31:32 +0800 <AlanMiLLRrr> @JillWineBanks To Chris Wallace‚Äôs point. Trump will still make comments to distract Biden and maybe even get picked up by other microphones.  From an appearance standpoint it could actually be worse in that Biden would look distracted without the audience knowing what Trump was saying.

1300602105510551552 2020-09-01 09:11:20 +0800 <AlanMiLLRrr> @Acyn @TuckerCarlson what about the teenage girl he sucker punched from behind repeatedly in a school parking lot a week before the shooting?
1300601244315054080 2020-09-01 09:07:55 +0800 <AlanMiLLRrr> @donwinslow What this clearly shows is our system is weak and over exposed to corruption from within. Russia merely had to tip the scales and GOP greed took over from there.  The Founding Fathers were not ‚Äúall knowing‚Äù. They thought we‚Äôd adapt instead of being fixated on their original plans
