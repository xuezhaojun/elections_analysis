I don't know what I did to my twitter text...but it's so huge, that it doesn't fit on my page. I watch all your live podcasts especially with redpill. Maybe a little help🙃🙃❤
1312508001492762624 2020-10-04 05:41:07 +0800 <DDeerring> Can someone please help me make my twitter text smaller? It's so big...it's off the page.🙃

1308504136292298752 2020-09-23 04:31:11 +0800 <DDeerring> @lisa_furmama This is your Democrat party. Hey Nancy is this how you act when nobody's looking. You D's are sicker than I ever thought. Don't you know the words 'prim and proper'.
1308501924770013185 2020-09-23 04:22:24 +0800 <DDeerring> @Henryhooddavis @realDonaldTrump Don't believe the polls  https://t.co/d0gLNTTdDC you see the people at Trump rallies...ok now, do you see the Trump supporters when Biden gets  out of his car. Shit, he's waving at nobody. You  must calm down my friend. I'm  just as nervous as you. God bless😇

1308494217790984192 2020-09-23 03:51:46 +0800 <DDeerring> @MrStache9 Any chance that we could kidnap President Trump and ask him politely be the PM of Canada...even if it's only for 6 months😬
1308493004638883840 2020-09-23 03:46:57 +0800 <DDeerring> @SpeakerPelosi Yes, you should not forget how you belittled President Trump when he stopped flights from China on January 31. Then you had the gull in March to go down to Chinatown and invite everyone...you told people it was SAFE. Nancy, you should be the one impeached. GROW UP
1308487727566917632 2020-09-23 03:25:59 +0800 <DDeerring> @pvtjokerus I don't understand why sleeping with 919 men would be something you would want the world to know😱

They couldn't shut their trap on all the kitchen table item's that they were going to do for you. Truthfully, name one they did for you. I am so serious about this, I am willing to wait along time.

Don't they pass these bills only if there's overwhelming support from the people? Are you telling me that ordinary Californians think it's ok that pedos get less time if the baby was willing.SICK

1301602528719548416 2020-09-04 03:26:40 +0800 <DDeerring> Every Californian who owns a salon should be open for business today. Pelosi said it's ok if you have only one customer in the shop at a time. What are you waiting for?😁
