The pacifist claims he wouldn’t use violence even to save his wife or child. It reads as cowardice. The last thing you  think of with someone like MLK or John Lewis is cowardice.
1337826788903440389 2020-12-13 02:28:56 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @MGEmancipation True &amp; true. But in both cases nonviolence was a core tactic which won important democratic gains. There were no violent means that could have brought them those successes in their context. Their nonviolent methods expanded democracy.

1336048021570666496 2020-12-08 04:40:45 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @therecount I like to think that on Twitter I end up seeing an over-sampling of mega assholes. I sure hope it’s an over-sampling.

My daughter recently started  encircling the plants with tinfoil that covers the soil. Now they occasionally mess with the tinfoil but mostly they leave them alone. Good luck!

1335484448557522944 2020-12-06 15:21:19 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @joshtpm Absolutely. When Trump pressures the GA Governor to purge and invalidate millions of legally cast ballots  he’s violating the Voting Rights Act. If we can’t expect Barr’s DOJ to act we should at least be hearing vocal objections from Attorneys Generals at other levels by now.
1335478666587860993 2020-12-06 14:58:20 +0800 <chessclubgringo> So why the he’ll isn’t anyone in law enforcement taking this up as a real issue at this point? I don’t expect anything from Barr’s DOJ, but US Attorneys &amp; Attorneys General etc could be calling for action by now.

1335364743633186817 2020-12-06 07:25:39 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @CharlesMBlow Isn’t an attempt to invalidate legally cast ballots a crime? I’m not expecting Bill Barr to file charges, but is their a place for state charges to be filed either in Georgia or in DC?

1333180068114223105 2020-11-30 06:44:32 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @BeaglesResist @JenniferJJacobs I wonder how many empty suitcases he’s bringing?
1333170742943309825 2020-11-30 06:07:28 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @AmyAThatcher I’m late to an easy one 😔 A steamer.

You can still find them with 150k - low mileage for them. My ‘96 Tacoma has 281k and still goes 4k btw oil changes  without loosing oil. Lots of sticks out there too, better mileage more control. Happy trails :)
1333145371908861953 2020-11-30 04:26:39 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @xeni I’m sorry for your loss and for all the callousness that’s being aimed at you on top of that. I’m hoping other members of the family are on the mend now too. ❤️❤️
1333129648675328002 2020-11-30 03:24:11 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @nberlat Yeah, all realities are either good for him or bad for him, with his reality being essentially pliable. He’s always in a fight to have his best facts accepted, and his followers admire the fight.

1332860925263577090 2020-11-29 09:36:22 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @nberlat Felt lost watching it, realizing I didn’t know enough going in. It left me thinking of Blight’s coverage of Brown, which was textured and from the Douglas vantage but fairly brief. Hawke puts a spin on his version of Brown that was compelling but seemed to miss on tone.
1332856022600273922 2020-11-29 09:16:53 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @davenewworld_2 Strange affect.

1332848796544376832 2020-11-29 08:48:10 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @nberlat I’d be curious what you thought of the John Brown portrayal in the recent Showtime series: The Good Lord Bird. Also, interesting coverage of JB in the recent Frederick Douglass Bio by David Blight.
1332821502702493696 2020-11-29 06:59:43 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @BMeiselas @KLoeffler Surprisingly wide spectrum of folks included here agreeing that Kelly Loeffler needs to be voted out.

Then he pulls up a chair for a non-panel soft interview with Culter or Bannon or Yiannopoulos. Yeah, if he’s a liberal it’s only in the Adam Smith sense.

Dehumanizing language is a slippery slope. If you’re trying to get the other side not to do that, you can’t do it yourself.

They upgraded to color at that point for many photos etc. It’s not one of those huge, leave open on a stand kind type, but still pretty comprehensive. I should remember to open it up more these days.

1331617452422176768 2020-11-25 23:15:15 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @Professing_Prof @LLinWood And maybe they care more about whether their supporters and the people in their lives live or die?

1325864022068125696 2020-11-10 02:13:10 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @HudsonRiverCroc A form of simple lashing out I suspect.

1325646838569955328 2020-11-09 11:50:10 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @joelpollak That would also be true for many other blue states combos that together add up to 40 million people. What’s your point exactly?
1325548132319469568 2020-11-09 05:17:56 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @MZHemingway Think about picking your damn metaphors more appropriately. You shill for the party that puts abusers in office and in the west wing specifically. You’re in no position to lecture.

1324791403684265985 2020-11-07 03:10:58 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @AP You have enough to call NV &amp; PA even if you reset AZ for now. Right?
1324790447676542978 2020-11-07 03:07:10 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @AP He’s going to talk about his plans as our new President. CALL THE DAMN ELECTION!
1324751307542994946 2020-11-07 00:31:39 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @JimZarroli President-elect.   It’s not rocket science.

1324741977724743681 2020-11-06 23:54:34 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @molly_knight One of the networks that already has a 264 map active might take the plunge first. AP, Politico or Fox are the ones I know in that category. Calling PA first I suspect. Thoughts?
1324740685115715585 2020-11-06 23:49:26 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @Lawrence I think it’s more “light at the end of the tunnel” time.

1324714254247718912 2020-11-06 22:04:24 +0800 <chessclubgringo> And now PA too I guess.
1324712584084295681 2020-11-06 21:57:46 +0800 <chessclubgringo> No one has added Georgia or Nevada to the official Biden tally yet. But has anyone else been trying out the phrase: President Elect Joe Biden?

1324545394668351489 2020-11-06 10:53:25 +0800 <chessclubgringo> Trump now ahead by less than 2000 votes in Georgia.  https://t.co/3FKQsdA1ly

1324535965617192960 2020-11-06 10:15:57 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @IamDarrenD It sounded like sick irony typing it up, but unfortunately I think you’re right. I’m still hoping he might have his parole revoked over it.
1324534123994796033 2020-11-06 10:08:38 +0800 <chessclubgringo> @IamDarrenD Bannon also made his case for a return to medieval policial norms, advocating for heads on pikes in front of the White House.

I responded with an image of the hatefulness that most concerns me. Hate and a culture of violence are being encouraged actively by the trump right.
