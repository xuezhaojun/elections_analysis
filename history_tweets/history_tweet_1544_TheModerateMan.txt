1322247466838872075 2020-10-31 02:42:16 +0800 <TheModerateMan> @BennyBFrat @Mobius22_ Benny, I believe in criminal justice reform, legal marijuana, background checks on gun sales, renewable energy, etc. On some of these issues, Biden more closely aligns with my philosophy.  I‚Äôll tag you both on a thread that explains why I‚Äôm team Trump this election.
1322217030184017920 2020-10-31 00:41:20 +0800 <TheModerateMan> @BennyBFrat @Mobius22_ I have found far leftists to generally be very, very intolerant of other people‚Äôs political beliefs. Benny does not appear to be any different.

1321487354964676611 2020-10-29 00:21:52 +0800 <TheModerateMan> ...The methods used to help Joe Biden in this election set a terrible precedent. This should not be the new normal. Voters should send a strong message that they reject these tactics.
1321487353685381120 2020-10-29 00:21:51 +0800 <TheModerateMan> 3. The Democrats have obstructed this President (Russia, Ukraine, etc.), major networks such as CNN are basically propaganda machines of the left, tech giants are censoring free expression on the internet, and protestors have physically assaulted the opposition...
1321487351999303680 2020-10-29 00:21:51 +0800 <TheModerateMan> 2. Joe Biden has surrounded himself with radicals. Bernie Sanders had an important role in shaping the Democratic platform. AOC has been appointed to Biden‚Äôs climate task force. Several Joe Biden staffers supported the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which bailed out rioters this Summer.
1321487350858473477 2020-10-29 00:21:51 +0800 <TheModerateMan> 1. Joe Biden lacks the mental fitness and physical stamina to endure the rigors of being President.
1321487349528801280 2020-10-29 00:21:50 +0800 <TheModerateMan> However, this is not a normal election and it is not a tough call for me at all. I plan on voting for President Trump without reservation. Policies aside, here are three primary reasons why:
1321487346546679808 2020-10-29 00:21:50 +0800 <TheModerateMan> * #MyVote Thread *  There are policies I agree with President Trump on and there are policies I agree with Joe Biden on.  In a normal election, it would be a tough call, but I probably agree with President Trump on the more of major the policies so he‚Äôd get my vote.

1312565538460233728 2020-10-04 09:29:45 +0800 <TheModerateMan> Opinion: Young/healthy people face more risk to their wellbeing from the shutdowns than from actual COVID-19.
1312565158494044160 2020-10-04 09:28:14 +0800 <TheModerateMan> @CaringHeartSoul I understand that that many people have lost their lives. It‚Äôs tragic. Very few percentage-wise have been young and healthy.  Just my opinion but I believe young and healthy people face more risk to their health from the shutdowns than from actual COVID-19.

1307705941870206982 2020-09-20 23:39:27 +0800 <TheModerateMan> @cathysloanva @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Cathy, President Trump is running against Joe Biden, not President Bush. I think Joe Biden has some bad policies and, more concerning, has some terrible people in his ear. I also question his mental fitness.
1307705107883098117 2020-09-20 23:36:08 +0800 <TheModerateMan> @BennyBFrat @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Benny, there are many other important issues. Again, I am generally more aligned with President Trump on policy so I‚Äôll deal with occasional inappropriate comments.

That said, this is an area that I am more aligned with Biden on policy. It‚Äôs concerning though that extremist AOC may have a major environmental role in his administration.
1307702827872145410 2020-09-20 23:27:04 +0800 <TheModerateMan> @BennyBFrat @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump In regards to civil rights, I‚Äôd like to see the Second Step Act signed into law, further prison and sentencing reform, ending the war on drugs, and legalization of marijuana.

For decades, Biden has spearheaded policies that have resulted in the imprisonment of millions of Americans, disproportionately black men. President Trump signed into law the First Step Act to the undo some of the damage.
1307701157159108608 2020-09-20 23:20:26 +0800 <TheModerateMan> @BennyBFrat @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Economy: Prior to COVID-19, we were kicking ass- low unemployment, wage growth, wealth creation, record stock market, etc.  A frequent critique I have of the President though is the growth of the national debt. However, Biden is not committing to lower as far as I know.
1307699990459019264 2020-09-20 23:15:48 +0800 <TheModerateMan> @BennyBFrat @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Sure, let‚Äôs take them one by one...

1303317314063003649 2020-09-08 21:00:36 +0800 <TheModerateMan> Instead of sensible steps like quarantine rules for infected students, increased testing, mask rules, and protecting those at high risk, the University of NC at Chapel Hill, switched to remote learning for undergrads after learning of 135 COVID-19 infection cases in one week.

According to a recent poll, 81% of black Americans do not want the police defunded, much less abolished.  These ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù protestors do not speak for the black community. They are anarchists and Marxists.  https://t.co/YAwK8RRRON

1301194928735879175 2020-09-03 00:27:00 +0800 <TheModerateMan> I encourage moderate Democrats to split with the lunatic fringe of the party. Either walk away or encourage them to join the Green Party that openly embraces deranged concepts such as defunding the police.

1300592466861719554 2020-09-01 08:33:02 +0800 <TheModerateMan> If Portland and Seattle are any indication, electing radical left politicians will embolden, not pacify, ANTIFA and other lunatics.
