AND YOU WON'T SIGN IT.  3) #230Protections are NOT #COVID19 RELATED!

1329053051618009089 2020-11-18 21:25:14 +0800 <TravelingUS> @DrakeWingGaming Donald Trump is not new to this.  He has made certain that everyone around him has done something that he can use against them.
1329052850903781380 2020-11-18 21:24:26 +0800 <TravelingUS> @damnplastic I understand.  I believe all what I said. I believe he will resign in time for Pence to pardon him.   Trump is not a beginner. He is made certain that he has dirtied Mike up enough so that he has no choice but to pardon him.

1329042419208351745 2020-11-18 20:42:59 +0800 <TravelingUS> @thomaskaine5 Pence will pardon Trump.  Congress must investigate and report to us how this happened &amp; safeguard against a repeat.

1329040318289883138 2020-11-18 20:34:38 +0800 <TravelingUS> I suspect Mike Pence will pardon him for all actions during past 4 yrs in White House like Nixon. We need to know what he did, pass legislation to prevent it, prosecute ALL co-conspirators through an independent DOJ.   Manhattan DA election in July. They all promise prosecution.

1324482266207297536 2020-11-06 06:42:34 +0800 <TravelingUS> @aprilbaer @rickpluta 3/ The Republican Party, to my estimation is not genuine in its pursuit of a "broader coalition." They did it successfully once. The backlash of racism after Reconstruction has not been reconciled - they aren't ready to give it up. America has been turning browner for 400 years.

He grew up in Pence's hometown, attended Columbus High School in 1917 (one of a handful of black students) His family was in politics after Reconstruction. Nixon was a "wrong turn."

1324463025110339593 2020-11-06 05:26:07 +0800 <TravelingUS> 2/  If the Republican party writ large believes him to be the future of the party, they are as misguided as they were in 1961 when my Uncle resigned as national GOP Minority Affairs Director after 34 yrs of working in the party. He predicted the past 50 yrs of veiled racism.

1323973080201465856 2020-11-04 20:59:15 +0800 <TravelingUS> QUESTION @AliVelshi  Does #Canadian Media report as intensely as we do on Election Day/Night.   I kind of feel like we need less of this media frenzy.
1323971311895564290 2020-11-04 20:52:13 +0800 <TravelingUS> @djrothkopf When I was phone banking I got a lot of push back on the phrase "defuned the police" ...   The message should have been reform the police ... We gave him a weapon.
1323971021557424130 2020-11-04 20:51:04 +0800 <TravelingUS> @AliciaJacobs @DecisionDeskHQ People who were on the border of voting for Trump told me one thing that turned them off and that was the phrase "defuned the police."   We were not careful in our messaging. He took advantage of it in the suburbs and in Florida he took advantage of it with the Cubans.

They estimate 100 hours to count absentee ballots. They will finish AFTER Nov 3rd.

By the way she avoids answering simple questions of fact, I am guessing she is racist. No, adopting 2 black children does not exempt her (i.e. Thomas Jefferson).
