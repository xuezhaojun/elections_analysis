BREXIT is very much in line with the priorities of Aleksandr Dugin, the anti-Western Russian geopolitical theorist who has been a mentor to BOTH Putin and Steve Bannon.  Bannon has deeply connected to UK and other European Far Right.

So obvious he was throwing Jr. to the wolves (when he was still worried about Mueller).

She was defiant about not foregoing "normal" life, including restaurants, way back last spring.  Given limited testing, ANY of us here could have been symptomatic.  People in CONTACT with her could well have had a not-great year (or last month(s)).

1343270764057931776 2020-12-28 03:01:21 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @BCDreyer I was horrified by her last spring but realized that she was a Trollstress who I presume monetizes her hate clicks.  She has emerged this weekend for some free range shaming, dismissing, and minimizing, but she got nuthin' on my Irish Catholic elderly female relations.

1343257936827723779 2020-12-28 02:10:23 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @stevensantos The thing that blows my mind about this person is she was openly defiant about social distancing protocols. And testing here was so limited. We ALL could gave been asymptomatic so this woman could, literally, have contributed to killing a granny or two here.
1343255907845742595 2020-12-28 02:02:19 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @stevensantos   Speaking of pharma-lobbyists named Kirsten (or Heather).  In pre-Covid life, were you ever stuck between two "Wooooooing" girls at a bar, attempting to converse through your ear canals?  Bonus for  blonde hair whipping around and landing on your cheeseburger.
1343254858783195141 2020-12-28 01:58:09 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @EJKessler She just trolled someone who lost two close relatives this year.    She is indeed in a league of her own and apparently revels in the  hate-clicks.

1342998555590610944 2020-12-27 08:59:42 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> I teach English, am fascinated with accents.

1342979714764464129 2020-12-27 07:44:50 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @paledave   Really enjoy your criticism.  This may sound odd, but the phrase that came to my mind was "loving but rigorous."  Have you ever taught English Lit?

1342977852447334400 2020-12-27 07:37:26 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @paledave @JFly99 One last thing.  Another Mega Camp flick is "Eating Raoul" from the early 80's, featuring Edie McClurg as a swinger who has an unfortunate encounter with a hot tub.
1342977134311178242 2020-12-27 07:34:34 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @paledave I can't believe that flick came out in 2015!!!  @JFly99 does some great live tweets and is very active in LA storytelling scene.

1342962643515142144 2020-12-27 06:36:59 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Once again, Sirk's "All That Heaven Allow" is from a different culture (50's) but still has enormous emotional resonance.

Even worse, as flag was doused with accelerant and burned, it burned slowly from right to left and the last thing to go was the "Asbury" church brand.

I believe based on the clothes and her youthful appearance that this may be early 1900s.  In addition to the Daytona intimidation, as a young woman, KKK also threatened to burn down her school.

Audiences weren't accustomed to this.  As movie got wilder and wilder, a matronly woman jumped up, and ran out, yelling:  "I'm gettin' OUTTA HERE!"

1338504229485481986 2020-12-14 23:20:51 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @jzmurdock @Yahoo One of these churches is Asbury Methodist, founded in 1836 and on Natl. Register of Historic Places.    ONE member of church? 1st African-American woman to head up a federal agency (under FDR), Dr. Mary MacLeod Bethune.   1.

1338499908983279618 2020-12-14 23:03:41 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @JoshuaPotash I am convinced the P Boys also attacked random individuals and couples who they "pronounced" were "Antifa" or "Trump protestors."  I live here.  People need to come in to bring family to hospitals, to staff corp.  law IT and mailrooms, to staff hotels these thugs stayed at.

1338476409229029377 2020-12-14 21:30:18 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> 1,000 raging Proud Boys roamed thru downtown DC Saturday night and burned African American church banners and the Democratic leadership is  virtually silent.  This sucks.

1337971962036056065 2020-12-13 12:05:48 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @BengyCompson They are clearly emboldened.  I remember that when they went to an East Side Republican event, they jumped onto a subway train and I believe they targeted to tourists from Asia.  Not sure if just harassment.    When bring accelerant and burning banners, what might they do next.

1337965632629960705 2020-12-13 11:40:39 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @B52Malmet I am disturbed and monitoring, as I know people who live in these DC city areas, and if they happen to make their way home from work or a date, and "look" like a target, they could be in terrible danger from a ritualized Proud Boy "beat down "
1337964798550691844 2020-12-13 11:37:20 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @Politidope I am so disgusted with what is happening in DC tonight.  The Police Chief needs to resign.

1337963659956457478 2020-12-13 11:32:49 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @BengyCompson In earnest, these thugs congregate at Harris Hotel.  I worry about kitchen staff, night desk people encountering these thugs in the street on their way to/from their shifts  PBs SEEK OUT vulnerable people to "beat down" as form of status.  Extra status for beating "immigrants."

1337956875082600451 2020-12-13 11:05:51 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @MarkJacob16 NBC/MSNBC is corporate media that, when it COUNTS, will do Trump's bidding.  I think any journalist worth a damn is likely resigned by now.  The rest will keep their mouth shut about this.

Also, to advance in Proud Boys, members NEED to engage in street "beatdowns."

Some poor souls pleaded out and are now felons (among other things, affects license to practice law).  Plus 2 years of legal bills, stress, life disruption.   https://t.co/27y5P4e6wS
1336738582061608960 2020-12-10 02:24:48 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @leedavidgraham Indeed.  Same M.O of Obama birth certificate, even big splash of Sessions' 2016 felony protestor arrests.  Same end.  Issue flaps about for a month, year, years then ignominiously dies, but does REAL harm in interim.  1.

1336479353882992643 2020-12-09 09:14:43 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @PunkrockPM @SometimesReese @70s_party Key is to cut FRESH sprouts in half and slice sausage at 1/2 inch or a bit less. Same for grapes on separate tray.  The oil oozing from the spicy sausage makes a dressing with the thick grapey syrup.

1336451584889401347 2020-12-09 07:24:22 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @PunkrockPM @70s_party I would suggest something rather spicy and rich, so flavor stands up to the sprounts.  Merguez, spicy Italian?

The great irony is that he will be the man who is President as we move on from unimaginable national loss and sorrow.  It is a strange blessing that he has this unique history.

It is baked into me and controlled by PTSD therapy, meditation, but it is person I AM.    But I will bring up as needed to help others with similar issues.    1/2

1334540989747376128 2020-12-04 00:52:21 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @poet3008 I am very disappointed. From General Milley, to the BOP guards, DEA guys, National Guard, to the park police, NOT ONE took a stand and REFUSED to forcibly "clear" citizens assembling in THEIR National Park!   Then Trump marched on through it after as if it was HIS.  It is not.
1334539825895116800 2020-12-04 00:47:43 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @poet3008 In this case, I believe this mature lady was hit in the thigh with a metal shard  from a container of pepper spray or some other chemical.    These kind young men carried her to safety while the big galoot military guys stood behind the park fence and WATCHED.

1333256605593460736 2020-11-30 11:48:40 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @LoWudang @antoniogm Not necessarily cutting edge, six-figure treatment for all, but a baseline policy  that no uninsured, laid-off worker would die homeless in a tent of pneumonia for lack of antibiotics, after being sent home from emergency room and advised to "drink tea with honey."
1333255344169111553 2020-11-30 11:43:39 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @realNicMattson @antoniogm Yes, but this case-by-case approach is a random drop in the bucket that does nothing to revolutionize the conceit that medical care (at some base level) was a consumer item rather than a human right.
1333254336189771778 2020-11-30 11:39:39 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @antoniogm I recall a German standing among the glitter of Times Square, who    commented that the USA was a barbaric place, filled with the finest of technology (including medical) where someone could still die for want rudimentary   healthcare.
1333253242680176641 2020-11-30 11:35:18 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @RanuDhillon And, of course, Trump "threw out" a pandemic playbook left by President Obama, motivated by hi obsession with destroying his legacy, regardless of the cost of that to the population.

Feedback from real life experience needs to flow in so "fine tuning" of plan can take place as needed.    Care must be taken to make sure plan doesn't become "rigid."

1333098273855434753 2020-11-30 01:19:30 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @MichelleMoggio Michelle M., just LOVE your blog.  When my Mom was younger, we traveled together to Paris and were "shoo'd away" several times.    NO ONE is as officious as a French gatekeeper with a natty mustache!
1333096821632208897 2020-11-30 01:13:44 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @MichelleMoggio I believe that if Americans (and leaders like our future Secretary of State under Biden) urged and incentivized more cultural  travel by U.S. citizens) we would bloom as a nation.  It is so sad that of the FEW Americans I saw in Tokyo,  80% were sailors/GIs on weekend leave.

1332692402084122627 2020-11-28 22:26:43 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @Mel_Batoste @waltshaub @mikememoli @CBSSunday @thechrisbarron Rat communities grow to depend on food sources and once DC commuters stayed home, restaurant traffic dwindled, their garbage supply dried up.    Rat cannibalism is bad sign.  Rats DO breed less when hungry and, sadly, there is a lot of cannibalism of rat babies as well.

1331632391618703362 2020-11-26 00:14:37 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @drbfg Peterson was evaluated by his peers and rightly labeled as no more than a "gamey obscurantist" years ago.  The "free speech" thing is misdirection and publication is about simple greed.   https://t.co/bl7f4bXG2o

He has been rejected and is now a force dedicated to damaging us to maximum extent possible and then undermining positive governing efforts so he will have something to rail against in his "2024 campaign."
1330530332634980381 2020-11-22 23:15:26 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @UROCKlive1 This makes Trump's absolute disinterest in G22 pandemic panel, and blowing meeting off to play golf, logical.  Trump is now invested in creating the most blighted nation possible for a Democrat who BEAT him to inherit.
1330529828152414210 2020-11-22 23:13:25 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Does anyone for a moment think Trump would NOT obstruct Covid relief and vaccine distribution and INCREASE Covid nfection and death rates to harm an enemy (which in his sick mind he considers Biden)?  Trump is a saboteur.

1329063143490920450 2020-11-18 22:05:20 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> This is how the Trumpublicans roll.  Did they get tactical advise from the seven members of Congress who spent the 4th of July of 2018 at Putin's Kremin?
1329062947658870784 2020-11-18 22:04:34 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> With white nationalists in Trump End Days,  there is no such thing as a dog whistle, or some kind of sneaky Lee Atwater strategy to sneak in the racism.

1328196782619291648 2020-11-16 12:42:44 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @AdamMacRoss Disgusting thing was that they slunk into BLM Plaza later and pulled signs off fence and high quality "Black Lives Matter" sign off building, TORE it, the STOMPED on it, jumping and kicking with both feet.  If that sign was a human being, it would have been beaten into a coma.

Italy is closing LOCAL and national borders right now to get a handle on increasing infection rates.  No one into Italy (virtually).  Then provinces closed.  E.g.  a person NOW IN Positano or  Sorrento can't leave their province, called Salerno.

Imagine if pandemic monitors in China hadn't been SHUT DOWN by Trump in fall?  We may have nipped this in the bud by late Feb. or March.  Or at least saved 100,000 plus lives.
1327235377959198721 2020-11-13 21:02:27 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @srfrgrl1959 @SurvivingMyWay Goes against principle of keeping populations LOCAL, so that mutations don't infect distant locations.  2nd wave in Europe this fall attributed largely to one or many travelers back home who carried mutated strain of Covid (from Spain) BACK from their vacation,  to UK, etc.1/2

Finland has nationalized healthcare   BUT they made exception for anyone infected with COVID after visiting Sweden (largely maskless, trying hybrid herd-immunity approach).  In that case, Finn had to foot bill for resultant COVID care.

At Trump Hotel with Kimberly Guilfoyle.   https://t.co/dcprbCMuKm

Interesting!   https://t.co/TjzxJKYowx  YES!  There is a Guilfoyle POINT to all this, thus being the link to the RNC itself as she and Junior invade.

Hyde and The Mysterious Belgian Guy texted about where "she" (the Ambassador) was, and what she was doing.  Later claiming they were just "joking."

1325111091131801603 2020-11-08 00:21:18 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Could you have imagined a totally mismanaged plague that infected most of the White House and killed hundreds of thousands, boarded up buildings, cannibal rats, and Malta yachts (&amp; potential pirates)?  @HayesBrown   But at LEAST we have Gritty "Game of Thrones" memes!
1325109999287341056 2020-11-08 00:16:57 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @VABVOX I notice when guys assemble stuff, there are ALWAYS a couple of extra little pieces left over at the end, which they insist are not needed.  Cue sudden collapse of new book shelf.
1325109517382787072 2020-11-08 00:15:02 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @VABVOX I noticed the guy giving you "how to be a reporter" advice, and you snapped right back quite nicely!
1325109338403450881 2020-11-08 00:14:20 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @VABVOX There may be a few, but I haven't run into many.  Looking things up on Google is as "emasculating" (to them) as looking up assembly instructions or reading the map (they seem to be better at GPS).    I tried to teach my ex-husband a computer app ONCE, and he kept interrupting me!

1325108032267837442 2020-11-08 00:09:08 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @stevensantos Steve S., I am glad that you are in the creative arts, as you have great technical skills (your "eye" is amazing) but also a warm heart, passion and soul.  There are a few filmakers (some even considered "auteurs") whose work I despise, given what total SHITS they are!
1325107465025941505 2020-11-08 00:06:53 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @stevensantos Such an incredibly shallow and cold-hearted take.  What an empty walnut-kernel of a human being.    Some of the takes coming out of financial market reporters are equally cold.

The American Film Institute down the road from me in Silver Spring, MD hosts some wonderful festivals.  I hope someday her work will be shown there.
1325105864336945157 2020-11-08 00:00:31 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @sturgidson Hello.  Did you reach your goal?    I hope your friend and her family are getting back on their feet.  Based not on direct experience but from what I have heard and read, the Lebanese sound like wonderful, hospitable people.

"Sable pelts...backbone of the Soviet economy.  The killer whose smuggling sables out of Mother Russia...kills three victims to protect his empire."    Weekend - pp 16-17

1325100536656441345 2020-11-07 23:39:21 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @ToniJens @WanbliWeiden @abirdsaun13 @SaraLSpurgeon1 "Gorky Park" was featured extensively in a book I love, "The Weekend Novelist Writes a Mystery" by Robert J. Ray and Jack Remick.  Even before reading this "how-to" I loved both the film AND the novel.    1st
1325100006450339842 2020-11-07 23:37:15 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @WanbliWeiden @abirdsaun13 Wow.  That is a wonderful nugget of info.

1325052867376525312 2020-11-07 20:29:56 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @elianayjohnson Biden-Harris transition team should put together a special project to contact every individual who resigned/retired/was forced out and create an offer of retroactive reinstatement at at LEAST  full years of service with consideration also as warranted of promotion/restitution.

Meanwhile, there was a genetic MUTATION of the COVID virus in Spain.  Guess how it spread into rest of Europe now?  "Holiday" travelers coming back from Spain.  Argh.

1320295839147974659 2020-10-25 17:27:12 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @djrothkopf I was 10 and 11 in that '68 to '69 period and we ALWAYS watched the nightly news and read the "death count."  Everyone in our neighborhood had a son, brother, uncle or grandson in Viet Nam or were visiting someone at the VA who had come back disabled.  It permeated the culture.

1320291161978949632 2020-10-25 17:08:37 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @crimdefend I remember in '69 as a 5th grader watching the nightly death toll in Viet Nam so well.  Loved this scene.  Just action, no polemic.
1320290970970263552 2020-10-25 17:07:51 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @crimdefend What a magnificent film.  I loved the structure, and the regular post-trial discussions at their law office in the evening, plus the flashback scenes.

His closest staffer, Marc Short.  He WILL be in Senate Monday for Barrett vote.  Maybe he will give Senator McConnell a giant hug and kiss for his great work on this.  #RepublicanDeathCult

1320249836738924544 2020-10-25 14:24:24 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @RepsForBiden Last spring, he accused nurses of sneaking out the hospital back door with PPE to sell it.

The brand is also divisive, norm-defying, nihilistic, transgressive, and potentially seditious.   1/2

1320166888832438272 2020-10-25 08:54:48 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @1wineaux1 @atrupar I guess that is the flag for "US" of who he represents, rather than "We The People" which the American flag represents.  Sadly, he may be ramping up for deliberate use of "another" flag in a divisive way if he loses, trying to divide the country in two even more explicitly.
1320162988955979777 2020-10-25 08:39:18 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> I wish they could make like private corporations and have a security guard escort him out the day after the election, after deactivating his computer and key fob.
1320158552569401345 2020-10-25 08:21:40 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @atrupar That is shameful.  It is NOT the American flag we pledge allegiance to.

1320129104738398209 2020-10-25 06:24:40 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @atrupar TRUMP RALLY  Hi! Anyone in Circleville Ohio know if this is a legitimate order of Sisters there?  Most of this type of habit in 2020 is worn by CLOISTERED nuns who never leave their convent.    Plus, do NOT pull mask down to expose nose!  https://t.co/1b1Z2QUmG5

1320126925847801862 2020-10-25 06:16:00 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> They look questionable to me.   Most nuns in habits of that sort are cloistered and would never be on the screen behind speaker at campaign rally.

1319918859093184512 2020-10-24 16:29:13 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @lizziedearden @N_Waters89 This is truly transnational far-right terror.  From police officers to state governors in the U.S., to Republican bullying of Christoper Steele, to Trump's stochastic terror against "female socialists" (direct ref. to Sen.

1318771809274167301 2020-10-21 12:31:15 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Clearly, the "chain of custody" for these 545 was CUT, but bits and pieces of the chain may be out there.  And people talk.  Someone took a child from point a, to b to c, to d, to END, and I doubt there was anything like "cells" here to keep info tighly held.
1318770872447045633 2020-10-21 12:27:32 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> On the "other end," send investigators to Latin America, gathering data on any "lost" children, build a DNA data base.    *  Q.  I would want to ask experts how much detail DNA could show in area of indigenous groups.  Tracking regions where a group lived (cross-national).
1318770352907059200 2020-10-21 12:25:28 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> 3.  The reason for smaller tranches for the very young would be to customize search tactics for age and for lack of memory of parents.  Also for likely connections.  Up to one year, highest  likelihood of ADOPTION.  Tween females, concern for risk of trafficking.
1318769847086534657 2020-10-21 12:23:27 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> 2.  After I had all the above data together, I would create "rows" of data for all 545, STARTING with (as known):  * First_Name * Last_Name * Middle_Name * Age  Then tranche for each AGE from 0-3 months, 3-6 months, 6 -9 months, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7 to 18.
1318768228978597888 2020-10-21 12:17:01 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> If I were coming in on January 20th at 12:01 p.m to start investigating the Trump Administration's child separation atrocity, I would first ask for EVERY scrap of data available for each of the 545, and EVERY bit of intell from Latin American on deportees who had LOST a child.

1318731277277777920 2020-10-21 09:50:12 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @RabbiJill This IS, literally, a form of genocide.  545 families who are grievously torn apart and broken.  Deliberately.
1318731060407095297 2020-10-21 09:49:20 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @RabbiJill I think dogged pursuit, financial incentives, and human intelligence (HUMINT) with some possibly skeevy operatives, plus blood tests of ALL unconnected people who are found, could make a dent in this.    2/2  Just a few suggesetions:
1318730888599998464 2020-10-21 09:48:39 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @RabbiJill The auditor part of me calls BS on this though.  If Eichmann could be found in South America long after the Germans surrendered, I think every one of these 545 souls can be connected to their families.  The problem is, how LONG will it take?  1/2
1318729999063670784 2020-10-21 09:45:07 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @RabbiJill Too much to take in all at once.  Peace to you, Rabbi.

We also had on other nights a mariachi band, a bagpiper,  a giant shark cosplayer, and a T-Rex playing air guitar!
1318313468852830214 2020-10-20 06:09:58 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @afewblue @melissastclair7 @diva3102 @BipolarAmerican @PGourevitch @sarahkendzior This is one of the most wonderful tweets I ever received.  I spent a long childhood being teased about my "wild imagination."  Take care, hang in there.   I would happily work to make this happen.  MASKED and socially distanced, natch.
1318313054975778817 2020-10-20 06:08:20 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Halloween 2020.  I think "Lobster Roll Being Ravaged By Seagull" could be an amazing Halloween costume.  @Cerulean_Man A lobster roll on a Maine dock has the deep cultural resonance of fish and chips at the sea, perhaps in Scotland, in UK.
1318311981112299521 2020-10-20 06:04:04 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Seagulls are the sharks of the food shacks on the docks.  The are lurking, just WAITING for their chance.

Hire local DC people who need work, with JOB ONE,  to come and help dismantle and carry away those gawdawful barriers at the White House.  Also hire entertainers, and MURALISTS to creat some great murals on Penn Ave.

The first few weeks of #KremlinAnnex , the sunsets and night air were incredible, and every night, things go more epic.  My personal favorite was Broadway actors on their night off coming down to sing with us.
1318307392959008769 2020-10-20 05:45:50 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Great shade here. MSN has been reading @atrupar  I like the reference to Trump's series of "startling" pronoucements.  Personally, I do not fine them "startling" and would instead use the alternate terms:  * Bizarro * Gonzo * Bonkers * Barking Mad   https://t.co/siAGeWlezO

1317345888558305281 2020-10-17 14:05:09 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @Snowbirdsix1000   Thanks for the faves.  Watched "10 Most Wanted" series on Netflix, episode on Semion Mogilevich.  Didn't know he was on that list.  He is in Russia, I imagine he is at some very remote and guarded location,

1317223089583816706 2020-10-17 05:57:12 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @susanl_author Saw this shrine on a lovely fall day in Tokyo, 2003. A nursery school was having a picnic, sitting among the statues.  Stunning contrast.  Saw several older women praying inside. Wrote fable10 years later, it came to me in tiny snippets and images.
1317222055641743361 2020-10-17 05:53:05 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Ta for the fave.  Would love to know what you think of my "Jizo" fable. One reader called it "allusive", but I have also wondered if it is impenetrable, or if I got my ideas across in a way that was clear to any reader (from the text itself).

1317217207571615752 2020-10-17 05:33:49 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> 2.  Another image that haunted me from Tokyo.  The Jizo, protecting the water spirits, the souls of the lost, the miscarried, the aborted.  A liminal place, and a mindset so unlike that in the U.S.   https://t.co/xSnnve7wDh
1317216681496879104 2020-10-17 05:31:44 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @susanl_author I tweet a lot but this is where I think out loud, work out ideas and connections, curate great info, and simultaneously fold socks, sort paper, etc. during tweetage.  A combination of journal and virtual salon.
1317216027487371265 2020-10-17 05:29:08 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @susanl_author Indeed. A day off every so often (or evening) is lovely.   I would love to know HOW you balance your day job with your writing/marketing.  For me it is a constant struggle, but I don't want to skimp on sleep and a little exercise, for the long-term.
1317215115868078080 2020-10-17 05:25:30 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @Jules_pea @KaypeeLondon We are having renewed outbreaks in Wash. DC, White House building alone more COVID than all ofViet Nam, and so many restaurants are out of business that the giant brown rats that grew fat on dumpsters are roving in packs in search of food and cannibalizing other rats.
1317214242064445440 2020-10-17 05:22:02 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @Jules_pea @KaypeeLondon In contrast, due to leadership and a totally different policy mindset, New Zealand IS, now back to zero percent internally-transmitted COVID (any cases from outside caught at nation's borders and isolated).  The "reward" is a public life, tastings, meetings, "normal" life.
1317213695030841345 2020-10-17 05:19:52 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @Jules_pea @KaypeeLondon Horrible for people in hospitality industry.  In France, initially, Macron, recognizing life was not "normal" declared the "job" of everyone was beating a viral existential threat.  "War footing." Closed cafes, but subsidized wait staff whose civic duty it was to quarantine.

1316780555082641416 2020-10-16 00:38:43 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Likely spreader event, at what level unknowable.  Inadequate contact tracing.
1316780379290959873 2020-10-16 00:38:01 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> P.S.  But of course we will NEVER see satisfactory results of contact tracing of this event, or Rose Garden super spreader, as any feeble attempts to do so were too little, too late and these people and any infection they carry have spread to the four corners of the earth.
1316779964411383810 2020-10-16 00:36:22 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Of DIRECT relevance to me as I work in DC, go in on certain days, and in the 25 days since these events, our infection rates have skyrocketed.  Highest since mid-summer after steady decline.  Incredibly enraging that White House has more cases than Viet Nam and Laos,  COMBINED.
1316779403628752902 2020-10-16 00:34:09 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Curious to see results of contact tracing of this whole group of ministers and public figures in this grouping  I don't have name at moment, but know at least one of these ministers attended this event AND Rose Garden super spreader and is confirmed POSITIVE    1/2

1316747779658649607 2020-10-15 22:28:29 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @Skyler4149 @JournalistJG Given general collapse of "investigate the investigator" ploy, Durham in stasis following resignation ofclosest staffer, Barr giving up, and Trump's own senior staffers contradicting his absurd attacks on his hand picked pet Attorney General, yeah, he'll slink away.

1316746400110125056 2020-10-15 22:23:00 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @LibbyCudmore @JoeBiden On the other hand:  * Why won't Donald Trump exterminate the lice in the baby cages?  * Why won't Donald Trump stop existentially dancing on the graves of the thousands of people he let die unnecessarily?  *  Why won't Donald Trump WEAR A DANG MASK?
1316745572703965185 2020-10-15 22:19:43 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @LibbyCudmore @JoeBiden The entire framing of the "Why won't Joe Biden" is yawpy and importuning.  It is also the most nauseatingly passive-aggressive type of verbal attack.
1316745073640566784 2020-10-15 22:17:44 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @LibbyCudmore @JoeBiden I think this could be the beginning of a trend.    * Why won't Joe Biden tell "Us" if he's turned his heat on and gotten out the winter sheets?  *  "Why won't Joe Biden tell "Us" when he stopped kicking stray dogs?"

1316646972808466435 2020-10-15 15:47:55 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @janeworld1 @JoeNBC Here she is with his team when investigation had just started, in Wing Woman position.  That IS her  from other photos.  She is a longtime close associate of Durham.  That is a devastating resignation that sent dhockwaves thru DOJ  https://t.co/qovzBUjQEa

1316636068012273664 2020-10-15 15:04:35 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> No one is mentioning the "Acting" BETWEEN Acting Sherwin (July 2020)and Lieu (confirmed by Senate), Acting Neal!  Acting Neal (Winter-Spring 2020)  (face circled) sent on to DEA in May, armed with DOJ opinion expanding DEA powers to let Barr build his DC protest "street army."  https://t.co/Mhx5uZdI4d
1316634108865449984 2020-10-15 14:56:48 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @Dev4Security   Acting Sherwin brought in to replace Acting Neal, who HAD replaced confirmed Lieu.  Neal quickly hustled over to DEA to build a private Barr Army (that you noticed last June, photographed, and asked about.

1316603846609833984 2020-10-15 12:56:33 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @stevensantos I love the seamless way the ride out to the wedding, with all the smoke stops, tolls through the film so seamlessly.    It reminds me of Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales."

1316602471758864385 2020-10-15 12:51:05 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @stevensantos Finally watching tonight.  It has this shaggy, rambling, puckish, but ice cold quality, and for me, the watchful eyes of the little girl, and Kennedy, Watergate, resonate.   I grew up in Boston when Whitey Bulger's shadow was everywhere and I was always watching, just like her!

1316499949933277185 2020-10-15 06:03:42 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Barr The Multitasker:  * Dispatching henchman to aggressively prosecute McCabe (for DOING his job)  * LESS aggressive with Flynn (who ADMITTED to breaking the law)  * Getting DOJ Counsel to loosen up DEA authority  *  Off he goes!  Shea to DEA to build a private army for... BARR!

She is preening and deferential to the Big Men, and by turns snippy, then shrinking into herself when fairly challenged by Sens. Klobuchar and Harris.

1316123032625217537 2020-10-14 05:05:58 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @ChipnNolna @MarkJacob16 Trump once commented "that's the way of the world."    In other words, if you are too poor to go to a doctor, you are one of the "Diers."

In sincerity, I think that ingrained Calvinist streak suggests that if you were "worthy," like them, God would have granted you the prosperity not to be so disgustingly poor.

This is the mentality that keeps people from making it to the hospital before they suffocate in their own lung fluids.
1316119835911368706 2020-10-14 04:53:15 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @ElieNYC There was a German tourist in Times Square, who made the apt comment that the United States was "glittering and barbaric."    A prince travels to Johns Hopkins for high-tech surgery, while a homeless old man in Baltimore dies of sepsis from a mouthful of rotted teeth.

1315366836775653378 2020-10-12 03:01:06 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @Politidope Wow.  The word "Orwellian" is used to the point of blanching it of meaning, but:  *  Trump forbids "real" Dr. Fauci from speaking on the air on Sundays.  then,  *  Trump creates "imago" of Dr. Fauci with a misleading verbal message.  Run during NFL game.  Sinister and chilling.

1314987690778152962 2020-10-11 01:54:31 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @ClaireBerlinski There are many threads to consider, but there is a huge national trauma to attend to, at level of "body politic" in general, and the ravaging of the federal government at the administrative level.  As  former fed employee, focusing more on latter here.   2.
1314987435420516354 2020-10-11 01:53:30 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @ClaireBerlinski I found your observations simply magnificent Ms. B.  Have been doing a lot of thought on this as well over the last year.. or more.  1.

1314980686294548482 2020-10-11 01:26:41 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @JakeSherman Ack!   Now I am all a-Twitter!
1314977679041593344 2020-10-11 01:14:44 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @maddenifico For those of us who live in the Washington DC region (including MD and Northern Virginia) the White House is a real and present health threat.
1314977395238219782 2020-10-11 01:13:36 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @maddenifico Will the First Lady appear in the window as a wraithlike form in a white nightgown from time to time to scare, or maybe be caught staring out from the giant White House sinkhole that erupts again, in time for the Super Spreader Event.
1314976351359766528 2020-10-11 01:09:27 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> UGH.
1314976026330619905 2020-10-11 01:08:10 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @ArrowofArtemis   This is too funny.  I am not always a Radio Free Tom fan (he can be scoldy and stereotypes "teenage girls") but this was great.   https://t.co/YFWP0TfC6f

1314975290192429063 2020-10-11 01:05:14 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Radio Free Tom has been hittin' it out of the ballpark lately.
1314971874372321282 2020-10-11 00:51:40 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @OlphertJustin @CNN I think I am being honest.  There is a LACK of good curation here in this Twitter land!

1314968809808236545 2020-10-11 00:39:29 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @OlphertJustin @CNN Annotation is cool.   It is also a type of "curation."
1314967712234430465 2020-10-11 00:35:08 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @JGaffneyUSN @howardfineman @JoeBiden @GovWhitmer @Trump SO off base.  This was first African American ("AA") woman debating in Presidential election. This woman is also only the SECOND AA woman to serve in the Senate.  An enormously resonant event for millions of AA women... and their daughters.    Again, I never assume "satire."
1314966921561993218 2020-10-11 00:31:59 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @JGaffneyUSN @howardfineman @JoeBiden @GovWhitmer @Trump It is hard to always know nowadays, so I presume no "of course."  For a tweet can't stand on its own as satire, I use a "/s."     A sharp person who I read regularly (who happened to be a white male) asserted that the Harris-Pence debate would soon be "forgotten."  (cont.) 1/2
1314965844368257024 2020-10-11 00:27:42 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @OlphertJustin @CNN Mr. Olphert, is that your artwork?  Just curious.
1314964198296899593 2020-10-11 00:21:10 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @OlphertJustin @CNN Now, I firmly believe he has been a spreader to who knows how many people, and may very well be a viral shedder still, and is inviting people to his infested lair of a White House today, mask-free, to "commune" with him.     2.
1314963716400721922 2020-10-11 00:19:15 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @OlphertJustin @CNN Amazing work.  There is a little bit of a Steven King body horror vibe about this.  Trump started as a sort of "spiritual" infection from 2015 on, with several people, faced with videos of their behavior at a Trump rally, all commented with variation of "that's not me."  1.

1314962043347382276 2020-10-11 00:12:36 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @JGaffneyUSN @howardfineman @JoeBiden @GovWhitmer @Trump There is also a tinge of misogyny to it.  Women with a degree are not a monolith or a fungible product like pork belllies or orange juice.  This human being is a state governor.
1314961590337273857 2020-10-11 00:10:48 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @JGaffneyUSN @howardfineman @JoeBiden @GovWhitmer @Trump Ugh.  What a sour comment.
1314961427367632898 2020-10-11 00:10:09 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @MatthewStiegler @MaxKennerly I don't understand the context of this, Mr. Stiegler.  Is it addressed to lawyers?  I just thought of the swarms of lawyers and law students that rushed to airports in early 2017 when the first Muslim ban order came out.  I thought that group was terrific.
1314960535620902913 2020-10-11 00:06:37 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @riotwomennn Uh oh.
1314960070350966784 2020-10-11 00:04:46 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @XavierOnassis1 @BenjaminPDixon This also does not negate the one indicator no one can mess with, the increase in annual deaths this year.  There is no way to reconcile that "bulge."  The Trumpists, unfortunately, can rage about the Covid "cause of death" numbers.  It is ridiculous and so badly motivated.
1314959045023928320 2020-10-11 00:00:41 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @susanl_author It was still great.  The same wonderful characters, just a bit too many threads that went nowhere featuring guest players.
1314958434245267456 2020-10-10 23:58:16 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @BenjaminPDixon Boris Johnson as well.   How many people were sent home with Tylenol, only to return to the hospital too late (or die horribly in their bedroom) while aggressive regimes were started at SAME infection point for "VIPs."
1314957332464504832 2020-10-10 23:53:53 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @susanl_author IMHO, it tried to stuff six weeks of material into three. My inner editor went into overdrive watching the finale, slashing away like a fiend.                                    2/2
1314957189963022337 2020-10-10 23:53:19 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @susanl_author Hee hee.   May have been in the mood for a classic ghost story.  Aside.  I have noticed lately that so many series are terribly overstuffed.  I always watch the Morse prequel "Endeavor," and this last series was a letdown. 1/2
1314956184978423810 2020-10-10 23:49:19 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> What a magnificent performance by Ms. Gordon.
1314955505085952000 2020-10-10 23:46:37 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @BCDreyer    Just one thing.  #HauntingOfBlyManor is magnificent and sad.  Great springboard from "Turn of the Screw."    I am a cranky, picky 62 year old with a wizened old nut of a heart (with soft truffle core) and it made me tear up.  Cheers!

1314954108659478531 2020-10-10 23:41:04 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Editor shifts in "its" (not sure of its gender) seat, spills its popcorn and yells at me.  "Too many secondary characters!  Pah!"  "Terrible temporal shift!  All these people look alike!"  "Ack  I don't want a lecture.  That dialog could have been make into 4 scenes.  Pfffft!"  2
1314953499814363136 2020-10-10 23:38:39 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @susanl_author Hi!   I am glad you saw these tweets, Susan!    About 80% of the time, my Merciless Inner Editor (who is hardest on me) starts a Netflix series and quickly hijacks attention of Moe Who Wants to Watch a Corking Great Show!  1.
1314952594884878336 2020-10-10 23:35:03 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> No spoilers, but I love subtle way narrative deals with what might be called "the persistence of love," in ways sad, sweet, and horrific.  Lips sealed!  I know you are in industry, if you know anyone connected with this series, please send my highest regards.  Bravo!
1314951280591286273 2020-10-10 23:29:50 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Sometimes leave Netflix series in background while I do some paperwork, etc.  This deserves a slow, concentrated viewing, followed by some thought.  Hopefully, an essay!  So far, I love its perfect "tone," the deft use of a portmanteau format, the acting.  Love it all.   2.
1314950568415236103 2020-10-10 23:27:00 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @stevensantos On a totally non-Trump track, I watched a bit of #HauntingOfBlyManor and am simply dazzled.    Rare example of finding work that reminds me of my benchmark, Graham Greene's novel "The End of the Affair."  1.

At this point (even with USA Today having worked out 75% or more of guests via Google) it has been two weeks.  Spread from infected (over nation) is likely too far gone to track now.

1314355096621322240 2020-10-09 08:00:49 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @SusanPage @debates The bleeding edge of this is Dehumanizing.  Donald Trump called Senator Harris not even just "Kamala" or "Nasty Woman" or even a devolved slur of other benIgn species, but MONSTER.
1314354453454229504 2020-10-09 07:58:15 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> No man I asked even picked up on this.  Only 1 in 4 women did.  I am sensitive as I have made a study about Naming/Credentialing, and the annihilative effret of Un-Naming/Invisibilizing Credentials .

1314297513726353422 2020-10-09 04:12:00 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @RabbiJill @TheRaDR In contrast Sen. Harris, in a tough situation, deftly fought the disrespect, even taking on dual debater/moderator roles to minimize and neutralize Pence.
1314296986259140609 2020-10-09 04:09:54 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @jillharth   Thanks.  Susan Page is a total "Aunt Julia."  Have you seen Handmaid's Tale?
1314296529625194503 2020-10-09 04:08:05 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @debates @CDC  Your decisions endangered Senator Harris.  It was foreseeable that one of Trump camp would unmask, as Karen Pence did ONSTAGE, after being exposed to Covid at Rose Garden 10 days ago and defying quarantine recs.
1314295697403977735 2020-10-09 04:04:47 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @SusanPage @debates I noticed that you generally referred to a sitting U.S. Senator as "Kamala."  You referred to her debate opponent as "Mr. Vice President."  Very jarring.
1314294314198093826 2020-10-09 03:59:17 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @RabbiJill @jacobkornbluh Horrible.
1314293899628810240 2020-10-09 03:57:38 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @DylanReeve And you can bet that if Senator Harris had displayed 1000th of the rudeness of a Pence or Trump, Susan Page would have gone "full Aunt Lydia."   https://t.co/8xFPqxOyJA

1314292694173319168 2020-10-09 03:52:51 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @RabbiJill @TheRaDR @soledadobrien Susan Page bio choice? Barbara Bush.  Classic "acceptable" Lady.
1314292395299745792 2020-10-09 03:51:40 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @RabbiJill @TheRaDR Suggest Page exercises passive aggressive power which "serves" and reinforces The Patriarchy for "crumbs."   Her reward? She was moderator! And an awesome woman like @soledadobrien is "An Absence"...like so many other strong and gifted women.
1314291235469897730 2020-10-09 03:47:03 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @RabbiJill @TheRaDR My issue with Susan Page is her apparent willing collaboration with the disrespect, and her double standard in her "to the letter" standard for "Kamala," a woman of color, and "whispery" deference to "Mr. Vice President."

1314289471525969922 2020-10-09 03:40:02 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @eliserkress @JoyceWhiteVance Sen. Harris did not "allow" it.  She handled it by smoothly playing dual role of debater AND moderator in a terrible situation   She would gave been harshly judged for slightest loss Of emotional control.
1314288718228881409 2020-10-09 03:37:03 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @eliserkress @JoyceWhiteVance Her address is "Senator Harris."  Susan Page also called Sen. Harris "Kamala."  But called Pence "Mr. Vice President."
1314288117596270597 2020-10-09 03:34:40 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> THIS again.  The denial of title.    And Pence called the moderator "Susan."  "Senator Harris"  @TheRaDR  @RabbiJill

1314285909433561088 2020-10-09 03:25:53 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @xmastr @JoyceWhiteVance @VP And NOW debate commission agrees to virtual format.  They did NOT protect Sen. Harris.
1314285583880028165 2020-10-09 03:24:36 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @JoyceWhiteVance I think she was an "acceptable" choice for Trumpists as an "Aunt Lydia" enforcer of male Patriarchy and oppression.  Same as latest choice for the Supreme Court.    She ALLOWED this treatment, did NOT avail herself of power as Moderator    https://t.co/N11tZHLoYd
1314282906861305857 2020-10-09 03:13:57 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @EmilianoLincoln @RadioFreeTom Thanks, it was long ago.  What was more disturbing than menacing action was being penalized for self-defense.   Law firm wanted to avoid lawsuit by minimizing this guy's risk level.  Shameful behavior by HR Administrator.  Susan Page reminds me of her, an "Aunt Lydia" type.
1314281820750598144 2020-10-09 03:09:38 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @lcbradlow   Hey fellow theatre junkie.
1314275627084775425 2020-10-09 02:45:02 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @RadioFreeTom 2/2  What bothered me most was that I was physically afraid.  This man was purple faced with veins standing out, and NO ONE came out to my aid in spite of him screaming and ranting.  It was assumed it was a mutual "tiff" and I was (initially) assumed wrong for "yelling."
1314274184948834305 2020-10-09 02:39:18 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @seminefrius @RadioFreeTom I am sure this TACTIC was covered in debate coaching.  The coaches are very well aware of gendered communication and I also expect Page was chosen in part for her compliant mien
1314273751807258624 2020-10-09 02:37:35 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @RadioFreeTom Story of my work life of 45 years. Gendered ground rules are set, and fighting them brings "situations", most glaring of which was:  * Being put on PROBATION for "fighting" with "a lawyer," i.e., firmly telling him to step back when he was about to lunge over my cubicle wall.

Pence:  Interupts:  "Susan,  Susan...."  Moderator shuts up.  Lets him talk.  Harris:  Asks for time to respond.  Page responds that she will "GIVE HER" 30 seconds.

Ifsomething horrific happens, I don't want to have witnessed it.  STRAIGHT UP, organizers and campaigns are endangering Senator Harris.

In this case, mutual masks and condom is probably SAFER than an unprotected kiss and hug!

1313865815066923008 2020-10-07 23:36:35 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @atrupar Same reason I am worried about Senator Harris tonight.  Given the CDC made a statement about Pence's "contacts" that contradicted the evidence of our own eyes from videos, we all see a man who should be in isolation appearing on an indoor stage with little separation from her.

1313835454173769730 2020-10-07 21:35:56 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> It is objectively UNSAFE to sit for hours in an indoor environment across from a man who is VIOLATING quarantine standards.  I quarantined after only POTENTIAL COVID exposure. The CDC OK'ing Pence to be out is clear example of a discredited agency bowing to pressure.

1313535563920822272 2020-10-07 01:44:17 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> This is abuse and exploitation of workers.    ACTION Needed:  *  Shut down and lock White House for 40 days.  DEEP sanitizing.  Also pest control.  *  Evacuate, quarantine at safe space, contact trace and DAILY test for all working/visiting WH for last NINE months. Trumps to WRH.  https://t.co/MoEGmvZuBJ

1312896048055148545 2020-10-05 07:23:04 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @BraddJaffy The apparent inability of American citizens to distinguish between Armenia üá¶üá≤  and Azerbaijan üá¶üáø  is another touchy subject.

1312806444706791431 2020-10-05 01:27:01 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @stevensantos Trump is now furious at his Chief of Staff for providing contradictory (i.e., accurate) news about his health, that contradicted reports from Dr. Happy-Face McCheery.    He is likely to follow former around as spectral shade that makes sniffing sounds and howls.

1312799265153003523 2020-10-05 00:58:30 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @stevensantos Yes, Steve.  I had pneumonia ten years ago and needed oxygen badly but not to vent level.  I was there 5 days and took months to fully recover  103 fever and mega drug cocktails?  He has been sick for a WHILE and I doubt he goes home tomorrow.  He could go downhill fast at home

1312750282263138309 2020-10-04 21:43:51 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @Sandwichman_eh @nycsouthpaw I wonder.  She kept her illness very quiet.  Said she was sick "over the summer."   Summer ended 9/21.  I understand jury is out on how long a COVID patient might shed virus, even if undetectable by a post-symptom COVID test.
1312749277463142400 2020-10-04 21:39:52 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @MarkJacob16 Yes.  Anyone could.  I wish there was one of those cell phone charts watching the anonymous "blinking light" to show these people disburse after this event.  Not to mention, Senators are always jetting about.

IDEALLY, no one comes near infected without PPE.  If person can live separately, ideal.  That is why it is such a cruel form if death.   Quarantine is "potentially" infected.

Glass barrier, iPad,    Goal:  Isolate confirmed infected from ALL.  Someone who goes in for essential healthcare purpose should have on full PPE.  Applies to First Lady as well.
1312070960703471621 2020-10-03 00:44:28 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @flywithkamala @DouglasEmhoff   Please.  Set up fail safe barrier, no cross-cutting Secret Service, pool reporters from AF One!  And WHY can't the Senate go virtual?  Too many maskless meat heads up there!  Thank you.

1312032511728521216 2020-10-02 22:11:41 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @ChrisJansing Have tweeted already, but I knew ONLY that I was in contact with someone who "might" be positive and  was told to stay inside and AWAY from people until I got (whew) the  "all clear."  KNOWING person you were near WAS positive &amp; heading out to fundraiser?   I .. just..can't
1312031291660001280 2020-10-02 22:06:50 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @CBSNewYork Given the chance virus can cross-infect, I would suspect you are not even supposed to isolate with another infected family member.
1312030552095166467 2020-10-02 22:03:54 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @CBSNewYork The intent of ISOLATION is to SEPARATE the infected from EVERYONE ELSE who is NOT infected.  That is why it is such a horrible way to die.    During separation, one is ALONE (including from your own family members). No sharing of food, towels, etc.  Ideally ALONE in one room
1312029899994136576 2020-10-02 22:01:19 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @CBSNewYork PLEASE use correct terms.  Your piece this a.m. repeats wording from Trump tweet which is inaccurate.  Quarantine is for any "potentially" exposed.    Trump and the First Lady have tested POSITIVE for the virus and thus must go into ISOLATION. 1/2

1312021528238850049 2020-10-02 21:28:03 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Let the "packaging" begin.    If "minor symptoms" and "lethargic" adjective are being used by Access Maggie, I would grab yer garters.  I suspected something was going on when the word "convalescence" was bandied about in the early hours.
1312020804939415553 2020-10-02 21:25:10 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @WhalenBeth @BuzzPatterson @JoeBiden Trump KNEW, definitively, that he HAD been exposed to the virus (and it turns out, he WAS infected).  I doubt crowd had masks on (or Trump).     Behavior of a nihilistic, malignant narcissist.

You stay home, avoid people.  14 days   If you test positive, you ISOLATE, ideally in room no one else comes in.  Are brought food, no shared dishes towels.  For at least 10 days.  1/2

1311982489775243266 2020-10-02 18:52:55 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @SkyNews The Dem. rep is frustratingly mild.  Perhaps he has been ordered to "take the high road" and let the U.S. Repubs hang themselves, but this woman's shameless piffle and nonsense should be called out, IN REAL TIME!
1311981889469771776 2020-10-02 18:50:32 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @DrEricDing   Dr. Ding, have you seen this from Sky News in UK?  UNBELIEVABLE irresponsibility from the Repub. flack, who is, literally, STILL "both sidesing" mask wearing, implying it is a "choice" on which "good people" can differ.  NO IT IS NOT.     https://t.co/iKgfLRyGgj
1311980812062126083 2020-10-02 18:46:15 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @SkyNews The U.S. Republican rep is treading water.   Her bizarro comment about "moving beyond" the mask issue (implying "good people" on both sides of issue) LITERALLY contradicts established scientific findings.  NOT wearing a mask, and mocking those who do:  BAD!

THANK YOU for this as far as I can see, not one else has focused on this yet.  Flabbergasted about Bedminster fundraising event AFTER Trump knew Hope Hicks had test POSITIVE.
1311966145487011840 2020-10-02 17:47:58 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @DrEricDing Assuming someone was strong enough to be asymptomatic, how far BACK is it realistic to go.  I am skeptical  that her positive test AND symtoms are reported as appearing on the SAME DAY.
1311965702727884803 2020-10-02 17:46:13 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @weijia @CBSNews Again, that window of several days before BOTH positive test and symptoms is when infectiouness is at its PEAK!  Intensive contact tracing for Hope Hicks backwards to September 15th, or earlier, if she had been a 'carrier' (and contacts thru next 2nd, 3rd, 4th "ring" out) vital.

I am very sympathetic to but concerned about the safety of the Secret Service.  I hope Biden and Trump teams set up "firewalls" as Trumpers are irresponsible and defiant about viral transmission.
1311963239161438209 2020-10-02 17:36:25 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @CaslerNoel In vicious bit of irony, precautionary tonics Trump might take, but still "positive" test later, could have resulted in MASSIVE viral load he could bear without symptoms, creating "Cadillac" vehicle for a very "happy" virus, jumping to new "HOST" lung, brain, and neural matter.
1311961400789606400 2020-10-02 17:29:07 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump Hi Noel C., are there photos from fundraiser in Bedminster?  I heard Trump was NOT masked?  This could be the seeding ground for an outbreak, emanating from Bedminster.  If he was asymptomatic last night, tested positive few hours later, he would have had a BIGLY viral load.

1311957601312276480 2020-10-02 17:14:01 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @AbraarKaran @lufthansa Given the rapid tests at the Tuesday U.S. Presidential debate, and Trump/First Lady (day earlier Hope Hicks) POSITIVE TEST a day or so later, plus all the untested people behind the 1st Class curtain in "steerage" likely no more effective than wearing a St. Anthony medal,
1311956782013702144 2020-10-02 17:10:46 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @RayRedacted @JenniferJJacobs @JJohnsonLaw Is it even POSSIBLE to quarantine a person who has just BEGUN showing symtoms (HIGH viral load) inside metal tube flying through the sky?  So ironic, I have to find my tweet, but his plane home to his golden toilet, and his aide, "Hopie" have turned against him.

Here is a thread (my comments below) on my cocktail in honor of U.S. Senator (VP Candidate) Kamala Harris.  It is called a "Puckish Toddy" and features extra sour cherry juice one might have lying about.   https://t.co/G8sYVw20p9

We can double and triple task!!  (One concession I made was rescheduling "Penelope Fitzgerald Reading Week" that WOULD have started today... simply too much right now)
1311783154701815821 2020-10-02 05:40:50 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @lonesomereader Everyone needs to know more about Djuna Barnes.  I rescheduled my Penelope Fitzgerald Reading Week to April 2021,  perhaps a "Djuna Barnes Debauch" in Fall 2021, dovetailed into the #NationalPoetryDay events.  Prescient as always, Anais Nin was big support of Barnes!

1311369210250096653 2020-10-01 02:15:58 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @tarheelmark I would warn everyone what behavioral standards were at beginning.  Interruptions, personal attacks, etc. are abusive behavior.  ONE warning, then ejection.  Remainder of time to opponent.
1311368326854123524 2020-10-01 02:12:27 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @TobySez @kaitlancollins I would give them each 2 minutes, then warning light, 5 second cut-off.  During "hot" mic, "abusive" behavior (as adjudged by Commission) of moderator/oponent will get ONE warning.  Repeat of behavior resulting in expulsion.  Any time left can be used by opponent as they see fit.

1311367358485856265 2020-10-01 02:08:36 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @kaitlancollins @BCDreyer b.) Personal abuse (as adjudged by Commission) of assigned moderator or opponent will not be tolerated.  One warning will be given.  Continued defiance will result in expulsion of offending candidate. Remaining time will be apportioned to opponent to use as he sees fit."
1311366304352407556 2020-10-01 02:04:25 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @kaitlancollins @BCDreyer My take:  "Last night's debate was a travesty.  Here are the rules going forward.    a.) Each candidate will have two minutes at a "hot mic."  A warning light will indicate when to wrap up.  After a five second grace period, mic will be cut off.  (cont.)
1311365574044385285 2020-10-01 02:01:31 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @kaitlancollins @BCDreyer My Suggestion:     *  Commission should sent out message today basically telling everybody to "stay tuned."  *  Knock out a solution this afternoon.   2/3

He admired "Miss Hillary" for her sturdy ankles.  I will find one of his tweets.

He would travel to Lafeyette Park (pre Trump) to play outdoor chess with other older Russian dudes. Beeman occasionally joined them.

1309842681024176129 2020-09-26 21:10:05 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @graple12 @dinhi45 @realDonaldTrump No.   This is picture from the mid-90's.  Look in top row to left....Kavanaugh to right of Whitewater SC is about 30.  Man 1st from right in blue shirt is heavier set and older (Kilminik born in 1970 would have been around 25 at time, and living in RUSSIA).
1309841283201064960 2020-09-26 21:04:32 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @janeworld1 @sandibachom I believe so.  The reference to "handmaids" set out in cite below.   https://t.co/nqYH8JR3Ba

But was fixed!   She worked, watched concerts, was about to officiate WEDDING.  Then she takes a "sudden downhill turn" and passes within DAYS?  The "motive" is GARGANTUAN!

1309694842260389889 2020-09-26 11:22:38 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @dinhi45 @realDonaldTrump Right.  What I am saying is Kilminik did not work on Whitewater.  He was still in Russia then.  In that pik, I recognize Azar, Rosenstein, Starr, and Kavanaugh.    There ARE some photos og him around with Manafort and other Reoublican operatives.

1309506546200645632 2020-09-25 22:54:24 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @BCDreyer Arrived Feb. 1992, in midst of IRA subway-bombing scare. Must have tripped off some sort of "watch list" with my cash ticket from Boston and clean passport. My "stated purpose" of Boswell-following was met with a bit of skepticism and I was ill-at-ease whole time.
1309505497356218368 2020-09-25 22:50:14 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @BCDreyer I agree.  Part and parcel of the damp and fog.  Would love to return to London to resume my interrupted ramble through the streets that Boswell trod as he questioned and "formed" his wonderful biography of the Great One, Samuel Johnson.  1.
1309503967311917058 2020-09-25 22:44:09 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @me4usa SEE Elena Baronoff, Kremlin asset and "right hand" of Trump real estate business. Another middle age or older person who died of a "fast-acting leukemia."  Leukemia can proceed at various speeds, but is MUCH more likely to be "fast-acting" in the very YOUNG (immune system).
1309501222144086022 2020-09-25 22:33:15 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @MingGao26 YIKES!!!   Simply brainstorming at the moment, but Trump's real estate agent in Turkey/Russian asset, Baronoff, died in 2104 of a "fast-moving leukemia.   She was well into MIDDLE AGE.  *  Fast-moving leukemia MUCH more common in young people/teens.   https://t.co/PObpqFhb9P

1309495127665246208 2020-09-25 22:09:02 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @MarkJacob16 Not to mention the careful framing, consistent throughout the Trumpite masses, of being willing to accept a "court" decision.  This is an ELECTION.  With ballots.
1309494776702603265 2020-09-25 22:07:38 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @MarkJacob16 But he has clearly been coached the whole time.  I think Bannon is likely behind Trump making a reference to  "continuation" of power, rather than a "transfer."  He couldn't make that verbal distinction on his own.

1308891696424460289 2020-09-24 06:11:13 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Similarly, Trump had to bring a classification review to DOJ "not signed" by the original classifier, after hours of pressure.  Unless they forge your name or hold your puppy hostage!  I was at GAO &amp; occasionally there would be a supervisory auditor who did same thing. It speaks!
1308891075155763201 2020-09-24 06:08:44 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Mr. Strzok observed in follow-up pleading that whatever pressure was applied to the OPR exec. who "retired suddenly" she would NOT make the firing decision.  I still believe Wray was canny enough to download that to his Deputy.  But Bowdich's signature is on that for good.

1308809085144502276 2020-09-24 00:42:57 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @kgoss1128 Indeed.  My grandfather actively partipated in anti-Crown activity in Cork, Ireland in 1910s.  The "Royal Constabulary" were the LEO equivalent.  He and several of his brothers had to emigrate, and his best friend was beaten to death.  Price of opposition can be high.
1308808086681989121 2020-09-24 00:38:59 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @kgoss1128 And even at time of American Revolution, there were Loyalists who did recognize and "subject" themselves to "The Crown."  Many ended up in Canada.  An abject Trump coup COULD break country apart.
1308806956946251778 2020-09-24 00:34:29 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @kgoss1128 Yes...to be precise.  The signers of the Declaration of Independence were "out [British] laws."    Same as in Ireland in 1921, who DECLARED themselves a Republic with own interim courts.    Revolution.

Thus relates to professionals and artists to focus ( doctors, lawyers, journalists, artists, etc.)  Based on my observation.  *   Europeans have a "net"  of healthcare, as a human right.

Bannon vowed to destroy the "administrative state," a perversion of normal government operations.    Now, Barr directly attacks the rule of law at DOJ by a brute force  suppressive strike  on prosecutors.

But that is a debate for another time.

My own "Tracy Flick" moment came when I brought camera crew to stoner cafeteria in '75 running for HS govt, to "reach out". What a pompous twit I was.  THAT is a "grubby striver" moment!

I got quarantined due to "possible" exposure Are there people who justified that they were "OK" who ventured, highly infectious and asymptomatic  into crowds?
1307092577582284800 2020-09-19 07:02:09 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> I wonder how many "last blow-outs" on MARCH 14th seeded how many outbreaks?  How many "I'm just tired out"  older bar owners from March 18 after five busy nights, how many contacts with relatives?  I don't want to ever go into a bar that weekend in March again.

In response to this, some artists began writing in pidgin, which had practical application as communication among multi-lingual work gangs on Hawaiian plantations, Bra!
1306846382234513408 2020-09-18 14:43:52 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @evegord There is a broader angle to this, in that the canonization of "proper" English and its colonial imposition in Ireland, Scotland, and among indigenous peoples of the U.S. is a dark shadow hanging over all this.  1/2

Currently adding "Legal Project Manager" cert. to my toolbox. Also fascinated with message effectiveness, "Law and Language"/ Legal ESL.    I can be salty here, but love effective work groups!
1304480406855651329 2020-09-12 02:02:19 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Key is Trump bald declaration on Election NIGHT!!!!!    Vote may not be fully counted then, given Admin. generated USPS chaos, in midst of pandemic.
1304479953086558210 2020-09-12 02:00:31 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @waltshaub   Right this moment, swarms of Putin TrollBots are amplifying Trump statement.  Stay tuned for support from the Usual Suspects.  A-List Sockpuppets such as:    * Kevin McCarthy * Nikki Haley  (Plus wagon-circling by Johnson, Graham, Nunes,Jordan, Gaetz etc al)
1304478788047298566 2020-09-12 01:55:53 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @NoWooWooHere Point is he will not ACCEPT loss....simply outright DECLARE himself winner.    SEE:  Tactic of Barr memo.
1304478407493931010 2020-09-12 01:54:23 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @waltshaub   Reminds of BARR preempting Mueller report with Memo six weeks BEFORE report release.  *  Trump creates chaos and delays re mail-in ballots.   * While vote NOT yet fully counted, Trump DECLARES himself winner, Election Night.  *  Brutal put-down of citizen protest.

1304427269058953223 2020-09-11 22:31:10 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> CRUDE ref. to attack on dignified woman caught in a private moment.  QUERY:  How would YOU like it if someone videotaped and made public, an image of a chic matriarch in YOUR family in her robe, hair undone, without her regular makeup routine?  And called her by her last name?

1304144868449628160 2020-09-11 03:49:01 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @agentcurieuse I see a streak of unjust, bureaucratic, shaming cruelty against dedicated employees  that spans agencies and comes right from the top: Exs.:   * Sally Yates:  Trump calls "disgrace" to DOJ.  * NSA:   LTC Vindman's competence is brutally attacked in derogatory evaluation report.  https://t.co/JhYb8nzlPY
1304126640746885120 2020-09-11 02:36:35 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @agentcurieuse Thought of pronounced shallowness of Trump, in which he evaluates "players" in his regime according to how closely they conform to "central casting" standards, which, natch, have a baseline of "white" and "male" then move add more traits.   Right down to the "Senatorial hair"!
1304126031343874048 2020-09-11 02:34:10 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> Hmmm.   @agentcurieuse

Furthermore, at what point does your "brand" of "apolitical nature" become a perfume with which to mask the stench of the most politicized and corrupted Department of Justice in our history?

1304090014763155456 2020-09-11 00:11:02 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @agentcurieuse Hello. Noticed FBI DEPUTY Dir. Bowdich front and center with Barr in Chicago on latest announcement of crime-fighting.  NOT FBI Director Wray.    Meanwhile, under Barr, E. Jean's case has now been renamed "Carroll v. United States," changed from "Carroll v. Trump."
1304089009614979073 2020-09-11 00:07:03 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @agentcurieuse Dr. Sockpuppet is indeed a good little sockpuppet.  She will join Tulsi Gabbard, Nikki Haley, &amp; Kevin McCarty as part of tweeters PutinBots amplify, then send out to cycle thru Kremlin news, Sputnik, RT, OAN, Fox, then on to mainstream cable to Trumpists.  Rinse and repeat.

A water-diluted cream soup would accompany white bread with deviled ham.  2/2
1304087396670230528 2020-09-11 00:00:38 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @BCDreyer Not to mention condensed cream of celery, mushroom, and shrimp.

That is a place I had worked near, had wedding pictures taken in, then protested in (in 2018 and 2019....without fear at that time).  June 1 was a turning point.  https://t.co/ci4yLApofo

1303886634455314432 2020-09-10 10:42:53 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @CafeMuscato BTW, great to "meet" you.  Are you by chance a fan of UK women novelists, particularly Penelope Fitzgerald?  I am putting together an informal "Reading Week" on her here on Twitter from Sun. 10/4 through Sat. 10/10.   Hashtag:  #ReadingPenelopeFitz   You are Most Welcome!
1303885341737259009 2020-09-10 10:37:45 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @CafeMuscato Yes.  That is another amazing story.  I wish the film "Julia and Julia" had left out the later Julia and focused for two hours on Julia Child.

1303884098491092996 2020-09-10 10:32:48 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @CafeMuscato It's a little "niche-y."  Are you a fan of food writing, cookbooks, etc.?  I love Penguin and Oxford publishers generally.  Amazing that the book took 15 more years than was set out, but everyone hung in there.
1303883703719002113 2020-09-10 10:31:14 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @CafeMuscato Wow!  Thanks for all the faves.  I had a blast putting that together.  It was inspired by some of the tweets of U.S. author @Gabino_Iglesias on the "process" stuff, beyond the text, book covers, editing, etc.

1303536007934029824 2020-09-09 11:29:37 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @sfpelosi   I enjoyed hearing you in 2018 at #KremlinAnnex and think Romney (and his wife, shame on her) are absolute putzes.  If anyone did that to MY Mom, I shudder to think what I might do.  Crass people all round   I know she is tough as nails though, and an icon of chic!
1303532016730808321 2020-09-09 11:13:45 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @MittRomney @AnnRomney Then to snark and take away her earned honorific and call this House leader, this lady, wife, mother, grandmother, by the blunt "Pelosi."  How crass.  How cheap.
1303531258509746176 2020-09-09 11:10:45 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @MittRomney @AnnRomney "of faith"  "Mormon"  Your giddiness makes sport of a horrid violation of a woman's private boundaries, a virtual "stripping" of her toilette, her makeup, her "crowning glory."  A mature and dignified lady no less.    Can you not see how thuggish this is.  It demeans you both.
1303529929414451200 2020-09-09 11:05:28 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @MittRomney @AnnRomney In all sincerity you hold yourself out as Mormons if faith.  I have known several lovely Mormin couples here in DC.  It pains me that another woman here would (presumably) collaborate in cavalier act like this. 1
1303527880006213632 2020-09-09 10:57:19 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @john_sipher @MittRomney @AnnRomney Below is why I have no truck with Romney's disrespect...and I don't care about his Senate trial vote.  Women have a keen awareness of how hard we have to fight for our earned titles not to be dismissed. Sometimes our surnames as well.  https://t.co/c5sRXxPykm
1303526364184801280 2020-09-09 10:51:18 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @Politidope @KamalaHarris It is not lost on me that for Trump, Putin is always "President Putin."    I can't recall any time Trump has ever referred to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi by her name and title.
1303525695646322688 2020-09-09 10:48:38 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @Politidope @KamalaHarris Refusing a target their title or their true name is a form of psychic annihilation.  It is dead serious.   https://t.co/yOuPkL8oCe

1303467977774374912 2020-09-09 06:59:17 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @MaxCairnduff That would be teriff!  Academic milieu, pastiche, comic.  Nice balance to some others books more widely red.  Yes!  Maybe Day 4 (Wed.) we could have as a "focus" day.  First though, could you publish your thoughts on it that day with the hashtag? 1.
1303466066098753539 2020-09-09 06:51:42 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @MarkJacob16 Maybe this is fortuitous event,  a devious way of driving out career prisecutirs.  Just like using personal texts as excuse for firing legendary Russian-focused counterintell agent Peter Strzok?

That is a key "tell" you are dealing with a Grade A Russian troll, not a bot.  "Elderberry Girl" probably burps taco gas, has a hairy back, and is lazy &amp;  painfully bad at playing whatever an "Elderberry Girl" is.

1302759345894158341 2020-09-07 08:03:26 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @NatashaBertrand @petestrzok I am not intending to be cavalier at all above.  Mr. Strzok, thank you so much for your service to the country, and I am so sorry for what you have been put through.  But I am just driven to share my views.  Best regards to you both.
1302759078582792192 2020-09-07 08:02:23 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @NatashaBertrand @petestrzok Dep. Dir. Bowdich was equally  contradictory in the draconian, Rube Goldbergesque style HR process he was involved in.  Simultaneously, someone is NOT biased, but his PERSONAL TEXTS are still shaking the foundations of the FBI (ex., HRC email investigation)?  Patent nonsense.
1302757802797142016 2020-09-07 07:57:18 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @NatashaBertrand @petestrzok I was appalled at self-contradictory screeds by Cadelago on his topic du jour, Senator Kamala Harris.  I assume he figured no one would read to the end and there would be some claim about her "missing votes" in clickbait and lede, with exculpatory stuff stuck in the back! 2nd
1302757009159225346 2020-09-07 07:54:09 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @NatashaBertrand @petestrzok As background, during late 80's and through 90's, when working audits at GAO, I would read both "Politico" and "The Hill" each week cover to cover.  Have been gone now for 2 decades but with some of what was going on I went back to read them again and was simply horrified.  1st

1302755957601169408 2020-09-07 07:49:58 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @NatashaBertrand @petestrzok Ms. Bertrand, I waspuzzled as to why you would go to work at "Politico," which Dr. Fiona Hill actively scorned (under oath) as a purveyor of disinfo (on request) for the Trumpists (she categorized The Hill this way as well.) But given your amazing work, I must take it back! 1st
1302755107424141312 2020-09-07 07:46:36 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> The security clearance process is totally perverted in the Trumpist regime.  The power to grant or to take away access to classified material is a "prize" to be granted to Trumpist "friends" and taken from "enemies."  Facts suggesting literal security threat to U.S are irrelevant
1302754639046156290 2020-09-07 07:44:44 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @atrupar He VISIBLY "bared his choppers" three times here.  It was especially noticeable with the sound off.  A good "tell."

1302320487121539072 2020-09-06 02:59:34 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @joe361 I think vast majority of attacks/smears on Mr. STEELE are disingenuous with a suspect motive.
1302320193658671104 2020-09-06 02:58:24 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @joe361 As example, I worked at audit agency &amp; came across collateral info not relevant to our audit.  I later successfully presented "case" for newly-designed audit to TEST that data.    The validity or invalidity of data is NOT germane.  HUMINT (human intell) can be 70% junk!
1302319110676766726 2020-09-06 02:54:06 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @joe361 Indeed.  The Steele dossier is being mischarcterized.  It is more in the nature of RAW data, that suggests the NEED for a review.  Christopher Steeke was NOT expecting to come across it. 1/2

1301966657129189377 2020-09-05 03:33:35 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @jomajonesnyc   Awww. That was sweet if you to "fave" my share.    Blessings and a joyful weekend to you.
1301946826883563520 2020-09-05 02:14:47 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @Gabino_Iglesias I am late!  Back to you THIS p.m.
1301945396261015558 2020-09-05 02:09:06 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @PoliticalJM7 @AdamSerwer Sadly, this actually WAS something he raised.  Wondering WHY the U.S. was on the side of the Allies then.
1301944210959073287 2020-09-05 02:04:23 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @SubZeroPoet I open up when folks ask about these things since I am sure there are other people on the path behind me that are just now trying to get clarity on the shaded parts of their past that they "zoned out" from.    : )     Cheers to you and yours!  "Moe"
1301943675291865094 2020-09-05 02:02:15 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @SubZeroPoet I have "baked in" to me from toddler-hood an overactive "fight or flight" mechanism that I counter with meditation, and a lot of body/mind/spirit self-care. My body pumps cortisol at the drop of a hat,  and my blood pressure spikes high. Live with and manage it.
1301942442783059969 2020-09-05 01:57:21 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @SubZeroPoet And I had an obscure contempt for artists, musicians, i.e., people who were doing what I secretly wanted to do.  I had to break apart at midlife to finally start to become a full human being.    OK, that is it for now!  4.
1301942333689212929 2020-09-05 01:56:55 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @SubZeroPoet The sad part is that "hardness" can be internalized.  I could be pretty callous when I was young, cute, and making a lot of money.  3.
1301941837775745025 2020-09-05 01:54:57 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @SubZeroPoet I thought of it, since sometimes SEEING a kind person (like Biden), being treated with kindness after zoning out a cruel environment, is more enraging, since you realize WHAT you are living with (Trump) at the moment.  2.
1301941470153396225 2020-09-05 01:53:30 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @SubZeroPoet Daydreaming was a way of "checking out" but cut me off in many ways from reality, but it was the only "world" I knew.  For some reason, that family really hit me that day.  That people could be relaxed and happy, and PRESENT.  2.
1301941167458848768 2020-09-05 01:52:17 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @SubZeroPoet OK, I experienced very abusive (verbally and physical) behavior from a very young age, so my home environment was toxic but it was all I knew.  I would hide behind a giant tub with a book and "zone out."  1.
1301940668214980609 2020-09-05 01:50:18 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @SubZeroPoet Many citizens have been abused by this Administration, even if by osmosis, but the press has been brutally abused.  I would NOT be surprised if, in aftermath, some have PTSD symptoms.  In MIDST of bad situations, people sometimes "numb out," but boy do you pay for it later.
1301940070119768064 2020-09-05 01:47:56 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @SubZeroPoet Won't go into detail, but once biked by house on 4th of July and saw big, happy, group of people, and thought to myself "some families are happy and their house is happy."  I think I was 10.    Post Jan. 21 (particularly if we boot McConnell) going to be dizzifying few weeks.

If they weren't defending Trump, who ALREADY baldly dismissed SCORES of unrelated women's claims of assault as LIES, Squad would be more convincing.

Twitter is my own "think aloud" journal, tiny printing press, and also a wonderful kind of "salon"....  You just have to curate the gold threads from the chaff and poison!
1300824030497452034 2020-09-01 23:53:11 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @TicoRomao My own draft novel manuscripts  tend towards quests, by VERY different types of characters.    Plus for some reason... ghosts!

1300801446498250753 2020-09-01 22:23:27 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @TicoRomao Miss our Silver Spring, Maryland Art Deco "Silver Theater" SO much.  Home of  American Film Institute (you may well know all this already).  Wonderful idea when they reopen!     Miss live theatre and live music even more.   Zoom is fine, but can't replace real humans.  CHEERS!

1300797917905801217 2020-09-01 22:09:25 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @TicoRomao LOLZ.  This may sound silly, but "Apocalypse" shares my #1 fave film billing with "Shaun The Sheep," which I wrote a loving fan letter essay to.  Then some genius found two genius screen shots to commemorate my odd tastes.  Hope I can find!
1300797449536180225 2020-09-01 22:07:34 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @TicoRomao @davidberger @ConFilmBuff Wow.  I have a shredded copy of Greene's "End of the Affair" that I diced and sliced and hi-lited from every angle.  What a great educational experience.  IMHO, it is a technically "perfect" work of art.  It may or may not be to everyone's taste, but what masterful execution!
1300796543298154496 2020-09-01 22:03:58 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @TicoRomao   I thought this thread by Britt Marling was incredible.  The "strong woman" and the "dead prostitute/girl/woman" "mirror" tropes are very powerful, but only stand-ins for a full-fleshed-out female character.     https://t.co/9psVNqqhCe

1300613695379320833 2020-09-01 09:57:23 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @MissTallulah2   Thank you, I hope you can disseminate Dr. Shaw's warning.. I think it has been terribly underreported by MSM.

German UBoats were patrolling immediately outside  Hampton Beach, New Hampshire in Summer 1942....my dad and family had cottage there.  TOTAL blackout every night.  Not even a lit match for a üö¨.

1300604219502874627 2020-09-01 09:19:44 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> A bit more detail on the self-contradictory nature of a Politico  hit piece.  And as for Strzok disciplinary matter, Bowdich's reasoning is starchy and strained, as even FBI was forced to concede no Hatch Act  issue or suggestion of bias in Mr. Strzok's work.  https://t.co/6fh6FYv564
1300602862528008193 2020-09-01 09:14:21 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @xlawyer90 Thanks for the fave.  I thought the Politico "hit piece" analogy would sink like a stone!
1300601718326034438 2020-09-01 09:09:48 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @keithboykin ABSOLUTELY.  Thank you so much for continuing to share your truth.
1300601289584381963 2020-09-01 09:08:06 +0800 <MamurphyMaureen> @JuliaDavisNews @agentcurieuse I feel awkward discussing my theories while Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page are very much living their lives, but these possibilities should be considered.    Mr. Strzok once "favorited" some thoughts I tweeted out, so that helped my comfort level.
