1341783802935447552 2020-12-24 00:32:42 +0800 <Intersolglobal> Our CEO may have been a Tier 5 investigative interview manager in the police but this qualification, independently accredited and governed, has real value and meaning. Do you forensically interview people or conduct fact-finding meetings? This qualification is a must-have.  https://t.co/l8CuRH3Z1p
1340971035357790211 2020-12-21 18:43:03 +0800 <Intersolglobal> After a challenging and very unpredictable year, we‚Äôd like to thank all of our partners who have worked with us in 2020. We look forward to a much needed new year as we continue to train, qualify, advise &amp; investigate.   Merry Christmas!    https://t.co/4OD9MIfrWW  https://t.co/9gx4x2PEth
1339905209666027520 2020-12-18 20:07:50 +0800 <Intersolglobal> Some positive news to end the year on! We are delighted to announce our workplace mediation partnership with Normanton Chambers. Learn more about our partnership here:  https://t.co/crJ7gq9KGk  https://t.co/Clr6rdqgIz
1339650041884119040 2020-12-18 03:13:54 +0800 <Intersolglobal> So, so, sad for the many at the coalface working tirelessly to deliver some sort of service and justice. Just take a moment to reflect on how this sucks the lifeblood out of them.  A tragedy long in the making.
1338007374003580932 2020-12-13 14:26:31 +0800 <Intersolglobal> Great read @DeccaJourno. Nailed 3 of the top 5 qualities of an effective interviewer - ability to plan and prepare thoroughly, listening skills, and ‚Äòmirroring‚Äô. Touched on open-mindedness &amp; non-judgementality but missed confirmation bias and forensic questioning. We should talk!
1336286686733606915 2020-12-08 20:29:07 +0800 <Intersolglobal> We are delighted to continue our sponsorship with @amosshe_uk, The Student Services Organisation.

1336205295626964992 2020-12-08 15:05:42 +0800 <Intersolglobal> None. So many variables. Options can be explained along with potential outcomes allowing YOU to decide. Not a one-size fits all. There are some very basic principles that could be useful while YOU decide what to do. Would a ‚Äòfact-sheet‚Äô help victims?
1335148513890627585 2020-12-05 17:06:26 +0800 <Intersolglobal> @BarristerSecret Spot on @BarristerSecret. Bigger issue? Why are they still in the community? (Born out of interviewing more than enough psychotic killers and meeting bereaved families)
1335145309983436806 2020-12-05 16:53:42 +0800 <Intersolglobal> Thanks for the review Kerry. Ordered for the library!
1334408842382356481 2020-12-03 16:07:14 +0800 <Intersolglobal> ....BUT if you have the appetite to reflect and learn from mistakes look no further for your investigation training and operations.  https://t.co/cj31oEaudc
1334407256394395648 2020-12-03 16:00:56 +0800 <Intersolglobal> So please DON‚ÄôT commission us to investigate if you don‚Äôt want to hear the truth. We will NOT bury your bad news.  https://t.co/URlmXf2VN7
1334191777247600640 2020-12-03 01:44:42 +0800 <Intersolglobal> @DrEOChapman Respectfully there is a third Emma. Those professionals with the skills and emotional intelligence to non-judgementally follow the evidence whilst remaining open-minded, totally empathetic and delivering the means to secure justice. The  professional investigator.
1334039036797841408 2020-12-02 15:37:46 +0800 <Intersolglobal> Having your account professionally and forensically captured and stored not only makes the defending lawyers job harder if court ensues but is cathartic and therapeutic - ask any victim who has been professionally interviewed.
1334037916151111685 2020-12-02 15:33:19 +0800 <Intersolglobal> And this is why you should insist that you are forensically interviewed as soon as reasonably practicable. Victim of rape or serious sexual assault? Get yourself forensically interviewed until YOU decide what to do and don‚Äôt set yourself up to fail. @RapeCrisisEandW @StmarysSARC
1334035192168648704 2020-12-02 15:22:29 +0800 <Intersolglobal> @KatieAnneTobin @SussexUni We‚Äôd be happy to undertake an external desktop review of the investigation process and methodology if it would help.

The bedrock of the CJS is the investigative excellence, NOT lawyers. Without it the superstructure is built on quicksand.

1330789683408859136 2020-11-23 16:26:00 +0800 <Intersolglobal> @KatieAnneTobin @SussexUni Seems extreme but entirely dependent on the case and its stakeholders. We always emphasise that you can‚Äôt realistically estimate time until after the reporting persons forensic interview. Great report and support systems fail without investigation competency.

1319776079196860421 2020-10-24 07:01:52 +0800 <Intersolglobal> Superb initiative. Still a huge missing link, the forensic capturing and storage of narrative. Why? Because ultimately most RASSO investigations rely exclusively on the accounts of those involved.

1313380200814706690 2020-10-06 15:26:55 +0800 <Intersolglobal> Well said Your Honour, but not a patch on victims trauma. Also maybe spare a thought for those constantly forensically interviewing victims, day after day, investigating and then remaining non-judgemental when interviewing the suspects.
1312645437124423680 2020-10-04 14:47:14 +0800 <Intersolglobal> Brilliant!
1312288643181092864 2020-10-03 15:09:28 +0800 <Intersolglobal> Policing success MUST stop being measured by number of arrests. At least scrutinise how many pass the ‚Äòtests‚Äô, even better, measure (safe) convictions. Don‚Äôt even mention ‚Äúreleased under investigation‚Äù!
1312287272994246656 2020-10-03 15:04:01 +0800 <Intersolglobal> Only law is driven by ‚Äòbundles‚Äô and ‚Äòpapers‚Äô! Anything to do with billable fees by any chance?

1302516387613757440 2020-09-06 15:58:01 +0800 <Intersolglobal> What about one who says ‚ÄúI could just tell they (the witness) was lying?
1302194563017302016 2020-09-05 18:39:12 +0800 <Intersolglobal> @aoibhinn_ni_s @IrishTimes @ucddublin We‚Äôre embedded in the thinking and culture of increasing numbers of UK HEIs as external investigators of serious sexual misconduct and have lots of learning. Happy to share experiences if it would help.
1301959220372307975 2020-09-05 03:04:02 +0800 <Intersolglobal> Great news, well done. You know what We find staggering? Welfare case management is independently accredited but investigations of serious sexual offences can be undertaken by ANYONE! Can anybody explain why we risk victims lives in this way? Please? @1752Group @UniversitiesUK

1301457443789119489 2020-09-03 17:50:09 +0800 <Intersolglobal> Music college accused of failing to properly investigate sexual assault claims  https://t.co/RQkW3mJ5dz  Key question - who was the investigator and what were their qualifications and experience of investigating sexual assaults?.... As for the complaint nor being in writing!
1301398022820114434 2020-09-03 13:54:02 +0800 <Intersolglobal> @1752Group @t_haismanpage A really thought provoking article that we will share with all our investigators as part of their CPD. We‚Äôre already investigating online sexual and racial harassment so this is a natural extension. Thank you @1752Group @ConfreyMick
1300678902491295746 2020-09-01 14:16:30 +0800 <Intersolglobal> @Veronica_Strain Those who have Knowledge, Understanding, Skills, Attitude, and Behaviour. KUSAB old hat maybe but still very relevant. Never more so than when ‚Äòincompetent‚Äô investigation ruins lives.
