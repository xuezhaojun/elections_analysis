1343207820783722498 2020-12-27 22:51:14 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @Twogetherstudio @TheZoneCast It‚Äôs been a hard year for all of us, I wasn‚Äôt trying to make you feel bad. Thank you for apologising.

You didn‚Äôt have to reply immediately, &amp; you could post that you‚Äôre off for the holiday. You‚Äôve got to understand that the current situation is concerning for people waiting as well, as so many parcels have been lost in transit. It isn‚Äôt unreasonable to ask.
1343200184856096769 2020-12-27 22:20:54 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @Twogetherstudio @TheZoneCast It‚Äôs pretty legitimate to ask for an update 2 weeks after the estimated date you gave, especially as other people are receiving their product. I‚Äôm not being mean, I‚Äôm asking what‚Äôs happening because it isn‚Äôt clear. There‚Äôs no need to be rude or defensive.
1343195569632780289 2020-12-27 22:02:33 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @Twogetherstudio @TheZoneCast That‚Äôs great but the communication has been pretty poor. We were told that they would arrive at a warehouse in Ireland on 13th December and start shipping week of 21st Dec. So far it looks like neither of those things have happened and there‚Äôs not been any update since 23rd Nov.
1343186036726390784 2020-12-27 21:24:41 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @AC_Revolution just saw you in the guardian comments section on Facebook and did a double take! Twitter friends on Facebook, wild. Hope you‚Äôre having a good holiday season.

1339850981538979840 2020-12-18 16:32:21 +0800 <melissarchaplin> Today is a good day, in that it‚Äôs the last day of work before a much needed break. It‚Äôs also melancholy, because an old friend who died in summer would have been turning 30 today. I feel that juxtaposition kind of sums up my 2020.

1339196696505487362 2020-12-16 21:12:28 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @Umbralycoris Can‚Äôt get a test unless you develop symptoms and even if it‚Äôs negative you‚Äôre still meant to isolate. Got no way of getting home home anyway, but it does mean we can‚Äôt go back to our own flat (with flatmates)

1338397912926195712 2020-12-14 16:18:23 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @NorthwesternU should apologise for keeping this man on payroll for so long.

1337871874143948808 2020-12-13 05:28:05 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @WSJ should be ashamed of publishing such an demonstrably false, misogynistic piece. .@NorthwesternU is this, by your staff member, representative of how your university feels about doctorates?

1336266111256555525 2020-12-08 19:07:22 +0800 <melissarchaplin> I‚Äôm cold enough that I‚Äôve just stood up to hug the radiator while my pc restarts.

1335897786659770372 2020-12-07 18:43:46 +0800 <melissarchaplin> I have oodles of micro USB cables. I must have dozens. Hundreds. So why is it whenever I need one I cannot for the life of me find a single cable?
1335880589631762432 2020-12-07 17:35:26 +0800 <melissarchaplin> Has anyone else got into terrible sleep patterns lately? If you fixed it, how??  I sleep in on my days off till about 11 or 12 and can‚Äôt sleep till 1 or 2am most nights. It‚Äôs making it harder and harder to start my day well! üòÖ

1334426653288763392 2020-12-03 17:18:01 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @JodieAzhar Jodie you always speak such good sense. The Kafkaesque process of job applications can be so demoralising for people
1334425269009059842 2020-12-03 17:12:31 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @blindside_UK üôå that‚Äôs awesome to hear!

1330875299966423047 2020-11-23 22:06:12 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @LaurenSMoses @_StardustTweets Try to choose distinct areas you can score them on that are relevant, that‚Äôs how I make sure I‚Äôm being as objective as possible. E.g. professionalism of application; community experience (even volunteer); evidence of interest in the games industry; etc...

1330500955893325831 2020-11-22 21:18:42 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @tayadigital Why do my boobs feel weird? Oh it‚Äôs because the cushion that‚Äôs meant to be below one of them is actually above it now for some reason.  https://t.co/OTPIx34OYu
1330492270609657858 2020-11-22 20:44:11 +0800 <melissarchaplin> Which design paragon‚Äôs idea was it to have all the pads in sports bras be loose and unstitched so that every time you wash them they twist and contort and you have to use the tiny opening at the side to painstakingly right them again? I just want a word.
1330488279125401600 2020-11-22 20:28:19 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @SLINKYFISHY I feel like this but I know deep down I would just fall lots

Apparently Caitlin if we don‚Äôt want to be looked down on as women it‚Äôs our responsibility to ‚Äúprove them wrong‚Äù üôÉ

1329475778883571717 2020-11-20 01:25:00 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @CelestialLil There are plenty of women out there happy to co-sign misogyny because they think they‚Äôll be exempt from the same treatment. (Spoiler alert, they are never exempt).

1329455825077882882 2020-11-20 00:05:43 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @yurureri I know. It‚Äôs because they feel so invincible they can get away with it.
1329455021600206857 2020-11-20 00:02:31 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @iyagovos Unconvincingly denying it. All told, a mess from start to finish.
1329454386511278081 2020-11-20 00:00:00 +0800 <melissarchaplin> Imagine being so unashamed of hating women that you tweet this in a professional capacity...  https://t.co/ode0oARqPo

1329022486525173760 2020-11-18 19:23:47 +0800 <melissarchaplin> It‚Äôs important to check if you‚Äôre inadvertently following someone who is speaking hatefully about vulnerable groups, I would be mortified for anyone to think I tacitly endorsed those views.

1328995594040471557 2020-11-18 17:36:55 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @MckKirk Husband just admitted to humming it earlier. Mystery solved.
1328994397833269251 2020-11-18 17:32:10 +0800 <melissarchaplin> Why have I woken up with Linkin Park‚Äôs ‚ÄúIn The End‚Äù stuck in my head?
1328821999351820288 2020-11-18 06:07:07 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @AlexisTrust In all industries, we urgently need to address the overemphasis this country puts on London. It contributes to SO many systemic issues and inequalities.
1328820438387060741 2020-11-18 06:00:55 +0800 <melissarchaplin> I was able to live rent free in London so I could go to EGX and network, then take on part time lower paid roles without having to worry about making ends meet. It‚Äôs so so hard.
1328749098632179712 2020-11-18 01:17:26 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @Shikaboom Why is every platform determined to make this nonsense happen?
1328721072028602368 2020-11-17 23:26:04 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @SharkB1t @geekybaking And then you‚Äôll DM me how...
1328686543943454721 2020-11-17 21:08:52 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @cptnbeatrush Yeah it‚Äôs a super mixed bag. @tayadigital were you talking about different resources for this sort of thing recently? (Masters in psychology coming in clutch)
1328682703722598402 2020-11-17 20:53:36 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @cptnbeatrush I did some through the NHS, depending on where you are that might be possible. I tried Mind but honestly had quite a bad experience with them personally.
1328675006327508994 2020-11-17 20:23:01 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @geekybaking How do we watch this and the Kristen Stewart one here in the U.K.??
1328674090928967686 2020-11-17 20:19:23 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @ghostlycola This is relatable. Anxiety makes it very difficult for me to get tasks done. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs add in my case, more just spiralling thoughts.
1328673498483535872 2020-11-17 20:17:02 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @itshannahflynn God I remember this. Full body shudder.

1328457636505923588 2020-11-17 05:59:16 +0800 <melissarchaplin> I don‚Äôt feel up to listing my 2020 accomplishments right now. This has been a year of illness &amp; funerals. Of missing my family &amp; struggling with depression. There are absolutely things I‚Äôm thankful for but I find myself unable to articulate them right now.
1328456577360261120 2020-11-17 05:55:04 +0800 <melissarchaplin> Played Spiritfarer and cried lots - basically therapy.

1328329458642808832 2020-11-16 21:29:56 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @tayadigital I‚Äôm like hello everyone, you may surmise from my face that I am poorly and gross. Today is another day to be thankful for remote working so none of you have to see me in HD üòÇ
1328328441469526016 2020-11-16 21:25:54 +0800 <melissarchaplin> Anything suggesting I not wear my glasses is yucky ableist bullshit.
1328328302034030592 2020-11-16 21:25:21 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @tayadigital I have reframed my not bothering with makeup most days from lazy to taking a stand for the normalisation of bare faces
1328328013356953602 2020-11-16 21:24:12 +0800 <melissarchaplin> Twitter I need fashion help. I am looking for a black, v neck, sweater vest. Preferably cable knit. Under ¬£75 ideally.

1325857982203260931 2020-11-10 01:49:10 +0800 <melissarchaplin> I had no idea how much my mental health relied on going out for walks until we found out we can‚Äôt leave the house until the 18th (contact tracing). We‚Äôre less than halfway through and I‚Äôm struggling.

1322768640316497926 2020-11-01 13:13:14 +0800 <melissarchaplin> We just had to say our goodbyes to my FIL in hospital. 48 hours ago we thought he was fine.
1322476277023068160 2020-10-31 17:51:29 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @CharleneLebrun Just put together that you‚Äôre moving together and not two separate people on Twitter coincidentally moving to the same place at the same time üòÖ thinking of you, hope you can get there okay!

1322472295944855552 2020-10-31 17:35:40 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @alphachar A bit better on the kidney front but it‚Äôs going to be a tough weekend. We‚Äôre unexpectedly looking after my FIL who has had a bad reaction to radiotherapy, had to call paramedics in the night. We‚Äôre just trying to get an update from the hospital now :(

1322325943113965569 2020-10-31 07:54:07 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @NoeticVice I felt like this. Then I started to feel better. Stopped sleeping 18hrs a day. Didn‚Äôt cry all the time. I was on Sertraline for about a year &amp; a half. I wouldn‚Äôt have got through my PhD without it. Let me know if you ever want to chat. Firm believer in reducing stigma.

1321100641360584704 2020-10-27 22:45:12 +0800 <melissarchaplin> Pharmacy insists at 14:20 they‚Äôve never heard of the prescription and that ‚Äúthe internet is too slow‚Äù. Dr sent it at 13:20. Oh what‚Äôs that? Now my housemate has come all the way home they‚Äôve found it? Bloody fantastic.
1321082838461173763 2020-10-27 21:34:27 +0800 <melissarchaplin> If you had your money on it being a kidney infection- you were right! I will now proceed to continue being miserable but with added antibiotics

1321064153734414338 2020-10-27 20:20:13 +0800 <melissarchaplin> I live in a basement flat. Signal is terrible. Waiting by the phone like this means I can‚Äôt do anything, not even have a shower. I‚Äôm stuck in the same spot where I can muster a couple of bars of phone signal.
1321063653332996097 2020-10-27 20:18:13 +0800 <melissarchaplin> The saga continues. I was the 2nd person to call the surgery this morning. They promised at 8.20 they would call ASAP when on call dr was off the phone. When I called at 9.30 they said this morning. Morning has now passed. I‚Äôve still not heard anything and I‚Äôm still in pain :(
1321060292953051136 2020-10-27 20:04:52 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @zerobudgetgamer @yakwaxlips @StuAdvBrummie @AdventurersCap @StarSeekerGame is out soon :)

1321040693117288456 2020-10-27 18:46:59 +0800 <melissarchaplin> Is this Woolworths thing a hoax? Also pandemic has made me extremely not keen on pick n mix
1321026316355985409 2020-10-27 17:49:51 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @SharkB1t I understand there‚Äôs a pandemic. I know they must be going through it. I do expect them to still have compassion for me when I‚Äôm in pain.
1321026050072207360 2020-10-27 17:48:48 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @alphachar Thank you. Just rang them back. The woman got all defensive about the fact they hadn‚Äôt called me saying it‚Äôs busy on reception but confirmed the Dr will ring me sometime this morning. They also hadn‚Äôt made a note of the correct number to call so I‚Äôm glad I checked.
1321025953955516421 2020-10-27 17:48:25 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @SharkB1t Just did. The woman got all defensive about the fact they hadn‚Äôt called me saying it‚Äôs busy on reception but confirmed the Dr will ring me sometime this morning. They also hadn‚Äôt made a note of the correct number to call so I‚Äôm glad I checked.
1321025347060719616 2020-10-27 17:46:00 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @alphachar Thank you! I‚Äôll take that up. Lying down listening to a podcast is about all I‚Äôm up to rn. I just want the Dr to answer. Been trying to phone since 8am
1321021994217967618 2020-10-27 17:32:41 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @SharkB1t I think at the very least I‚Äôm gonna need antibiotics or something. I can barely sit up, and the kidney area on the right feels really tender and sore. I just feel like they said they‚Äôd call me back then forgot about me. Which...has happened to me before with Drs.
1321020889178267648 2020-10-27 17:28:18 +0800 <melissarchaplin> So they said they‚Äôd call me back shortly and that they couldn‚Äôt keep me on the line because the on call dr was busy. That was an hour ago and they still haven‚Äôt called :(
1321008414294757376 2020-10-27 16:38:43 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @feline_dacat Thank you! How was your Kiev?
1321003161444884481 2020-10-27 16:17:51 +0800 <melissarchaplin> I hate the hold music my GP uses because it has long periods of silence where I worry I‚Äôve been cut off
1321001545194967040 2020-10-27 16:11:26 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @tayadigital Thank you! Seriously the worst luck.
1321000510116290560 2020-10-27 16:07:19 +0800 <melissarchaplin> So I‚Äôm nervously waiting to ring the dr about the severe kidney pain I developed through the night. Send distractions and cute pets please.

By his own metric everyone else in the discussion is more qualified than him to comment.

1318833767138676742 2020-10-21 16:37:27 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @tweetcharisreid I‚Äôm trying to go outside more. I want to start running again (and listening to @sixtostart games while I do) but I haven‚Äôt quite felt up to it yet. Hoping if I keep going for walks I‚Äôll psych myself up. I also recommend ordering treats and maybe starting a new game :)

1318189604441366528 2020-10-19 21:57:47 +0800 <melissarchaplin> Over 75% funded! It‚Äôs the most eerily prescient sci-fi I‚Äôve ever read. With contributions from @leighalexander  @yudhanjaya and @m_older this is going to be at the cutting edge of interactive fiction.

1318184025115295746 2020-10-19 21:35:36 +0800 <melissarchaplin> My colleague, friend, &amp; all round good bean @lucyannjo wrote this helpful post about what counts as ‚Äúnews‚Äù in indie game marketing. It‚Äôs more nuanced than you‚Äôd think. A must-read for any #indiegamedev thinking about how to market their #indiegame    https://t.co/dDlBtzugo4

1317231473892724739 2020-10-17 06:30:31 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @geekybaking People want to believe they weren‚Äôt given a leg up by circumstances...even when they were.

1317014679915548673 2020-10-16 16:09:03 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @Gameonysus The audacity of this man openly admitting he is enraged just by a woman existing. Alongside what could well be his real name.
1316817447744344065 2020-10-16 03:05:19 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @gameifyouare Also I feel you missed an opportunity to go for Lewis Deadby here

Additional qualifications, experience they‚Äôve gained, or maybe they were just drastically underpaid in their previous role. You shouldn‚Äôt even be asking them their previous wage

1315936871512518658 2020-10-13 16:46:13 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @Popelady It could be that something about my online presence is confusing them into thinking I have more disposable income than I do?

1315584198095372288 2020-10-12 17:24:49 +0800 <melissarchaplin> Thinking about the school assembly we had once where a teacher stood up in front of a few hundred teens and told us if we read the spells from children‚Äôs books aloud we‚Äôd be possessed by demons. Happy days.

1314170985143300096 2020-10-08 19:49:13 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @patrixilent @LaurakBuzz One of the reasons I didn‚Äôt enjoy academia was the amount of work free you were expected to do for journals for exposure.
1314142918530273281 2020-10-08 17:57:42 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @Tivajillar Same. Happens all the time. Some people don‚Äôt see the knowledge as being worth paying for, and yet they want it enough to ask.
1314125674832109570 2020-10-08 16:49:10 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @designCaitlin Ah yes that classic legitimate business proposition üòÇ
1314118579948793856 2020-10-08 16:20:59 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @LaurakBuzz Oh yeah, anything reliant on emotional labour always gets undervalued!
1314117384177844224 2020-10-08 16:16:14 +0800 <melissarchaplin> Games people! What do you do in games, and how often are you asked to do that work for free?
1314116612639936513 2020-10-08 16:13:10 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @HeckinRobin Congratulations!
1314112520295264257 2020-10-08 15:56:54 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @samwrite Yeah I‚Äôm sensing a bit of obsession! Who needs to buy a home when you clearly life rent free in their mind?
1314112111354802176 2020-10-08 15:55:17 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @samwrite God what a creep. Who even is this person?
1314107823685595136 2020-10-08 15:38:14 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @ifnotnowgwen Get well soon!
1314106534851481602 2020-10-08 15:33:07 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @schillingc Sounds very similar to what we‚Äôve been doing. Looking forward to when we can resume some semblance of normality!
1314105455950663681 2020-10-08 15:28:50 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @schillingc Doing okay, all things considered. I enjoyed Spiritfarer and that‚Äôs certainly very close to home. You managing ok in this bizarre and terrible year?
1314102814000517120 2020-10-08 15:18:20 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @schillingc Thanks Chris. We weren‚Äôt still in touch and it‚Äôs suspected suicide so it‚Äôs a very complicated sort of grief.
1313980670566424576 2020-10-08 07:12:59 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @schillingc God I felt that. My childhood best friend died earlier this year.

1313855575772590081 2020-10-07 22:55:54 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @DC_Comicz @JustinMcElroy I think Taako is Chaotic Good, whereas Star Seeker is realistically Chaotic Neutral...neutral actually putting it gently.

1313590384631611396 2020-10-07 05:22:07 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @leonkillin Yes. I will never be able to own a home :(
1313581660168912896 2020-10-07 04:47:27 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @AtStudio46 This is fantastic! Well done!

1313580327479267329 2020-10-07 04:42:09 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @TheVTran I‚Äôm neither of those things but I am hyped for this game
1313579751416778753 2020-10-07 04:39:52 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @samito Congratulations on your fantastic news üôå I don‚Äôt know you but I was happy to see this tweet on my timeline.
1313425247849328641 2020-10-06 18:25:56 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @AmazonHelp I received an email saying it‚Äôs cancelled because the driver is unable to deliver to my address
1313424273508380674 2020-10-06 18:22:03 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @AmazonHelp They said Rabbit but then they have no contact details for them and they aren‚Äôt listed on your carrier page.
1313422605190299649 2020-10-06 18:15:25 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @AmazonHelp The issue is that my order is sitting in a van somewhere because the driver can‚Äôt even attempt to ring our doorbell? And amazon doesn‚Äôt know the contact details of the carrier at all??
1313420282481315841 2020-10-06 18:06:12 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @AmazonUK so your staff member is telling me that you don‚Äôt know where my delivery is, why it was suddenly cancelled, or even who the carrier is you‚Äôve used to deliver it? Just to let everyone know if you‚Äôre trying to use @AmazonFresh it‚Äôs an utterly useless service.
1313378894821691392 2020-10-06 15:21:44 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @x_GemGem Flagging has been a term as long as I can remember. (29, Geordie)

1311569025424592897 2020-10-01 15:29:58 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @DevRelCallum It‚Äôs always good to offer opportunities, the potential hurdle here is that a couple of days a week would rely on someone having another substantial source of income to take this opportunity, which can make things challenging for a lot of marginalised people.
1311568142590717953 2020-10-01 15:26:27 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @alexandrant5 Ooh exciting! I love a good trailer

1306499477449080833 2020-09-17 15:45:23 +0800 <melissarchaplin> I‚Äôve not been the biggest fan of ch4‚Äôs bake off, I‚Äôm loyal to the BBC version.

1306477481998848000 2020-09-17 14:17:59 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @six6jiang Yes! Sometimes sitting in discomfort is the appropriate reaction when something is f‚Äôed up and people are upset. Too many people lash out when they are uncomfortable, or try to paper over others‚Äô legitimate grievances, I suppose because they aren‚Äôt familiar with the feeling.

1305807085561667584 2020-09-15 17:54:04 +0800 <melissarchaplin> Random worry of the day. Is there science behind my multi step skincare routine, or have I just fallen victim to a capitalist plot to convince me to spend money on stuff to smush into my face every day?
1305775231227826176 2020-09-15 15:47:29 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @gameifyouare I think they had a big gap between s1 and s2 and lost momentum.
1305764321457250308 2020-09-15 15:04:08 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @hakirsch @FanTCbooks @ColonelMooney @JustinMcElroy I would defer to the people who‚Äôve been studying and researching heart disease, who are not in agreement with you there. It also isn‚Äôt a competition between infectious diseases. Comparing endemic disease with a specific global pandemic makes no sense.
1305757087918686208 2020-09-15 14:35:24 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @gameifyouare Got really into them because they did the entire soundtrack to Les Revenants, a creepy tv show I never went back to after an unsatisfactory s1 ending üòÖ

1305747694598664192 2020-09-15 13:58:04 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @FanTCbooks @ColonelMooney @JustinMcElroy This is the first year of Covid 19 &amp; it isn‚Äôt even over yet. It‚Äôs going to get worse in winter. Heart disease is also important, my grandfather died of a heart attack, but it isn‚Äôt an infectious disease so I‚Äôm not sure why we would compare them?
1305746328752975872 2020-09-15 13:52:39 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @MechaRecca I think under the current global circumstances this is a very normal feeling. Look after yourself, take some time to rest if you can, and find a gentle distraction like a game or Tv series you haven‚Äôt seen before. I actually have Spiritfarer lined up as my next soothing balm.
1305745899075899393 2020-09-15 13:50:56 +0800 <melissarchaplin> In honour of the gigs we can‚Äôt go to, let‚Äôs talk about our loudest ones!  Mine was 100% Mogwai. I felt that in my bones.
1305744662481833984 2020-09-15 13:46:01 +0800 <melissarchaplin> @FanTCbooks @ColonelMooney @JustinMcElroy The amount of deaths caused by this pandemic will also result in a massive recession and people losing their jobs. The jobs will suffer either way, I would prefer we go the route with fewer people dying painfully.
1305743992089436161 2020-09-15 13:43:21 +0800 <melissarchaplin> This is incredibly relatable. At no point has the pandemic gone away, people just decided to act as if it had. The more people who do that, the more dangerous it is for us all.
