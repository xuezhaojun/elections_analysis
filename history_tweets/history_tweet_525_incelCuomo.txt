1317099835829485568 2020-10-16 21:47:26 +0800 <incelCuomo> @NMalarksist @NathanJRobinson again, biden is the accelerationist when it comes to climate change
1317098783788990464 2020-10-16 21:43:15 +0800 <incelCuomo> @NMalarksist @NathanJRobinson im condemning policies that lead to more carbon emissions and you're supporting them because you don't care about your grandchildren
1317097823725379584 2020-10-16 21:39:26 +0800 <incelCuomo> @NMalarksist @NathanJRobinson more trade = more emissions. that's the only plan that matters
1317096896972918784 2020-10-16 21:35:45 +0800 <incelCuomo> @NathanJRobinson Biden will accelerate trade which will accelerate climate change faster than Trump changing EPA rules. Don't you care about your grandchildren?

1305139283800608768 2020-09-13 21:40:28 +0800 <incelCuomo> @ggreenwald do you think Biden will reduce drone policy to Obama levels or just default to the DoD's status quo? i don't honestly know the answer but I would guess the latter.
1305136773689999360 2020-09-13 21:30:29 +0800 <incelCuomo> @ggreenwald certainly not a peacenik but he's less likely to start a war in Syria than Biden
1304232674870075392 2020-09-11 09:37:55 +0800 <incelCuomo> @kath_krueger @willmenaker now that's a himbo

1302615773807075329 2020-09-06 22:32:56 +0800 <incelCuomo> @AigbokhanEjiehi @theintercept if only it were 3 years long instead of 2. then we would have gotten him!
1300972665503649792 2020-09-02 09:43:49 +0800 <incelCuomo> @SeanMcCarthyCom it'll probably be Pressley that runs against her. Mass libs still suck
