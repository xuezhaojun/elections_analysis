Human life is inherently valuable, something most normal people agree on, so obviously genocide is evil. Defending genocide would be pretty evil too, I'd say

It'd never solve world hunger because world hunger is an issue of distribution, not resources, and obviously it'd never cure cancer. Those aren't the goal of genocide. The goal

I'm talking about how much you get out of it, and you get a ton more replayability and the game gets so much more fun when you bump the difficulty up. This isn't about a score, it's about getting really into the meat of a game
1337478889111773184 2020-12-12 03:26:30 +0800 <Liseran23> @AdmiralBurnside @HearMe0ut @sol_demers @shann0nb1 @mikmarajjjj @jamescharles But of course you won't acknowledge that because then it doesn't fit your little narrative and you'll have to admit that maybe you're wrong. GTFO with your bad faith arguments

The original prosecutor literally withheld evidence that would've changed the decision you dipshit
1337461240118042626 2020-12-12 02:16:23 +0800 <Liseran23> @Archduke_Berith @sunset_breaker @SandwichColonel I'd definitely say the second entry leans harder into the more realistic style to be fair, but I absolutely love the look of the first game. It actually manages to pull off the dark visuals that most games fail at and it almost looks like an oil painting. Fits the theme p well
1337458093169512448 2020-12-12 02:03:52 +0800 <Liseran23> @sunset_breaker @Archduke_Berith @SandwichColonel Same with the OG Dishonored. That stylized approach not only sets it apart visually but makes its visuals timeless as well

1337454074611060736 2020-12-12 01:47:54 +0800 <Liseran23> @SpiderBat616 @spideyps5 Oh yeah, it's very likely gonna be another improvement of the game. The devs seem to be really getting into seeing how far they can go with encounters and all that. Eternal is at its best when it's at its hardest
1337451096067944451 2020-12-12 01:36:04 +0800 <Liseran23> @SpiderBat616 @spideyps5 I'm scared of Part 2 ngl, gonna make the base game look like Animal Crossing by comparison

Our argument is supported by one of the prosecutors, several members of the jury who had judged him guilty when they didn't have the full evidence, and the existing legal framework

Evidence which could've changed the outcome was withheld. If he had been sentenced for life there'd be a chance for retrial. Instead he's dead.

Several jurors and the appellate prosecutor agree with me on this.

Did you learn how to do weapon combos, think tactically in rapidly changing situations, and use your movement to avoid death? Or did you just play on an easy-medium difficulty one time and call it quits?

What the hell does my personal favorite movie have to do with anything? Of course if you like something you're gonna see it all the way through. If someone else said they didn't like it after watching the first portion then unless I felt like it improved

If you're not interested in a story and cutscene heavy game you're obviously not gonna be too interested in Cyberpunk and you're gonna be able to tell

It wasn‚Äôt known, it wasn‚Äôt shown in the same state that she played, and it‚Äôs a pattern specifically designed to trigger seizures. Stop being overly defensive over a genuine flaw
1336406640715849737 2020-12-09 04:25:47 +0800 <Liseran23> @T9X69 You‚Äôre stupid because you don‚Äôt even think for a second about what your argument is or what my argument is, and just repeat claims that I already disproved.
1336405851117137923 2020-12-09 04:22:38 +0800 <Liseran23> @T9X69 You‚Äôre stupid and haven‚Äôt processed a single thing I‚Äôve said here
1336405734611935233 2020-12-09 04:22:11 +0800 <Liseran23> @T9X69 Personally I don‚Äôt think someone should be forced to give up a hobby they enjoy because of disabilities, especially if there‚Äôs measures that can be taken to remove the risk from the hobby. She made that article to help people find those measures to avoid the danger.
1336404042826846209 2020-12-09 04:15:27 +0800 <Liseran23> @T9X69 Again. They endangered themselves to help other people work around those dangerous conditions. Stop selectively choosing the pieces of her PSA that support you while ignoring the actual purpose of it
1336391418550624256 2020-12-09 03:25:17 +0800 <Liseran23> @Steelcryo @Nimil @pcgamer They just responded to it  https://t.co/0CWG9gYsBN
1336390239078785025 2020-12-09 03:20:36 +0800 <Liseran23> @T9X69 @Nimil @pcgamer If this were just about the UI and explosions and what-not, I'd agree. It's not, though. It's about a specific pattern of flashing lights that's guaranteed to cause seizures. This is absolutely something new.
1336389902758506500 2020-12-09 03:19:16 +0800 <Liseran23> @T9X69 @Nimil @pcgamer She endangered herself for the purpose of helping other people who have epilepsy from avoiding those dangerous conditions
1336388236902543361 2020-12-09 03:12:39 +0800 <Liseran23> @T9X69 I have been nothing but excited for Cyberpunk for years now, I'm not just "bandwagoning" onto something I don't care about to hate on it, I'm talking about a legitimate issue with the game. Sorry that your narrow worldview can't handle there being valid criticisms of it
1336387591688646656 2020-12-09 03:10:05 +0800 <Liseran23> @T9X69 @Nimil @pcgamer She continued playing to help inform other people who might have epilepsy about the risks and how to possibly avoid those triggers. She didn't do it "to play a video game", she did it in order to provide proper information to other people with epilepsy you dumbfuck.
1336387334636527625 2020-12-09 03:09:04 +0800 <Liseran23> @T9X69 @Nimil @pcgamer Did you watch the video you sent? It's not strobing red and white lights, it's just a single white flash. And yes, I did read what she wrote. Did you? She literally talked about how she did it to figure things out to try and help other people with epilepsy.  https://t.co/BU9CS82Nm2
1336374254103912449 2020-12-09 02:17:05 +0800 <Liseran23> @T9X69 @Nimil @pcgamer people who have epilepsy. Don't act like she was just being stubborn and maybe actually take something like a method pretty much guaranteed to trigger epilepsy seriously
1336373949928706053 2020-12-09 02:15:52 +0800 <Liseran23> @T9X69 @Nimil @pcgamer The preview shown just had a single white flash, not flashing red and white lights. Also why the fuck do you think the reviewer was playing the game? You're acting like she was just being needlessly stubborn but she was playing it to give a proper review of accessibility to
1336371473422880774 2020-12-09 02:06:02 +0800 <Liseran23> @Steelcryo @Nimil @pcgamer Not from what I've seen? I hope they've found out about this. But yeah, it shouldn't be too hard of a tweak to make
1336370587401383938 2020-12-09 02:02:31 +0800 <Liseran23> @Steelcryo @Nimil @pcgamer Yeah, I don't think it was something maliciously placed in, it's likely just a stylistic choice that they didn't think too much about.
1336370322162012166 2020-12-09 02:01:28 +0800 <Liseran23> @joenilan @MickeHawk @pcgamer Yes, actually. Ambulance lights can cause seizures in people with epilepsy. Of course, I imagine it'd only be worse if it wasn't a vehicle that you're a certain distance from but instead a screen that'd be relatively closer to your eyes.
1336369326677487625 2020-12-09 01:57:30 +0800 <Liseran23> @Sandwich247 @Nimil @pcgamer Yeah, like while the person with epilepsy who played it did talk about how there are other issues with the stylistic glitching of the ui and all that but how there's workarounds, but with the brain dance it's just too much
1336368152394027010 2020-12-09 01:52:50 +0800 <Liseran23> @Nimil @pcgamer No, if you have seizures while not having epilepsy there's likely something going on physically. The problem is that it has the same method guaranteed to trigger epileptic seizures that doctors use.
1336367580924276739 2020-12-09 01:50:34 +0800 <Liseran23> @MickeHawk @pcgamer Not every FPS has the specific flashing red and white lights used by doctors to purposefully trigger seizures though. It goes beyond what's usually present in games.
1336367207819989001 2020-12-09 01:49:05 +0800 <Liseran23> @Nimil @pcgamer Difference is it's a specific kind of flashing red and white lights that are suspiciously similar to the same method used to purposefully trigger seizures in patients for diagnosis reasons. It's not just the regular flashing lights, it's stuff that goes far beyond that.
1336359698665250818 2020-12-09 01:19:15 +0800 <Liseran23> @SourceLocator @cowgirl_beebop To be fair the third point is a horribly worded argument about the double standards of how CP is rightfully universally hated but we all just kinda turn a blind eye to child labor. A "No ethical consumption under capitalism" argument.
1336340918056599554 2020-12-09 00:04:37 +0800 <Liseran23> @Goosenpai It also kinda just reeks of an attitude of letting the company who actually engages in those poor work ethics scot free. If that's your approach to poor work ethics you're going to have to start harassing a lot more people over a lot more things that have become commonplace

It‚Äôs some terminally online shit. It wasn‚Äôt because of stalking or anything like SMPLive stans did, it‚Äôs because of something as silly as twitter trending
1336281533175517186 2020-12-08 20:08:39 +0800 <Liseran23> @Marmot288 @Dream I mean he‚Äôs been donating to charity time and time again.

1335990853941202953 2020-12-08 00:53:35 +0800 <Liseran23> @ImDeido @NETHERVINES Yeah like I think if he actually worded it in a way that wasn't overly dramatic and was just like "yo stan culture can be pretty bad maybe you shouldn't obsess over random e-celebs" it'd probably be fine, but instead he went on some weird overblown tirade
1335989340116295683 2020-12-08 00:47:34 +0800 <Liseran23> @ImDeido @NETHERVINES Jawsh also used some pretty cringy language talking about how stans are a "beast" and a "malicious hivemind" as if stans making stuff trend on twitter or making edits is some atrocity.

That's why we should call for diverting said funding to stuff that actually helps people.

I feel like that‚Äôs really the root of issues people have with Eternal, some people were expecting Doom 2016 2, rather than Doom Eternal. Again, it‚Äôs valid to enjoy one and not the other, just doesn‚Äôt
1329124977489174535 2020-11-19 02:11:03 +0800 <Liseran23> @CJSeedge @GeertCu @BoundaryBreak @revolug_ Even with just the single charge, it‚Äôs a good habit to occasionally chainsaw a fodder demon. Again, that animation is a good time to check how you‚Äôre doing on resources and cooldowns, to think about your strategy, and possibly make you invincible right before an attack.

1329123134692323328 2020-11-19 02:03:43 +0800 <Liseran23> @CJSeedge @GeertCu @BoundaryBreak @revolug_ Yeah, again, that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre supposed to do. The chainsaw is another tool in your toolkit. It‚Äôs not a last resort, it‚Äôs something you use strategically and in the flow of your combat.
1329122836594765824 2020-11-19 02:02:32 +0800 <Liseran23> @CJSeedge @GeertCu @BoundaryBreak @revolug_ Mechanically simpler doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter‚Äù though. Eternal pushes you to learn its combat because once you do learn it, it‚Äôs so much more fun than 2016‚Äôs.

1329120115028332546 2020-11-19 01:51:43 +0800 <Liseran23> @jeffqchen @PepperTroopa @BoundaryBreak lmao bro pressing a single key for a short animation isn‚Äôt a ‚ÄúQTE‚Äù. If you actually gave Eternal a chance you‚Äôd realize that the glory kill animation is a great moment to check your health, armor, and cooldowns because you‚Äôre invincible at the moment. Also uh, it‚Äôs not ‚Äútrapping‚Äù
1329119253228888065 2020-11-19 01:48:18 +0800 <Liseran23> @CJSeedge @GeertCu @BoundaryBreak @revolug_ all different kinds of weapons, and strategize and adapt to changing situations. If you don‚Äôt like it that‚Äôs fine but to dismiss it as ‚Äúforcing you to do one thing‚Äù clearly shows you haven‚Äôt actually put in the effort to learn the game.

It‚Äôs something you occasionally do to get that down time to check your health, armor, and cooldowns. Eternal is a game that really pushes you to try and think on your feet, use

You don‚Äôt have to shoot the rockets off a revenant, in fact with the right weapons and combos you can easily wipe it without touching it‚Äôs rockets. It also sounds like you resorted to a strategy of ‚Äúfire guns until you run out, then

You don‚Äôt HAVE to do certain things to kill certain demons. Sure, a grenade stuns a caco and primes it for a glorykill but you can also use the ballista or the rocket

Your anecdotal evidence does not invalidate a documented phenomenon of those delivery services leaving it to USPS to actually finish the delivery in service of their profits.

And your other options are to have someone travel long distances just for the chance to get better deals? As if that does anything to fix the issue at hand? You types just love making the individual fix systemic issues

Why do you think delivery services like FedEx and UPS just hand packages over to the post office? When your system is based around making the maximum profit, you're inevitably gonna ignore certain groups

Pretty much any place that sells geodes will undoubtedly have amethyst geodes all the time. I think it's because the nice purple color does more to draw people in than quartz.

So yeah, maybe the pushback is because, believe it or not, unions are good, and anti-union laws are bad

Funny, that. Almost like when they don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre treated fairly they aren‚Äôt given a proper means to fix the issue at hand.

If you‚Äôre suggesting they start a business with the standard structure...

However, you can kill an animal in real life an get a horn from it. It seems the novel concept of things in games also existing irl is beyond you.
1321817797178101760 2020-10-29 22:14:55 +0800 <Liseran23> @HubertWjcik0 @Person19039024 @kingbdogz Also killing animals for magical numbers to go up isn't something that has a real life parallel, whereas killing animals for their horns and tusks is a real thing that people do in real life.
1321817613517860866 2020-10-29 22:14:11 +0800 <Liseran23> @HubertWjcik0 @Person19039024 @kingbdogz like you'd need to kill passive mobs for a measly amount of XP. You're focusing way too much on a technically possible situation instead of looking what's logical and what people usually do.
1321817231081295872 2020-10-29 22:12:40 +0800 <Liseran23> @HubertWjcik0 @Person19039024 @kingbdogz I've already addressed those arguments. A unique cosmetic item only obtainable from one source is not the same as an overly abundant resource you passively get for just playing the game. XP is something you get so often and by the time you're actually able to use it, it's not
1321815425014026240 2020-10-29 22:05:30 +0800 <Liseran23> @HubertWjcik0 @Person19039024 @kingbdogz No, but there‚Äôs no point in arguing with you, you‚Äôll just keep making up scenarios that are TECHNICALLY true but make no actual logical sense and pretty much never happen.

They tend to focus on mobs that give food, you know, like cows and pigs. Again, nobody seeks out passive mobs for their XP. What would you even do with the XP at that point in time? You can‚Äôt enchant anything.

Mining ores? Gives you XP. Smelting ores? Gives you XP. Killing hostile mobs? Gives you XP. And they're all much better ways of getting XP than animals.
1321807244783198208 2020-10-29 21:32:59 +0800 <Liseran23> @HubertWjcik0 @Person19039024 @kingbdogz XP can be gotten from almost anything and is better obtained from different sources. The horn would ONLY be obtainable from a goat, so you'd either have to kill it OR get it in a different way. They hardly compare.

If doing one thing gets you a penny and doing another thing gets you 10 bucks, you're gonna go for the 10 bucks every time. Killing a single zombie can give you more

Nobody kills animals to get XP, it just doesn't happen. It's not nearly enough of a reward to "encourage" that action

You literally can get higher rewards from mining lapis or redstone. And you wanna know something? You get rewarded way more for breeding animals. The devs at Mojang understand that players are smart enough to

It's about giving greater reinforcement and reward to the desired playstyle and acknowledging that players are smart. Almost nobody uses passive mobs to farm XP, because hostile mobs are infinitely more useful in getting it.

1321437617762816001 2020-10-28 21:04:13 +0800 <Liseran23> @RInvandrare @BidenLenin They're both forms of child exploitation that are documented to cause similar effects of permanent mental and physical damage and stunt child development
1321436073109737472 2020-10-28 20:58:05 +0800 <Liseran23> @RInvandrare @BidenLenin Then why are you comparing both of them to determine which is "worse" and which is "better"?
1321435555012448256 2020-10-28 20:56:02 +0800 <Liseran23> @RInvandrare @BidenLenin Your argument is fundamentally based on comparing the two different types of trauma and deeming that one of them is less bad. My argument is just based on "Hey, maybe we shouldn't fucking exploit children"
1321435300984430594 2020-10-28 20:55:01 +0800 <Liseran23> @RInvandrare @BidenLenin Also I find it interesting how you complain about how "comparing" the two is insane, but you're the one trying to defend the argument that one's worse than the other, and I'm trying to defend the argument that, while different forms of trauma, they're both equally terrible
1321435062479572997 2020-10-28 20:54:04 +0800 <Liseran23> @RInvandrare @BidenLenin So... you don't have any scientifically backed evidence of effects of child sex abuse that are worse than the effects of child labor, and are just saying one's worse than the other because you *feel* like one is worse than the other. Do I need to say the line?
1321433987471073280 2020-10-28 20:49:48 +0800 <Liseran23> @northh1129 @buddyjj95 @BuzAudi @Timcast @VaushV I guess at the end of the day you'll always feel a lean to what personally affected you being the worst. Grass is always greener on the other side and all. In any case I wish you the best and hope that you're doing at least somewhat okay for yourself now.
1321433297377964034 2020-10-28 20:47:03 +0800 <Liseran23> @northh1129 @buddyjj95 @BuzAudi @Timcast @VaushV There's plenty if you take the time to look into it. All my claims about the effects of child labor have been backed by research.

I've provided factual information about the effects of child labor and child sexual abuse, so if you're trying to say one is worse than the other, what's your basis for doing so?
1321432258931236864 2020-10-28 20:42:56 +0800 <Liseran23> @RInvandrare @northh1129 @buddyjj95 @BuzAudi @Timcast @VaushV that the concept that maybe these two forms of childhood trauma are both same levels of horrible and cause the same horrible effects on children goes to show exactly why we need a larger discussion about the effects of child labor
1321432002097283073 2020-10-28 20:41:54 +0800 <Liseran23> @RInvandrare @northh1129 @buddyjj95 @BuzAudi @Timcast @VaushV Child labor literally causes extreme permanent mental and physical damage, stunts social skills preventing children from forming healthy relationships with friends and family, and stunts their academic development. It causes effects very similar to child sex abuse, and the fact

This is about spreading awareness of just how terrible it is that CSE is correctly hated but for some reason we all just kinda pretend that child labor doesn't exist.
1321429040750800902 2020-10-28 20:30:08 +0800 <Liseran23> @northh1129 @buddyjj95 @BuzAudi @Timcast @VaushV child labor are similar and equally terrible as the effects of child sexual exploitation, and your argument is based around downplaying the effects of child labor. I understand you've had personal experience with CSE, but I need you to understand that victims of child labor have

Both cause extreme levels of physical and mental damage. I find it interesting how my argument is based around talking about how the documented effects of

You're the one trying to somehow make one better than the other, I'm saying they're both bad and it's a stain on all
1321426582964154368 2020-10-28 20:20:22 +0800 <Liseran23> @northh1129 @buddyjj95 @BuzAudi @Timcast @VaushV Wait, if you're trying to cut the "child" part out of the equation, why are you removing it in terms of the forced labor but keeping it in terms of sexual exploitation? Is it perhaps because you're trying to remove the "child" part from labor to make it sound less bad?
1321425809333211136 2020-10-28 20:17:18 +0800 <Liseran23> @northh1129 @buddyjj95 @BuzAudi @Timcast @VaushV It feels like you're just trying to take the "child" part out of the equation to try and make your argument look better. The "child" part is an important part in this discussion
1321425526595223553 2020-10-28 20:16:11 +0800 <Liseran23> @northh1129 @buddyjj95 @BuzAudi @Timcast @VaushV Why the hell are you trying to change what the argument's about? While it's still kinda sus to claim that slavery is better than sexual abuse, when I'd put them on around the same level of bad, that's not what I was arguing at all. The argument is about CHILD labor.
1321424288591872000 2020-10-28 20:11:15 +0800 <Liseran23> @northh1129 @buddyjj95 @BuzAudi @Timcast @VaushV I do understand the psychological damage, and guess what? Victims of child labor face similar psychological damage! And permanent physical damage! It's not "someone working with their hands", it's a child being exploited for their labor and suffering extreme side effects
1321423323595743232 2020-10-28 20:07:25 +0800 <Liseran23> @northh1129 @buddyjj95 @BuzAudi @Timcast @VaushV It's not just "someone being payed" you fucking dumbass, it's a children being given a few scraps to suffer permanent mental and physical damage. Your own trauma is NOT an excuse to invalidate other's trauma.

1321421960291766277 2020-10-28 20:02:00 +0800 <Liseran23> @northh1129 @buddyjj95 @BuzAudi @Timcast @VaushV those things are "easier" to recover from? That shit's permanent. It's not easier to recover from. You're just trying to find a justification to not criticize the global capitalistic supply chain

I'm sorry, but are you genuinely trying to argue that

1321201186251427841 2020-10-28 05:24:44 +0800 <Liseran23> @F0rtuneL0wT1er The content is already finished and everything, it's not that the game alone isn't ready. The issue is, with the 2 delays, Cyberpunk is essentially going to be a "next-gen game" now, so they want to make sure it's ready and stable to release on the new consoles

I had just gotten *too* confident in going gold. This seems more like they made a decision between taking the hit for
1321147186642604032 2020-10-28 01:50:09 +0800 <Liseran23> @DatBoyJustyn @TheNeonArcadeNA That seemed to be the initial plan, it seems since then they've decided that it's better to take the hit of another delay than to risk people getting upset at possible poor optimization and lack of next-gen quality on next-gen consoles.
1321145677062299655 2020-10-28 01:44:09 +0800 <Liseran23> @DatBoyJustyn @TheNeonArcadeNA I mean it is gold, they're not changing anything content-wise. It's just a matter of optimization at this point.
1321144852709593089 2020-10-28 01:40:53 +0800 <Liseran23> @ALLYBABTU @CP2077Countdown lmao did you really let this live rent free in your head so badly that you had to bring this up after the thread was done? Yeah, I admit I was wrong about the delay. They still went gold, the content's all there. They're delaying to make sure the next-gen versions are up to par.
1321144145075994630 2020-10-28 01:38:04 +0800 <Liseran23> This. If they didn't delay then everybody would instead be complaining about how it's "so unoptimized" and how it didn't look as good as it should on next-gen consoles. Though they should maybe work on their issues with under-estimating the time it takes to do things

It's not about loving your body no matter what. Trans people want a different body, so that completely falls in line with body positivity. Shaming a trans person for transitioning is like shaming a fat person for working out

That's why people who transition from mtf start developing breasts, have their skin grow softer, develop monthly cramps similar to periods, have a female sex drive replace their male sex drive, etc. Chromosomes are meaningless,

If you actually knew anything about transitioning, you'd know that hormone replacement therapy changes the ratio of testosterone and estrogen, and thus

And even then, wouldn‚Äôt it be better to just, you know, point out that Kyle had reason to fire? Instead of bringing up a criminal history that the kid didn‚Äôt even know about?
1313112142799949825 2020-10-05 21:41:45 +0800 <Liseran23> @AimbotAimy @ThisBoner That's fair, on looking more closely that's definitely true, and makes the first shooting a lot more justified. Wish there was more focus on the actual events instead of immediately jumping to the weird "they were no saints" arguments.
1313109347434737673 2020-10-05 21:30:39 +0800 <Liseran23> @ThisBoner Yeah, because he saw Kyle kill two people over a coke bottle and a skateboard.

I think we can all agree pedophilia is wrong, but the fact of the matter is it had nothing

Looking more closely at the statistics, you can see that violent rape hasn't changed a bit. And again, if the immigrants were responsible, even if they were 5 times more likely to rape,
1310317676040990720 2020-09-28 04:37:33 +0800 <Liseran23> @MFeewings @palaver @TruthsThere @IlhanMN Yes, actually. That did happen. And now that's being changed. It's a documented and acknowledged phenomena that most of Europe, particularly the nordic countries, had laws that weren't up to par with international standards, and that there was a huge underreporting issue.

This is because many European countries have had poorly defined laws regarding rape, and reporting was flawed. Attention was brought to the issue as a whole, and now the countries are
1310287676613029890 2020-09-28 02:38:20 +0800 <Liseran23> @MFeewings @palaver @TruthsThere @IlhanMN If it were immigrants, there‚Äôd also be a link between the cities taking in more immigrants and rape cases, however that‚Äôs been shown to not be true. Mathematically and logically, the arguments that immigrants are responsible for the increase in rape cases makes little sense.
1310287246717837314 2020-09-28 02:36:38 +0800 <Liseran23> @MFeewings @palaver @TruthsThere @IlhanMN It was closer to around double, and it spiked because the legal definition of what rape is was expanded. Investigating the situation found that for immigrants to be the reason behind the spike, they‚Äôd have to be 83 times more likely to commit rape, a highly improbable statistic.

Unfortunately there is no way to peacefully instate a communist society, but to reject the idea based on that ignores that all politics rely on violence in some way.

Frankly, if you're going off of "what's more natural for humans", you'd realize that back before there were strict hierarchies in societies we lived a lot more communally. In truth, what "Human Nature" is, is anything. It's flexible."Human nature"

1308645616327831553 2020-09-23 13:53:23 +0800 <Liseran23> @Bat_Pepe01 @JayExci Exxon scientists found out about climate change and kept that secret because it was more profitable to do so. You're right, it's not a reality. It's a god damned fantasy. You'd rather live in a fantasy world than accept that we need drastic change and we need it now.
1308645189439967232 2020-09-23 13:51:41 +0800 <Liseran23> @Bat_Pepe01 @JayExci You think supporting capitalism is gonna do that? You think huge corporations will just decide to treat foreign workers better out of nowhere? Capitalism has no care for human rights or even the continued existence of the human race. It only cares about making more capital.
1308644614249811971 2020-09-23 13:49:24 +0800 <Liseran23> @Bat_Pepe01 @JayExci Ah, trickle-down economics, something invariably shown to be false. "If the wealthy are richer, we'll all get richer!" Truth is, no, that hasn't happened. It's only caused increased national debt, worsening poverty, greater income inequality, and marginal employment growth.
1308643926526619649 2020-09-23 13:46:40 +0800 <Liseran23> @Bat_Pepe01 @JayExci You realize that wages are stagnant while cost of living is rising, right? In fact, even some people who fall into middle class are living paycheck-to-paycheck. Thing's aren't improving. It's not getting more affordable.

Shouldn't those decisions be made by the people that they effect? At most you seem to
1308641220835577857 2020-09-23 13:35:55 +0800 <Liseran23> @Bat_Pepe01 @JayExci Communism is about the people who actually do the work being the ones to manage themselves. Communism is about treating human beings as actual human beings, and not tossing them to the gutters to slowly die for not being needed to do a rich man's work for him.
1308640359107436546 2020-09-23 13:32:29 +0800 <Liseran23> @Bat_Pepe01 @JayExci Do you even know what Communism is? That sounds more like a critique of Capitalism. Communism is in part a rejection of wealthy men creating businesses where the average joe works to barely scrape by, while the wealthy man gets wealthier.
1308639881619439616 2020-09-23 13:30:35 +0800 <Liseran23> @Bat_Pepe01 @JayExci What about the foreign workers who are mistreated, paid poorly, and murdered for striking, all because its more profitable to treat people like machines? At the end of the day, the death toll of Capitalism is exponentially higher than the death toll of Communism

What about the people who can't afford life saving medicine because of price gouging? What about the people who suffer from starvation, while living in the wealthiest nation?
1308638836336009217 2020-09-23 13:26:26 +0800 <Liseran23> @Bat_Pepe01 @JayExci You realize that if you apply the same (very loose and very biased) logic used to incriminate communism, it incriminates capitalism to a much larger scale, right? You want to argue against Communism because the death toll you're given? How about the death toll of Capitalism?

1308637608642310145 2020-09-23 13:21:33 +0800 <Liseran23> @Bat_Pepe01 @JayExci To say that something never worked before, therefore it never *can* work, is circular logic. If you dismiss the ability for something to work based very loosely on historical precedent, and use that to justify not pursuing it as an idea at all, then you never allow the historical

1308636401475428352 2020-09-23 13:16:46 +0800 <Liseran23> @Bat_Pepe01 @JayExci sometimes we don't really acknowledge all the failed attempts at achieving different systems. Even Athens, heralded as the first democracy, could be dismissed as a failure of democracy. However, we have historical hindsight and can acknowledge that democracy isn't some pipedream.

Socialism and Communism are not meant to spawn from agrarian societies, but rather from post-industrial societies, where the worker faces

Although some past ideologies were around back in Ancient Greece, it wasn't until the 19th century that communism came into being in its modern form. It's undoubtedly newer than Capitalism, which isn't by mistake.
1308631961603276800 2020-09-23 12:59:07 +0800 <Liseran23> @Bat_Pepe01 @JayExci Ah, the "cost more lives than fascism" part, I assume is citing the Black Book of Communism? A book which was subject to horrible editorial misconduct, with two of the researchers disavowing the book entirely, citing the editor fabricating deaths to get to the "100M dead" number

Fascism teaches class collaboration between the middle class and the industrialists, not the lower class and the industrialists.

It doesn't matter what he's done in the past, because at the end of the day, that knee on his neck killed him over a 20 dollar bill.
1306997850182758408 2020-09-19 00:45:44 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci Huh, maybe she wasn't paid as much attention because there's too many damn cases of police brutality to count? Have you ever considered that?

1306995719765716992 2020-09-19 00:37:17 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci I'm sorry, do you know what qualified immunity even is or what the issue that people have with it is? It protects police officers from being held liable for violating constitutional rights so long as there isn't a previous court decision within the same jurisdiction with the same
1306994114802708487 2020-09-19 00:30:54 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci Qualified immunity keeps them safe from the consequences of their actions. I'm not asking for more dead cops, I'm asking for cops to be held accountable.
1306993816969326592 2020-09-19 00:29:43 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci Sorry, but I'm not exactly trusting of just witness testimony from cops, considering they've pulled stunts like that to try and garner sympathy before. Stuff like "Pigs" being written on coffee cups or a tampon in a milkshake, things which have been proven outright false.
1306992728560066567 2020-09-19 00:25:23 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci Except there wasn't even that, just a patch on the front of their vest that just said "Police", something any tacticool larper can buy on their own.

1306967214726283265 2020-09-18 22:44:00 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci I can not find a single news article on this situation. With you being unable to provide a source, I can‚Äôt accept that as valid evidence for your side.
1306966614676561927 2020-09-18 22:41:37 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci Except they DIDN‚ÄôT have insignias, and yeah, qualified immunity is the thing protecting cops and keeping them unaccountable. Almost like there‚Äôs an issue with the current system and the people want it to be changed ü§î
1306958619666153476 2020-09-18 22:09:51 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci Do you have a story on this, because I heard jack shit about that. If it‚Äôs really as damning as you act like it is, surely there‚Äôd be no issue with me reading about it for myself, no?
1306957645086183428 2020-09-18 22:05:59 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci Hey buddy, I was just making a joke. You a little triggered?
1306957309894111238 2020-09-18 22:04:39 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci Hell, if you cared so much about doxxing, you should probably be upset with the NYPD doxxing the mayor‚Äôs daughter.
1306956996856483846 2020-09-18 22:03:24 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci I‚Äôm sorry, but no, they aren‚Äôt. They have no form of being identified. You just want to defend them over a false belief that if their identity is known that the big bad scary antifa will burn them down. Newsflash: That hasn‚Äôt happened to any individual who‚Äôs been doxed
1306956632501489670 2020-09-18 22:01:57 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci Citation needed. They had no insignia, refused to verbally identify, and had no clear identification.
1306950179183112193 2020-09-18 21:36:19 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci Oh, and if you really cared about cop's wives, you might wanna look at what 40% of cops do at their homes ;)
1306949821614501896 2020-09-18 21:34:54 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci And uh, when have people ever harassed cop's spouses and burned down their houses? They're supposed to be identifiable so they can be held accountable. That's kinda the whole point of protests, you know?
1306949620812132360 2020-09-18 21:34:06 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci The only markings or "personal codes" they had on were a badge on the front that said "POLICE". You realize anybody can just buy a vest and some tactical gear, right?
1306947392009273346 2020-09-18 21:25:14 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci that drivel, it's clearly rotting your brain. Unmarked agents of the state were throwing people in vans, and you have to use a non-existent technicality to accuse BLM of kidnapping as well? That was a good one, brought me a bit of laughter
1306946953536835585 2020-09-18 21:23:30 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci actual self defense, like attacking a guy who was running around with a machete trying to fight protestors. And as for that whole "kidnapping" thing, obstructing traffic, maybe, kidnapping? BAHAAHAHAHA hell no, you need to stop listening to your right wing pundits selling you
1306946724485836800 2020-09-18 21:22:35 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci I mean I've heard of a few buildings being burned (one of which being an under construction expansion to a child prison, so I'm not exactly shedding tears over that one), and yeah there's been some opportunists looting, as for assault, there really hasn't been much outside of
1306944611299012614 2020-09-18 21:14:11 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci shot at black bloc tactics, because that's a tactic that is used by almost any protest movement in which protestors don't want to be targeted by the state or by twitter psychos who will track a person down for daring to practice their first amendment rights.
1306943975232860162 2020-09-18 21:11:40 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci Yes, actually, protestors and supporters HAVE denounced the violence. Here's a video of them even self-policing in DC:  https://t.co/AqzhzicThf. And I'm not asking why they're smashed together, those beliefs all kinda go hand-in-hand lmao, you don't need to take a bizarre
1306927363222011904 2020-09-18 20:05:39 +0800 <Liseran23> @JackMcBobo @NYTWA Do you know the difference between a protest and a parade? You know a protest is *supposed* to cause a disturbance and to disrupt normal everyday life, right? That's kinda the whole point, otherwise a protest would never be treated seriously by those in power.

Most companies couldn't give less of a shit about pushing technology forward and making a better world, they'll just do whatever nets them the most money for the least expense.
1306906269882765312 2020-09-18 18:41:50 +0800 <Liseran23> @Morelion_Mor @JayExci Citation needed, and a citation that involves people actually part of the movement, not just random opportunists
1306811874709835776 2020-09-18 12:26:44 +0800 <Liseran23> @MarkMaddenX @tmorello Taking aim at the actual issues that cause crime instead of relying on a mostly reactive form of stopping crime. Stuff like decriminalizing drugs, providing better education, providing better job opportunities for poorer people, providing mental health treatment to those in need

1306462536531873792 2020-09-17 13:18:36 +0800 <Liseran23> @MeynethMonado @CursedBoomers that money's taken just to fatten the wallet of the mother. Important distinction between the two, don't you think?
1306462362728308736 2020-09-17 13:17:54 +0800 <Liseran23> @MeynethMonado @CursedBoomers Well if she's supposed to represent the government taking some money through taxes, then it's also important to include the part where those taxes go to something that they and their sibling both benefit from, like paying for better food or funds for a trip, whereas in capitalism

Then she‚Äôd tell the child that if she works hard enough she‚Äôll make it some day, all while taking most of the money that the child earns.

1305644491504746497 2020-09-15 07:07:59 +0800 <Liseran23> @WayneVinson5 @Somdayoftheweek @PinkWug @VaushV It was one example of several, just to show how the proud boys explicitly calls for violence. You're hyper-focusing on it and acting like it's my sole argument.
1305644147026669569 2020-09-15 07:06:37 +0800 <Liseran23> @SaturnVRockets @PinkWug @BreadPanes I don't like Zionism either. What does that have to do with BLM protests? Unless you're an anti-semitic conspiracy nut, in which case there's no point talking to somebody who lives in their own made up fantasy world.

1305641722580525063 2020-09-15 06:56:58 +0800 <Liseran23> @SaturnVRockets @PinkWug @BreadPanes You know I meant it in regards to political violence. You can try to weasel your way out of the truth, but at the end of the day, right wing motivated violence kills a lot more than left wing motivated violence.

However, I won't let you pivot like that.

And there‚Äôs a difference between going on a show with a huge amount of viewers and a host known to agree with guests for the most part, and hanging out with a large number of far right figures.

Also Joe Rogan is kinda infamous for nodding along and agreeing with certain right wing figures, albeit he does push back sometimes.

The only evidence of that is him *saying* that he is. FFS, most of the videos he makes are about Trump "DESTROYING THE DEMOCRATS" and "the far left destroying america"

I'm not saying that if you get off to loli porn then that means you're gonna go on a spree of molesting children. I'm saying it makes you a pedophile and you should probably see a therapist.
1305257011676876805 2020-09-14 05:28:16 +0800 <Liseran23> @KitzuneOtacu @nomadicgoose @XanderhalTV And again, you drew a false equivalency. The reason people like loli porn is because they find the lolis attractive. Nobody plays CS:GO because they want to be terrorists and hold people hostage.
1305256567500140549 2020-09-14 05:26:30 +0800 <Liseran23> @KitzuneOtacu @nomadicgoose @XanderhalTV Why are you bringing law into this? I wasn't arguing law. I'm not saying loli is illegal or should be illegal. It should actually stay legal, because it's a way for pedos to handle urges if they can't do so on their own. I'm saying enjoying loli porn makes you a pedophile.
1305252328551874565 2020-09-14 05:09:40 +0800 <Liseran23> @KitzuneOtacu @nomadicgoose @XanderhalTV The violence in CS:GO isn't the reason why people play it, whereas the children in loli porn are the reason why pedos get off to it.
1305252101971472384 2020-09-14 05:08:46 +0800 <Liseran23> @KitzuneOtacu @nomadicgoose @XanderhalTV Who plays CS:GO because they want to shoot people and plant bombs? Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't people play CS:GO because of, you know, the gameplay? The tactics and the skill involved? Whereas with loli you're jacking it because you find the child attractive.
1305240955075821569 2020-09-14 04:24:28 +0800 <Liseran23> @KitzuneOtacu @nomadicgoose @XanderhalTV Making that distinction is so weird because we don't try to make it with anything else. If jacking to lolis doesn't make you a pedo, then jacking to anime men doesn't make you gay, and jacking to anime feet fetish porn doesn't mean you have a foot fetish
1305208511815659522 2020-09-14 02:15:33 +0800 <Liseran23> @AimbotAimy I mean they're just saying that there's no proof it was extremists that started them, not that nobody at all had started the fires.

People who adamantly defend loli are def just in denial

1303390559411806210 2020-09-09 01:51:39 +0800 <Liseran23> @MouthyInfidel Imagine thinking any one person can speak on behalf of minorities as if they're some kind of monolith and a diverse group of people with differing ideas and opinions

1303370110023987202 2020-09-09 00:30:24 +0800 <Liseran23> @red_baiting @lostiridescence I guess, but like... then that means liberals should also be judged harshly when joining the left because liberalism kills people, and socialists who used to be socdems should also be judged harshly because social democracies also take advantage of and kill people.
1303369434137067524 2020-09-09 00:27:43 +0800 <Liseran23> @lostiridescence @red_baiting They were caught up in the rhetoric but they broke free. Isn't that a good thing? Don't you WANT fascists to stop being fascists?
1303369195846066177 2020-09-09 00:26:46 +0800 <Liseran23> @lostiridescence Why are you immediately jumping to Nazi accusations? You know there's more to the right wing than JUST Nazis, right? You're acting like the stereotypical 2015 SJW strawman
1303368661198143496 2020-09-09 00:24:38 +0800 <Liseran23> @lostiridescence @red_baiting I mean I haven't seen a lot of ex reactionaries who bought into the JQ or anything
1303368410311675904 2020-09-09 00:23:39 +0800 <Liseran23> @lostiridescence @red_baiting Wh... when did they "commit violence against marginalized people"... they were people who got caught up in the rise of fascism and right wing rhetoric, I don't think any of them were proud boys or anything
1303368024481816576 2020-09-09 00:22:07 +0800 <Liseran23> @red_baiting @lostiridescence I guess that's fair, yeah.
1303367746219061248 2020-09-09 00:21:00 +0800 <Liseran23> @red_baiting Critical about what? What are your criticism other than they used to be reactionaries, because that alone isn't enough to be considered solid criticism
1303367400075784193 2020-09-09 00:19:38 +0800 <Liseran23> @red_baiting @lostiridescence My bad, I've seen people cast doubt on the legitimacy of those claiming to be leftists. And I don't really see anybody "questioning their loyalty" towards leftism, just them talking about how it's kinda toxic to denounce people just because they used to be reactionary
1303366883572436995 2020-09-09 00:17:35 +0800 <Liseran23> @red_baiting You can be critical about ex reactionaries if you feel like there's something that points to them pretending or having old reactionary tendencies, but them being reactionary in the past alone is not enough to condemn them.
1303366441337524226 2020-09-09 00:15:49 +0800 <Liseran23> @lostiridescence @red_baiting The quotes around "used to be" make it clear to me that you think that people who went from right wing to left wing aren't *actually* leftists and are just pretending. You aren't helping the spread of leftism by trying to gatekeep it.
1303365927027826688 2020-09-09 00:13:47 +0800 <Liseran23> @red_baiting It isn't really even taking it personal though, is it? It's just saying that exclusionary leftists who try to gatekeep leftism as if it's some kind of fandom and not a political belief are harmful to radicalizing people and there needs to be something to counteract that
1303359216493768705 2020-09-08 23:47:07 +0800 <Liseran23> @red_baiting Treating people who've been deradicalized from the right and radicalized to the left with disdain and disgust only leads to more infighting and discourages people who could be radicalized from joining the left, which isn't what we need when fascism is on the rise
1303358672211521536 2020-09-08 23:44:57 +0800 <Liseran23> @red_baiting I have seen people saying things that boil down to "You used to be a right winger so actually I don't care about you and you're awful, fuck you." And yeah, leftists have killed other leftists, and maybe something to keep that from happening again is to not fight over petty shit?
1303357311218577409 2020-09-08 23:39:32 +0800 <Liseran23> @red_baiting What criticism are they even being given? That they used to be reactionaries? As if they don't know that, regret that, and have grown from that? There's no criticism there it's just saying "You used to be on the right? Heh, then how can you be a leftist now?"
1303355757992255489 2020-09-08 23:33:22 +0800 <Liseran23> @CutieHannyah i wouldn't doubt it
1303355518707171329 2020-09-08 23:32:25 +0800 <Liseran23> @red_baiting Saying "You used to be a conservative? And now you're a leftist? You're still bad!" isn't a "criticism". You're pulling the same card as the reactionary types who just kinda shit on a person and when they get backlash they just say "Heh, guess you can't handle criticism"

1303296465004040192 2020-09-08 19:37:45 +0800 <Liseran23> @scum1999 That second image completely misuses the paradox of tolerance. The paradox only comes into play when the intolerant argue in bad faith or denounce arguing in general, and is to only be used by regular people, not any government institution.

1302784597462257664 2020-09-07 09:43:47 +0800 <Liseran23> @CosmoJames @LivingScribe I mean unless you're saying that feminism is a left only thing, I don't see how she'd be left. She's a critique of white supremacy using attractive looks and the aesthetic of free thinking to draw people in on social media.
1302780035787640832 2020-09-07 09:25:39 +0800 <Liseran23> @CosmoJames @LivingScribe She's literally based on how the alt-right rabbit hole uses female media figures to draw people into white supremacy lmao
1302778030914441217 2020-09-07 09:17:41 +0800 <Liseran23> @DancingPepes2 @LivingScribe He's not literal Stillwell. With TV Stillwell they flipped the father-figure dynamic on its head and made Stillwell a woman and gave her and Homelander a weird mother-figure as well as sexual dynamic instead.
1302736331710308353 2020-09-07 06:31:59 +0800 <Liseran23> @TwitmoWolf @marwilliamson Biden isn't fear mongering about invading minorities and isn't the subject of a conspiracy theory about the "deep state" trying to stop him. America is in a really bad place, but the first step to getting it out of that is to get a fascist out of the highest position of authority
1302731462341468169 2020-09-07 06:12:38 +0800 <Liseran23> @TwitmoWolf @marwilliamson It would delay fascism, because the alternative is already fascist.

1302684084653690880 2020-09-07 03:04:23 +0800 <Liseran23> @WyvernFren @ms_pigtails Related to the term Bourgeois, which is meant to refer to the upper-middle/upper class. Tankies are dumb and think that any amount of nice things in the richest country in the world makes you bourgeois and therefore an enemy.
1302683066616479745 2020-09-07 03:00:20 +0800 <Liseran23> @ms_pigtails The weird leftists who think enjoying anything slightly nice instantly makes you part of the bourgeois are so stupid. Like that time a 20 dollar charcuterie board was apparently a "bourgeois" thing.

1301325664096858112 2020-09-03 09:06:30 +0800 <Liseran23> @PunishedMelanie Guns are meant to be a way for the working class to protect themselves and revolt when the time is right. I don‚Äôt think the current state of gun laws is perfect, but I also think focusing on guns is shortsighted and ignores the actual causes of gun violence.
1301303251418206208 2020-09-03 07:37:26 +0800 <Liseran23> @SamAdlerBell Guns are an important tool in protecting and fighting for the working class. However, just like all tools, you need understanding and tact to use them correctly. Most anti-gun talking points I‚Äôve seen have blamed guns for stuff that‚Äôs better solved by fixing the system.

There‚Äôs no point in arguing with someone who‚Äôs bad faith enough to just talk about how it‚Äôs ‚Äúoh so sinful‚Äù to be a communist. You‚Äôre clearly not even trying to be logical.

1301259560259391489 2020-09-03 04:43:50 +0800 <Liseran23> @CptConundrum20 about powerful enemies is that, the more powerful they are, the harder they are to get rid of. Crazy, I know. Didn't think you'd be able to grasp that one.
1301259288770416640 2020-09-03 04:42:45 +0800 <Liseran23> @CptConundrum20 Because of the authoritarianism and China not being the one to fight in a ton of proxy wars. Along with the US generally having stopped most of its production, with most of that essential production having been moved to China, and China's growth as a world power. The funny thing

1301257872001638400 2020-09-03 04:37:07 +0800 <Liseran23> @CptConundrum20 Because the system itself is very much a promising one. Giving workers the ability to govern themselves and providing for the needs of your citizens is very much an object of aspiration. I don‚Äôt see why you should drop the idea entirely because one strong enough nation doesn‚Äôt
1301256811698434049 2020-09-03 04:32:54 +0800 <Liseran23> @CptConundrum20 Then I guess we‚Äôll see in 2030 where you‚Äôll be saying the exact same thing üòâ
1301256132023980032 2020-09-03 04:30:12 +0800 <Liseran23> @CptConundrum20 We can see the clear issue, which is foreign interference. You‚Äôre looking at a murder victim and the murderer with the smoking gun and blaming the victim here.

And of course, still haven‚Äôt addressed the big issue, which is American interference done in order to disrupt socialist states, or pretty much any state that doesn‚Äôt particularly serve America‚Äôs interests.
1301255426990911489 2020-09-03 04:27:24 +0800 <Liseran23> @CptConundrum20 I will admit that Yugoslavia had an issue of a cult of personality practically holding the nation together, though that‚Äôs more down to the long-time hatred between the different nationalities of the balkans. You dismiss Rojava because it‚Äôs within a failed state, but just being

1301253971072425984 2020-09-03 04:21:37 +0800 <Liseran23> @CptConundrum20 Places like Yugoslavia and Rojava have both instituted different forms of socialism. It‚Äôs hard for socialist states to get very big, of course, because certain large powers in the western world just love to destabilize and fund counterrevolutionaries within states that might
1301252100647727106 2020-09-03 04:14:11 +0800 <Liseran23> @CptConundrum20 No, it‚Äôs just saying it‚Äôs incredibly myopic and bad faith to discredit an entire ideology off of a single derivative. Would you lampoon the entirety of Christianity off of issues with the Mormon Church? No, because that‚Äôd be stupid.
1301251164990734336 2020-09-03 04:10:28 +0800 <Liseran23> @CptConundrum20 @marv_alice @shoe0nhead @GreenwoodOutlaw You blame Marx for many of the issues with socialist states we‚Äôve seen, but that ignores the impact of Lenin, and Stalin‚Äôs subsequent frankenstein that was Marxism-Leninism, which has been the foundation for many failed socialist states.
1301250120667758595 2020-09-03 04:06:19 +0800 <Liseran23> @CptConundrum20 @marv_alice @shoe0nhead @GreenwoodOutlaw the idea of peaceful protests. It‚Äôs clear as day you‚Äôre using one bad thing about Marx to discredit his ideas, which kinda makes you hypocritical. Unless, of course, you also believe we shouldn‚Äôt cite the founding fathers on anything because ‚Äúthey aren‚Äôt moral authorities‚Äù? Hmm?

That‚Äôs exactly why I brought up MLK and Gandhi. They‚Äôre not perfectly moral beings and aren‚Äôt moral authorities, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll catch you using that to dismiss
1301248682008944640 2020-09-03 04:00:36 +0800 <Liseran23> @ellymelly @BenjaminPDixon Why do you think a system wherein people born into wealth can quiet easily become a petty dictator in an autocratic workplace structure and influence the political system to support their business is, in fact, a democracy?

If you aren‚Äôt antisemitic then it affects nothing about communism as a greater whole. You just want an easy excuse to say ‚ÄúCommies bad‚Äù.
