1344044357884772353 2020-12-30 06:15:20 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @CREWcrew the only diversity in trump's admin is the diversity of the crimes they commit. i say call it #TrumpGate

1343976914361458688 2020-12-30 01:47:20 +0800 <kittyclinton2> how could we have fallen so far to name a prolific sexual predator, a multiple rapist, as the most admired man in america?

1343791186289553408 2020-12-29 13:29:19 +0800 <kittyclinton2> will @senatemajldr and the @SenateGOP vote for higher survival checks or a higher death toll? or will he let it sit on his desk until time runs out on 1/3?

1343775423570841600 2020-12-29 12:26:41 +0800 <kittyclinton2> PTSD is sad and horrible, but it doesn't automatically make this guy safer to be around. he needs to be locked up.
1343775008666116097 2020-12-29 12:25:02 +0800 <kittyclinton2> white supremacy? i don't see it
1343773475417284608 2020-12-29 12:18:57 +0800 <kittyclinton2> it's going to take months to repair the damage inflicted on numerous federal  agencies by @realDonaldTrump's incompetence. years and years to restore trust with our allies. i don't even trust us not too put another trump-like fascist in office again. how can they?
1343770280427184130 2020-12-29 12:06:15 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @LovesTiki2 i'm so sorry for your loss. love, hugs and prayers to you and your family.
1343768467078590465 2020-12-29 11:59:03 +0800 <kittyclinton2> the murderer declined to appear in court. at least they fired him very soon into the investigation. this is disgusting and heartbreaking. i look forward to him going to prison. what made the shooting even worse was the "cop" refused to offer first aid.    https://t.co/RL5nmrc56c
1343765385645010944 2020-12-29 11:46:48 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @ArianaDMichaels do a gofundme. that's how it's done here in the good ol' USA under the @GOP
1343764741236404228 2020-12-29 11:44:14 +0800 <kittyclinton2> soldiers need frequent, periodic psych evals. and routine ongoing group therapy. cut funding of the military refuses. remember the 12 or so domestic murders after soldiers returned from the first gulf war? or those soldiers after returning from vietnam? they were in horrific pain
1343761840929714179 2020-12-29 11:32:43 +0800 <kittyclinton2> 544 hours until @realDonaldTrump loses immunity from prosecution.
1343758910050750470 2020-12-29 11:21:04 +0800 <kittyclinton2> curious to see if the @SenateGOP that supported @realDonaldTrump through numerous rape and sexual assault allegations, torturing refugee children, extorsion of foreign powers, ignoring multiple attacks from russia will balk when it comes to helping americans survive covid.
1343756169731584001 2020-12-29 11:10:11 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump more likely the @SenateGOP will vote for adding to the death toll and not the stimulus checks. and you and i both know voting to remove sec 230 sends it back to congress and you'll volley back and forth until 1/5
1343755418070364160 2020-12-29 11:07:12 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @dremilyportermd have you tried calling your congressperson or senator? i'd do it and remind them of what trump said
1343750068449517570 2020-12-29 10:45:56 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @AymanM every bomber is a terrorist. he's a white american domestic terrorist
1343748632227565574 2020-12-29 10:40:14 +0800 <kittyclinton2> .@VP mike pence will wear that @realDonaldTrump stench the rest of his life. i will make sure of it. i hope you'll join me

1343738670449389568 2020-12-29 10:00:39 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @fireman452a thank you france!!!!!!!!!
1343738469944799233 2020-12-29 09:59:51 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @GOPChairwoman hunger and desperation lead to increased crime. i think it's more likely due to trump's failure to manage the covid crisis. mayor bottoms is a better person, a better leader, than you'll ever be
1343736622483972104 2020-12-29 09:52:30 +0800 <kittyclinton2> share to name and shame a bigot. i doubt george floyd even knew the money was counterfeit. if he did, death is not the usual penalty

1343726774665048070 2020-12-29 09:13:22 +0800 <kittyclinton2> i'm thinking far more will buy winter coats and food with the rest going to pay utility bills and rent/mortgage. the rich are the ones w/savings
1343726262691500034 2020-12-29 09:11:20 +0800 <kittyclinton2> will mitch basically deliver the death penalty to struggling americans or the life saving $2000?

1342492819290730498 2020-12-25 23:30:05 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @SeanFlan45 @RawStory just to confirm it. some people refuse the obvious unless a professional confirms it. too many will still think it's "fake news." trump inoculated them well against the truth
1342492392956559360 2020-12-25 23:28:23 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @Jeff66923777 @cbeidson even my trumpy brother and sister and their families are staying home.
1342491405822910466 2020-12-25 23:24:28 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @svdate what's the probability he's making a run for it? i read somewhere the trump plane was in FL.
1342490766791340033 2020-12-25 23:21:55 +0800 <kittyclinton2> consider donating to utility company funds also. some utility companies have funds you can donate to to help needy families. churches limit the help they give
1342487688738451459 2020-12-25 23:09:41 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @Breaking911 are those gun shots or just noises from the fire following the explosion?
1342487345539518464 2020-12-25 23:08:20 +0800 <kittyclinton2> throwing kids in cages, doing nothing about putin putting bounties on our troops, corruption and covering up criminal acts, 25,000+ lies didn't turn the @GOP against trump, but returning $2000 to tax payers in need was the one thing that did it. very telling
1342485466864644100 2020-12-25 23:00:52 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @rob_willeford @cbeidson i am so sorry. that is a lot of heartache to bear. sending love hugs and prayers to you and your family
1342485114102697984 2020-12-25 22:59:28 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @jjbanzer @USATODAY true evil is killing hundreds of thousands needlessly and creating an economy where millions of families are going hungry, unemployed and too many being evicted because he chose to ignore a pandemic. he wasn't up for the job. i hope he has a lousy christmas
1342479932757331968 2020-12-25 22:38:52 +0800 <kittyclinton2> weird how the @GOP sees this as a problem. and it isn't make rich people poorer, it just makes them less rich. phrasing it the way pence does makes it seem the rich will starve. they already have more money than they could spend in a lifetime.
1342476539531845633 2020-12-25 22:25:23 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @fireman452a his participation in the degradation of a scif should be enough to disbar any lawyer.

1342472736543793154 2020-12-25 22:10:16 +0800 <kittyclinton2> he sent it to his sister on the day of her nephew's engagement party. she raised the nephew and he was more like a son. that makes it 10x worse as if it wasn't horrid already

1342461824046931968 2020-12-25 21:26:55 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @TonyShnark i think so. because the current unwritten principles of the GOP require you be cruel, callous, unprincipled and soulless in order to support or carry them out

1342333399013478401 2020-12-25 12:56:36 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @emptywheel whomever takes the AG position, they'll need a special council to investigate trump, the congress people and senators that helped him commit and cover up crimes. and hopefully prosecute them all
1342331815604973568 2020-12-25 12:50:18 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @Cleavon_MD all these people. trump is such a monster
1342330118740570112 2020-12-25 12:43:34 +0800 <kittyclinton2> i'm thinking those 800+ that did not attend one of their big parties still don't regret turning them down

1342239290332504064 2020-12-25 06:42:39 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @donwinslow i doubt any politicians would look into why mcconnell keeps winning w/such low approval ratings, but i hope some industrious investigative reporters will. i believe he's buying votes with cash
1342231362963693569 2020-12-25 06:11:09 +0800 <kittyclinton2> #DefundThePolice is the worst/least descriptive hashtag of police reform. i hope we come up with something better. but i'm at a loss
1342228709592461312 2020-12-25 06:00:36 +0800 <kittyclinton2> the best comparison to republicans now standing up to trump is the rich entitled assholes on the titanic jumping the line to get a seat on a life boat.   remember, they took the place of children traveling in steerage

1340072141065216001 2020-12-19 07:11:10 +0800 <kittyclinton2> the greatest insult to american democracy was the day the @SenateGOP refused to protect democracy and remove @realDonaldTrump.    https://t.co/8RnWhBeN5z

1340057071627227137 2020-12-19 06:11:17 +0800 <kittyclinton2> some article written in a newspaper made trump mad, so he stopped the pentagon from participating in the transition.  @realDonaldTrump is a crybaby. i can't wait for normal, mature people get into the @WhiteHouse #CryBabyTrump

1338867063973036032 2020-12-15 23:22:37 +0800 <kittyclinton2> trump promised to run the US like he does his business and here we are. one promise kept
1338866458458132481 2020-12-15 23:20:13 +0800 <kittyclinton2> we shouldn't get complacent. i think the only reason we've gotten this far is because a lot of these people are incompetent.

1337119533174284288 2020-12-11 03:38:33 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @Coblog2 lol! it's obviously marco making a joke. look who's on the advisory board  https://t.co/otZpFmoRZH
1337119072480276481 2020-12-11 03:36:44 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @marcorubio interesting to see who the advisory board on this ripon society are. these are pro trump republicans trying to redeem themselves by claiming they're changing. they've had ample opportunity to show who they are.  https://t.co/otZpFmoRZH
1337117429764337664 2020-12-11 03:30:12 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @marcorubio if you are republican and want to follow republicans w/principles, look into this group.  https://t.co/Syj0JPjh93
1337116161306206213 2020-12-11 03:25:09 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @marcorubio there are good people trying to do just that. if you're invited to join them, my opinion will change greatly. you'll wear that 300 pound trump anchor until and after you reach rock bottom
1337114337165635589 2020-12-11 03:17:55 +0800 <kittyclinton2> seriously KY. let us know why you repeatedly vote for these guys and we'll see if there is something we can do to help so you aren't trapped in this cycle anymore

1337091778470621184 2020-12-11 01:48:16 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @GiseleDubson @Julius_Kim there is a group trying to restart the rep. party from scratch. miles taylor, michael steel, james comey are just a few. they  had their own convention. i think they'll do a good job. i'm not conservative, but i believe competition toward similar goals makes both sides stronger
1337089468491292673 2020-12-11 01:39:05 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @SecPompeo why would uganda think you credible while you support trump and all his works?
1337088532314263556 2020-12-11 01:35:22 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @Julius_Kim trump and republican are used synonymously, but they aren't. trumpism has no principles found in the old republican party. there are liberals, conservatives and trumpists
1337087038495940608 2020-12-11 01:29:26 +0800 <kittyclinton2> we need to start the fight to win these seats in 2022, today. donate monthly to  https://t.co/5CtzhzD1Px

1337058987959791623 2020-12-10 23:37:58 +0800 <kittyclinton2> we need a trump crimes commission that roots out crimes and corruption in the trump administration and those around him. ending with charges, prosecution and appropriate punishment. and looking into the legality of pardons trump has and will gift to co conspirators
1337057202318807042 2020-12-10 23:30:53 +0800 <kittyclinton2> in a summary of one guy they're putting to death, who was just an accomplice at most and it looks like the guy got the idea of a trial, but did not get an actual one. it's horrible.

1337052566782406660 2020-12-10 23:12:27 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @realDonaldTrump that's right. @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris have both wisdom and courage. i'm surprised you could identify characteristics so foreign to you.
1337051664352686087 2020-12-10 23:08:52 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @realDonaldTrump i agree. which is why @HillaryClinton should be looking forward to her second term today.

1336778344432623619 2020-12-10 05:02:48 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @realDonaldTrump i don't really care if you ever admit you lost. it's your own people you're grifting. just know you are responsible for any violence that comes from this BS. i for one will name you in any lawsuits i need to file. also just be out by noon 1/20. sooner would be better.

1336727763412275206 2020-12-10 01:41:48 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @d1Vinman no. but if they are true to form--stupid, lazy and easily bored, they'll go out, prance around with their guns and if there is no one to engage in violence or another group to blame the violence on, they'll just go home. they've done just that several times
1336725808019369984 2020-12-10 01:34:02 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @rickhasen he knows he lost. he's only doing this so he can channel money into his pocket, fundraising for "stop the steal." as soon as this door closes, he'll announce he's running in 2024 and start fundraising for his campaign. he raised $1B for 2020 and didn't pay his bills. where is it?
1336724591629242370 2020-12-10 01:29:12 +0800 <kittyclinton2> this is getting out of hand. @GOP these are your monsters. rein them in.

1336706624581480450 2020-12-10 00:17:48 +0800 <kittyclinton2> it's a new day. the media needs to re adapt. no more low brow BS. it's time to raise everyone up, including trumpers. start with defining what is actually news and what are schoolyard bully tactics targeting a small audience.
1336703882660098048 2020-12-10 00:06:55 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @GOPLeader not nearly as much as death does. if you idiots had encouraged masks, distancing and conducted testing and tracking as suggested, we wouldn't be here needing lockdowns to prevent a massive number of deaths and overwhelming our health care facilities. this is on you.

1336691305687232512 2020-12-09 23:16:56 +0800 <kittyclinton2> unacceptable @senatemajldr. do better. we not only pay taxes, but we're having to keep charities and food banks a float. airline share holders spent a lot buying back stock prior to the first round. let them use their own money this time. the people and sm. businesses need it
1336688492261367810 2020-12-09 23:05:45 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @NicolasEdny "racism" from the left comes from lack of knowledge &amp; understanding. most of us are doing what we can to remedy that. the right's racism stems from fear. they've been told they're superior all their life and they can clearly see they aren't. that realization turns fear into hate

1336686339341869056 2020-12-09 22:57:12 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @LeaKThompson i've always suggested if you work outside the home, shop, etc, remove clothing in garage, mudroom or just inside the door. shower/wash clothes immediately. wipe down or wash shoes. if you're talking about quarantining w/ your clothes, they should be good as soon as you are

1336674010185289729 2020-12-09 22:08:12 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @politico trump will throw his hat in the ring in order to be able to collect funds. i doubt seriously he'll want the job after loopholes allowing him to scam people and commit other crimes are closed

1336671200660107267 2020-12-09 21:57:03 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @kateneuropsych what i've observed are trumpers are stupid and lazy. they'll march around with their weapons and if no one engages, they get bored and go home. their "war" has no merit and can't survive if no one fuels it. their pathology needs to be dealt with, but this is not the way.
1336669495943892993 2020-12-09 21:50:16 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @kateneuropsych you're behavior is quite bizarre for a dr. of nuropsych. normal people ask questions, not attack w/o cause.
1336668367659393026 2020-12-09 21:45:47 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @kateneuropsych no. i'm really surprised you even came to that conclusion

1336651548580044801 2020-12-09 20:38:57 +0800 <kittyclinton2> these anti maskers and all like them are the reason so many are dying. they carry the full responsibility for the devastated economy.

1336646704049876992 2020-12-09 20:19:42 +0800 <kittyclinton2> that would teach him
1336645836122578944 2020-12-09 20:16:15 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @NikkiMcR or, they released the in person voting first as is routine, then released mail in ballot tallies in batches as they were counted. trump told his cult voting by mail was bad, so they voted in person. the rest of us used common sense and voted by mail if we could.

1336640717737832451 2020-12-09 19:55:55 +0800 <kittyclinton2> if trumpers want civil war, remember, we are under no obligation to participate or even acknowledge their "war" any further than reporting violent or illegal activities to authorities. don't fuel their stupidity.

1336622124157505536 2020-12-09 18:42:02 +0800 <kittyclinton2> white male privilege is over. you need to make your peace with that. it's a really good thing.

1336489244534206464 2020-12-09 09:54:01 +0800 <kittyclinton2> if trump refuses to budget for the next phase, everything will stall. trump is that vindictive. i hope congress can find the funding somewhere. we'll be working from trump's budget for the first year.

1336463501867577344 2020-12-09 08:11:43 +0800 <kittyclinton2> trump refused multiple offers of more vaccine doses because he wanted herd immunity. now we won't have enough for a long time. some vaccines that require multiple doses need to be given in a set period of time or you have to start over. covid takes 2 doses.

1332746930888302592 2020-11-29 02:03:24 +0800 <kittyclinton2> #MAGAts "socialism" is like a giant gofundme account. everybody puts in a little so they can help those that need it.  i'm not sure why that's scary. it's not unlike the system we have now. only now the taxes collected will go to those that need it, not to those that don't

1331978513075892225 2020-11-26 23:09:59 +0800 <kittyclinton2> if you're looking for a place to worship, choose one that cares enough about their community and congregants to maintain covid precautions according to public health officials regardless of the deadly ruling from SCOTUS.
1331977766972108801 2020-11-26 23:07:01 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @Susan_Hennessey one pastor said they would continue the precautions until it was safe to do otherwise--regardless of the ruling. i hope other churches care about their congregants and their community and will choose to do the same.

1331868496968486913 2020-11-26 15:52:49 +0800 <kittyclinton2> powell released the kraken...sort of. @glennkirschner2 what say you? this looks like nonsense to me, but i'm not a lawyer. the misspellings and grammatical errors are embarrassing.   https://t.co/nH3loqyo9G
1331867830871011328 2020-11-26 15:50:10 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @supadeano @realhomomarcus @realDonaldTrump right now it's state. barr is trying to make the civil rape-related case against trump, a federal case. i think he'll try to do the same thing w/rittenhouse and the cop that murdered george floyd.
1331866710094336000 2020-11-26 15:45:43 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @GregStohr i'm really upset about this ruling. people can worship safely in their homes and not put people's lives in danger during a deadly pandemic. every sane/caring person in this country is making sacrifices to keep hospitals from crashing. disgusting.
1331865445918502912 2020-11-26 15:40:41 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @ladyzelda035 @VillarrealEsmy does this mean she is only licensed in TX? because she's filling in states, not TX.

1331862180761915392 2020-11-26 15:27:43 +0800 <kittyclinton2> .@ACLU  what kind of BS is this? they can worship safety in their homes without putting others lives in danger. i hope any infection/death that occurs because of this nonsense is followed with a massive wrongful death suit.  https://t.co/dhYee6mMxj
1331860094498328578 2020-11-26 15:19:25 +0800 <kittyclinton2> .@Scotus this is a really bad decision. my right to life trumps their right to congregate in a church during a deadly pandemic. if they believe, they know they can worship anywhere. very telling only the "pro lifers" voted to allow worshippers to kill others. reverse it!
1331858321435975688 2020-11-26 15:12:23 +0800 <kittyclinton2> i am extremely angry about this. people are making sacrifices, hospitals all over the country are either overwhelmed or soon to be and this faux "pro life" bunch thinks it's ok for catholics and christians to kill in the name of their religion. some needs to sue. @aclu
1331857341600378880 2020-11-26 15:08:29 +0800 <kittyclinton2> i have no doubt they'll be invited back. the rich ivanka hung out with likely don't consider tax fraud and cruelty to the poor as crimes
1331856033623502853 2020-11-26 15:03:17 +0800 <kittyclinton2> curious to know if this is where trump would need to be tried for his multiple crimes against humanity
1331852351154556929 2020-11-26 14:48:39 +0800 <kittyclinton2> apparently SCOTUS thinks just because you're in a church, you're protected from covid. these religious fascists are going to get people killed.
1331851401304084481 2020-11-26 14:44:53 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @profchandIer looking back there is. flynn lying started a chain of reactions from trump and others leading to the need for mueller. had he not lied, most everything else would probably not have occurred. that's according to andrew mccabe
1331849099134574593 2020-11-26 14:35:44 +0800 <kittyclinton2> andrew mccabe said if flynn had not lied to the FBI about talking to the russians, matters would have been closed and the mueller investigation likely would not have happened

1331845501126381568 2020-11-26 14:21:26 +0800 <kittyclinton2> i think trump will have barr make kyle rittenhouse and george floyd's murderer fed. cases and he'll pardon them. he's already trying this on his own rape related case.
1331844931166605313 2020-11-26 14:19:10 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @realhomomarcus @realDonaldTrump he'll do it. there's no question. she knows too much about trump and many others. i think he'll not only pardon anyone that can flip on him, but he'll pardon someone like kyle rittenhouse and the cops that murdered george floyd. he'll get barr to make them fed. cases.

1331399241495883777 2020-11-25 08:48:10 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @politicalnative it was for arpaio. i think you have to at least be charged w/a crime
1331398983210688513 2020-11-25 08:47:08 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @SocialPowerOne1 of all the institutional racism, this is the worst. how can anyone rob a child of a chance?
1331398558671663105 2020-11-25 08:45:27 +0800 <kittyclinton2> if you want vaccinations to go smoothly, states will need federal funding. to get that funding, we need to make mitch mcconnell irrelevant. support @ossof and @ReverendWarnock's efforts in winning GA senate seats.

1331324168298754048 2020-11-25 03:49:51 +0800 <kittyclinton2> i recently saw a chart that showed POC living in poverty are so much more affected by covid. it was disturbing.  does anyone know if there are organizations insuring people in low income areas at least have masks?
1331322104000749570 2020-11-25 03:41:39 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @choz51 @GovAbbott absolutely. we had so much time to prepare and isolate those initial infections. most all of this was preventable.

1331283486842433537 2020-11-25 01:08:11 +0800 <kittyclinton2> i think the USA should go last--except our frontline and essential workers, because we've done next to nothing to contain this virus. other countries made sacrifices and followed guidelines.  and when it comes to the US, those states w/mandated covid restrictions are first.
1331281807631933444 2020-11-25 01:01:31 +0800 <kittyclinton2> wear a mask, please.
1331272516497780750 2020-11-25 00:24:36 +0800 <kittyclinton2> anti maskers are preventing us from spending time with our friends and families and causing our hospitals to be over run. they must be held accountable.

1331265340328841220 2020-11-24 23:56:05 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @KatWebheart as long as mask mandates, etc. followed. otherwise they only help for a short time. but if anti maskers force us to have to do extreme measures to save lives and decrease the demand on hospitals i think we should do it.
1331258314798272513 2020-11-24 23:28:10 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @INTLmischief i think it's an excellent idea

1331144110879682560 2020-11-24 15:54:22 +0800 <kittyclinton2> no doubt trump will declare he's running so he can legally raise funds which he will skim and pocket. he raised $1B for this 2020 run but can't say where it went

1329843872520925186 2020-11-21 01:47:41 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @AmbJohnBolton i would have come to their defense had they turned down the invite. now as far as i'm concerned, they've ended their own careers. no mercy. we'll never know exactly what went on in those meetings
1329842976953131014 2020-11-21 01:44:07 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @robertjdenault in 2016 intel agencies were telling us russia was intruding in our election and they did not know if putin could change votes. in 2020 we were told it was the most secure election in our history. yet repubs refused to look into 2016 and demand investigations into 2020
1329838436539305984 2020-11-21 01:26:05 +0800 <kittyclinton2> worth the time. you'll feel so much better

1329822963512782855 2020-11-21 00:24:36 +0800 <kittyclinton2> .@GeraldoRivera wants to name the covid vaccine after trump--the man whose name is synonymous with hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths from covid.  i'm thinking it's a bad idea. you?
1329822149998239745 2020-11-21 00:21:22 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @politvidchannel trump has murdered 254,000 people so far. his name is synonymous with death. not good branding for a vaccine

1329803093761007616 2020-11-20 23:05:38 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @GOP .@FBI, this looks like wire fraud
1329802996625117186 2020-11-20 23:05:15 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @GOP we don't need to steal an election we won outright. i think this tweet is an example of wire fraud.

1329760958143746049 2020-11-20 20:18:12 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @nprpolitics people are dying from covid, going hungry, losing their homes, racism is emboldened, hate crimes are skyrocketing, healthcare is vanishing. this election is everything. the dems have got to take the senate.
1329759731909595136 2020-11-20 20:13:20 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @phyllisj1003 if they request it and there is ample reason--pain of cancer is one. not all pain responds to pain meds
1329759181180710914 2020-11-20 20:11:09 +0800 <kittyclinton2> investigating, exposing trump's crimes publicly and prosecuting him and his cronies will go a long way to restore our reputation as a nation of laws
1329747716151373825 2020-11-20 19:25:35 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @CeilieKayOGM my guess is it's close to 250,000
1329747417760141316 2020-11-20 19:24:24 +0800 <kittyclinton2> and it gives him time to destroy evidence and continue his cover ups as long as possible. a lot will be exposed as biden is briefed
1329745818694393856 2020-11-20 19:18:03 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @Scaramucci @RobertaD7777 i hope "wiped" in this context means arrested or imprisoned or something similar
1329745325104492545 2020-11-20 19:16:05 +0800 <kittyclinton2> people probably shouldn't do this kind of thing on parler. but, if you were to do something like this, what would it be?
1329740140403679233 2020-11-20 18:55:29 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @thomaskaine5 no. their victims deserve to be able to seek damages. we'll find another way. if they aren't prosecuted, they're likely to do it again. and others will expect the same
1329735468607475714 2020-11-20 18:36:55 +0800 <kittyclinton2> .@SpeakerPelosi since @senatemajldr refuses to pass the heroes act, continue the extra assistance w/UE benefits, etc., is there any way to help people keep their homes and utilities? maybe a gofundme through the dems? anything?
1329732664925048836 2020-11-20 18:25:47 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @marcorubio you embraced a cruel, racist con man and prolific sexual predator. no one in their right mind likes republicans.

1329727871653437442 2020-11-20 18:06:44 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @pjderenzo i got nothing.
1329725707514068992 2020-11-20 17:58:08 +0800 <kittyclinton2> trump was known as a cruel racist, con man and prolific sexual predator the minute he came down that escalator and republican voters embraced that.   some say they didn't know in the beginning, and changed their minds once they learned, they can be forgiven. the rest ??? idk.
1329723960443990021 2020-11-20 17:51:11 +0800 <kittyclinton2> if you're already not following, block him. if it's important, the news will report a truthful version. no need to give that psychopath an audience or platform

1329717311092174850 2020-11-20 17:24:46 +0800 <kittyclinton2> treason weighs heavily on some. i don't think it actually does for @GSAEmily or she'd do her job. she's trying to play the victim here. don't allow it.
1329716730801909760 2020-11-20 17:22:28 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @EthanLK2001 don't. let them make the first move. whenever i've reached out it just makes them more defensive and aggressive.
1329716401993560064 2020-11-20 17:21:09 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @mattgaetz @Amberdev4real that's right matt. we like criminals to be prosecuted and imprisoned. your party was for that until trump came along. or maybe before you paid your way out of 7 DUIs.
1329713962192154624 2020-11-20 17:11:28 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @marcorubio they report the news, they don't create it. you want better news coverage, do better newsworthy things. being truthful is a start. even republican voters are becoming better able to see through your BS

1329707063178563593 2020-11-20 16:44:03 +0800 <kittyclinton2> the irony is if trump had taken the virus seriously and stopped the spread, he'd have partially redeemed himself

1326301937336266753 2020-11-11 07:13:18 +0800 <kittyclinton2> if @realDonaldTrump attends the inauguration, he gets to see @HillaryClinton smiling and imagine she and everyone else in the entire world, minus white supremacists, are reveling in his loss and calling him a loser. and he would be right. he's too much of a coward to be there.

1326286027921690628 2020-11-11 06:10:04 +0800 <kittyclinton2> trump is starting to look like a stepping stone toward turning USA into an autocracy. if we don't start getting rid of this set of republicans, that s where we're headed.

1326021921822167041 2020-11-10 12:40:37 +0800 <kittyclinton2> why is the trump campaign now tasking our taxpayer resources to look into voter fraud while they're raising money to pay for it? that fundraising is a con and barr using our money for this is BS

1325666069424508928 2020-11-09 13:06:35 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @LincolnsBible i've been thinking along the same lines. it goes back further than that and i think there's a russian connection. in 1980 rudy became a republican. he proceeded to take down the mafia in NY, the russian mob filled the void. trump laundered for the mafia, then the russians. 1/2

1325639169436241920 2020-11-09 11:19:41 +0800 <kittyclinton2> this is an attempt to squeeze every last $ from his supporters. 60% is to go to pay campaign debts. he said he raised $1B so where did that money go? he can't concede because he'll have to stop this money grab or be charged w/wire fraud. he won't pay his debts or his lawyers.
1325638287659294720 2020-11-09 11:16:11 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @rob13567 a candidates campaign org. pays the bills. and he won't. i think it's a pretext to get more money. he also won't concede until he gets all he can with that bogus fundraising effort.

1324955761034883072 2020-11-07 14:04:04 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @intelligencer @Olivianuzzi it hasn't been a great experience for us either. and he can stop worrying about being arrested and start coming to terms with it. individual #1's accomplice was given 3 years. he should get a lot more, and that's just the beginning of what's coming. he hurt a lot of people.
1324954317527404545 2020-11-07 13:58:20 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @ReesusP @MauraRolls i wish there was more in depth native american history in school. actually every culture since we really are a melting pot
1324952115484168194 2020-11-07 13:49:35 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @samstein i;m guessing they owe a ton of money. anyone know how much?

1324951438817169408 2020-11-07 13:46:54 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @FPWellman @Coblog2 that's the difference. there are enough ballots left to count in every state that has yet to be called to swing the election. there was massive absentee voting this year

1324950902957092869 2020-11-07 13:44:46 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @donwinslow @jodeye11 trump wasting everybody else's time and money. if they made him pay for it, he wouldn't do it
1324950558009151492 2020-11-07 13:43:24 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @jaywhyelle no. i think it may be sunday before we know. they have until the 12th to receive or cure ballots postmarked or submitted on or before 11/3. so unless those are enough to change the outcome, we'll know by then
1324949915999621122 2020-11-07 13:40:51 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @AVindman @TheRickWilson @realDonaldTrump i hope you're right. i won't survive 4 more years of that POS
1324949507952537600 2020-11-07 13:39:13 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @RepLeeZeldin and covid infections, hospitalizations and deaths rose in those cities after every visit. it may be mostly trumpers infected, but they're still human beings. don't think anyone has forgotten the hypothermia and heat strokes and the elderly abandoned miles from their cars

1324923523689811970 2020-11-07 11:55:58 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @alxellt0308 as a white woman, i want to know why they chose trump too. i cannot imagine why. i see absolutely no redeeming qualities in that man
1324920868556984321 2020-11-07 11:45:25 +0800 <kittyclinton2> part of me wants to see him dragged out kicking and screaming. like @JoeBiden says, they know how to handle trespassers.

1324870281035456512 2020-11-07 08:24:24 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @TrueFactsStated @JoeBiden i'm so glad
1324870136495476738 2020-11-07 08:23:50 +0800 <kittyclinton2> the best way to beat trump's #MAGATerrorists are to make fools of them. stay off the streets. don't engage in violence of any kind. they'll look silly standing out there armed to the teeth, all dressed up with no where to go.  please pass it on
1324868879466770434 2020-11-07 08:18:50 +0800 <kittyclinton2> more trumpism. #MAGATerrorists
1324868291899371520 2020-11-07 08:16:30 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @RedStateResists how much time did they give hillary? none
1324867981546049538 2020-11-07 08:15:16 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @DLWilson71 @Ladybounty2000 @senatemajldr i would love to see that. it's gone on a long time
1324867782480113664 2020-11-07 08:14:28 +0800 <kittyclinton2> everyone of these instances needs to be investigated. no doubt most are not criminal acts, but i think the two largest batches were likely purposeful and needs to be fully explained and ? prosecuted
1324865213225689088 2020-11-07 08:04:16 +0800 <kittyclinton2> so like @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP to solicit their followers to commit crimes on their behalf. who are the real suckers and losers?
1324864486726119425 2020-11-07 08:01:23 +0800 <kittyclinton2> there are enough outstanding ballots right now in every state yet to be called to swing the election either way. please be patient. we don't want to celebrate a win, then have the rug pulled out from under us. remember 2016? there was no way in hell trump could win, yet he did
1324863414800424962 2020-11-07 07:57:07 +0800 <kittyclinton2> a guy in line at the pa election office to "cure" ballots said he tried 3 different sites to register and vote yesterday but was turned down. i hope they film him coming out of that office after standing there fuming at the injustice for hours. lol!
1324862724438896643 2020-11-07 07:54:22 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @BadBradRSR i'm with you on that. if he had anything it wasn't much more than a cold

1324861069291118596 2020-11-07 07:47:48 +0800 <kittyclinton2> KY is a very poor state. i wonder if @senatemajldr actually gives people cash for their votes? he consistently has the lowest approval ratings i've ever seen.
1324860648250101761 2020-11-07 07:46:07 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @GOP @GOPChairwoman have at it. btw, FL and KY could use some up close auditing--if you're really trying to increase confidence in our election results
1324859959931232257 2020-11-07 07:43:23 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @PissOffTrumpkin why anyone would vote for 4 more years of this BS is beyond me

1324850981281144834 2020-11-07 07:07:43 +0800 <kittyclinton2> chaos and violence will allow trump to exert emergency powers. don't give him that option. stay off the streets and don't engage. they won't fight each other or the police. fight smarter.
1324850382758137858 2020-11-07 07:05:20 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @Artemis888Infin @lucyjbri @SteveSchmidtSES @JoeBiden i'm shell shocked from 2016. we don't know how many ballots are left to count for each candidate. i'd rather be more sure
1324849958462377984 2020-11-07 07:03:39 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @DesignationSix i say when joe and kamala are sworn in. i think we need to follow in the path of post hitler germany and wipe out every remembrance of trump in favor of remembering his victims and our rescuers
1324848233215102977 2020-11-07 06:56:47 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @RuadhMairi baby bush was the only republican to win the popular vote--only on his second term, in decades

1324846778378821639 2020-11-07 06:51:01 +0800 <kittyclinton2> violence in the streets could give trump a reason to exert emergency powers. we know his supporters are organizing to fight in the streets, so i beg you, stay off the streets and don't engage
1324845104226570241 2020-11-07 06:44:21 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @Gloria4Educ @glennkirschner2 he really was. hated some of his policies, but thought the world of him
1324844642328858628 2020-11-07 06:42:31 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @PalmerReport @ossoff @ReverendWarnock we also haven't gotten results of alaska and nc's senate races

1324839542776598535 2020-11-07 06:22:15 +0800 <kittyclinton2> my guess, if they have any at all, it isn't very many and they don't work in their favor
1324839052563107840 2020-11-07 06:20:19 +0800 <kittyclinton2> trump is a black hole. nothing will ever be enough

1324837928745553920 2020-11-07 06:15:51 +0800 <kittyclinton2> lots of rumors about violence from trump's people. please stay safe and off the streets
1324837682351116288 2020-11-07 06:14:52 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @JJHennie1 let them waste their time and money all by themselves. we have real work to do.

1324836592838758406 2020-11-07 06:10:32 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @joncoopertweets convenient since a potus that will hold him accountable will be taking office the day begore

1324829302584713222 2020-11-07 05:41:34 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @mattgaetz .@LindseyGrahamSC paid $500,000 for @realDonaldTrump's legal fund. how much did you donate? do you love trump more than lindsey?

1324797869816193024 2020-11-07 03:36:40 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @Dknight10k lol! he's going to be in criminal investigations and court trials in congress, nyc and who knows how many other cities, states and countries for a long time. winning potus is going to prove the worst thing that ever happened to him
1324794842292146179 2020-11-07 03:24:38 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @DanCrenshawTX were you this concerned in 2016? because that's when the integrity of our elections were questioned and repubs did little to nothing to look into it or to prevent it from happening again. if not for the pandemic and widely used paper ballots, we'd be seeing it all over again
1324793291133669376 2020-11-07 03:18:28 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @biannagolodryga @jaketapper either that or label those freaks disguised as "news" labeled entertainment

1324791726301728768 2020-11-07 03:12:15 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @MarkSchweitzer we need this even if trump dies before it's finished. it's important to learn as much as we can about his and his cronies crimes and corruption.
1324791374500298757 2020-11-07 03:10:51 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @MarkSchweitzer we soooo need this.
1324790766686900224 2020-11-07 03:08:26 +0800 <kittyclinton2> and this honesty, integrity and leadership is why even dems loved john mccain. thank you for sharing him with us @cindymccain. he is missed.

1323458707473289218 2020-11-03 10:55:19 +0800 <kittyclinton2> we'll never get the 300,000 lost to covid back. the 9M infected w/covid 19 may lose their health for a lifetime. we can never be trusted w/immigration policies again.

1323436312133832704 2020-11-03 09:26:19 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @ChantelMarsaw @nytimes me too
1323436189534294016 2020-11-03 09:25:50 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @realDonaldTrump barr has made a lot of contacts in the DOC. are you at all concerned he'll have you 'epsteined' to keep you quiet once you're arrested?
1323435037757419520 2020-11-03 09:21:15 +0800 <kittyclinton2> every one please report any voter intimidation you experience. it's the only way to curtail it
1323434172346761218 2020-11-03 09:17:49 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @nytimes everything she talked about re trump was out right in front of all our faces. why so few saw it, i'll never know. #ImStillWithHer
1323431254067478533 2020-11-03 09:06:13 +0800 <kittyclinton2> the guy crossed state lines, murdered 2 people with a gun he couldn't legally own and carry. why was bail even a consideration?
1323430517845491712 2020-11-03 09:03:18 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @fireman452a that shame will follow trump voters for the rest of their lives.
1323428866510229506 2020-11-03 08:56:44 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @DetHippieChick @texyellowdogdem why is he not under arrest?
1323428594165731328 2020-11-03 08:55:39 +0800 <kittyclinton2> .@FoxNews, @OANN @RT_com @putin the next time you talk to @realDonaldTrump remind him, when he contests the election in court as he plans, it is at his and his campaign's expense using their lawyers, not ours. this would not be an appropriate use of tax payer resources
1323427002787995648 2020-11-03 08:49:20 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @poppij i so hope you're right.
1323426914044960768 2020-11-03 08:48:59 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @realDonaldTrump if you contest this election, remember it's your right, but at your cost alone. this will not be a valid taxpayer expense, nor should our lawyers be used in the process.
1323426373076221954 2020-11-03 08:46:50 +0800 <kittyclinton2> and if trump contests this election, those fees need to come out of his and his campaigns pockets. not the pockets of the american people.

1323412687674609666 2020-11-03 07:52:27 +0800 <kittyclinton2> also, voting trump out of the white house, is the beginning, not the end. buckle up. we still have a lot of work to do

1323409705046343776 2020-11-03 07:40:36 +0800 <kittyclinton2> they must be held accountable for the torture and kidnapping of thousands of children. nothing less than a long prison term will do.
1323407662042779648 2020-11-03 07:32:29 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @poppij scared to death right now. thanks for your support!

1323376930696187908 2020-11-03 05:30:22 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @A4Ny14 @dhershiser i think it will depend on their actions once the trump spell has evaporated and they learn the truth of what they've been supporting

1323361131977756672 2020-11-03 04:27:35 +0800 <kittyclinton2> not voting, or a vote for someone other than biden is a vote for fascism. if you don't believe that, study the 2016 election

1323349055968333826 2020-11-03 03:39:36 +0800 <kittyclinton2> these people would prefer to die of or kill someone with covid than risk being called a "hippy" or a "sheep"  people are trapped in middle school
1323347616864808960 2020-11-03 03:33:53 +0800 <kittyclinton2> this is the attitude getting people infected and killed at an alarming rate. please don't patronize businesses that refuse to protect their workers and customers. #MaskUp
1323345491531309056 2020-11-03 03:25:26 +0800 <kittyclinton2> trump and republicans in power are all supporting domestic terrorism. a vote for trump means we'll have more of this in the future. vote blue for peace to return

1322021870334627840 2020-10-30 11:45:50 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @realDonaldTrump To put this grim figure in context, #COVID19 overtook stroke, chronic lung disease, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and kidney disease as the leading cause of death during that period. Needless to say, NOT just the common cold.
1322020813067948033 2020-10-30 11:41:38 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @realDonaldTrump COVID-19 is the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States.

1321414274200252416 2020-10-28 19:31:28 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @realDonaldTrump trump hates the elderly. he evicted this lady. he abandoned thousands last night in NE in the dark. in the cold. miles away from their vehicles. watch him blame someone else today. he stiffed the charter co. out of $1000s, so they left.  https://t.co/tsxSooudWF

1321331819501989888 2020-10-28 14:03:49 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @Lee_in_Iowa a lot of those agriindustries are foreign owned. many by china from what i understand. trump's anti china rhetoric has looked out of sink with his actions for a long time. many of the china mkts lost, were picked up by russia. they won't be coming back.

1321326758705156097 2020-10-28 13:43:42 +0800 <kittyclinton2> the trump campaign hired buses to transport people to and from his superspreader event, but did not pay them, so the buses left. trump left these people, mostly elderly stranded in the cold, at night, miles from their vehicles.
1321323707286118401 2020-10-28 13:31:35 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @realDonaldTrump trump bussed these people in. his campaign stiffed the bus charter co, so they left.   when trump doesn't pay his bills, people are hurt.  some  of these people could die from hypothermia.

1320877430853246977 2020-10-27 07:58:14 +0800 <kittyclinton2> @realDonaldTrump if you're voting for trump because he's good for your retirement account, consider just how important that is while his policies insure you won't live to spend it.
