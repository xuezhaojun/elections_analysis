1305948869289807872 2020-09-16 03:17:28 +0800 <JudyMontgomer13> Ms. Alene,   Has this report been confirmed, collaborated?  I  have not seen the confirmation on this anywhere.
1305864688631189506 2020-09-15 21:42:58 +0800 <JudyMontgomer13> @ElieNYC This story needs more confirmation before we run to The Hague.  And I support the trip in a second, once this is confirmed by multiple source.
1305858976819621888 2020-09-15 21:20:16 +0800 <JudyMontgomer13> tRump family really enjoys traveling on our dime.

1305636748849033217 2020-09-15 06:37:13 +0800 <JudyMontgomer13> Today would be a great day for TRump to release his tax returns.
1305636457684635648 2020-09-15 06:36:03 +0800 <JudyMontgomer13> @DavidCornDC GOP stoking blatant propaganda!  Don’t but it folks.
1305634444271902724 2020-09-15 06:28:03 +0800 <JudyMontgomer13> Exactly,,   Why was tRump’s  only choice, lie or cause panic?   How about informing the public, in an adult way.  He simply took our health safety and way of life from us all.

He has sabotaged this country from the beginning,   I still am waiting for an explanation re: Helsinki, and how the gop looked the other way.  Dan Coats has it correct.   What else could it be?
1305255469074837504 2020-09-14 05:22:08 +0800 <JudyMontgomer13> @RBReich He has sabotaged this country for a long time.  We will know why, after he’s gone.

1305121357500383233 2020-09-13 20:29:14 +0800 <JudyMontgomer13> They are rushing to hear his explanation of the Helsinki remarks again,  or maybe, He’s released his taxes,  yup. They are interested in that.
