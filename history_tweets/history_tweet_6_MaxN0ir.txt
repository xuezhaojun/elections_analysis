1334945959525101570 2020-12-05 03:41:33 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @deep_rifter Yea I usually do exactly this. What about in person meetings? Interesting how I feel I’d wait longer because the effort is so much higher to get there...plus in NYC, there’s a mutual grace period understanding of, “the train”.
1334941275259285504 2020-12-05 03:22:56 +0800 <MaxN0ir> Curious... how long do you wait in a video call room before you deem it a no show?

Highly recommend 👏🏽
1332439740407230466 2020-11-28 05:42:44 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @realDonaldTrump @fadde Must be fun to get to create your own reality all the time &amp; actually believe in it. Must do wonders for your self-confidence, but also be super frustrating as everyone's looking at you like you have 3 heads, but you're so convinced that the truth you created is real...intriguing

1331361196637888512 2020-11-25 06:16:59 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @deep_rifter The bottom right image has me feeling oodles of discomfort 😂😂 WHAT. am I looking at??
1331358651416719361 2020-11-25 06:06:52 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @SL33PYcasts @autonomousdotai Honestly, I just love the desk. It helps motivate me. When I wasn't traveling, I used to stand literally almost all day long and it made me feel so much healthier overall. Now I just sit and I don't like it.
1331348221696864258 2020-11-25 05:25:25 +0800 <MaxN0ir> What item do you miss the most when you're away from home? I miss my @autonomousdotai standing desk 😭

1327053718030782466 2020-11-13 09:00:36 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @_LucasRizzotto @kitvolta @tiktok_us I don't geeet iiiiit. I think for me, I'm always searching for some sort of a punch line in these things... but there's no punchline, it just seems to relate to people somehow, but I am not relating. Am I sick? Did they give me the wrong generation assignment??
1327052259402854401 2020-11-13 08:54:48 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @kitvolta @tiktok_us See I just don't get this 😭 lol. I also almost never understand memes, therefore, I don't like them. What am I missing here?!
1327033356031242240 2020-11-13 07:39:41 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @kitvolta @tiktok_us Thanks for the tips! I do NOT feel like a millennial as i'm attempting to navigate this app.
1327033046529417216 2020-11-13 07:38:28 +0800 <MaxN0ir> Our new content has just released on @Huawei VR! Would you like to see it on other platforms??

1326984812033433600 2020-11-13 04:26:48 +0800 <MaxN0ir> I finally started using @tiktok_us and it is SUCH A TIME SUCK. Why do I care about your amateur dance moves??

1325258365942059008 2020-11-08 10:06:31 +0800 <MaxN0ir> Kamala's speech killed me. So many emotions today, this week, this year. There is so much work to be done. I hope for a peaceful transition, and better, more empathetic communication between all of us and our neighbors. I am hopeful 🥰
1324904201911111681 2020-11-07 10:39:11 +0800 <MaxN0ir> Camera launch starts in 20 minutes! Join us :)

1324065658250891265 2020-11-05 03:07:07 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @NathieVR I've been stress eating for two days now. Don't talk about delicious things hahaha
1324063212787159042 2020-11-05 02:57:24 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @NathieVR broooo why you gotta bring churros into this 😭
1324059913027538945 2020-11-05 02:44:17 +0800 <MaxN0ir> Someone(s) may or may not be announcing groundbreaking 360 technology this Friday.... here is a more fun vote to participate in!
1324031729879912449 2020-11-05 00:52:18 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @sarahmcbride has been elected to Delaware's State Senate! She is also the "first openly transgender person to be elected to that position nationwide". Let's focus on all of the wins of this election while we wait 🙏🏽🥰   https://t.co/P8ZyrzYpMv
1324030873293987841 2020-11-05 00:48:54 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @juliesmithso Thank you 🧡 it is one thing to feel it in the air, but it's another thing to see just how equally divided the numbers are...
1324030645040021507 2020-11-05 00:47:59 +0800 <MaxN0ir> Every share gets me a vote if you feel it fit 🥰
1324030397085327362 2020-11-05 00:47:00 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @ar_vr_women Thank you ✨🥰
1324030184534822915 2020-11-05 00:46:09 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @fakerapper As long as you know you're a mess, you're in good shape! In my experience, if one party is unsure, it does not work. But I obviously can't speak for everyone. It has worked for me when both parties are interested and willing to try from the beginning.
1324020173460762624 2020-11-05 00:06:23 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @fakerapper I think it can be super beneficial, and healthy for certain people. Like anything, it's not a one-size fits all, and you and your partner(s) need to be professional communicators in order to find success. Two people communicating is already crazy hard so prepare to work 😂
1324019131792809989 2020-11-05 00:02:14 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @corymay81 Congratulations on your progress and for making it through these days!!
1324016794193985537 2020-11-04 23:52:57 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @SarahEMcBride has been elected for Delaware's State Senate, and is the "first openly transgender person to be elected to that position" nationwide!

1324015305991991297 2020-11-04 23:47:02 +0800 <MaxN0ir> So the US has officially left the Paris climate change agreement. It's so important that we stop relying on our shitty ass leaders to fix global warming. That is on us, as individual consumers, to fix our damage. Don't wait for some man to regulate you.   https://t.co/9pVkjYBj4J
1324014043451912192 2020-11-04 23:42:01 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @theonechella Do what feels right to you! It may be helpful for some of your audience during this crazy time.
1324001069647556609 2020-11-04 22:50:28 +0800 <MaxN0ir> I am stoked to read that 5 states (some unexpected) have legalized recreational marijuana use, &amp; Oregon has decriminalized possession of small amounts of hard drugs. This is a step in the right direction. Save prison for people who are ACTUALLY dangerous.  https://t.co/bC8xTiGg39

1323462832663482368 2020-11-03 11:11:42 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @ben_rainwolf Supah cute!
1323417041412435968 2020-11-03 08:09:45 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @bpowtweets @kevinasarobot I changed my shirt 3 times the other day to catch up on procrastinated content that I owed people 😂
1323416886885961730 2020-11-03 08:09:08 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @ben_rainwolf Rain deserves all of the love!

1323414434342199297 2020-11-03 07:59:23 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @ben_rainwolf That sounds absolutely wonderful... Now I want that too hehe it would be so nice if the string lights made a little, 'clink' sound when you poked them!
1323413478556770306 2020-11-03 07:55:35 +0800 <MaxN0ir> I'm super stoked about some of the virtual worlds my team has been building lately... what would your ideal virtual world contain? What would the vibe be?
1323332103610667008 2020-11-03 02:32:14 +0800 <MaxN0ir> Today my #Epilepsy story was shared by @cbd4epilepsydoc for their #FacingEpilepsy campaign. Feeling honored, and always hoping my story will help one person with seizures to feel less alone.  https://t.co/eEqAujehiB
1323292341579468801 2020-11-02 23:54:14 +0800 <MaxN0ir> As we begin to crossover into tomorrow, I wish you all so so much love and strength. Hoping you all have a loved one to be with as we await the results. No matter what, we the people have power, and we have love. I'm optimistic that the years to come are reflective of that.
1323282909793574912 2020-11-02 23:16:45 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @Lisi_Linares YEA. IT IS
1323280655556448257 2020-11-02 23:07:48 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @thedak I hope the same for you, David!
1323274788073295873 2020-11-02 22:44:29 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @rocombo Totally agree!
1323274596980850689 2020-11-02 22:43:43 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @LeirielTV Yes, same here! I can't wait to try it out.
1323274515695177731 2020-11-02 22:43:24 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @baiweiart What is the swiping method?!
1321938225309601792 2020-10-30 06:13:27 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @erinisaway ayyyy congrats, mama!
1321935820685824000 2020-10-30 06:03:54 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @LeirielTV Have you tried it?
1321824896251531264 2020-10-29 22:43:08 +0800 <MaxN0ir> I'm really looking forward to trying this new method of typing in VR- which looks to be more intuitive and similar to what we are used to. But will it feel good? Let's find out!
1321821433312481283 2020-10-29 22:29:22 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @HorizonMuseum @FacebookHorizon Tagging her official account to this thread (sorry for the mistag!)- @ArtistisPresent
1321821181327089664 2020-10-29 22:28:22 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @HorizonMuseum @FacebookHorizon Yes, I hope they would be!
1321817775237664768 2020-10-29 22:14:50 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @HorizonMuseum @MarinaAbramovlc @FacebookHorizon Awh, how amazing! Perhaps @MarinaAbramovlc can come see it too :) Look what you're doing, Paige 🧡
1321815207639994368 2020-10-29 22:04:38 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @HorizonMuseum Hmm to be honest, I am not well-versed in the museum art realm (trying to improve)! But hands down, @MarinaAbramovlc 🙏🏽
1321811125378363392 2020-10-29 21:48:25 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @HorizonMuseum In XR or in general??
1321810804602187778 2020-10-29 21:47:08 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @Lisi_Linares ahahaha yessssss
1321810728781860864 2020-10-29 21:46:50 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @callieleone Yes I agree!
1321480626277617666 2020-10-28 23:55:07 +0800 <MaxN0ir> The global US expat community is the US' largest swing state, yet barely votes. why? Yesterday I mailed my absentee ballot. It was an unintuitive, complicated process. 2 weeks worth of confusion &amp; anxiety. Uncertainties unanswered. I hope it gets counted. also unhealthy apathy.  https://t.co/dfR34nO8pI
1321470076277661703 2020-10-28 23:13:12 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @cgledhill @SpirosMargaris Oh my gosh, FINALLY.!
1321468918968557569 2020-10-28 23:08:36 +0800 <MaxN0ir> Hey friends! I'm missing a lot of you, &amp; would love to connect with many of you Twitter friends who I haven't had the lovely honor of conversing with yet. I'd love to touch base with whomever is open/wanting to connect beyond the Twitterverse! Click this!  https://t.co/Ku3LTRDQ2D
1321464698739544064 2020-10-28 22:51:50 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @HorizonMuseum This looks amazing, Paige! Can't wait to check it out :D
1321463921732161537 2020-10-28 22:48:45 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @MichaelZhangVR @AndyFidel_ Yea, all great points! What drives you to spend time with your preexisting friends inside of VR, opposed to on Facetime or something similar?
1321463400002654215 2020-10-28 22:46:40 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @callieleone great point. for me, my best relationships have been feeling mutually safe to be ourselves, but also pushing e/o to grow around each other, &amp; the friendship builds slowly over time, as trust strengthens. I like introspective convos &amp; sharing comedy. I find it hard in VR
1321460626087120896 2020-10-28 22:35:39 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @TheGameVeda @_LucasRizzotto You've mentioned island/VR commune 3 times in tweets in the last few hours. I am here on the island. Would you like to talk about it?
1321448932057223168 2020-10-28 21:49:11 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @kitvolta ahahaha yesssssss this put such a big smile on my face 🤣
1321448515680296961 2020-10-28 21:47:32 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @VRchazen could be many of folk! but oooooo i like the idea of this writing product. Bummer that it's needed, but it's a really nice concept for this era 🌞
1321080066693103618 2020-10-27 21:23:27 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @CixLiv Thanks for the heads up! Official link:  https://t.co/qunDxuTjfL
1321079412926914561 2020-10-27 21:20:51 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @XxItsYoloManxX Yea, I'm definitely waiting for this. Any hand tacking in VR that I've tried so far has felt novelty but difficult and inefficient to use. I'm waiting for an affordable option that works super well!
1321078834888871936 2020-10-27 21:18:33 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @LehsssVR VRchat is certainly included in the umbrella of socialvr. Also altspace, recroom, horizons, etc.
1321078384059928576 2020-10-27 21:16:45 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @morganlinton Yes, I agree! If my mother &amp; my good friends from around the world were in there, that would be quite revitalizing! I guess I'm used to connecting w my VR friends online, but I miss hanging out with people I can't hang out with anymore because of distance, but they don't use VR
1321077873034383365 2020-10-27 21:14:44 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @deep_rifter @nikkmitchell @baiweiart @Mada3DL @scottneb @AlexTench @VArtisans360 @MindWise_CK Hey, that sounds like a good time! Yea, I'm definitely more interested in coming together in VR to share about real life things
1321077606037528577 2020-10-27 21:13:40 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @nikkmitchell Well that sounds like a jolly ole time!
1321077547954819075 2020-10-27 21:13:26 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @kevando_ both! It's all up to you and the experience you want to have.
1320901726891888645 2020-10-27 09:34:47 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @deep_rifter @nikkmitchell @baiweiart @Mada3DL @scottneb @AlexTench @VArtisans360 @MindWise_CK yessss the educational events where we hang out and share content have definitely been my favorites!
1320899658135339008 2020-10-27 09:26:34 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @Shinkaze What types of events drive you to attend? I've been feeling lately like many events are too similar. An echo-chamber.
1320892953561321474 2020-10-27 08:59:55 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @LarryRosenthal 😂
1320892823437193218 2020-10-27 08:59:24 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @LarryRosenthal oye. agreed, but a long ways away.
1320891791852425218 2020-10-27 08:55:18 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @LarryRosenthal interesting! i wonder what multiplayer interactions would look like in this framework
1320890903389765633 2020-10-27 08:51:46 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @CheetosOnToast That sounds nice to me.   But no! That's sad and messed up 🤣 I've never figured out how I was supposed to save myself. I was too pissed off to look it up hahaha I was like, I hate this game. I hate it forever.
1320889582611845125 2020-10-27 08:46:32 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @LarryRosenthal well, any ideas?
1320889433298739200 2020-10-27 08:45:56 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @CheetosOnToast Ahah that could be fun! Multiplayer live sims or offline sims? Last time I played Sims, my gal caught on fire cooking a burrito. it said, "call the fire department"! Fire depart. wasn't in the phone book and 911 didn't work. She died, I cried, and that was it.
1320888127033147394 2020-10-27 08:40:45 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @LarryRosenthal History definitely repeats itself. Question is, what's next?
1320887683032485890 2020-10-27 08:38:59 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @cummins_orgs @rebecca_evans  https://t.co/Q6vBuXFJCu !
1320881260500312066 2020-10-27 08:13:27 +0800 <MaxN0ir> Okay, is anyone else feeling fatigued by social vr? I'm finding it difficult to WANT to go into social vr apps. The novelty has worn off so it's not enough anymore to have fun, customizable avatars. How do we revitalize?
1320876120271708161 2020-10-27 07:53:02 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @rebecca_evans Fantastic! It's great to have you there!
1320871264211423233 2020-10-27 07:33:44 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @NathieVR but HOW DID YOU CATCH THAT.

1319743700822577154 2020-10-24 04:53:12 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @prans_dhunnoo Gotcha! To begin, you've got @Nreal on MR glasses, @katvrwalk on omni-directional treadmills, Skyworth, @PicoInteractive &amp; @Huawei on VR headsets, and us, @FXG_VR working on 360 cameras and volcap 🔥 Of course there are more
1319742995265105920 2020-10-24 04:50:24 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @prans_dhunnoo @nikkmitchell I haven't had the opportunity to try the Madgaze yet! How was it??
1319742734656299010 2020-10-24 04:49:22 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @fncischen @nikkmitchell @amoration Yea, we do. One of our services in our localization team is piracy protection. We've fought off a great deal of pirates 🏴‍☠️🦜
1319742265162649600 2020-10-24 04:47:30 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @Bertaroo Come and get it 🤣
1319741757207228421 2020-10-24 04:45:29 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @amoration That sounds fair! But important to acknowledge that's only one company in a large ecosystem 🙏🏽
1319741452797214725 2020-10-24 04:44:16 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @prans_dhunnoo There's quite a decent amount! What type of hardware specifically are you interested in??
1319452888243068928 2020-10-23 09:37:37 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @BlakeDGross ahahaah 我也是这么认为！
1319452471174025222 2020-10-23 09:35:58 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @LeirielTV Totally makes sense! Everyone I tagged in this thread speaks great English, so that's a good start. Much of the XR community speaks English amongst other languages 🙂

1319420861686910976 2020-10-23 07:30:21 +0800 <MaxN0ir> As an outsider who lived &amp; worked in China in the XR industry, I'm excited &amp; consistently impressed by the innovation happening there, but I feel like the US isn't paying attention. There's huge stigma, &amp; little effort to learn more. What's up?
1319420860583845888 2020-10-23 07:30:21 +0800 <MaxN0ir> Are you interested in getting involved in the Chinese XR market/community? Why or why not?

1319052492399910912 2020-10-22 07:06:35 +0800 <MaxN0ir> There is so much amazing XR tech happening in China that NOBODY knows about over on this side of the world! @nikkmitchell did an excellent job capturing all the showcased tech at the Nanchang conference this week. Check em out.

1318301231983611905 2020-10-20 05:21:21 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @Lisi_Linares Lmao. My father said, and I quote, "dang! I guess the Dominican Republic is really rocking your world!" 🙄 how did Dad jokes become so universal?
1318298906502090753 2020-10-20 05:12:06 +0800 <MaxN0ir> So I experienced my first earthquake today. A 4.8 in the Dominican Republic. I jolted awake at 5am to the entire house shaking violently. Have to say it was pretty terrifying, but it looks like the country, and our household is all safe and intact 🙏🏽
1318206659668430848 2020-10-19 23:05:33 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @nikkmitchell 🤣 Nooooooooo! They just raided the nearest Walmart right before start
1317523192609726467 2020-10-18 01:49:42 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @erinisaway the answer is yes. hi 💛 you are loved.
1317522169086332929 2020-10-18 01:45:38 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @LarryRosenthal oh no. This scares me loll
1317518467604557825 2020-10-18 01:30:55 +0800 <MaxN0ir> Congratulations, Lucas on another episode, showing the world the possibilities of modern technology through comedy, introspective trial and error, and narrative 🥰
1317074735684063233 2020-10-16 20:07:41 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @CheetosOnToast lol PROBABLY.
1316840970739163138 2020-10-16 04:38:47 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @lunarlouiee Hey Lou, my team would likely be interested and can work really fast. Happy to talk about it. max@fxgvr.com
1316840590185725952 2020-10-16 04:37:17 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @jamesmccrary At least he's not saying Trix are for Kids....
1316840168888958976 2020-10-16 04:35:36 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @VRchazen ahahha! I love that his name is Hammer 🤣 I'm reaaaaally liking the idea presented earlier of a horny jail...
1316839931956916226 2020-10-16 04:34:40 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @amoration @BeatSaber Beautiful! Thanks, I will check this out 💛

1316827577177251841 2020-10-16 03:45:34 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @amoration @BeatSaber That's wonderful! I'd love to connect with them if it makes sense. With the inability to have in person meetings because of COVID, i'm definitely thinking differently about how to not live a miserable livelihood in an unaffordable city that I don't like..
1316827146271285254 2020-10-16 03:43:51 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @bcarlton727 Ahahahaha I had some genius help on this one.... but seriously though, I've tried to grow veggies in a BK apartment! It's no easy feat 🤯
1316826861205323783 2020-10-16 03:42:43 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @Scobleizer Nothing rude about it! If you have an influx of messages coming in everyday on tons of different platforms, you have to choose the ones that make sense, otherwise, shooting your mental health in the foot for the sake of validating others.
1316822454900322304 2020-10-16 03:25:13 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @NextJennConsole ahahaha I wish there were an easy way for me to mimic the, "beeeeeep", in text.
1316822348104904710 2020-10-16 03:24:47 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @Scobleizer Yup! Engagement laws set us up for terrible conversations! I try to answer 'almost' everyone at least once, unless it's like this right off the bat. Sometimes it leads to normal behavior, and sometimes.... this happens.

1316816861678403585 2020-10-16 03:02:59 +0800 <MaxN0ir> I find these messages in my DMs almost every day. Did he really not understand that I was messing with him? How often does he DM strangers asking them if we'd like to see his eggplant? Does it ever work? I have so many questions...  https://t.co/VS4VM7eVJ0

1316770721775878146 2020-10-15 23:59:39 +0800 <MaxN0ir> I'm spending 5 weeks in the Dominican Republic jungle, living, working, and making art with some of the most wonderful, beautiful-souled VR friends I could ever ask for.

1316020049732227080 2020-10-13 22:16:44 +0800 <MaxN0ir> So as much as I'd like to buy the Oculus Quest 2, my OG Quest is still kickin! I'd love to see @oculus roll out a free upgrade program like Apple. You pay monthly payments and after 12 months, you get a free upgrade. + old HMDs are donated to schools and hospitals 🧠

1315806703372435456 2020-10-13 08:08:59 +0800 <MaxN0ir> Super interesting input everyone! For me, Twitter's great for making friends in the field. LinkedIn has been best for making serious connections that lead to doing business w new people. Instagram's where I find the most success in personal efforts, so I'm focused there for now.
1315804925734072322 2020-10-13 08:01:55 +0800 <MaxN0ir> I was happy to have my story about my #ChronicLymeDisease &amp; #Epilepsy journey, and how i've used medical #CBD to live a better life, featured today by Elevate CBD.

1306662446409678848 2020-09-18 02:32:58 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @JustBreatheLuv Yea I think this is a valid point. That scene should have been toned down a lot.
1306541167425847296 2020-09-17 18:31:03 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @JustBreatheLuv I can agree with this. I’m feeling that the immense amount of energy being put into #CancelNetflix could have so much stronger an impact if put into the roots of the problem that the director is critiquing.
1306384549526622211 2020-09-17 08:08:42 +0800 <MaxN0ir> Just watched #TheSocialDilemma . I found it to be a great, informative documentary for anyone seeking to better understand data mining, machine learning &amp; algorithms via social media. Terrifying and important.  https://t.co/vrG7JvWcIF

1305890927899279366 2020-09-15 23:27:14 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @JustBreatheLuv I do think that some of the scenes, really just the dance scene which has gone viral, should have been toned down a bit. It is undoubtedly controversial &amp; flawed, but I do not think it calls for this magnitude of critique. This story is important.

1305614532874833921 2020-09-15 05:08:56 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @PuskasRenee I think it's good to have a conversation with people you disagree with. This is how society grows. Happy to continue the dialogue.
1305613267621089280 2020-09-15 05:03:54 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @PuskasRenee Would you mind explaining why you think it is pedo grooming? I saw critique, and only critique, with no romanticization. It definitely opens a big dialogue. where do we draw the line? TikTok, beauty pageants...  i'm glad we're at least talking about it.

I will say, given the stars are young women, I do hope that the set provided

These days, with social media and access to all content online, 11 year olds and younger are mirroring what they're learning from everyday apps such as TikTok before they understand what they're even emulating. Not one minute of this film romanticized this
1305610830084530176 2020-09-15 04:54:13 +0800 <MaxN0ir> 3/7 I thought the push &amp; pull relationship that young women face, between, "be sexier" and "don't be a whore" was depicted seamlessly. The main character, trying to fit in in the middle of working out intense family dynamics and starting puberty, merely mirrored what the internet

This is shown in the scene where the young girls are discussing male genitalia and sex, with little to no understanding of how any of it works.
1305610826636812289 2020-09-15 04:54:12 +0800 <MaxN0ir> 1/7 Update: I watched #CutiesFilm. I have a lot of thoughts. Firstly, I do not believe that most people tweeting #CancelNetflix have watched the film. To me, the film presented beautifully the dichotomy of sexuality that is presented to youth, specifically young girls. The young

1304512305456181248 2020-09-12 04:09:04 +0800 <MaxN0ir> "There is nothing to show its Antifa or Proud Boys setting fires. Wait for information.”   My heart goes out to all living things affected by the wildfires. Remember to always wait for reliable information/confirmation before amplifying divisive dialogue.  https://t.co/k79LyXKy06

1304431891303497728 2020-09-11 22:49:32 +0800 <MaxN0ir> Just spent some time reading the #CancelNetflix trend, as well as a variety of articles about the situation. I don't know about you guys, but, tonight I'm going to watch the movie before I hop onto this anger train. Seems right to do the due diligence before forming an opinion.
1304425217037492230 2020-09-11 22:23:01 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @sgagnaire This is super valuable, thanks, Soph!
1304422610671992834 2020-09-11 22:12:40 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @LeirielTV Yea, I guess for realtime updates on emergency situations, that's a good method.

1304176934679609344 2020-09-11 05:56:26 +0800 <MaxN0ir> What do you find to be the least biased/reliable source for keeping yourself informed about the ongoings of the world on a daily basis?

1303001495219187712 2020-09-08 00:05:39 +0800 <MaxN0ir> I have started using CBD oil as an anxiety reducer. Usually I take it in herbal tea before bed. Some nights I fall asleep immediately, and other nights I feel like it gives me so much energy that I can't sleep for hours. Anyone have any experience with CBD best practices?  https://t.co/rV0KYxHzXh

1302210703361802252 2020-09-05 19:43:20 +0800 <MaxN0ir> As I'm uprooted &amp; traveling, I revisit once again the idea of 'spiritual homelessness', unsure of where home is in my heart. I remember the journey I transpired of learning to find home within myself, &amp; the community around me.   I've never shared before:  https://t.co/3ObLfiqvIV

1301924455938232320 2020-09-05 00:45:53 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @Anticleric Like VR pizza parties? I appreciate the thought but I can't get down with it... the haptics are nice but like, I want to taste real pizza.
1301879625035939841 2020-09-04 21:47:45 +0800 <MaxN0ir> @Anticleric Thinking about how I personally feel.... I get excited by the objects, then quickly realize that I cannot use them in a realistic enough way, which frustrates me, so the most exciting thing to do ends up being to throw them or drop em and walk away.
1301633041287258115 2020-09-04 05:27:54 +0800 <MaxN0ir> Where do you think our ET2 is off to now?
