When these patients became more aware of their own problems, they grew less paranoid—and less prejudiced. You don't have To Be Racist.

1344013945582067714 2020-12-30 04:14:29 +0800 <Stonefree63> @JazzySpreckles To continue perceiving extreme racism as normative and not pathologic is to lend it legitimacy. Anyone who scapegoats a whole group of people, seeks to eliminate them to resolve his or her internal conflicts meets criteria for a delusional disorder, a major psychiatric illness.

1333486672776982528 2020-12-01 03:02:52 +0800 <Stonefree63> @FleishmanHoward Why we need to refocus our efforts to take away white supremacists control by dismantling it completely, in order to do this, we have to demand reparations, money they know they owe U.S.🇺🇸 need money to fight back, no if ands and buts about it.

1332422730633895936 2020-11-28 04:35:08 +0800 <Stonefree63> @coldharvest @Kojobalewa Again, until the 99% of U.S.🇺🇸 get it to our heads that 1% of U.S.🇺🇸 is the main problem, things will never change.
1332422117510492160 2020-11-28 04:32:42 +0800 <Stonefree63> @coldharvest @Kojobalewa It would take away control from the evil 1% rich.
1332421962094825472 2020-11-28 04:32:05 +0800 <Stonefree63> @coldharvest @Kojobalewa A fact they just admitted to this, this country spends $800 billion dollars annually on racism alone, in 20 years that $16 trillion the debt would have been paid by now. But it also will upset their white supremacist base economy, that's what they don't want. Money power control.
1332420933596884998 2020-11-28 04:28:00 +0800 <Stonefree63> @coldharvest @Kojobalewa The entire economic base of the United States is off of the backs of genocide and slavery, that's an aspect of History you cannot be erased. Now is the time to make reparations, so we can move forward and move on.
1332420199736356865 2020-11-28 04:25:05 +0800 <Stonefree63> @Kojobalewa And even though it may not happen in my lifetime, you can guarantee this Generation and future Generations, will see to it and there ain't a damn thing they can do to stop it.
1332419499782516736 2020-11-28 04:22:18 +0800 <Stonefree63> @Kojobalewa It cannot, this is where we're at right now.
1332419314570436613 2020-11-28 04:21:34 +0800 <Stonefree63> @Kojobalewa All that money they made during slavery, that they never paid U.S. for is still there, apart of their economy and they're still spending and using it against U.S.🇺🇸
1332418761966706689 2020-11-28 04:19:22 +0800 <Stonefree63> @Kojobalewa Absolutely racism is part of it it's the subterfuge they use to hide the crimes they commit that's it, when you remove that from the equation, (by not making it the primary focus) all that's left is the $16 trillion dollars they owe, which will destabilize their WS based economy.
1332417474550247424 2020-11-28 04:14:15 +0800 <Stonefree63> @Kojobalewa They done pay everybody else but U.S.🇺🇸 and we came before everybody else, that's some bullshit. 😏  https://t.co/QzIwXmde2Y
1332416877398806528 2020-11-28 04:11:53 +0800 <Stonefree63> @Kojobalewa Ain't nothing but about money, power and control, keep telling people, quit get hung up on that racism, that's the bullshit story that used to distract U.S.🇺🇸 with, away from the money. Our Ancestors paid with their lives for their economy, least they could do is pay U.S.🇺🇸 🙏  https://t.co/OTOwxtA5Wq
1332414461655834629 2020-11-28 04:02:17 +0800 <Stonefree63> @Kojobalewa Fuck Hollywood, we get that reparations money, we'll have our own Studios, make our own movies and then Hollywood is gone to have to come knocking at our door, that's what they don't want. Autonomy, scares the shit out of them.
1332414001578455040 2020-11-28 04:00:27 +0800 <Stonefree63> @Kojobalewa Other folks can say goodbye to that $16 trillion-dollars, in #ReparationsNow owed, they wonts to, my ass, is looking 'em dead in the face for it, Bitch, where's my ancestors money?!

1332361028601073668 2020-11-28 00:29:57 +0800 <Stonefree63> @hazeydaze1 You're welcome, told you that 1619 project expose them for what they did, that's why they're acting up right now, tryna distract U.S.🇺🇸 with racist subterfuge but it won't work, the world knows what they done, now, it's time to make them pay for what they did. It's the only way.
1332359178678116353 2020-11-28 00:22:36 +0800 <Stonefree63> @hazeydaze1 It takes money to do what they do systemically with racism, the only way to effect change is it send a clear blow to that money pile, reparations, will do this, that's why they fight against it, cuz they know this better than we do. Never lose faith and never stop fighting. ✊
1332357386007437312 2020-11-28 00:15:29 +0800 <Stonefree63> @hazeydaze1 This country spends $800 billion dollars annually, on racism only, we need to take that money out of their hands, making them pay reparations, will go a long way towards doing that.
1332355981494333443 2020-11-28 00:09:54 +0800 <Stonefree63> @hazeydaze1 Again, your hang-up is focusing on the people, this discussion began with the government, lets start with the system of government 1st, let God deal with the people, that's out of our hands.
1332355482724552705 2020-11-28 00:07:55 +0800 <Stonefree63> @hazeydaze1 Bottom line, white supremacy has to go, it cannot be allowed to remain, there are no if ands and buts about it.
1332355063403192322 2020-11-28 00:06:15 +0800 <Stonefree63> @hazeydaze1 All the more reason to focus on the system of government that causes it and take it down.
1332354905357619201 2020-11-28 00:05:38 +0800 <Stonefree63> @hazeydaze1 Yes, but is Apartheid still there?! God will take care of that part, as long as we take care of our part.
1332354444885962752 2020-11-28 00:03:48 +0800 <Stonefree63> @hazeydaze1 Main point of this discussion was how to change the system, not the people, white supremacy is a system of government which can be changed, people, have to change themselves.
1332353839400443909 2020-11-28 00:01:23 +0800 <Stonefree63> @hazeydaze1 Gemini, so you know there has to be balance, Nelson Mandela, made me believe, that there is no form of government that cannot be changed. None, RIP, 🙏
1332352740270477312 2020-11-27 23:57:01 +0800 <Stonefree63> @hazeydaze1 I'm just the opposite but then that's just me too.
1332352565254762497 2020-11-27 23:56:20 +0800 <Stonefree63> @hazeydaze1 It's a start, at this point we're just getting started, it will take time but it can be done, again it's not going to change people, stop focusing on that but do you see Apartheid flourishing in South Africa anymore, no.
1332351516297072641 2020-11-27 23:52:10 +0800 <Stonefree63> @hazeydaze1 We need to focus on the crimes, not to human beings, let God change human beings, while we change the system the human beings use to oppress U.S.🇺🇸 with.
1332350895024189444 2020-11-27 23:49:41 +0800 <Stonefree63> @hazeydaze1 Agree to disagree, the difference here is that some people see white supremacy is not being able to be dismantled, never seen it that way, not after Nelson Mandela, anything can come down, they're not going to do it on their own, we're going to have to make them.
1332350246995812352 2020-11-27 23:47:07 +0800 <Stonefree63> @hazeydaze1 Wishful thinking has been known to change the world, just ask Nelson Mandela.

Only talks we want to have now, is when and how are they going to pay this off.

1332077567696834560 2020-11-27 05:43:35 +0800 <Stonefree63> @Worral10S Yep, sadly they did the same thing in 1918 with the flu, anytime you turn a virus into politics and you put politics over people, you're going to have this type of devastation. Irony is, it's not even the government's money it's our money, taxpayers, they're saying we can't have.

1332030736468221956 2020-11-27 02:37:30 +0800 <Stonefree63> @STweeytcat Racism is wrong and it's a lie, end of story, good talk. 😏
1332029591679094785 2020-11-27 02:32:57 +0800 <Stonefree63> @STweeytcat Debate?! There's no discussion with those stupid, racist, motherfukers.
1332027936405413888 2020-11-27 02:26:22 +0800 <Stonefree63> @STweeytcat Now when somebody asked me an obvious question, my answer is, Google it.
1332027304999051264 2020-11-27 02:23:52 +0800 <Stonefree63> Now that's a good point, never looked at it that way, things are too easy for them, maybe they had to look for like buried treasure, like we did, they'd appreciate it more.
1332026500976160770 2020-11-27 02:20:40 +0800 <Stonefree63> @STweeytcat Hell, all you gotta do is Google it nowadays, these dumbfucks won't even Google shit.
1332022849280860163 2020-11-27 02:06:09 +0800 <Stonefree63> @STweeytcat Back in the day we had to do that shit manually, you literally read with a dictionary right next to you.
1332021105519943681 2020-11-27 01:59:13 +0800 <Stonefree63> Thank you for the birthday wishes but you read the Tweet, it's just throwback thursday, it's not my birthday. 🙏😏
1332019834675212289 2020-11-27 01:54:10 +0800 <Stonefree63> @STweeytcat Yeah, There's really no excuse for anybody to be ignorant and slow today, cuz, they are, its cuz they wanna be. (Notice, didn't say stupid either cuz a stupid person knows this but chooses to ignore it, that's what makes them stupid.) 😏  https://t.co/TwqOG1bvYn
1332017316972933122 2020-11-27 01:44:10 +0800 <Stonefree63> The number one reason why people disagree with you, is cus they did not understand, not cuz you didn't explain it properly but cuz they didn't comprehend. Which is critical in order to reach consensus.    https://t.co/XBhJ29NPkr
1332013596113559552 2020-11-27 01:29:23 +0800 <Stonefree63> Any words we didn't understand we looked up in a dictionary thus increase vocabulary. Teachers were astonished by this, they couldn't believe that this little boy knew what he was reading and understood.
1332013013013032963 2020-11-27 01:27:04 +0800 <Stonefree63> Could read and comprehend by the age of 3 by the age of 5, was reading books, (Not See Spot Run either) my mother taught me how to do that, she said it's important not just to see the words on the page but do you understand them. Ty, Moms. 🙏
1332012119643082755 2020-11-27 01:23:31 +0800 <Stonefree63> Yes, reading is fundamental but comprehension is critical, what good is it to read the words on the page, you don't understand?! This is a learned trait, you had to learn early in life, most people didn't get that one point lesson and it shows 😈
1332007077435346946 2020-11-27 01:03:29 +0800 <Stonefree63> @unclerayscrazy Only a truly Twisted demented fuck, can turn this festive occasion, into a demented one, for that, eternally grateful. 😈  https://t.co/0mu9DwduFc

1331685523543486464 2020-11-26 03:45:44 +0800 <Stonefree63> @TheOralBuffet That's bottom line, we got to get rid of white supremacy or we ain't getting nowhere. Ty, 🙏
1331683736824532994 2020-11-26 03:38:39 +0800 <Stonefree63> @archangelcrew We're almost there, come this far, we can make it the rest of the way, stay frosty. #ItsJoeTime 😷
1331682947750047746 2020-11-26 03:35:30 +0800 <Stonefree63> @archangelcrew We're fine over here, how's you and yours doing?! (Wellness check) 😷  https://t.co/2ATaEcdqQ9
1331681959916015616 2020-11-26 03:31:35 +0800 <Stonefree63> @TheOralBuffet White supremacy, has to go, there are no if ands and buts about it.
1331681539709657090 2020-11-26 03:29:55 +0800 <Stonefree63> @TheOralBuffet Again, as long as you get hung up on the people, past and present, there's no consensus here, tryna see beyond all that and move forward, me, Nelson Mandela provided the perfect example of this, he crushed 50 years of Apartheid by making them change the system. That's jus' me. ✊
1331679338476007428 2020-11-26 03:21:10 +0800 <Stonefree63> @TheOralBuffet You keep going back to the people, long as you keep going back to the people, we're not going to go anywhere, so that's why I said, let's just agree to disagree, cuz, obviously this point is not getting thru.
1331678936384892937 2020-11-26 03:19:34 +0800 <Stonefree63> @coldharvest Precisely you are my brother whether you wanna recognize it or realize it or not, changes nothing. All racism is, is a divide-and-conquer tactic used by white supremacy, people need to get over it.
1331678639071571968 2020-11-26 03:18:23 +0800 <Stonefree63> @TheOralBuffet Thank you, 🙏 highly value your input but again we're talkin about a system of government, those things can be changed, let God deal with the people, that's out of our hands.
1331677510388604933 2020-11-26 03:13:54 +0800 <Stonefree63> @TheOralBuffet When Nelson Mandela changed the system of Apartheid, he wasn't trying to change the people, he was trying to change the way they govern the people, that's the point, thought we were talking about. Outside of that can't help you with anything else.
1331677032858705921 2020-11-26 03:12:00 +0800 <Stonefree63> @TheOralBuffet Lastly, there are no other races, it's only one race human, anything else is racist ideology, we're not going to reach consensus on this, so, let's just agree to disagree, at this point. Which means it's not worth arguing over.
1331674313825673217 2020-11-26 03:01:12 +0800 <Stonefree63> @TheOralBuffet Done with this, again, we're talking about the system, you can't do anything with what people do, people have to control themselves but you can change the system. White supremacy, is a system of control, systems can be changed, people have to change themselves.
1331672025946009610 2020-11-26 02:52:06 +0800 <Stonefree63> @TheOralBuffet It's more than just a symptom but let's just agree to disagree.
1331670459813933058 2020-11-26 02:45:53 +0800 <Stonefree63> @TheOralBuffet Don't see it that way. Not when you change the system, that's why we have to dismantle white supremacy, so this doesn't happen again, we don't, guarantee you, we'll be right back here again, not worse.  https://t.co/un5E24BcH0

Blade Understanding what racism is, is not looking for excuses, its tryna understand what causes the behavior, in order to eliminate it. There's more than hate going on here, a lot more, open your eyes.

1322604232286023680 2020-11-01 02:19:56 +0800 <Stonefree63> @musikk70 Not doubting your research, saying look up how Germany did it after the war, it can be done, without question. 400yrs we've been waiting for them to do it, think we've waited long enough, clearly, they're not going to do it on their own, unless they have to. We need to make them.
1322602751285743621 2020-11-01 02:14:03 +0800 <Stonefree63> @musikk70 It'll never get done, until we get started, we've never gotten started.

1322600890537226240 2020-11-01 02:06:39 +0800 <Stonefree63> @jdougmar Thank you, 🙏 the right ones will. 😷😎
1322598707343380482 2020-11-01 01:57:59 +0800 <Stonefree63> @musikk70 It's never too late, we just need to get started, it will take time this will not be an overnight process but it can be done. We don't start, nothing will get done and we'll be right back where we started, not worse.
1322597791596773378 2020-11-01 01:54:20 +0800 <Stonefree63> @musikk70 1st step is a remove all those involved in white supremacy, replace them with those who are willing, able to enact democracy to its fullest. Use the same model Germany use over 70 years ago when dismantling fascism, work for Germany, should work for us too. Simple But Effective.

And, since perception is reflection, what they see, says more of who they are than defines who you are. Malcolm said it best, its all psychological warfare 101.
1316752519188688896 2020-10-15 22:47:19 +0800 <Stonefree63> Never give racism that much power. Racism, is a stupid and ridiculous lie, why would you let a lie have that much power over you?!

Police brutality, is one of them. Logically, you would expect full cooperation from the police, instead they've confirmed there is a problem and they're okay with it.

1309129189254139904 2020-09-24 21:54:55 +0800 <Stonefree63> @2Alarm United States, had a great idea, 200 some odd years ago but white supremacy, crushed that dream and now we're living in the nightmarish reality of what they created, time to wake up, dismantle white supremacy and let real democracy, reign supreme, as intended. No More Excuses, 😎
1309127325116661760 2020-09-24 21:47:31 +0800 <Stonefree63> @2Alarm 246yrs+ ago it, made perfect sense, to them. This is the reason for all the chaos we're seeing happening in our country today, they are losing, everybody knows what they've been up to, they can no longer hide in the shadows nor behide the guise of democracy. The Party's Over, 😏
1309125823568457731 2020-09-24 21:41:33 +0800 <Stonefree63> @2Alarm The Electoral College, is about as racist as you can get, it was founded to keep the power amongst the rual whites against the freed ex slaves, so that they would never gain power and keep the money they made off of Slavery, to themselves. Diabolical, 😱
1309125356092358660 2020-09-24 21:39:41 +0800 <Stonefree63> @2Alarm You understand anything about the way the Electoral College is structured, then you know, it really needs to go, they are the problem. 😱

1309124106621792257 2020-09-24 21:34:44 +0800 <Stonefree63> @2Alarm That's going to be difficult, the Electoral College was set up, to make sure who they wanted in the White House, got in the White House, we need to change that. Again, the problem is, with the people, with the money and power to effect change. We need to dismantle them too. 😎

1308770892789485569 2020-09-23 22:11:11 +0800 <Stonefree63> @adgs8 @NW_StayDet Ask your government, why it refuses to pay its citizens, they wronged about the $16 trillion dollars, they owe us. The funds are available, they're there, they always been there, they just been withholding them from us and keeping us oppressed, with our own Monies. Pure Evil, 😎

1308767799683153920 2020-09-23 21:58:53 +0800 <Stonefree63> @NW_StayDet Instead, we got hounded, persecuted by Jim Crow laws, more racial discrimination, more of the same basically, the only difference was, we just wasn't on the plantation getting it. Slave-owners got more than we got, government paid them, $300 per ex-slave, after we were released.
1308766653010907143 2020-09-23 21:54:20 +0800 <Stonefree63> @NW_StayDet Matter of fact, it was so bad on us, some people stayed on the plantation, cuz it was better for them there, than being set free. We needed it educational program setup, we needed a job program setup, we needed housing program setup, we needed therapy set up, we got none of that.

All he did was turn us loose, there was no program set up for the  ex-slaves, they were no laws to protect the ex-slaves and no government institutions set up to help ex-slaves, after slavery, essentially, we just got thrown out the car.

Which creates a serious problem. Denial, 😱😎

1308507012364460032 2020-09-23 04:42:37 +0800 <Stonefree63> @twendi66 Was another point they made, getting with people that don't necessarily agree with your point of view not necessarily arguing back and forth but just getting a different side of the coin. You have to have both sides, different points, that's how you arrive at the truth. 😱😷😎
1308506354177454081 2020-09-23 04:40:00 +0800 <Stonefree63> @LuLuRoche Nope, 😏 we damn sure got enough of that running around. 😱
1308506053773066249 2020-09-23 04:38:48 +0800 <Stonefree63> @LuLuRoche That's a horror movie, 😱 towards the end of the documentary, they asked one of the designers, at what age did he think a child to be on the internet, he said preferably 18, even then, he said it would reservations. 😱
1308505316179480581 2020-09-23 04:35:52 +0800 <Stonefree63> @twendi66 Different from my perspective, as a computer electronic engineer, know exactly what they're doing, so, gonna see the little bit differently than the way you do but it's okay. 😎
1308504911030751240 2020-09-23 04:34:16 +0800 <Stonefree63> @twendi66 Indeed, 😱😷😎

1308504450185691136 2020-09-23 04:32:26 +0800 <Stonefree63> @twendi66 Tell people, they need to learn how to keep the internet, in its proper perspective, especially social media, it's an experiment, the original designers, thought it would be nice get ppl to connect, problem with that, sometimes you connect the wrong people together, Whoops. 😱😎
1308502792399618048 2020-09-23 04:25:51 +0800 <Stonefree63> @twendi66 Something's are hard but in reality, we're very easily dissuaded, more so than we'd like to think. You get the chance make sure you look at this one, don't pass it up, again, you may decide afterwards, to come off of social media, after watching it. 😱
1308501978473992199 2020-09-23 04:22:37 +0800 <Stonefree63> @LuLuRoche Thank you, 🙏 another main point the documentary made, we can help social media out by making sure we fact check what we post, make a habit of doing this, you will never see me just post something, without fact-checking it first. Do this for my comedy but it helps in everything.
1308501004732817411 2020-09-23 04:18:44 +0800 <Stonefree63> @LuLuRoche They covered that topic during the documentary, children should never be on the internet, always said this, get on parents for letting their children have access to the internet, unsupervised. You know it's bad when the creators of social media, won't let their own kids on there.

1308496568845250562 2020-09-23 04:01:07 +0800 <Stonefree63> You haven't done so already, please do take the opportunity to watch, Netflix's Social Media Dilemma, afterwards, you may be considering, closing out your account. Social media experiment, was to bring us closer together when in actuality it's had equal, opposite affect. 😏😷😱😎
1308493855399043074 2020-09-23 03:50:20 +0800 <Stonefree63> Why folks are more hostile toward the truth teller, than the liar. They've been conditioned to accept the lie and reject the truth. The very definition of stupid, not the lack of intelligence but the inability to use knowledge, correctly. Permanently damaging, critical thinking.  https://t.co/XsQvkFNujC
1308491414574161923 2020-09-23 03:40:38 +0800 <Stonefree63> @OhVonda They have absolutely no idea, shhh, don't tell 'em either. 😷😱😎😈
1308488551441596416 2020-09-23 03:29:15 +0800 <Stonefree63> @OhVonda Guess they figured, they can't get you kicked off, then they'll jus' take over your platform, start posting things on your platform, that go against what your platform, that you built, in essence, they high jacket it, take over it. To establish their own agenda, on your platform.
1308487341024186368 2020-09-23 03:24:27 +0800 <Stonefree63> Some don't know how to filter out all the white noise of lies and look for the truth, cuz they don't know what the truth is. When you don't understand or have truth as your base, then you will be easily dissuaded by every lie comes along, even to the point of disdaing the truth.
1308485800879894529 2020-09-23 03:18:20 +0800 <Stonefree63> Watching the documentary, Social Media Dilemma, learned why ppl find it hard to accept the truth, they've been conditioned, not to, on social media, a lie travels, 6xfaster than the truth, so by the time the truth gets to you, you already been bombarded, with the lie. Wth?! 😱😷

Trump is guilty, you can't spin this. 😷😱 #ArrestTrumpNow ✊

1304424741751730177 2020-09-11 22:21:08 +0800 <Stonefree63> Trump supporters, believed when Trump called covid-19 a hoax but won't believe, when Trump said, (On Audio Tape) it is real, its deadly and airborne, he also was down playing it, still is, cuz, he also says, he didn't wanna create a panic, he was tyrna protect wallstreet.

1304421528822571008 2020-09-11 22:08:22 +0800 <Stonefree63> Covid-19 is real, over 1k+ deaths a day attest to this, Trump knew this, he deliberately called it a hoax, downplayed the seriousness of it, has yet to take responsibility. Whether you believe this or not matters not we still have a virus to deal with that should be our priority.

1301170257726406659 2020-09-02 22:48:58 +0800 <Stonefree63> @AMushroomQueen I've worked for him before, he actually helped me through a rough spot, get back on my feet, that's what he's tryna secure, he thinks this will have a setback effect on me, told him, I'm not worried about a set back, all I'm concerned with right now, is staying alive. That's it.
1301169364352278528 2020-09-02 22:45:25 +0800 <Stonefree63> Take one for the team?! So he pimpin' out his staff now, hmm. 😏😷😱😎  https://t.co/mpPWvB6dV4

1301168200294559744 2020-09-02 22:40:48 +0800 <Stonefree63> @AMushroomQueen Here's the punchline, he has his own business and he works from home, got a auto mechanic shop, behind his house. Seriously?! 😏😷😱😎
1301167621828681728 2020-09-02 22:38:30 +0800 <Stonefree63> @AMushroomQueen Jus' listen to him the other day. (RIP George, 🙏)
1301167082680258562 2020-09-02 22:36:21 +0800 <Stonefree63> @AMushroomQueen No, he's just a friend, whose only concern is my financial portfolio, not my health. Sweet Jesus, 😏😷😱😎
1301166775497879559 2020-09-02 22:35:08 +0800 <Stonefree63> @AMushroomQueen Ikr, now there's an option for you. 😏😷😱😎
1301166560065748997 2020-09-02 22:34:17 +0800 <Stonefree63> @AMushroomQueen Remember what happened the D.L. Hughley, he tried to do the same thing and passed out on stage. In the audience, nobody was wearing a mask, nobody was social distancing, fortunately, he survived but it could have easily gone the other way. Not worth the risk, survival first. 😷😎
1301164705579491328 2020-09-02 22:26:54 +0800 <Stonefree63> Which is more dangerous, overreacting to covid-19 or not taking covid-19, seriously enough?! Overreacting, will keep you alive, not taking it seriously enough, will get you killed. He accused me of overreacting, so be it, at least I'll be alive, to reget it later. #StayingAlive
1301162299504447488 2020-09-02 22:17:21 +0800 <Stonefree63> Any monies, not making right now or losing cuz of not being at work, are inconsequential to the fact, none of that will matter, my ass gets covid-19 and dies, which is not my fault, this is Trump's fault, all of it. 😏😷😱😎
1301161176492126213 2020-09-02 22:12:53 +0800 <Stonefree63> @AMushroomQueen Delusional and Deranged, is what they are. With all the deaths happening, almost 200k+ dead, still find it astonishing, some folk are still not taking this thing seriously. Are you fucking kidding me right now?! 😏😷😱😎
1301160091295547393 2020-09-02 22:08:34 +0800 <Stonefree63> @AMushroomQueen Covid-19 is the problem not me going to work. When a medical doctor says it's safe to return to work that's when I'll return to work also when these corporations remove these waivers I'm not working for no company signing no waiver for my health and safety, kiss 💋 my ass! 😷😱😎
1301159675094880256 2020-09-02 22:06:55 +0800 <Stonefree63> @AMushroomQueen Yes they are, this fool was up here talking about retirement, I'm like, they don't do something about covid-19, there's no need for me to worry about retirement, not right now, that's not the focus. Wants me to return to work told him, that's not possible with covid-19 raging. 😷
1301158369500241922 2020-09-02 22:01:44 +0800 <Stonefree63> Let's focus on getting rid of covid-19 1st, there's no reason right now to be focusing on future financial planning, with 'Rona looming off in the horizon, let's make sure we have a future to secure 1st before we go making plans to be in one. Focus: 1st Things, 1st. 😠😷😱😎
1301157240783745026 2020-09-02 21:57:15 +0800 <Stonefree63> Last thing I'm concerned about right now, is my retirement portfolio, main focus, is to survive this thing and move forward from there, a lotta good a retirement package is gonna to do me, I'm dead. Focus here people, 😏😷😱😎
1301156185958223873 2020-09-02 21:53:03 +0800 <Stonefree63> Friend, who doesn't believe in covid-19, was tryna convince me yesterday to return to work, after cussin' him out, again, the answer is still no. While I'm appreciative of his concerns about my future financial planning, his main concern needs to be covid-19 and me stayin' alive.
